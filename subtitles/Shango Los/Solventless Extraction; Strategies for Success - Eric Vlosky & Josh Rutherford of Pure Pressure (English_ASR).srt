00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,560
either if you have an existing business

30
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,269
that's running solvent list and you're

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,899
looking for tips and tricks on how to

32
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:24,269
make it better

33
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:25,978
or if it's a form of extraction that

34
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:28,739
you're looking to get into either as a

35
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,090
complete net new or as one that you're

36
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:32,250
gonna be adding on to an existing

37
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,849
operation so the whole point of this

38
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,340
presentation is to give people advice

39
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:40,649
tips and strategies that you can be

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,020
successful with solvent lists it's one

41
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:45,118
of the extraction forms that needs the

42
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,640
most education and that's what we're

43
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,819
here for so Josh and I will be you know

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,079
tag-teaming these topics we've got a lot

45
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,579
of great ideas to share with you guys

46
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,399
and we're gonna go through this

47
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:59,848
presentation in a cadence kind of

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,640
leading you through how to really think

49
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:04,530
about being successful with solving this

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,140
processing because there are a lot of

51
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,060
elements to it that if you're not really

52
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,159
orienting your business in the right way

53
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,079
you can make some missteps you can

54
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,449
stumble and it'll make it a little more

55
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:17,489
difficult for you to do so so we're here

56
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:21,268
to help anyone who's trying to do salt

57
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:24,060
and let's do it right so the first big

58
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:27,359
point is in today's market with

59
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,219
concentrates if you are not making samos

60
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:31,590
concentrates you do not have a premium

61
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:34,049
extraction brand and a lot of our

62
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,549
customers solvent list might be five

63
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:37,139
percent of their business and some of

64
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:40,230
our customers it's a hundred percent of

65
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,659
their business but if you are trying to

66
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:44,909
make concentrates solvent list is the

67
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,680
way that you attract influencers and

68
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:49,530
come source because that's really the

69
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,930
product category that that specific

70
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,689
segment of the market is looking for now

71
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,370
we go to tons of trade shows we talk to

72
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:58,739
business owners I mean business owners

73
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,469
of co2 companies hydrocarbon companies

74
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,180
those guys that are owning and running

75
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:04,949
those companies are smoking processes

76
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,680
that's what they tell us the absolute

77
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,149
secret I mean it's the clean concentrate

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,590
as well you know the solvent is

79
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,950
concentrates it's also fleshing the

80
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,140
highest dollar you have

81
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:16,810
a variation of skews that you're able to

82
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:19,779
create with rosin with ball hash and

83
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,310
really escalate what you guys are doing

84
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,750
whether it's an existing lab we're

85
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,330
trying to start justice all tooless lab

86
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,909
or having a solvent and solvent this

87
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,830
labs it's really really important to be

88
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:32,919
able to have and we'll get into this a

89
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,989
little bit later is a variations of SKUs

90
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,729
and saltless can bring you that and you

91
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,069
know it's a definitely one of the

92
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:40,598
cleanest concentrate forms that I enjoy

93
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:43,238
smoking laws yeah

94
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:45,879
so another quick note here is that many

95
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,739
of our customers are doing all kinds of

96
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:51,009
forms of extraction and and most labs

97
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:54,039
should be so that is the perfect segue I

98
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:56,530
don't know if anybody checks out MJ biz

99
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:59,139
they put out a fact book every year they

100
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,299
updated we are not affiliated with them

101
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:03,969
in any way I'm not a salesperson for MJ

102
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:06,340
biz but they're Factbook provides some

103
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:07,539
of the best data in the industry and if

104
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,610
you're serious about learning where

105
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,870
trends are totally recommend it and

106
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,730
that's where this slide is coming from I

107
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,700
know the resolution isn't very good but

108
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:18,069
what this very complicated set of bars

109
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:21,519
and numbers is trying to tell us is that

110
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:24,459
the profitability of processing

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,430
operations increases dramatically when

112
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:28,959
you're making a number of SKUs so for

113
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,930
processing operations that are making

114
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:34,120
one two three different products only

115
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,910
six of them are reporting that they're

116
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,430
profitable that is very very little now

117
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,560
you get into four to six 20% but then

118
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,269
once you get to that bottom what that's

119
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,110
really saying is that processing labs

120
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:51,129
that are making between 11 and 15 unique

121
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,720
SKUs unique products 83% of them are

122
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:57,009
reporting profitability that is a

123
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,750
massive Gulf in the difference of how

124
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:00,788
many products these labs are making and

125
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,620
their profitability as a result yeah and

126
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:04,959
the reason you know you kind of see that

127
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,620
trend in the industry is because we're

128
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,089
in a limited market you know wherever

129
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,129
you're opening up whether it's Colorado

130
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:13,529
whether it's you know Illinois or

131
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:15,540
California you know there's only so many

132
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:18,629
dispensaries licenses so being able to

133
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,370
capture more skews more volume with each

134
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:22,589
of those stores and have a bigger

135
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,569
presence in those stores is very

136
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,799
important in order to be the most

137
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:29,459
accessible with yourself in this

138
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,699
business or so and most importantly

139
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:36,089
solvent lists is the least expensive way

140
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,160
to add additional SKUs when you compare

141
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:39,810
cost you know for the equipment for

142
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,090
everything that need to go in on to

143
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,250
actually release a number of Samba SKUs

144
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:45,929
it's Ovilus tends to be the least

145
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,600
expensive of all of them so it's the

146
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,209
easiest way the cheapest way to add

147
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,160
additional SKUs to your product mix if

148
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:55,918
you aren't already good so yeah that's

149
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,949
all about the post process cost process

150
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,959
that you're actually using to make those

151
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:04,470
SKUs so whether it's going to be topical

152
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:07,288
edibles carts you know rather than

153
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:09,690
batter there's a bunch of different jams

154
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:11,699
and micro-diamonds all sorts of

155
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:13,348
different things each one of these can

156
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,120
be ask you for your business to be

157
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:17,610
selling and what it's going to come down

158
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,449
to is also the material that you're able

159
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,530
to source or grow so that's also

160
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:24,598
something that we're going to get into

161
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:27,089
here down the line yep absolutely

162
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:29,250
so helps you attract more consumers

163
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:31,319
there are consumers in the market and

164
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,598
I'm sure a number of them in this room

165
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,759
right now that you probably will pretty

166
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:39,149
much only smoke salt list or maybe

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,069
really good live resin but the high-end

168
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,478
the connoisseur the influencer consumers

169
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:45,060
this is the product that they're looking

170
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,709
for and if your lab isn't producing it

171
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,160
then you're not even competing in that

172
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:51,538
market in the first place so now we're

173
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,910
going to talk a little bit about the

174
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:56,399
different types of products that we see

175
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,229
as the most popular that are being sold

176
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,569
the most and right now really catch

177
00:06:58,228 --> 00:07:02,418
rosin has risen over the last couple

178
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:05,788
years to be pretty much the dominant

179
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:07,319
solvent list product in terms of quality

180
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:09,719
in terms of volume being sold at

181
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,740
dispensaries so Josh you know running

182
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,490
coach master

183
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,168
and making a lot of hydrocarbon solvent

184
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,300
list he makes a whole variety of

185
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:20,068
products not just solving list this is

186
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,918
what you can see right oh yeah it's

187
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:24,419
definitely the industry trend and my

188
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,129
career I was just mentioning you know

189
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:28,198
there's many different consistencies

190
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:30,598
that you can make off of your cell phone

191
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,250
this concentrates so it's really off of

192
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:35,310
the post-processing and actually

193
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,810
maximizing and using industry specific

194
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,389
equipment so that you're optimizing

195
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:42,629
yourself on this metric because you

196
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:44,780
don't want to leave 2 3 % behind and you

197
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:47,038
know end up you know not having the

198
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:49,258
extra that you could have that it's

199
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,779
gonna actually make your business Bible

200
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,180
yep and we're gonna talk about food

201
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,939
grade solvent lists and kind of

202
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,120
dispelling the myth of how to get a

203
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:02,339
better yield out of your product with

204
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,280
hash drawers and specifically you're

205
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:07,619
seeing that people are really developing

206
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,538
a taste for live rosin products just

207
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,329
like live resin coming from fresh frozen

208
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:14,430
plants that terpene profile and for a

209
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:17,459
whole variety of other business reasons

210
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,530
labor time there's all these reasons

211
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:22,258
that companies are doing live products

212
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:25,079
and live rosin is pretty much the king

213
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,330
right now in terms of high-end Abbeville

214
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,680
concentrates now full metal six star is

215
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:29,879
also starting to make you come back a

216
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,278
lot of the people that have you know

217
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,750
been enjoying hatch for a long time it's

218
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,599
a pretty unparalleled experience

219
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,549
experience to get great full melt now

220
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,669
more and more places are trying hard to

221
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:44,158
produce full mel bricked hash is making

222
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:45,809
a comeback as well we are seeing some

223
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,970
really cool ice water cash products and

224
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:50,159
not to leave sift out of this there's a

225
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,278
lot of companies also making really

226
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,139
great stiff crossing flour rosin however

227
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,240
is a product that we're not seeing as

228
00:08:55,139 --> 00:09:00,169
much of in mature markets like colorado

229
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,490
in newer markets it's easy to produce

230
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:04,469
we're seeing a lot more of it there but

231
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,009
as markets tend to mature we're seeing a

232
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,990
little bit

233
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:08,340
consumption of flour oven yeah and we

234
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,899
kind of talked a little bit about that

235
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,240
and why you kind of see those trends

236
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,610
those trends are also because of the

237
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,409
price point of the flour compared to in

238
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,000
that relative market so you know for

239
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:20,610
example if the East Coast I mean I'm

240
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,169
sure pound flour on the recreational and

241
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,120
medical market are still going for three

242
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:27,000
thousand plus we're here in Colorado

243
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,440
there two thousand and below so you

244
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,480
start to see those trends and those

245
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,670
shifts within those camp cannabis

246
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,350
businesses and those mitts so those nips

247
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:37,049
were basically going to be able to

248
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,759
create different SKUs and varieties

249
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:42,240
based on the price points they're able

250
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,830
to start sourcing material yep so these

251
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,340
are kind of big dogs right now

252
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:50,009
and then where we see and have seen

253
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:52,170
really great opportunities for existing

254
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:54,990
and new businesses to take advantage is

255
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:56,370
with leash saltless products there's a

256
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,080
number of them out there and there's

257
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,419
producers kind of all across the country

258
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,629
that are building their brands and their

259
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:05,659
businesses today on these CBD and CBD

260
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:08,460
rosin we're going to talk about that

261
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:11,429
cartridges the proliferation of true

262
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,170
rosin cartridges is just going haywire

263
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:14,759
right now concerns there's just so many

264
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:17,549
of these high end hash makers that are

265
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,259
now starting to make cartridges topicals

266
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:21,809
and salves that's another thing you know

267
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:23,879
just having a product that is based in

268
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:26,639
rosin that is solvent list is

269
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,679
immediately a differentiator that people

270
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,149
can identify with and one that will can

271
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,370
also increase the price point of your

272
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:33,299
product because it is a higher quality

273
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,669
product to begin with

274
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:38,639
yeah and topical themselves and edibles

275
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:40,529
and stuff like that your grams of

276
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,809
concentrate you know it might not be a

277
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:44,250
demo to dabble gram or something that

278
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,409
you want to hit the shelf well then

279
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,750
you're able to take that type of product

280
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:51,149
or even a second press rosin and really

281
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,279
ship those into those type of products

282
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:55,278
and that potency is going to go so much

283
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,879
farther than selling one gram

284
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:01,249
your dog and you know coming from my and

285
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,990
the things working in marketing talking

286
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:05,720
with so many of our clients and kind of

287
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,730
their marketing endeavors you know this

288
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,249
is one of the most powerful tools you

289
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,709
can give a marketing team and your

290
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:14,870
company is to say this product is

291
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:16,849
solvent list this product is full

292
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,370
spectrum this product that has these

293
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,350
quality identifiers z' to it whether or

294
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,990
not it was made from a food-grade rosin

295
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,540
or not so there's a lot more flexibility

296
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,159
with solvent list now than there was a

297
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:30,498
year ago when we were giving this talk

298
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,299
and we're seeing a lot more businesses a

299
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:34,850
lot more of our customers you know

300
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:37,308
really diversifying what they're doing

301
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,749
with their material as they press it and

302
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:40,850
turn it into a variety of different

303
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:42,649
things yeah now more than ever setting

304
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,209
yourself apart this industry is exactly

305
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:49,629
what you need to be able to make a stamp

306
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:52,938
and a brand so just before I move on

307
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:54,709
resolution very good but poplin Barkley

308
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:57,289
one of our biggest customers out in

309
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:59,958
California they've become famous for

310
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:01,578
what they put out our mainly topical

311
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:04,549
zein I mean they're one of our biggest

312
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:06,289
customers and the majority of what they

313
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:08,719
do with their rosin is is making

314
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:11,750
topicals in California I mean that is

315
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,720
the clearest example of a brand in an

316
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,028
extremely competitive and difficult

317
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,410
market California is extremely tough to

318
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:23,149
operate in right now using a food-grade

319
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:25,039
high-quality rosin to make topicals and

320
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:27,919
being extremely successful with it so

321
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:30,198
one small example obviously really nice

322
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,259
packaging doesn't hurt but they do a

323
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:35,628
really good job

324
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:38,500
another thing CBD rosin this is

325
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:42,110
something that unlike ice water hash and

326
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,178
sift is still very much in the mastering

327
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,199
process I think a lot of businesses are

328
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:46,490
really trying to figure this out right

329
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:49,458
now and a lot of people are interested

330
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,528
this is farm house hemp they're located

331
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:53,149
in Fort Collins Colorado we did a video

332
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:55,490
with them talking about that but that

333
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:58,490
they use browsing for all of their CBD

334
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:01,490
products there are some issues depending

335
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:04,049
on the concentrations of course but

336
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,149
using CBD rosin is a

337
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:08,399
a huge differentiator and there's a ton

338
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:11,399
of things that you can put it into it's

339
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,860
not just selling a CVS Ram and within

340
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,659
you know they'll CBD and you know you're

341
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,740
pressing something you're activating it

342
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:18,750
next y'see well you're just

343
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,610
concentrating it you know that will

344
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,169
happen whether you're distilling it or

345
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,089
you're using ethanol or whether you're

346
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:26,669
using solvent list you're gonna end up

347
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:28,740
having a higher concentration of THC in

348
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:31,229
that product which is going to make it

349
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,200
uncomplaining within you know the farm

350
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:36,450
bill to be shipping so what you do at

351
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,079
that point is you end up mixing it into

352
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:42,480
you know MCT oils or you end up making

353
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:45,389
products themselves that because even if

354
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,190
it has 1% THC in the overall concentrate

355
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:49,708
after you've done after you've made it

356
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,380
well after you've diluted into that one

357
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:55,559
ounce jar for that pet now you're maybe

358
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:58,980
0.1 percent THC and we're always allowed

359
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:01,139
to point three are there any products

360
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,759
that you've seen on the CBD side that

361
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:06,389
are particularly popular right now I

362
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,278
mean that products tinctures salads are

363
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:11,370
probably one of the most popular that

364
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,559
I've seen right now just totally on the

365
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,720
market but pet products you know I feel

366
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,519
like you know anything well anybody will

367
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:22,139
do anything for their pets so yeah

368
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:24,870
definitely I know so another big thing

369
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,549
that we really get a lot of questions

370
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,070
about and now we're gonna kind of lead

371
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:31,679
into you know really actionable advice

372
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,700
and items for your business or any

373
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,069
business that you're planning on

374
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,500
starting is kind of explaining what

375
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:41,790
yields with solvent this look like and

376
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:45,659
and what they mean so and it's really

377
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:49,620
shifting so when you've got flour rosin

378
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:53,189
you're looking at ranges of 18% or above

379
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,169
and all of these ranges are what you can

380
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,449
expect and what you should strive for

381
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:59,129
with your business now with ice water

382
00:14:57,448 --> 00:15:01,169
1/2 specifically since we've been

383
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:03,419
talking a lot about that when we're

384
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:05,399
talking four to eight percent that's a

385
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,860
fresh frozen product that is a product

386
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,620
that is about three-quarters wet weight

387
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:13,279
we're not talking about a dry to a dry

388
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,560
we're talking to that a wet product

389
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,959
yielding into a final dry state yes so

390
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,089
taking a frozen and a dry pod basically

391
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,610
your frozen pond will basically be like

392
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:25,950
a quarter pound dry so I always use the

393
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,750
math to 7525 when you're talking about

394
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,060
frozen weight so you're talking about

395
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,250
frozen way for true frozen pounds equals

396
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:34,349
one dry pound so when you're doing your

397
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,809
math and you do your numbers based on

398
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,700
these numbers there's actually pretty it

399
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:41,519
equals you know that eighteen percent

400
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,500
range compared to you know that four to

401
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,480
eight percent it's the same math it's

402
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,909
just a different volume of water within

403
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,560
that cup within that but mass yep and

404
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:51,719
we're about to talk pretty heavily about

405
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,639
genetics because that is going to be one

406
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,800
of the key factors here and how to

407
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,480
achieve yields that are profitable for

408
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,129
your business and the way to really

409
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,330
think about this is if you're trying to

410
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:02,129
make a full milk product you're trying

411
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,780
to you know capture the best trichomes

412
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,970
you possibly can and sell that as a

413
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:08,429
standalone product what you would do as

414
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,830
a business is watch that product very

415
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:12,269
gently at first and then you're gonna go

416
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,830
back and you're gonna re wash it for a

417
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:16,439
full spectrum you're not just gonna

418
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:18,620
leave all of those trichomes in the bag

419
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,240
and weave them behind this is a

420
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,519
multi-stage process to get multiple

421
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,200
products out of a single strain or

422
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,360
cultivar that you're working with so

423
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,590
that again you can diversify the amount

424
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,930
of products that you're actually selling

425
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:33,330
here same goes for sift you know you

426
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:35,189
might tumble what you've got very very

427
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:37,770
gently to make a really high-quality

428
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:40,380
sift that you're gonna press into your

429
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:42,269
best sift rosin and then you can

430
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:44,909
continue sifting it getting more out of

431
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,899
it to create other products yep and

432
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:47,730
that's what I was talking about earlier

433
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,529
where then you take that stuff that

434
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,389
you're not going to end up hitting the

435
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:54,419
market with that is a what I call it a

436
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:55,799
bubble concentrate and you're basically

437
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:57,389
putting in top of clothes you're putting

438
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,740
in edibles you're putting in it or

439
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:00,778
distilling it you know

440
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,450
doing all sorts of other post-processing

441
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:08,179
to create it into a final violent

442
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:11,459
consumable product yep so with yield and

443
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:13,439
solve unless it really comes more down

444
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:15,150
to the types of plants that you're

445
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,630
running and the types of strains that

446
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:20,400
you're using so with other types of

447
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,500
extraction salt Neum solvent based

448
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,970
extractions one of the key questions we

449
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,250
get asked all the time you know what

450
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,170
what really is the difference between a

451
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,690
solvent and a solvent list extraction

452
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:33,870
process look I'll take them real quick

453
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,970
wait huh he makes more so you got to

454
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:38,039
look at a solvent process so at the

455
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,870
solvent process we're liquefying ANCA

456
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,639
trichome heads and so since we're

457
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:43,259
liquefying were looking liquefying them

458
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,059
and then reclaiming that gas and leaving

459
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:47,250
the THC and then purging it purging that

460
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:50,460
gas off later in the post-processing and

461
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:52,529
so with solvent list what we're doing is

462
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,549
we're basically stripping it with either

463
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:57,149
ice water

464
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:59,700
you know co2 dry ice or just tumbling it

465
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:02,040
in itself and or just pressing it in

466
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,500
itself so we're got to be a little bit

467
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,990
more delicate with it as well and you

468
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,579
know with saw the list you're stripping

469
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,589
it you're basically keeping it as a

470
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:12,359
whole plant so hold about I'm sure

471
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,428
you're all familiar you have different

472
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,808
micron screens well at each different

473
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:17,910
micron screen you're gonna have a

474
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:19,109
different grade and those different

475
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,250
grades are gonna create a different

476
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:22,229
final product for you

477
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,690
and what it will allow you to do is

478
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,429
stretch that solvent less material that

479
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,769
much further to create that anymore

480
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:31,710
skews to make yourself as business that

481
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:34,410
much more viable ultimately what we are

482
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:38,400
trying to do is solve unless is isolate

483
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:40,800
the resin glands intact and then create

484
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,380
various products from those isolated

485
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,928
trichomes whereas with solvent based

486
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,370
it's a dissolution process graphically

487
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:49,650
exactly see they're stripping at your

488
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:52,139
liquefying it and you're also taking a

489
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:55,110
bunch of fats and lipids with it where

490
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,840
we're actually able to keep it more here

491
00:18:55,109 --> 00:19:00,299
throughout that process and as we get

492
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:03,089
rougher with that process we're able to

493
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:05,039
you know get that higher yield for

494
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:08,939
topicals edibles also

495
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,220
different products yep so sourcing

496
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,990
proper material whether you're growing

497
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,529
it or purchasing it through your

498
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,059
business is one of if not the most

499
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:20,099
important steps to be successful assault

500
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:22,649
unless and I'm sure as people in here

501
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:24,329
who have created solvent list but no you

502
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,640
know we talk to our customers and you

503
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:29,339
know sometimes they run tangey their

504
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,710
cost program to produce it is there they

505
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,329
are losing money on that gram whereas

506
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,190
with other ones they're making a lot

507
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:36,389
more you know if you're watching math or

508
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,940
you have some of these other strains

509
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,160
your price for gram to wash and create

510
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,700
that product there's a giant range there

511
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:48,690
so being able to actually get material

512
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,430
that's going to work for saltless is one

513
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,529
of the most important steps here and

514
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,480
when you're vertically integrated that

515
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:57,599
gives you a lot of control because if

516
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,210
your head grower is on board and

517
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,980
actually looking for genetics that they

518
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,019
know will do well and their strain

519
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,089
hunting then that's really gonna help

520
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:08,309
you yeah the lineage in the genetics I

521
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:10,049
mean we'll get into a few strains and

522
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:12,509
crosses and stuff like that we have a

523
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:14,309
list out of you know just some you know

524
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:16,019
things to look out for you know as

525
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:18,089
you're going out buying seeds as you're

526
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:20,039
going out and you know buy clones from

527
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:21,959
these different businesses making sure

528
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:24,299
that the lineage is there so that those

529
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,360
trichomes structures which we have a

530
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:28,950
slide here coming up that will shows

531
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:31,649
Tricon structures and how full those

532
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:34,080
trichome heads are and if they're just

533
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,250
shelves because when you look at a track

534
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,559
go ahead and if it's gonna be full

535
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,269
you're gonna end up you know having a

536
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,339
much higher yield than the salt and ice

537
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:43,859
extraction process compared to if it's a

538
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:44,759
shell you just wash that away when we're

539
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:47,009
that's where you're gonna have a half

540
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,950
percent or 1 percent and that's gonna be

541
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:52,650
more on your high higher Terpening of

542
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:55,860
like tangi those type of flavors you

543
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:58,560
want more 10 type of flavor and cross

544
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:01,019
its case but yeah get into that a little

545
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,659
bit yeah so what we like to tell people

546
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,099
is that if you're growing your own it's

547
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,410
really important to

548
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:09,149
identify strains that are gonna work

549
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,190
well like we're just about to go into a

550
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,200
whole bunch of crosses and strains that

551
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,450
you can start hunting for yourself or if

552
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,240
you're purchasing from the third party

553
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:20,250
you really need to make sure that they

554
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,048
are aware that either this product has

555
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,480
been washed in the past or the strain

556
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,609
you want to ask them you know can I get

557
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,130
a little bit to do a test wash does the

558
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:31,229
is the grower aware that this may work

559
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,789
well or not for solvent list in the

560
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,130
first place there's a lot of questions

561
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:36,629
that you can ask before you go all-in on

562
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,429
a batch that you're gonna produce and

563
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,770
turning into Roslyn yeah that your grows

564
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:43,590
and you bet your sourcing material that

565
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:45,750
is probably the best advice I can give

566
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:48,240
each and every one of you you know I

567
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,369
test washes you know buy three pounds of

568
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,529
each strain that they're growing in XY

569
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:53,819
and Z and you know see how they do in

570
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:55,980
each different type of salt in this

571
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:57,569
process and then that gives you data and

572
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,130
then it also gives you partners you know

573
00:21:57,569 --> 00:22:01,319
they're able to rely on you you're able

574
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:04,110
to rely on them and you have this nice

575
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:06,359
symbiotic relationship where you they

576
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:08,369
are learning how you want it to be come

577
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,769
to your facility how you want impact how

578
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,119
many increments all of those things are

579
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:16,408
going to lead you to very very

580
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:18,658
successful business so just a slide here

581
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:21,630
on the different try some of the

582
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:23,780
different trichome structures and what

583
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,309
they look like

584
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:29,220
across the top even though it's a little

585
00:22:26,308 --> 00:22:32,879
hard to read you know that's so small

586
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,409
it's a spike 20 it's gonna go pretty

587
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,150
much straight through your bag and

588
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:37,830
there's a lot of hemp strains actually

589
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,620
that those are the types of trichomes

590
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:43,019
kind of a top across the top row there

591
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:44,668
that you're gonna see that are common in

592
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:46,889
certain CBD strains which is why they

593
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:48,870
can be really hard to wash whereas with

594
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,509
you know d here in the bottom left

595
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:54,178
corner that is pretty much your ideal

596
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:56,339
trichome structure for pressing the

597
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,350
rosin washing or sifting because it's

598
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:01,109
large enough to be captured well and

599
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:02,849
it's got a large glandular head yeah and

600
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:04,139
it's full you know you're gonna see a

601
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,579
lot of trichome heads you might be able

602
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,100
to see those track dome heads underneath

603
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:10,009
the microscope but it might be empty and

604
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:12,259
even if you see that track on that

605
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:13,700
that's how people otherwise you're not

606
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:16,400
going to end up having a successful

607
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,620
yield of on your salt less material yep

608
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,530
so with many of our most successful

609
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:25,819
customers how they've gotten that way is

610
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:29,269
by being relentless and detail-oriented

611
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:31,220
about how they select the material and

612
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:33,019
strange that they choose to run through

613
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,339
solvent list so that they can increase

614
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:36,440
their yields and increase their chance

615
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:39,558
of success you know getting a jeweler's

616
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,450
loupe looking at the plant seeing where

617
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:43,160
the trichomes are how big that are what

618
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,470
kinds they are you know it's that

619
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,960
attention to detail that will make the

620
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,269
biggest difference in selecting genetics

621
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,460
that you can really be profitable on

622
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:54,529
really build your brand on and get

623
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,329
connoisseurs and influencers you know

624
00:23:54,529 --> 00:24:00,399
behind your brand online for your

625
00:23:56,329 --> 00:24:03,619
solvents products here are some strains

626
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,660
take a picture happy to send this out I

627
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:07,639
mean this will be on shaping fires

628
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:10,730
podcast and yeah we're doing it on our

629
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,220
website on our website is not secret

630
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:16,730
information but these are some of the

631
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,558
strands that we see with many of our

632
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,589
customers and some of the biggest hash

633
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:24,079
makers online that the cultivars and the

634
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:27,079
lineages associated with many of these

635
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:29,539
are so popular and they yield so well

636
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:30,710
that they deserve special attention and

637
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:32,089
you know kind of like we have a node at

638
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:34,160
the bottom here I mean there's so many

639
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:37,250
great breeders that come to this show

640
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,900
and sell their stuff a lot of breeders

641
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,779
are now really really trying to make

642
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:44,660
strains specifically for rosin and

643
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:46,279
solvent lists Josh has had some pretty

644
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,640
incredible results with a couple of

645
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:51,379
these at his own lab Eric Simpson who's

646
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,179
with us in the audience told us that he

647
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,270
had a record-breaking wash of nine

648
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:59,320
percent on a related strain so you know

649
00:24:56,269 --> 00:25:01,609
the money sitting right over there so

650
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:03,500
these are some really great strains to

651
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:05,928
start with now a caveat here is that

652
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:09,369
just because you pop a chem dog scene

653
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:12,040
does not guarantee that that streams

654
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:13,299
is you know gonna yield five six percent

655
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:16,299
in your wash but that's not what that

656
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:19,990
means but that these are generally

657
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:22,119
lineages and cultivars that have proper

658
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:25,299
tricone structure and that have the best

659
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:27,609
shot at being able to give you a bud

660
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:29,619
structure a tri comb structure and the

661
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,359
turkey profile that's going to play nice

662
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:32,469
with salt and stretch exactly and this

663
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,819
is the thing you also have to think

664
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,529
about if you're fully integrated you're

665
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:36,730
going to be growing these are the

666
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:39,009
genetics and stuff that you're going to

667
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,200
want to be sourcing and buying because

668
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:42,759
that also not only is going to give you

669
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,000
a versatile product but it's going to

670
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:47,500
give the mipzor whatever boy labs say

671
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,970
you have an influx of material you're

672
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,670
able to sell that as salt on this

673
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,799
material and hydrocarbon material it

674
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:56,590
doesn't limit you one route or the other

675
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:59,259
now you're probably getting 25 50 bucks

676
00:25:56,589 --> 00:26:02,379
more per pound you know just because you

677
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:04,179
got a versatile product and also you're

678
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,490
gonna end up with clients and you know

679
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:08,380
you're gonna end up with crosses and you

680
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,970
know I can arkad you that we did

681
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,960
together you know we talked about

682
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,660
artisan blends

683
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,759
where you end up having to compete grew

684
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,160
it completely sucker and then you mix it

685
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:21,429
up into the washing process to make you

686
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:24,420
know a very interesting terpene profile

687
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:27,309
like the pumps trunk that we put out at

688
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,620
you know there's some essential extract

689
00:26:27,308 --> 00:26:31,660
is to do that very well - yeah and they

690
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:34,029
were around here so yep it's keys to

691
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,370
being successful you know what as your

692
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:38,589
sourcing material purchasing seeds and

693
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:41,199
you know definitely keep that money yep

694
00:26:38,589 --> 00:26:43,629
so again keeping an eye on the genetics

695
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,730
you know many hash makers and growers

696
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,080
are really proud of the products that

697
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,690
they put out as they should be and they

698
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:51,460
are not shy about what kinds of strains

699
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,990
are working well for them so highly

700
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,029
suggest going out you know following

701
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,650
hash makers on Instagram that are making

702
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:58,089
solvent less being successful with it

703
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,250
they're always talking about the new

704
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:01,569
strains that they're running they're not

705
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,429
going to give you a cut of it I can

706
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:04,579
pretty much guarantee that but you

707
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:06,740
should have any opponent

708
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:08,059
sure yeah or find a client's daughter

709
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,710
who has a similar one you know

710
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:13,069
cookies-and-cream is a huge one the

711
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:17,299
cream crosses ice cream just on this

712
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:20,299
list along GMO mac the cake and the chem

713
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:23,960
dog crosses and lineages are by far my

714
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:25,730
favorite on this list and we'll do you

715
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,069
really really well you know hit that

716
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,170
nano a at nine percent there's a lot of

717
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:33,730
good options here we've been told that

718
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:36,320
roughly a quarter to a third of

719
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:39,559
phenotypes and strains out there are

720
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,539
gonna be in that profitable yield range

721
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:43,579
for what you're good so it's not every

722
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:47,210
single one but there's more of them than

723
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:48,859
people expected absolutely so here's a

724
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,529
really really big one you know once

725
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:52,969
we've kind of gone through the idea of

726
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:55,430
what kind of SKUs you're thinking about

727
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:57,319
making and whether you're an MSO a

728
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:59,900
multi-state operator looking to install

729
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:02,089
the same lab in multiple states or

730
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,130
you're a boutique grower who is just

731
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:06,799
building your brand around a core line

732
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:10,340
of solvent list products really thinking

733
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,869
about your lab space is one of the best

734
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:13,789
things that you can do for yourself

735
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:16,309
early on in the process I mean it can be

736
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:17,960
very exciting - yeah man we're gonna Rob

737
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:22,069
the press we're gonna get in there push

738
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:25,009
this [ __ ] awesome you can make a solvent

739
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:27,189
list lab be very successful in under a

740
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:29,569
thousand square feet and we see people

741
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:32,090
and they are making their rising in a

742
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:35,509
closet and they are winning awards with

743
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:38,059
it so square footage is one of the

744
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:39,319
smallest concerns but planning against

745
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:41,990
it is one of the most important things

746
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:44,000
you can do so streamlining your floor

747
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:46,099
spent floor space and you know really

748
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,799
making sure that it's optimized for what

749
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:50,959
you guys are really doing at your lab is

750
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,430
important so figuring out the SKUs not

751
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,779
only that you want to produce in the

752
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,360
future but that you're going to be

753
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:56,549
really see

754
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:59,189
when you go to market or the excuse that

755
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:00,629
you have in the market all of those

756
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,950
things have to be factored into place

757
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,570
before you say I'm gonna go put that

758
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,460
route and press on that table and this

759
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:06,419
at the freeze dryer up here and the wash

760
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,100
machine over there

761
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,690
you know because that includes plumbing

762
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:11,759
that include you know there's a lot of

763
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,500
little things that will make your life a

764
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,410
lot easier if you put things in the

765
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,599
right spot yeah and for anyone who is

766
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,950
considering getting into this or already

767
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:21,480
is and is looking to upgrade like we're

768
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,940
talking about the very beginning if you

769
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,470
have questions about you know how many

770
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,210
free strawberries do I really need or

771
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,860
how much space do I need to plan against

772
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,299
that's something that we can actually

773
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:31,709
help you guys out with and those are

774
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:33,839
some of the most popular questions that

775
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:36,390
we get asked on a daily basis is you

776
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:39,179
know I've got X amount of material and

777
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,980
I'm trying to wash it week you know what

778
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,080
do I really need how do I really lay out

779
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,569
my space how do I lay out my lab design

780
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:47,939
and and we've become you know pretty

781
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:50,879
much the top dogs in helping lab build

782
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,410
and grow out with that so happy to help

783
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:58,470
there anything else you want to add on

784
00:29:52,410 --> 00:30:01,140
this all right so we're gonna leave you

785
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:03,059
know good 10 to 15 minutes here for QA

786
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,470
since the last time when we do

787
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,849
presentations that went way over that

788
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,210
they kick us off the stage

789
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:12,569
so we've got some predictions here that

790
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:14,190
we're expecting for 2020 and beyond just

791
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:16,799
based on the trends and speaking with

792
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:19,769
our customers browsing cartridges are

793
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,950
coming in hot people are really excited

794
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:26,490
about this product it's not available in

795
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:28,950
that many markets yet but now businesses

796
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:32,370
are really starting to see that if I

797
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:35,250
master my solvent list process a

798
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:37,349
cartridge is a product that is the

799
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,809
luxury cart that is it is the

800
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:41,609
top-of-the-line product that your

801
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:43,349
business can sell pretty much that's

802
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:47,250
going to appeal to the widest range of

803
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:48,250
consumers so that's gonna be huge you

804
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,690
wanna have something that

805
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,069
and I think it's gonna be one of the

806
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:54,130
bigger things that we're gonna see in

807
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:56,470
2020 you know and it will take you know

808
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:59,200
some time you know to get your business

809
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:01,299
there to be launching you know all sorts

810
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,830
of carts all sorts of you know hash rods

811
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:05,769
and you know it is a learning process

812
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:07,599
and sourcing the right material to be

813
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:09,639
coming out with these exotic SKUs

814
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,230
yep so there's a lot of businesses

815
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,880
coming out in Colorado with it and

816
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,710
really the progression is you know

817
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,320
mastering the hash rods and mastering

818
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,210
the SIP rosin and then doing the Rd to

819
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:21,879
create a product like this and I mean

820
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:24,100
it's crazy we're talking 70 to 90

821
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,290
dollars for a half gram of these type of

822
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:28,329
cartridges so very high price points and

823
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:29,889
then niche solvent list products like we

824
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:33,009
were talking about before CV rosin

825
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:34,330
topicals edibles especially a major new

826
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:36,490
opportunity there's just not a lot of

827
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:38,829
businesses out there that are promoting

828
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:41,319
that and that are using those products

829
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:43,539
and the solvent list as a differentiator

830
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:45,399
to do so but now that but now people are

831
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:47,500
really picking up on that as competition

832
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,240
is increasing people are looking for

833
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,849
different ways to differentiate

834
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,140
themselves in the market these are going

835
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:56,139
to be products you're gonna start seeing

836
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:58,240
a lot more of and then many more labs

837
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,100
that are not doing solvents processing

838
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,870
are starting to realize how much they're

839
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:03,639
missing out on by not competing in the

840
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:05,500
first place so we're getting a lot of

841
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,460
calls and a lot of people are coming to

842
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,410
us saying you know hey I've been

843
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,610
thinking about this for a long time or

844
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,310
you know I'm just not really sure if

845
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:14,289
this is gonna work for me but all of my

846
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:15,909
guys in the lab like will not show up

847
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:17,109
about they will not stop asking me when

848
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,570
but when we're gonna start releasing

849
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:21,250
rosin so we're seeing a lot of these

850
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:22,480
businesses really starting to come out

851
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:25,079
of the Woodworks and realizing that you

852
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,099
know this is an area to compete in

853
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:29,740
there's a lot there I mean you don't

854
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:32,230
need you know a thousand square feet you

855
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,640
can do it start with 500 you know or and

856
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,980
then move up to a thousand square feet

857
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,009
or you know if you have extra allocated

858
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,509
space I mean the cost to get in to solve

859
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:42,940
unless extraction or add into your

860
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:45,670
business and add all of those SKUs I

861
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,799
mean I can guarantee you six months down

862
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:49,320
the road if you did you know half of

863
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,720
what we said on here you're gonna

864
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:55,049
an extra three to six skews or at least

865
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,670
and all those hundred of sub stores that

866
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:58,710
you're already in are going to start to

867
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:02,240
pick those up and then those invoices

868
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:04,829
just paint keep going up but no enough

869
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,539
so the last thing we'll close with here

870
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:08,819
before we go into the Q&amp;A is you know

871
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,879
from my perspective and from speaking

872
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:14,039
with many of our customers it's hard to

873
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,740
understate how big of a brand builder

874
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:19,680
solvent list can be and in a really

875
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:22,620
really flooded market with cannabis

876
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,970
products having your brand be something

877
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:25,829
that people recognize on the Shelf

878
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,000
whether it's through your packaging you

879
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:30,269
know really through the quality of your

880
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,430
product that these are the kinds of

881
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:34,680
products that people are really talking

882
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:36,509
about and especially the influencers I

883
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,640
mean I just cannot understate that

884
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:40,710
enough and that's how some of these big

885
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,140
brands like push masters you know having

886
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,789
come out won an award that if people

887
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,400
talk about it on Instagram all time like

888
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:49,859
that is free advertising for your

889
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,920
business and and the value cannot be

890
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:55,109
understated exactly go let's get some

891
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:58,230
questions so that's it Cheryl Mike with

892
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:59,490
Joshua sure so we've got about 10

893
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:05,220
minutes for questions go ahead and raise

894
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:07,380
your hand and we'll get right to it we

895
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,610
came in late you may have artists talked

896
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,579
about the equipment that you're using

897
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:16,829
and if so I apologize but you did

898
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:19,230
mention the freeze-dried line yes

899
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:21,719
peer pressure equipment you know we have

900
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:23,789
everything from you know solvent lifts

901
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:25,980
equipment to freeze dryers to sift

902
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:28,380
equipment you know we're basically a

903
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,750
one-stop shop for you know all saltless

904
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:33,150
products that you would need and we try

905
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:35,099
and source everything you know that is

906
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:37,079
going to end up coming with certs for

907
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:38,779
doing all sorts of different you know

908
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:41,630
and help you build your

909
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,740
business and it's also about when kind

910
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:45,380
of touched on this earlier about

911
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:47,539
industry specific equipment we built

912
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:50,030
designed all this equipment from the

913
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:51,949
ground up and made it functional from

914
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:54,530
the ground up to make sure that this

915
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:57,529
saltless is viable because five years

916
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,000
ago you know it really wasn't no I mean

917
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,230
one thing talked about because you

918
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,960
couldn't do it on the commercial scale

919
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:06,110
well now you can and now it's you know

920
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,329
really one of the highest quality

921
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:12,050
highest price point things I'm shelves

922
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:14,840
fed and after this if you like you know

923
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,130
with our booth at 411 if you want to

924
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,960
come by we'd be happy to talk with you

925
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:20,210
about just the different options and

926
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,949
what kind of equipment you need and it's

927
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:24,740
really all based on what your processing

928
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:26,389
needs are and so it every business is

929
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:27,649
gonna need a different solution and

930
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:31,219
that's really the approach that we take

931
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:32,960
I know you showed kind of the

932
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:34,909
percentages that you're coming out but

933
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,289
just straight away unlike an average

934
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:39,799
kind of run that you're kind of seeing

935
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:42,199
from fresh frozen to year green a cash

936
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,730
frozen one and a half percent two

937
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:45,439
percent what do you really think that

938
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,490
the average market is and I know there's

939
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,710
monsters that dump

940
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:53,389
I know that's X gifts so to rosin I mean

941
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:56,480
you're looking at around 3% to rather

942
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:57,859
than on your average you know frozen and

943
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,269
you know you'll have those dumpers that

944
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,430
are going to offset you and you know

945
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:04,070
create it because yes there is loss in

946
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:06,440
each post processing that you do which

947
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:08,870
will then determine your yield at your

948
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,119
finished product but then through that

949
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:13,130
it's though also those byproducts that

950
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,750
we were talking about earlier from that

951
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:17,990
post-processing that you're able to

952
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:21,320
extend and save and create that many

953
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:24,549
more SKUs that now you it wasn't a loss

954
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,550
you see what I mean

955
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:31,410
know the highest quality is really going

956
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,300
into the carts and that's a you know

957
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:35,309
partly the tricky part and why you don't

958
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:39,810
see as much of them on the market

959
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:42,059
yeah for states that have just gone

960
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:45,659
medical or states like Illinois or

961
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:48,059
Missouri have you seen any problem with

962
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:50,399
production of fresh fresh frozen and

963
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:53,130
like the supply of fresh frozen not

964
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,280
being adequate yeah I think the supply

965
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:58,650
is an issue in some newer states because

966
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,030
as markets mature is what we've seen

967
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,130
pretty much consistently across the

968
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:04,050
board is that you know smokeable flour

969
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:06,180
is the dominant product when a market

970
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,260
launches because people have not had

971
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:09,960
access to this

972
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,820
it before other than buying it on the

973
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,849
street or from friends or whatever it is

974
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,350
so getting fresh frozen product can be a

975
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:18,659
challenge for some businesses in

976
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:19,889
emerging markets but I think some of

977
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:21,889
these markets are starting to leapfrog

978
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:24,420
each other whereas a couple years ago

979
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:26,129
you could barely buy it in some of the

980
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,360
emerging markets but then now in

981
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,150
Illinois you know things are getting

982
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,160
more sophisticated and that people who

983
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,050
are coming to shows like these going to

984
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,509
the trade shows and learning things are

985
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:39,000
thinking like okay well smokeable flour

986
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:40,740
is going to be big today but in five

987
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,630
months from now I know that I need to

988
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:44,159
get a great source of fresh frozen so I

989
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:48,450
can be washing and making these kinds of

990
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:50,759
products as that trend goes down and as

991
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:52,710
that price point goes down as well like

992
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,720
we were talking earlier you know in that

993
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,369
market more people will convert because

994
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,559
there won't be as much of a demand for

995
00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:00,420
dry flour they'll convert it to fresh

996
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,849
frozen and then you'll see an increase

997
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,980
in fresh frozen and you know it's kind

998
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:06,239
of like Colorado now where you know you

999
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,730
can get fresh frozen all the time where

1000
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,259
you can get dry material all the time

1001
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:12,900
and it's just about the way the market

1002
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,580
sits and the how all of these grows set

1003
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,320
up their business for you know whether

1004
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:17,819
it was that frozen model or that drug

1005
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,769
to your model and you'll see a lot of

1006
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,260
these dry material models start to

1007
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:27,420
change and start to go to fresh frozen

1008
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:31,140
as that price point drops have you seen

1009
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:33,570
anybody take the wash material and then

1010
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:35,039
process it with solvents after so you

1011
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:39,000
know you know drive material and then

1012
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:40,800
you know throw a co2 machine or hydrogen

1013
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,590
and if so what's the best way to get

1014
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,950
that material correct to run of those

1015
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:49,350
pieces absolutely and I mean if you have

1016
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:52,049
a giant facility I mean it's totally

1017
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:53,579
doable but once you actually factor in

1018
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:55,140
the profitability on the material what

1019
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:57,960
you've made on it and you if you

1020
00:38:55,139 --> 00:39:00,750
utilized at all you know it's not

1021
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,970
necessarily worth it the labor that it's

1022
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:05,099
gonna take to be able to read extract it

1023
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:07,079
dry it you know you're gonna have a lot

1024
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:10,079
of moisture and if you don't read right

1025
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,730
after you just washed it and then you

1026
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,380
have price to melt you know there's

1027
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:15,000
there's definitely problems with it

1028
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,519
today you know couldn't be down the

1029
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,119
lines and machines that you know will do

1030
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:23,219
that but you'd be having around a 2% 3%

1031
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,239
yield I mean you look at solvent

1032
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:28,949
extraction when you read you know don't

1033
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,509
you know solvent over it after you've

1034
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:33,629
just extracted it again you're looking

1035
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:36,450
at a 3% yield or less out the door and

1036
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:40,500
then you know it's basically waste

1037
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:42,239
material at that point we have heard of

1038
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,039
some people taking that approach but

1039
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,389
like Josh said it's very uncommon

1040
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:48,329
because once you actually total up the

1041
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:50,400
labor it ends up really digging into

1042
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:52,349
what you can do with it what most places

1043
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,119
are doing is doing they're getting

1044
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:56,789
multiple washes on the same material to

1045
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,579
start you know with that 3% which really

1046
00:39:56,789 --> 00:40:01,320
dry weight is like 12% to getting that a

1047
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:04,049
grade hash product and then washing

1048
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,789
again into more full-spectrum into more

1049
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:08,010
of a food grade and just getting

1050
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:10,559
everything out of it so that your actual

1051
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:13,530
yield on your first grade you know it

1052
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,259
might be that 3% but the total yield for

1053
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:17,340
you know these more sophisticated

1054
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,870
extractors it's going to be a lot higher

1055
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,510
than that or at least a bit higher than

1056
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:23,549
that by re extracting it but through

1057
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,910
solvents ways yeah yeah all right this

1058
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:29,510
will be our last question

1059
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:33,170
is there any like tricks that you do in

1060
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:37,280
your grow to tell what's gonna wash

1061
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:39,409
better any like ways of you know kind of

1062
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,120
something super greasy is it gonna wash

1063
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:42,980
well it's it's not gonna wash well or

1064
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,019
what's like kind of tips or tricks again

1065
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:47,480
see if I'm at ya

1066
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:49,639
so I'll start up to present really get

1067
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,079
input on this again one of the tips that

1068
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:52,759
I talked about in the beginning that

1069
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:55,299
we've heard from a lot of places I'm

1070
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,140
Church oft as well you know using

1071
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,450
magnifying glasses and other

1072
00:40:57,139 --> 00:41:01,909
magnification technology to look at the

1073
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:03,529
trichomes beforehand and you can even

1074
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:05,960
you know brush your finger on something

1075
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:08,269
and see how well they attach because

1076
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,070
detach ability of your trichome heads is

1077
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:12,739
a really important thing to figure out

1078
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:15,170
what a lot of places do is also a very

1079
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:17,179
small test wash so you could even I mean

1080
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:19,430
the people that have done this I think

1081
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:21,739
can wall was one who put some info out

1082
00:41:19,429 --> 00:41:24,349
that most recently was just you know

1083
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:26,689
putting some in a jar and letting some

1084
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:28,219
of the trichomes just naturally separate

1085
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,619
and then seeing how they settle and

1086
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:32,750
really eyeballing it and seeing you know

1087
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:33,829
how much is in my jar right now does

1088
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,719
this look like a lot does this look like

1089
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:37,130
a little you know if you're doing a test

1090
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:38,719
wash there's a lot of things that you

1091
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,640
can figure out before you're committing

1092
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:44,089
you know tens of thousands of fresh

1093
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:46,819
frozen grams to actually doing it yeah

1094
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:48,140
and I mean it's basically test watching

1095
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,330
all of your genetics and looking at

1096
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:51,859
those trichome heads are keys but you

1097
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:53,449
know starting with genetics that you can

1098
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:56,269
know our fee knows that are going to

1099
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:59,419
wash well and you know you're gonna have

1100
00:41:56,269 --> 00:42:00,829
maybe 14 seeds and of that genetic that

1101
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,570
you washed and you can watch those

1102
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:04,190
trichome head structures you can watch

1103
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:06,410
all those fee notes and then you can

1104
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:08,119
decide okay this one has a dumper the

1105
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:09,559
structure looked really good you know

1106
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:11,509
it's healthy that's the those are the

1107
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:14,570
three that I want to go into my grow

1108
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:18,020
moving forward that's gonna be the keys

1109
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:21,559
to dialing in your girl definitely trial

1110
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:25,210
and error right oh that is all of our

1111
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:25,210
time thank you very much thank you

1112
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:29,409
[Applause]

1113
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,110
you
