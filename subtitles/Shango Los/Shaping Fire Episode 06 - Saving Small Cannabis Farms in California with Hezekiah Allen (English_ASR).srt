1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,638
I remember back when I was younger we

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,109
would get high and lay on the grass and

3
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:14,989
talk about how cool it would be to move

4
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:17,129
to California and grow marijuana

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,289
California was the promised land of

6
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:22,049
getting high on beaches drenched in

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,269
sunshine we had no idea how to make that

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,490
reality happen but we all knew that

9
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:28,858
being a marijuana farmer in Humboldt

10
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:31,739
County was pretty much the gold standard

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,570
of life goals most of the cannabis in

12
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,000
the Midwest was all moldy brick weed

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,230
from Mexico every now and then someone

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,359
would come back from a trip to

15
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:41,819
California we would all gather around to

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,649
see the big dense and fragrant flowers

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,899
that were called kind bud

18
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,489
putting California flower next to him

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,710
Mexican brick weed you'd not even know

20
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:51,869
they were the same plant and just like

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,878
that the kind bud was smoked and it was

22
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,488
gone and after a while it seemed like

23
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:59,698
myth again that flowers like that even

24
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:01,679
existed but we knew they existed because

25
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,378
we saw them in High Times Magazine these

26
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,840
ornate colorful and perfect flowers were

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,969
pretty much unattainable to us we

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,150
considered flowers from California with

29
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,609
reverence the idea of California was

30
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,520
more than just the gorgeous but itself

31
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:20,129
though it was the small clandestine

32
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,829
farmers in love with the land and making

33
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:25,228
it work it was these back to the land

34
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:28,079
folks giving up the city and growing

35
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:30,060
their own food and subsisting on income

36
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,150
from weed crops you know they may have

37
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,950
been modest income small farmers but

38
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,009
they were happy and they were high and

39
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,590
they had community the thing about that

40
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,810
fantasy of California we held in our

41
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,890
imagination was that it was actually

42
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,290
pretty true

43
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,909
while the DEA certainly played a role

44
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,710
and there was a general fear of

45
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,259
outsiders when I have talked to

46
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:54,478
old-timers in Garberville or Mendocino

47
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,989
or wherever they describe a world quite

48
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,429
like the one we always imagined it to be

49
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:00,809
now though those farmers are being

50
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,729
threatened by the potential

51
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,920
consolidation of production into huge

52
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:07,590
farms leading to the end of the small

53
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,598
family cannabis farm but this is in no

54
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,900
way a done deal though small farmers in

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,089
California can stand up and demand that

56
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,969
their voice be heard and influence the

57
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,729
implementation of proposition 64 so

58
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:22,400
their culture can pre preserved instead

59
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:24,738
of obliterated by corporatism and it

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,319
isn't only just on them all of us as

61
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:30,259
cannabis enthusiasts can speak up that

62
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:33,199
we don't want only mass-produce flour we

63
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:36,608
want artisan flour too and we want to

64
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:39,259
preserve California's cannabis heritage

65
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:41,120
today's episode is part 2 of 2 in our

66
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:44,000
series on the impacts and opportunities

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,799
of Proposition 64 in California if you

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,658
missed last week's episode with Amanda

69
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,069
Ryman of the drug policy Alliance you

70
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:50,780
can go back and hear our discussion

71
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,780
about new business opportunities now

72
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,128
that proposition 64 is passed

73
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,949
today's show is about what comes next

74
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:59,509
for small cannabis farmers in California

75
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:01,280
my guest today is Hezekiah Allen

76
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:04,068
executive director of the California

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,199
Growers Association Hezekiah grew up off

78
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:07,848
the grid in Humboldt County in exactly

79
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:10,188
the kind of community my friends and I

80
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:12,229
used to dream of living in he lived off

81
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:14,358
the land in cannabis was his agriculture

82
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:15,979
he realized that his community of

83
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:17,930
farmers in the Emerald triangle of

84
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:19,459
Northern California could use someone

85
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,590
dedicated to representing their

86
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,479
interests and so he progressed locally

87
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,789
from executive director of the Emerald

88
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:27,948
Growers Association to become the leader

89
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:30,739
of the now more statewide oriented

90
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:32,120
California Growers Association he now

91
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:33,560
speaks for cannabis farmers and

92
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,810
especially for small farmers with

93
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,128
California policymakers today we're

94
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,439
going to talk about the impact of

95
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:41,298
Proposition 64 on small cannabis farmers

96
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,039
and the actions necessary to preserve

97
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,500
artisan cannabis agriculture in

98
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,719
California

99
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,039
welcome to the show Hezekiah it's great

100
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,959
to be here thanks for having me well

101
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,759
thank you for making the time so you

102
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,919
know going into the election there was a

103
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:57,469
great deal of fear by a lot of folks

104
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,449
about the outcome of Proposition 64 and

105
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:02,329
and for some folks especially people who

106
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:04,069
think business wise simply not knowing

107
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:06,530
how the election was going to turn out

108
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:09,018
made business decisions really difficult

109
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,389
now that we're on the far side of the

110
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:13,579
election and we know that Proposition 64

111
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:15,769
is passed what are you hearing from

112
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:17,598
farmers and families in the Emerald

113
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:21,288
triangle region of Northern California

114
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:23,990
about how they feel now you know I in a

115
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:25,639
single word I think uncertainty is is

116
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,759
the overarching

117
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,129
here certainly going into the election

118
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:34,490
there was a lot of uncertainty about how

119
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:36,499
the legal adult use regulated market

120
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,060
would play out but I think coming out of

121
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:40,669
the election you know and this is a bit

122
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,139
of a curveball for for everyone coming

123
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:44,810
out of the election there's also

124
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:46,968
significantly increased uncertainty at

125
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,069
the federal level and so you know

126
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:51,139
exactly how this is going to play out

127
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:53,479
and what implementation is going to look

128
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:56,990
like was riddled with uncertainty to

129
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:59,959
begin with and now that conversation is

130
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,900
is even a bit more uncertain so folks

131
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:04,399
folks aren't quite sure what to think

132
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:06,649
you know of course my job and the reason

133
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,859
I moved down here to Sacramento to work

134
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:11,508
on this issue is to try to stay really

135
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,210
at the cutting edge of that conversation

136
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:16,759
to try to cut through some of that

137
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:20,120
uncertainty and and right now I don't

138
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:23,110
have a huge amount of solid feedback to

139
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,430
give to members so we're all sort of

140
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,680
looking at what passed looking at

141
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,240
current law and speculating as to what

142
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,610
may happen at the federal level but

143
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,668
certainly you know it's anything but

144
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,348
celebratory there there for folks who

145
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,028
have criminal convictions or who are

146
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:40,598
facing charges or are in jail

147
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:43,699
those folks are stoked and everybody is

148
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:45,199
100% in alignment that they should be

149
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:48,080
out of jail and those charges should be

150
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,810
dropped from the business side a really

151
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,158
really tremendous amount of uncertainty

152
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,949
you know that must be really frustrating

153
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:57,370
for you as somebody who grew up in the

154
00:05:54,949 --> 00:06:00,560
Emerald Triangle area and as their

155
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:03,649
representative down in Sacramento for

156
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,110
them to turn to you for sage advice and

157
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:08,088
insight but for you to you know maybe

158
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,680
not really know anything more than we

159
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:12,348
knew before the elections since the

160
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,569
rulemaking hasn't really started yet as

161
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:16,848
somebody who you know represents people

162
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:18,259
who are not only our constituents but

163
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:19,579
like these are this is your family and

164
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,620
people you grew up and your loved ones

165
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,859
there must be a certain amount of

166
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,449
frustration kind of packed into that -

167
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,088
yeah you know and this is certainly the

168
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:31,490
frustration that we felt ahead of the

169
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:33,408
election you know the the Association

170
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,408
largest Association of cannabis

171
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:38,778
businesses in California with probably

172
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:39,829
close to about 900 members at the time

173
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:42,319
of this

174
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:46,370
you know we felt that frustration ahead

175
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:49,969
of time there is a lot of policy in prop

176
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:52,129
64 there is a lot of statute that was

177
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,680
passed last year by the legislature and

178
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,509
part of our concern and part of why we

179
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,780
were never never able to get to a

180
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:02,060
support position on prop 64 is because

181
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:05,418
of the immensity of it and because of

182
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,149
how many aspects of it are a bit unclear

183
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:09,859
and the disparities or disagreements

184
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:13,219
with current law and trying to figure

185
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,889
out which provisions will be preeminent

186
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,530
you know which ones will actually govern

187
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:20,240
the industry and and yeah it is a bit

188
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:22,699
frustrating I mean I guess the saving

189
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,280
grace and you know a bit of irony and in

190
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:27,529
describing it as a silver lining but the

191
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,289
silver lining is there still plenty of

192
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:35,599
things growers can be working on from

193
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:37,400
water permits to labor law to tax law

194
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,439
you know there's plenty of things that

195
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:42,620
folks who are currently operating in the

196
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,538
underground or gray medical market

197
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,639
there's plenty of things they can be

198
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:48,918
working on so there's not a shortage of

199
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,349
compliance tasks for the growers to be

200
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:54,859
doing but it is certainly frustrating to

201
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,600
have frankly more answers than we did

202
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,520
the day before there excuse me more

203
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,100
questions than we did the day before the

204
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,719
answer before the election answers are

205
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,669
hard to come by and questions are

206
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,289
plentiful yeah and you're probably

207
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:07,579
trying to hand out more patients than

208
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:09,168
anything to everybody

209
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:11,089
you know I think it surprised a lot of

210
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:13,459
folks that the voting returns from the

211
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:15,469
triangle counties actually came back in

212
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,180
favor of the proposition now even though

213
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,220
I read over the weekend that Mendocino

214
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,949
County very literally passed it by one

215
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,220
vote did it surprise you that the

216
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:27,139
counties ended up voting in favor of it

217
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,539
no I you know I think I think at this

218
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,939
point in 2016 it was pretty much a

219
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:35,208
foregone conclusion from our perspective

220
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:38,179
that it would pass we saw a lot of

221
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:41,329
people that took a YES on adult use no

222
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:45,429
on Prop 64 position I you know I would

223
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:48,770
estimate and some of our initial post

224
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:50,659
post-election surveys indicate that you

225
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:53,059
know public support was probably closer

226
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:54,889
to 65 or 70 percent

227
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:58,219
and the fact that we saw numbers in the

228
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:59,569
mid-50s throughout the state it reflects

229
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,269
the fact that there there was a

230
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:08,000
significant YES on adult use voting bloc

231
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:09,439
know on 64 so we were pretty pretty

232
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,480
confident that it was going to be

233
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,580
successful this time all of all of the

234
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,409
numbers indicated such and and there was

235
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,660
no good reason to believe they weren't

236
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:20,000
gonna pull a majority in in most

237
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:22,579
counties the the map looks a lot like we

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,589
expected it to frankly you know there's

239
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,610
that schism that there was before the

240
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:30,589
election the the YES on adult use no on

241
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,139
sixty-four folks it was it was hard

242
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:34,940
because people who are family and

243
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,039
friends and and have done business

244
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,650
together and medical providers you know

245
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:43,459
it there was this subtle cut in between

246
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:45,649
the community and the closer got to the

247
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,960
election and and more of it got turned

248
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,879
up and up and up on social media it was

249
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,920
it was pretty rough there right at the

250
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,720
end and I think that probably everybody

251
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,360
is just happy to have the damn election

252
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,450
over so we can deal with the reality of

253
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,980
it instead of everybody trying to

254
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,680
convince each other and hate on each

255
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,730
other about whichever side they were on

256
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,159
yeah I'd certainly think that's an

257
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,139
accurate observation and you know I

258
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:13,129
think one thing that was particularly

259
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:15,769
acute for our community in part of the

260
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:18,830
cannabis culture in California is is one

261
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:20,838
of sort of escaping from the system

262
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,930
right my parents went back to the land

263
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:27,320
to get away from all of this and so our

264
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:29,659
culture is very much a outsiders culture

265
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,790
and for a lot of our members this was

266
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:34,399
the first election cycle that they've

267
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:37,789
gone through and actually had a real

268
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,949
tangible emotional stake in it and so

269
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:44,269
you know for for me and for folks who

270
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:46,310
work in in politics election fever is a

271
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:48,289
pretty well-known thing you know you get

272
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:50,059
you get really really worked up an

273
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:52,309
intense and passionate in the weeks

274
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:53,899
leading up to the election and then you

275
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:56,208
wake up the next day and you sort of see

276
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:58,069
how long the hangover lasts and so for a

277
00:10:56,208 --> 00:11:00,909
lot of people experiencing that

278
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:04,370
phenomenon for the first time it got

279
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:05,959
particularly nasty you know boycotts of

280
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,769
businesses that were voting

281
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:12,320
no and just just you know frankly a lot

282
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:14,689
more divisive than it needed to be and

283
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,750
you know the beautiful thing is now that

284
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:20,660
that cycle has concluded farmers know

285
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:23,000
about cycles now they understand okay so

286
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:25,579
that was harvest and now we're tilling

287
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,769
the soil and starting over and so to be

288
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,139
able to have gone through the cycle made

289
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:33,829
it through the fever and frankly to have

290
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:36,049
emerged more unified and stronger than

291
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,210
we went into it I think is a pretty

292
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:40,339
significant accomplishment yeah I would

293
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,110
definitely agree with you there and you

294
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,540
know it's it's too bad that it happened

295
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,070
right there during harvest time as well

296
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:48,049
it must have been really distracting

297
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,210
from everybody trying to trying to get

298
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:53,539
the harvest in yeah you know I actually

299
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:55,430
think we saw a bit of relief there right

300
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:57,620
around the third week of October when

301
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:59,659
the rains hit we saw a lot of the social

302
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,389
media at least from my perspective cool

303
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:04,069
off and you know everyone had more

304
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:06,889
pressing concerns the vote-by-mail

305
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,720
ballots had already been mailed and you

306
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:11,569
know as it was back to the farm which is

307
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,100
where most growers want to be spending

308
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,660
their time so it actually worked out

309
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,730
pretty well with the weather and the

310
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:18,889
conditions and sort of gave us a bit of

311
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,360
relief right in the lead-up the

312
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:22,309
immediate lead-up to the election there

313
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,769
right on well before we go to commercial

314
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:27,409
I want to ask you one cultural question

315
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:30,649
about harvest over there in the Humboldt

316
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:35,000
area you know I I heard once that there

317
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:37,399
are so many growers in the area that the

318
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,409
businesses that sell high price tag

319
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,319
things like cars and stuff they actually

320
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:44,240
advertise harvest sale so it's like

321
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,250
you've made your harvest and then you've

322
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,009
sold it down the line and now you've got

323
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,889
your big yearly income do do you see

324
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:53,809
that happening do businesses really

325
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:56,059
target market harvesters because there's

326
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:57,439
so many growers in the region yeah

327
00:12:56,059 --> 00:13:00,739
absolutely and you know the only thing

328
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,480
that I'll correct in that sort of

329
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,549
understanding of the situation is this

330
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,519
is not a phenomenon that's limited to

331
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:10,479
the triangle tri-county region I mean

332
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,159
this is something we see statewide from

333
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,950
Calaveras Tuolumne out in the foothills

334
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:18,370
Nevada County Sierra County Santa Cruz I

335
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,560
mean the the one of one of

336
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,419
things from an academic perspective that

337
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,819
I'm most excited about as this

338
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:27,009
marketplace emerges into regulation is

339
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,700
wrapping our minds and imaginations

340
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:34,649
around the scope and the scale of our

341
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:37,150
outdoor harvest it is truly an epic

342
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:40,120
agricultural feat that we managed to get

343
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:43,329
all of this labor-intensive high-value

344
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,028
delicate by some standards perishable

345
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,430
product out of the ground onto the wires

346
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:51,000
and into the turkey bags in such a short

347
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:53,079
amount of time so I am thoroughly

348
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,669
excited about having better

349
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,440
understanding of that but yeah you know

350
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:59,019
we definitely see that in in many ways

351
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,360
all of rural California is operating on

352
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:03,278
a harvest cycle and of course you know a

353
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,250
lot of other agriculture has that same

354
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:08,649
cycle so it's not completely unheard of

355
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,750
but it's it's really undeniable that

356
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:14,439
that the cannabis harvest is a major

357
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:16,419
driving force in in regional economies

358
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,339
up and down the state awesome thank you

359
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:20,049
for that little bit of culture injection

360
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:21,940
there Hezekiah we're gonna take our

361
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:26,679
first short break and be right back you

362
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:28,510
are listening to shaping fire using

363
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:30,519
pesticides when growing cannabis has

364
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:32,889
been common for a long time nowadays

365
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,958
though we know better we know that most

366
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:36,580
pesticides formulated for food crops

367
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,009
have never been tested for use with

368
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,290
cannabis they've been tested to be eaten

369
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:43,269
in tiny doses they have not been tested

370
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:45,389
to be inhaled and especially not

371
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:47,769
concentrated into a cannabis oil

372
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:49,480
chemical residues from pesticides are

373
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:52,000
not healthy for anyone but they are

374
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,620
especially dangerous for patients for

375
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,929
commercial cannabis growers this has

376
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,700
become very impactful cannabis

377
00:14:55,929 --> 00:15:00,338
enthusiasts and patients have gotten

378
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,310
educated enough that they avoid growers

379
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:04,930
who used pesticides not only that but

380
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:07,239
states across the country have begun

381
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:10,809
making pesticide testing mandatory on

382
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,278
all licensed cannabis crops the time has

383
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,409
come to find a better way to fight

384
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,450
garden pests than covering your cannabis

385
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:20,399
and chemicals and there is a better way

386
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:22,778
let some good bugs fight your bad bugs

387
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,579
beneficial insects and predatory mites

388
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:26,828
have come a long way since we were

389
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,780
buying ladybugs online and putting them

390
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:32,299
in the grow room and just hoping for the

listening to shaping fire I am your host

413
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:30,649
Shengo louse and our guest this week is

414
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,200
Hezekiah Allen executive director of the

415
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:35,329
California growers association so

416
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,509
Hezekiah before the break we were

417
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:40,370
talking about the lack of certainty on

418
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:42,919
growers parts about what's gonna happen

419
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,810
next and you know there are a lot of

420
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:47,599
lobbyist groups who will be trying to

421
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:49,339
influence policy making in Sacramento do

422
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,620
you think the artisan farmers throughout

423
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:54,879
California the smaller folks will you

424
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,320
know have a voice in the rulemaking

425
00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:00,529
certainly if I have anything to do about

426
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,230
it they will you know that that is very

427
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:05,269
much the purpose for which the

428
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:10,039
California Growers Association was

429
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:13,240
organized our our general highest level

430
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:16,609
metric of success will be how many

431
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,740
independent growers are successful in

432
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:21,049
the regulated marketplace you know

433
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:24,140
oftentimes economists will boil things

434
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:26,149
down to how big is a market what is the

435
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,759
gross productivity of this marketplace

436
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:31,400
but from our perspective we want to go a

437
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:33,680
layer deeper and we care greatly about

438
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,990
what that ownership pattern looks like

439
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,049
and so transitioning not just from what

440
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:42,109
is the gross value gross productivity of

441
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:45,259
the market but how many people how many

442
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:47,779
businesses are enjoying the benefits of

443
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:52,069
productivity and you know that's that's

444
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:54,170
a I think a very relevant and salient

445
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:56,629
message in in sort of the greater

446
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:59,690
political be it national or global as

447
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:01,670
we're looking at this economic reality

448
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,710
that you know there's more wealth in the

449
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,810
world today than there ever has been in

450
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,930
the world and yet absolute and relative

451
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:11,200
poverty are off the charts not only are

452
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:14,240
we offering this new and amazing

453
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,069
alternative medicine we're also bringing

454
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,250
this very different culture that

455
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:21,470
incubated outside of that economic

456
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,900
development you know the post-war years

457
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:26,360
nineteen fifty was not that long ago and

458
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,250
we had a very different wealth

459
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:31,309
distribution both nationally and

460
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:34,250
globally then and so our industry grew

461
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:36,669
up outside of the consolidation and to

462
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:39,740
be able to bring that back in such a

463
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,900
culturally stimulating exciting this is

464
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,809
a product that people care about it's in

465
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:48,170
the headlines to be able to bring that

466
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:50,139
to the conversation in you know early on

467
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,920
in the 21st century I think has

468
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,680
implications not just for our

469
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,590
marketplace but for the broader academic

470
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,810
study of economics in general and you

471
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:02,240
know certainly at this point we're

472
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:04,700
pushing a thousand members we'd love to

473
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,740
double that again this calendar year you

474
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,990
know we look around the state we're

475
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,750
estimating about fifty thousand growers

476
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,089
total probably about thirty thousand of

477
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,279
them would eventually seek a license and

478
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:18,619
we'd love to see five or ten thousand of

479
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,629
them licensed in year one and so we

480
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:23,269
certainly I think it's fair to say that

481
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,280
the existing rowers in the state not

482
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:27,319
only have a voice but are one of the

483
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,809
preeminent voices in Sacramento and

484
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,819
we're gonna continue growing our

485
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:32,569
membership and growing our influence

486
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:35,839
accordingly

487
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:38,689
that is such both an honorable and a

488
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:41,480
really difficult fight because you know

489
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:45,380
capitalism just generally moves towards

490
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,450
consolidation so that economies of scale

491
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,860
can be taken advantage of and prices

492
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:53,870
generally come down and profits are made

493
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:56,509
but of course what you're suggesting is

494
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:59,189
that you know it's it's better to have

495
00:19:56,509 --> 00:20:03,329
more small business

496
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:04,860
then fewer gargantuan businesses and you

497
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:08,309
know that's where a lot of people's

498
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:12,750
heart is but pushing back on those

499
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:16,039
economic forces is a real challenge yeah

500
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:19,650
it is and you know where I grew up very

501
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:23,759
few things were easy you know every

502
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:26,100
harvest came at in spite of at the time

503
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,470
a paramilitary war on drugs you know

504
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:31,559
Bush Senior sent the National Guard out

505
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:33,360
a couple times so we you know we grew up

506
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:36,359
on the front lines of this thing and our

507
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:40,229
culture was really tempered by that most

508
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:42,569
extreme manifestation of prohibition and

509
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,430
and you know this is this is the place

510
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:46,409
that our culture is coming from and and

511
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:49,370
you know it's it's certainly present in

512
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:52,200
other states Washington Colorado Alaska

513
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:56,099
Oregon you know you you had these

514
00:20:52,200 --> 00:21:00,690
experiences but the center of gravity

515
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:02,879
and the the there are so many people and

516
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,029
and businesses and farms coming from

517
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,800
that place here that you know frankly

518
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:10,349
it's about time that we start

519
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:13,950
questioning some of those basic tenets

520
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:16,709
of economics and what better community

521
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:19,650
of businesses to do it than ours I mean

522
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:22,170
change has to be financed at the end of

523
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:24,900
the day you know there's no way that we

524
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:28,110
can win a revolution of economics of

525
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,730
sustainability of Labor of any of these

526
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:31,949
things that our culture is marked by

527
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,170
there's no way we can win that fight

528
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,509
without a financial commercial base and

529
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:39,000
we're in a very unique position of

530
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:41,579
having that and that's why it's so

531
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,220
important to permit and license those

532
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:46,500
businesses so that this message that we

533
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,289
carry continues to have voice and

534
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,019
continues to have momentum and and I do

535
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:54,720
think at the end of the day if we stop

536
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:57,990
and take the time to ask ourselves is

537
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,900
this economic system working for us as

538
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,599
people as families as neighborhoods the

539
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:06,630
answer frankly is no and we do need to

540
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:09,000
start doing some things differently we

541
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:12,600
can look to a handful of states in the

542
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,079
farm belt just to add a quick aside to

543
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,819
it there

544
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,159
there's about 11 states in the nation

545
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:20,099
that currently restrict the corporate

546
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,470
ownership of agriculture and those 11

547
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:25,459
states from a Human Development Index

548
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:28,250
standard they have some of the longest

549
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,960
lifespans lowest infant mortality

550
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,970
everything is so much better than the

551
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,880
states around them that have allowed for

552
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:39,390
the financial sector to gut agriculture

553
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:43,290
there's something really really special

554
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:46,470
a special kind of value that small farms

555
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:48,539
bring to our communities and building on

556
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,970
that value not just from a cultural

557
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:53,639
perspective but also from an economic

558
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:56,309
perspective it really needs to be the

559
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,870
foundation of our 21st century and you

560
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:01,980
know the last point I'll make on this

561
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:05,449
subject it's it's very uncommon for me

562
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,370
to cite a World Trade Organization paper

563
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,660
1,013 the World Trade Organization

564
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:12,059
teamed up with the United Nations

565
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,370
Commission on Trade and Development and

566
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,659
they released a report called wake up

567
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:18,539
before it's too late

568
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,880
small farms are the only way to feed the

569
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:24,990
world and it really called into question

570
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,420
the entire driving thesis behind the

571
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:29,339
industrial agricultural revolution and

572
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,890
so at this point there really is a

573
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:34,439
global movement picking up steam to put

574
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:37,230
agricultural productivity back in the

575
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,029
hands of family farms one of the biggest

576
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,769
challenges of course to that and one of

577
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:43,170
the reasons the obama administration

578
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:45,509
didn't take this one on is because of

579
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:48,330
the entrenched interests of agribusiness

580
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:50,849
these are these are giants of global

581
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:53,369
commerce but they don't exist in our

582
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:56,789
marketplace and so we have this very

583
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:59,879
unique opportunity to move quickly with

584
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:01,200
a different type of regulations and you

585
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,600
know that's precisely what we've been

586
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,180
doing and what we intend to continue

587
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,309
doing as executive director of the

588
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,310
California Growers Association you know

589
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:14,220
you have got I think at least two really

590
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:17,549
nice advantages as far as as getting

591
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:20,220
your base involved number one like you

592
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:23,058
said it's a it's an industry that grew

593
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,730
up outside of the consolidation world

594
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:27,499
in the gray area and so you all have you

595
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,349
know you've been to war together already

596
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:32,509
you you've had the war on drugs come to

597
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:34,398
your neighborhood and it and it bonded

598
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:37,220
people and it really let people get to

599
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:39,199
know each other and so you're not a

600
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,200
hodgepodge of folks that are put

601
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,048
together you're already a prepared

602
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,370
communicative folks who you know have

603
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:49,038
each other's phone numbers and email

604
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:50,839
addresses right but also as far as you

605
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,548
know income distribution which is what

606
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,908
you've been talking about you know

607
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:58,759
having the big conversation and message

608
00:24:55,909 --> 00:25:00,730
of Bernie Sanders in the election got

609
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:04,339
people thinking about whether or not

610
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:06,769
consolidation and big business helped

611
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:10,189
them as individual people and I think

612
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:11,990
that having having both your people

613
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,999
already know each other and the fact

614
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,609
that that message was pushed so heavily

615
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:19,269
during this particular election can only

616
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:23,028
help the California Growers Association

617
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:28,730
yeah and you know frankly we saw it from

618
00:25:23,028 --> 00:25:31,548
I think the Trump campaign is well well

619
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:34,819
a lot of folks on the coast particularly

620
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:37,460
our beautiful Pacific Northwest out here

621
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:40,700
I think we were triggered by some of the

622
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:44,740
more racist misogynist xenophobic things

623
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,940
that the incoming president said but for

624
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,009
academics who have now had the

625
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,259
opportunity to take the time to go

626
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:54,649
through speeches and to do quantitative

627
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:57,259
analyses whether or not it's lip service

628
00:25:54,648 --> 00:26:02,209
the incoming president spent a lot of

629
00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:04,548
time talking about the damage that free

630
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,759
trade agreements the damage that this

631
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:09,859
particular neoliberal breed of economic

632
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:12,618
development has done to the heartland

633
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:15,038
and so well it's easier to find the

634
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:17,749
affinity with the with the senator

635
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:21,618
Sanders campaign I think that there's

636
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:22,730
also a commonality in in folks who who

637
00:26:21,618 --> 00:26:25,308
voted for the incoming administration

638
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,889
and well of course we talked about the

639
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:29,569
uncertainty at the beginning we have no

640
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:31,609
idea how this administration

641
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:34,240
particularly the incoming Attorney

642
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:36,529
General is going to respond and react to

643
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,730
cannabis laws throughout the country

644
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:44,720
there is an underlying majority and I

645
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:47,150
think growing majority that big is not

646
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,940
better and and that's the fundamental

647
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:52,370
question that we need to ask ourselves I

648
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,720
mean we went through it in two thousand

649
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:57,319
six seven eight with the too-big-to-fail

650
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,569
era and and the way to not end up in

651
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:01,819
that situation again is to prevent that

652
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:04,490
level of consolidation so I actually

653
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:07,309
think that it's a it's a populist it's a

654
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:10,400
resurgent populist message that is

655
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:14,450
bridging partisan divides it's unifying

656
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:17,240
campaigns and frankly I think that the

657
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:20,120
Clinton campaign was unsuccessful

658
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,609
because they didn't have a meaningful

659
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:25,149
answer to this question and I really

660
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:28,429
think that over the next 10 to 20 years

661
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:31,100
this will be the defining question how

662
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:33,440
is this policy going to impact the

663
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:36,889
middle class is this going to create

664
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,910
more small business owners and you know

665
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,610
we need to get into some of those

666
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:43,759
definitions what is a small business I'm

667
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:46,129
sorry grossing 2.5 million is not small

668
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,930
from my perspective you know and and

669
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:50,990
this is one of those important areas

670
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:53,539
where current state law for the medical

671
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:57,440
regs to find small business very

672
00:27:53,539 --> 00:28:00,289
differently than prop 64 does prop 64

673
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,650
defines a micro business as being four

674
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:06,740
times larger than what current law

675
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:10,610
defines the micro business as so there's

676
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:13,099
a real slant and bias toward larger

677
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:14,899
businesses and prop 64 and that

678
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:17,569
ultimately was why we weren't able to

679
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:20,240
support it is because it prefers fewer

680
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:22,339
bigger businesses over more smaller

681
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,079
businesses thanks for that Hezekiah

682
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:25,730
we're gonna take another short break and

683
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:31,369
be right back you are listening to

684
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:33,110
shaping fire businesses everywhere are

685
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:35,239
constantly striving to reach out to

686
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:36,889
people through advertising we all know

687
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,509
though that trying to reach a cannabis

688
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:40,370
audience with a quality message is

689
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:42,259
pretty difficult that's why many people

690
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:45,229
choose to advertise on the shaping fire

691
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:47,059
podcast advertising on this show allows

692
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:49,069
us time to talk about your product

693
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,548
service or brand in a way that really

694
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:50,960
lets pee

695
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:53,298
we'll know what sets your company apart

696
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,798
from others bold people who own

697
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:56,329
companies know that getting in a

698
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:59,569
relationship with their customers is

699
00:28:56,329 --> 00:29:01,638
essential that is what we offer we will

700
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:04,069
explain your service or product and what

701
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:06,288
sets it apart as desirable and help our

702
00:29:04,069 --> 00:29:07,388
audience get in contact with you it's

703
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:09,230
pretty simple really

704
00:29:07,388 --> 00:29:12,199
advertising does not have to be all

705
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,819
whiz-bang smoke and mirrors nowadays I

706
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,489
find that people prefer just to be

707
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:18,829
spoken to calmly accurately and with

708
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:20,798
good intentions if you want to make your

709
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:23,509
own commercial spot you can do that too

710
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,788
because the podcast is young but growing

711
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:27,769

listening to shaping fire I am your host

729
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:07,278
Shengo Louis and our guest this week is

730
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:09,798
Hezekiah Allen executive director of the

731
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,898
California growers association so

732
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:14,239
Hezekiah on the last episode of shaping

733
00:30:11,898 --> 00:30:16,398
fire Amanda Ryman of the drug policy

734
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:18,769
Alliance was on the show and she said

735
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:21,618
that the new law very much protects

736
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:23,808
medical in California but she also said

737
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:26,628
that the bigger medical players who can

738
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:28,940
afford the costs of compliance in adult

739
00:30:26,628 --> 00:30:32,148
use with the new law will very likely

740
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,679
migrate to the commercial market now you

741
00:30:32,148 --> 00:30:36,498
know I've been a business strategist my

742
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:39,590
whole life and to me that suggests to me

743
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:42,139
a future where the medical market slowly

744
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:44,269
gets drained of its major players and

745
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:46,788
therefore major funding and it gets

746
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:49,368
smaller and weaker until the commercial

747
00:30:46,788 --> 00:30:52,669
lobbyists who you know are dying to

748
00:30:49,368 --> 00:30:54,738
inhale that medical market find a way to

749
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:57,379
say oh the medical market is irrelevant

750
00:30:54,739 --> 00:30:59,539
and they try to shut them out how do you

751
00:30:57,378 --> 00:31:02,579
see it playing out at this

752
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:05,190
well you know I think that this idea

753
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:08,639
that prop 64 protects the medical

754
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:12,470
marketplace is a bit more of campaign

755
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:15,780
rhetoric than actual policy work and so

756
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:19,380
California was obviously the first to

757
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:22,859
pass a medical law back in 96 we have a

758
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:25,440
two decade long tradition of medical

759
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:28,649
cannabis it is compassionate use and

760
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,710
compassionate commerce are very much the

761
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:34,610
foundation of our cannabis industry and

762
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:37,529
marketplace be it regulated medical

763
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:39,269
unregulated adult use or out-of-state

764
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:41,670
sales which of course you know

765
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:44,039
California is a a large exporter of

766
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:45,810
cannabis as well but that culture really

767
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:49,019
threads the needle between all of those

768
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:52,139
marketplaces and so the initiative would

769
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:54,599
not have been politically viable if it

770
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,970
was perceived to undermine that

771
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:59,579
marketplace so the campaign ran very

772
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:01,670
very heavily on this point that you know

773
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:06,470
medical is protected this is separate

774
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:10,230
that's not true just to put it simply

775
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:12,269
every everything around town in

776
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:14,789
Sacramento here in the legislature the

777
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:16,799
regulatory agencies everyone's pulling

778
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:18,839
their hair out trying to figure out how

779
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,109
we're going to fold these marketplaces

780
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:25,319
together what rules and regs apply to

781
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:27,149
both I think that before we knew the

782
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:29,639
outcome of the presidential election

783
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:31,860
there was a pretty firm consensus that

784
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,590
California would emerge with a single

785
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:37,979
regulated marketplace now I think

786
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:41,730
everyone is sort of on alert that the

787
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:44,670
federal government may decide to impose

788
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:46,589
a distinction on the states something to

789
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:49,529
the effect of will respect States

790
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:52,409
medical programs but we won't respect

791
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:55,109
States adult use programs and so that

792
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:57,390
uncertainty asserting certainly clouded

793
00:32:55,109 --> 00:33:00,509
the conversation but the truth of the

794
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:04,230
matter is at the end of the day at least

795
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:06,420
up until the consumer purchases the

796
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:09,569
cannabis there is likely to be one

797
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:11,130
unified supply chain a grower is not

798
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:13,559
going to be a medical grow

799
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:15,960
or an adult use grower they're simply

800
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:18,240
going to grow cannabis pesticide

801
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,549
regulations are not going to differ if

802
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,160
it's not safe for a patient it's not

803
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:25,769
safe for an adult consumer those types

804
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,960
of things are going to be unified and

805
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:30,619
that was always the intent and so this

806
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,509
is this is one of those places where

807
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:37,529
policy and politics don't always match

808
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:42,119
and you know it was a necessary

809
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:43,559
political goal to to insulate and to

810
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:47,099
carve out medical but from an

811
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:49,049
implementation bureaucratic who's going

812
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:51,449
to give you a license it's going to be

813
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:53,909
the same office there's not going to be

814
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:57,090
two offices and two bureaus and two

815
00:33:53,910 --> 00:34:00,060
directors so I think it's important to

816
00:33:57,089 --> 00:34:01,919
distinguish how politics and policy

817
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:03,119
differ in this regard yeah I think

818
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,830
that's a good point I've got a couple

819
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,929
more questions about economies of scale

820
00:34:04,829 --> 00:34:08,219
here and how you see it playing out so

821
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:10,470
you know the economies of scale will

822
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:12,959
continue to favor the large commercial

823
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:14,128
growers as they start to create more

824
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,648
profits because they can you know

825
00:34:14,128 --> 00:34:19,230
essentially by things like supplies and

826
00:34:16,648 --> 00:34:21,750
labor and bulk so do you think that the

827
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:23,519
Emerald triangle Appalachian region that

828
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,739
will eventually be created will be

829
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:28,349
enough to support the higher prices that

830
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:30,269
artisan farmers were will likely have to

831
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:32,309
charge since they're smaller and can't

832
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:35,250
take advantage of buying things in such

833
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:38,789
mega bulk well so this goes back to that

834
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:41,010
that initial question is bigger actually

835
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:43,500
better you know there's been a lot of

836
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:46,020
work done on the high cost of low prices

837
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,289
and understanding that those economies

838
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:51,509
of scale are not actually reduced costs

839
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:54,119
they just externalize more of their

840
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:55,889
costs and society ends up bearing those

841
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:57,929
costs whether it you know for

842
00:34:55,889 --> 00:35:00,660
traditional agriculture that comes in

843
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:02,989
the form of farm subsidies or for the

844
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:06,629
oil industry it comes in the form of

845
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:09,989
unmitigated or unrestored environmental

846
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:12,930
damages but those costs still exists in

847
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:16,319
fact if you want to get really technical

848
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:18,869
about it products grown agriculture in

849
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,590
particular large scale grows are

850
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:24,838
probably more expensive the consumer is

851
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:27,568
seeing a reduced cost but

852
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:29,578
the overall social cost is not reduced

853
00:35:27,568 --> 00:35:32,278
and so we need to do a better job of

854
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:34,039
doing true cost accounting but you know

855
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:36,539
that's all well in good academic

856
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:39,089
conceptual feel good stuff let's talk

857
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:41,700
about nuts and bolts on the ground this

858
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:45,690
is one of the biggest distinctions

859
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:49,048
between prop 64 and the medical regs the

860
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:53,159
medical regs limit any single license

861
00:35:49,048 --> 00:35:56,548
holder to one acre per lot and four

862
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:58,710
acres cumulative prop 64 blows it wide

863
00:35:56,548 --> 00:36:01,768
open and allows a licensee to grow as

864
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,659
much as they want frankly we don't think

865
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:06,868
anyone needs to grow more than an acre

866
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:12,298
and it's very much our intent this year

867
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:14,190
in 2017 to ask everyone in the state who

868
00:36:12,298 --> 00:36:16,949
needs to grow more than an acre raise

869
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:19,920
your hand come to the legislature and

870
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:22,348
tell us why tell us what the public

871
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,719
benefit of you doing that is you're

872
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:26,609
going to ask the state for some level of

873
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:29,548
limited liability through a corporate

874
00:36:26,608 --> 00:36:31,348
charter that's not a free pass corporate

875
00:36:29,548 --> 00:36:34,949
charters shouldn't be handed out so

876
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:37,950
easily demonstrate how you will promote

877
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:40,578
good jobs not minimum-wage jobs good

878
00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:43,919
jobs demonstrate how you will protect

879
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:47,729
California's scarce water and why going

880
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,710
big is going to allow you to improve

881
00:36:47,728 --> 00:36:52,288
those metrics and at the end of the day

882
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:54,809
the truth is they want these small farms

883
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:57,569
are more resource efficient they create

884
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:59,849
better jobs and so it really is a

885
00:36:57,568 --> 00:37:02,998
question of how we look at efficiency

886
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:05,579
are those cost savings real or are they

887
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:07,588
just externalized and secondly what are

888
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:10,680
the secondary benefits and the

889
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:12,659
multiplier effects of inhibiting those

890
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:14,460
large growths and I'll just say at the

891
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:17,368
end of at the end of this conversation

892
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,228
there is a clear consensus that the

893
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:21,150
lieutenant governor's Blue Ribbon

894
00:37:19,228 --> 00:37:23,968
Commission reports States very

895
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:26,940
succinctly it is appropriate and wise

896
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:29,999
for the state of California to limit the

897
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:33,179
size and power both economic and

898
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:36,389
political of any single entity in the

899
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:38,308
cannabis marketplace I think that if you

900
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:38,670
had to make that argument anywhere in

901
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:41,130
the

902
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:44,070
you are the best place to make that

903
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:46,920
argument where the ideas of of social

904
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:51,930
socially conscious business and you know

905
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:53,820
in triple bottom-line profit really you

906
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:55,949
know people are interested to know that

907
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,110
okay that so the company's making money

908
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:59,759
the shareholders are making money but

909
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:04,320
what impact is it having on the

910
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,180
community and and let's not forget that

911
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,309
that there's humans in all these

912
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:09,210
companies so so I think that if you you

913
00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:11,009
know if you had to make that argument

914
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,559
anywhere I'm glad that you're making it

915
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:15,780
in California you know and strangely we

916
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:19,079
find ourselves drawing on some very

917
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:21,900
unexpected bodies of policy North Dakota

918
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:25,860
for example has what I think is probably

919
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:28,680
the most robust restrictions on

920
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:30,900
corporate ownerships of Agriculture

921
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:32,940
you know there's several states through

922
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,460
the farm belt there that right around

923
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,829
the the turn of the last century when

924
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:41,909
you know the the railroad barons were

925
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:45,000
and disrupted and and that last major

926
00:38:41,909 --> 00:38:48,779
wave of antitrust regulations went into

927
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,449
place you know you see you see some

928
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:54,930
similar provisions in states that you

929
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:56,909
really wouldn't expect this from so so

930
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:58,469
they're actually there there are some

931
00:38:56,909 --> 00:39:00,389
some other states out there that we're

932
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:03,569
drawing from but I certainly agree that

933
00:39:00,389 --> 00:39:06,779
you know if we're going to if California

934
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:09,930
is going to lead like we so oftentimes

935
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,880
projects that we do which quick tangent

936
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:13,829
I'm not convinced that California is

937
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,890
exactly the trendsetter nationally

938
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:20,069
anymore um but but we certainly identify

939
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:22,289
as such and if we're going to lead in

940
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:24,030
terms of those values we're going to

941
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:25,949
need to be bold and courageous and I

942
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:29,280
think this is a perfect opportunity to

943
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:31,679
do just that right on well said so for

944
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,320
this last question you know I really try

945
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:36,419
to do my best to decrease fear whenever

946
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,920
possible decrease fear and suffering in

947
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,559
people whenever I have the opportunity

948
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,440
and you know there's a lot of people who

949
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:45,509
are still afraid of Proposition 64

950
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,099
because it's passed and they don't know

951
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:49,920
what the rulemaking is going to be and

952
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:52,289
as you have already mentioned you know a

953
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,550
lot a lot of more weird as

954
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:56,070
ingredients are going to be going into

955
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:58,440
the sausage before the rulemaking comes

956
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:01,850
out on the other side so so take a

957
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,440
moment what advice would you give

958
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:06,449
fearful artists and growers who've been

959
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,960
doing this for generations who are

960
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:12,960
afraid of what comes next what balm can

961
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,909
you offer them that might help them get

962
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,820
through just living through the

963
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:23,159
rulemaking process you know we really

964
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:25,400
focus on basic core values at cow

965
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:28,679
growers and we try to boil things down

966
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:31,760
to the most simplest of terms and and

967
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:34,649
the two things that I can offer are

968
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,410
really the outcomes are going to be

969
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:40,889
better if we have a hand in shaping them

970
00:40:37,409 --> 00:40:43,920
and the more organized we are and the

971
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:47,400
more we work together the more influence

972
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,760
we'll have so you know I'm not trying to

973
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,920
veil the fact that this is a bit

974
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,660
self-serving in that of course I want

975
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,300
the organization to have more members

976
00:40:54,659 --> 00:41:00,839
but the reason the organization needs

977
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:03,510
more members is not so that you know I

978
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:07,140
can go on a fancy vacation it's so that

979
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:09,120
we can have more influence we we really

980
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:11,759
are focusing our resources pooling

981
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,679
resources together to ensure the

982
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,980
outcomes are as best as possible and

983
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:19,799
secondly courage what I can say with

984
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,510
certainty is that the clock is not going

985
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,260
to go backwards on this one we are

986
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:27,660
moving forward into a regulated future

987
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:31,920
and we need to have the courage to

988
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:36,089
embrace that the sooner folks get on the

989
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,190
train the easier it's going to be five

990
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:40,019
years from now it's going to be really

991
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:43,740
hard to make the transition from

992
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:46,230
unregulated to regulated so beyond to

993
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:49,199
have the courage to be on the first wave

994
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:52,159
have the courage to jump in and go for

995
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,230
it know that there are hundreds if not

996
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,969
thousands of other like-minded

997
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:59,519
businesses throughout the state that are

998
00:41:56,969 --> 00:42:02,609
going through this together with you and

999
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:04,829
really at the end of the day we're going

1000
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:06,090
to have the courage to work together to

1001
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:07,920
put our values

1002
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:11,010
first and like you mentioned a minute

1003
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,559
ago we value our profitability but we

1004
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:15,720
also value the places we do business and

1005
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:19,110
we value the people we do business with

1006
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:21,739
and I all I can say is that if we put

1007
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:24,750
our values first we work together to

1008
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:26,189
advance them with courage the world is

1009
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,800
going to be a better place than if we

1010
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:30,450
didn't and I you know I I some wake up

1011
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,390
every morning and I give thanks for the

1012
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:36,109

1013
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:39,719
be intentional let's bring this amazing

1014
