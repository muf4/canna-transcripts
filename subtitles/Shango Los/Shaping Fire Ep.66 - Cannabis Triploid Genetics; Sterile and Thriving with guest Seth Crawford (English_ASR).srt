2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,879
as cannabis cultivation continues to

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,399
normalize across the united states

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,639
more and more research and development

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,480
is being invested in cannabis genetics

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,839
our heritage growers made the cannabis

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,960
crosses we love today

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,359
based on intuition and experience today

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,439
though

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,279
a whole new variety of cannabis breeder

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,000
has evolved not only using

12
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,399
intuition and experience but also using

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,439
heavy computing and laboratory analytics

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,280
as well

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,359
while there is certainly no replacement

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,520
for experience and intuition

17
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,359
technology assisted breeding greatly

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,120
decreases the time it takes to actually

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,039
attain breeding goals

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,558
because successful cultivars can be

21
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,799
analyzed and confirmed

22
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,599
on the spot in a spreadsheet instead of

23
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,599
having to grow

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,039
all the plants to maturity and having

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,760
all the breeders friends smoke the

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,800
flowers hoping to confirm the results

27
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,439
with analytical breeding sex cannabinoid

28
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,839
content

29
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,159
terpene content and overall potency can

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,760
be determined in just a few minutes

31
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,798
several thousand times over making

32
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,159
extraordinarily large sifts a real

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,159
possibility

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,400
the application of these technologies

35
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,359
does not create genetically modified

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,600
organisms

37
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,280
they simply allow traditional mendelian

38
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,319
breeding decisions to occur

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,960
much much faster today we're going to be

40
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,679
talking about

41
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:26,079
triploid cannabis genetics these

42
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
triploid plants are only available to us

43
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,759
due to the availability of computing

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,680
power to cannabis breeders

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,799
these plants have three chromosomes

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,880
instead of two

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,960
which makes them sterile and impervious

48
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,798
to unintentional pollination

49
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,158
they also exhibit other traits many

50
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,479
cultivators want like

51
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,759
increased yields and resistance to pests

52
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,000
and molds

53
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,319
triploids occur in nature in a great

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,640
many species and in nearly all cases

55
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,158
these plants are superior to the other

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,000
plants in their species

57
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,759
so long as you don't intend to breed

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200

i'm your host shango

96
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,280
los my guest today is seth crawford

97
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,200
seth is a de-institutionalized academic

98
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,120
with a masters in public policy and a

99
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,958
phd in sociology

100
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,519
his focus up till now has been on the

101
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,439
political economy of cannabis

102
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,599
for years now he has been consulted by

103
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,359
lawmakers and policy specialists

104
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,598
for a better understanding of how the

105
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,319
cannabis economy works

106
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,039
seth is now co-founder of oregon cbd

107
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,119
seeds

108
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,079
a company researching developing and

109
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,480
wholesaling

110
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,080
specialty novel cannabinoid dominant

111
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,199
cannabis seeds

112
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,360
seth appeared on episode 25 of shaping

113
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,079
fire to talk about the convoluted cbd

114
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,720
market

115
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
and again on episode 37 to discuss the

116
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,239
nexus

117
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,359
of the medical cannabis and hemp markets

118
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,680
today we're going to talk about the

119
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,560
dramatic evolution of triploid seeds for

120
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,599
cannabis

121
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,280
welcome back to shaping fire seth thank

122
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,158
you for having me oh so glad to have you

123
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,759
here so

124
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,560
let's get right into it talking about

125
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,039
triploids so you know triploids are

126
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,199
really

127
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,479
common in other agriculture and food

128
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,399
industries but

129
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,318
i'm figuring the place to start with

130
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,560
today would be if you were to start with

131
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,318
the story of your entire valley

132
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,840
getting pollinated a few years back

133
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,919
right

134
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,120
yeah that was definitely the impetus for

135
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,759
us um this was uh back in 2016

136
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
uh we had a it was the the second year

137
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,680
of

138
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,439
industrial hemp production in the state

139
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,918
of oregon and it was the first year

140
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:31,759
of legal uh adult use

141
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,839
outdoor production so it was the the

142
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,800
inaugural year for thc

143
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,399
and uh the first i would say big year

144
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,280
for industrial hemp

145
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,079
and we had a neighbor who was about

146
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,918
three miles away

147
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,399
from one of our facilities and six miles

148
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,519
away from our major field

149
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:52,478
who had about 75 acres of

150
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,918
densely planted male and female

151
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:57,199
industrial hemp or what was

152
00:04:53,918 --> 00:05:00,560
supposed to be industrial hemp

153
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,879
he pollinated our our field our facility

154
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,560
he pollinated you know neighbors that

155
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,639
were 15 miles to the east

156
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,600
15 miles to the north 15 miles to the

157
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,120
south

158
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,000
it really demonstrated the viability of

159
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,879
cannabis pollen

160
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,399
and just how far it can travel uh so i

161
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,439
will grant him that it was a good good

162
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,279
science experiment

163
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,639
but on the other hand it devastated a

164
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,599
lot of other farmers in the

165
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,720
in the valley and unfortunately um you

166
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,039
know

167
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,919
in in ensuing years it it continued to

168
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,560
happen in in

169
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,240
uh in smaller i wouldn't say it was to

170
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,038
that scale but it's definitely been

171
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,879
happening

172
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,478
in our in our valley and then also

173
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,879
throughout the state and other areas

174
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,959
especially in southern oregon it's

175
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,759
really really demonstrated to people

176
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,879
that

177
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
you know even if you have good

178
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:48,159
communication with your neighbors

179
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,959
there are just some folks who cannot be

180
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,039
convinced

181
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:55,198
that their right to farm is

182
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,879
less important than the common good of

183
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,840
everybody else being able to have a crop

184
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,759
as well

185
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,119
so it's really an outgrowth of uh of

186
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,800
that experience for us

187
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,879
so folks who are listening in the show

188
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,240
who aren't super familiar with pollen

189
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,719
why don't you explain why

190
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,519
it's lame that a neighbor's crop

191
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
pollinated

192
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,599
your crop uh you know if you if you have

193
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,599
a

194
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,759
an all-female crop that you're growing

195
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,280
four cannabinoids whether it's thc

196
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,280
cbd cbg etc uh or even

197
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,279
just for terpenes in cannabinoid free

198
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,359
plants if those

199
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,119
female plants end up being pollinated

200
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,479
you're going to lose about 50 percent of

201
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,918
your overall biomass

202
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,240
in about 30 percent of your total

203
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,839
cannabinoid content just because the

204
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,319
female plants are putting all of their

205
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,239
energy

206
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,520
into that seed production rather than

207
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,519
into the stuff that we want

208
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,960
very very problematic from it from an

209
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,879
economic standpoint

210
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,000
yeah and essentially you're also ruining

211
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,159
good medicine right

212
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,439
so there's a there's a real human aspect

213
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,000
to it as well

214
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,360
most definitely and the other the other

215
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,199
side of this too and it's gonna it's

216
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,919
going to uh be a part of this larger

217
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,680
story

218
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,198
is you know if you're a farmer and

219
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,639
you're you're let's say you're trying to

220
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,960
grow a grain crop

221
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,960
in the the midwest and you're trying to

222
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,560
feed your cattle a very particular type

223
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,598
of grain

224
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,720
in a lot of cases that grain while the

225
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,800
the seed itself

226
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,120
is uh highly impacted by the female

227
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
that ends up producing the seed it's

228
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,360
also impacted

229
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,478
from a from a you know omega-3 and

230
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,479
omega-6 and then

231
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,318
other other components of the the seed

232
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,359
is healthy and you know good for

233
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,039
nutrition

234
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,560
that can be influenced by the pollen

235
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,360
donor as well

236
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,160
so if you're trying to have a pure type

237
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,439
of seed

238
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,080
even if it's just you know for your

239
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,560
cattle uh pollen contamination

240
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,478
can really play a play a significant

241
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,160
role in undermining that as well

242
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,478
so it's not just cannabinoids it's it's

243
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,560
also in seed production

244
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,079
and also you know it's it's even more

245
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,918
than just uh commercial

246
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:58,719
cannabis as well um you know when

247
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,079
i appreciate the spirit of people who

248
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,840
want to

249
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,680
um gorilla grow um you know cannabis

250
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,119
plants right they let the cannabis be

251
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,519
free and they you know they make these

252
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,199
little

253
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,079
fertilizer balls and they chuck them

254
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,720
into you know vacant yards and you know

255
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,359
uh things like that and the problem with

256
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,080
that though

257
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,720
is that if you have these feral cannabis

258
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,839
plants

259
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,680
growing around um you could have a

260
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,000
patient who's got their little home grow

261
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,680
with four or six plants or something

262
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,598
and you know they are growing their

263
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,158
medicine and it's important and you know

264
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,718
somebody has thrown some feral hemp

265
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,360
you know you know a few parcels down and

266
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,760
one of those

267
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,440
seeds becomes a male and all of that

268
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,639
pollen is blowing

269
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,880
uh windwardly to this

270
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,679
patient's house suddenly their medicine

271
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,240
is going to get

272
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,599
all of this pollen and ruin this crop

273
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,480
which you know could be

274
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
literally a life-or-death situation for

275
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,519
them so

276
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,120
i'm constantly encouraging people to not

277
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,639
gorilla garden

278
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,959
you know uh irregular

279
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,679
sexed seeds because it's kind of

280
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,799
dangerous

281
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:08,559
for everybody it really is you know you

282
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,838
can't imagine a worse punch in the

283
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,079
stomach than

284
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,839
to have that small outdoor grow that you

285
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,759
put all that time and energy into

286
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,160
uh you know in your backyard in oregon

287
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,120
it's for plants

288
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,278
you know you get to the end of the

289
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,080
season and and your plants are finishing

290
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,200
up and you realize

291
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,920
oh no there's there's seed in all of

292
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,839
this you know

293
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,120
you basically lose you know three to

294
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,120
four months of your life and all that

295
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,720
time and energy you put into it

296
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,278
um it you know it's a in a way it's a

297
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,959
lot like

298
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,120
legalization you know at the very

299
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,159
beginning before there was any

300
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,519
uh any form of uh legal thc consumption

301
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,838
in the united states

302
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,879
at the state level uh you know a lot of

303
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,640
advocates would say

304
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,000
ah we just have to legalize it just

305
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,399
legalize it you know

306
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
and well yes that's true we need to

307
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,278
legalize it

308
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,480
uh the process of legalization once you

309
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,679
start to get into the

310
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,278
the weeds of policies and rules and

311
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,519
and how that gets implemented becomes

312
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,039
much much more complicated

313
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,120
i think the same thing is definitely

314
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,879
true in industrial hemp

315
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,360
we have a lot of folks that are big

316
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,600
advocates of hemp in general

317
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,800
who have constantly criticized some of

318
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,399
the farmers

319
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,479
over the last few years for growing you

320
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,360
know cbd or other cannabinoids

321
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,320
and not putting energy into uh you know

322
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,720
fiber crops

323
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,920
or grain crops and that type of stuff

324
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,000
and it's that same question

325
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,000
it's you know hemp can do these amazing

326
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,078
things however

327
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,679
how how can we make all of these

328
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,359
different uses coexist

329
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,639
peacefully and i think that's one of the

330
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,639
biggest challenges that we have in the

331
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,159
21st century of being able to adapt this

332
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,919
crop

333
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,278
both to the landscape into the the

334
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,679
social landscape

335
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,360
of being able to have people interact in

336
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,679
a way that's not going to be negative

337
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,720
for

338
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,799
either party we talked about that quite

339
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,639
a bit last time you were here about how

340
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,838
you know after your valley got

341
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,439
pollinated

342
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,120
um you know you tried to pull together

343
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,800
the local farmers

344
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,360
to create what what i called at the time

345
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,639
a pollen exclusion zone for lack of an

346
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,560
official term

347
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,720
and uh and you said that you know it was

348
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:13,679
actually really challenging because

349
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,759
um you know farmers are some of the most

350
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,319
independently minded

351
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,639
people that there are as similarly with

352
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,440
you know liberation-minded folks and to

353
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,720
kind of

354
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,120
pull people together to kind of agree to

355
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,040
not

356
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,399
do certain things on their property

357
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,078
there's a lot of pushback

358
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,440
and you know one of the things that

359
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,599
we're going to talk about today is is

360
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,800
why triploids are great and i think that

361
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,639
this is a this is going to be an

362
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,479
opportunity today where's where science

363
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,439
is going to make the politics of living

364
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,278
in your neighborhood

365
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,959
easier exactly exactly we had tried from

366
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,320
a policy perspective and from a social

367
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,359
perspective

368
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,839
to try to get people to engage and agree

369
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,560
and come together and it just it wasn't

370
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,480
possible

371
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:59,278
um but there's other ways

372
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,920
so so during the during the introduction

373
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:01,919
to the show

374
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,278
you know i mentioned vaguely what what

375
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,519
triploids are so people

376
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,879
knew what they were in for today but you

377
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,519
know since you are

378
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,799
you know deep into uh polyploidy science

379
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,759
um why don't you go ahead and give us

380
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:18,399
your definition of what a triploid is

381
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,958
yeah and i would uh first couch this and

382
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,600
say

383
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,838
uh the reason that we even have a ploity

384
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,120
breeding program here at oregon cbd is

385
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,440
uh because we hired

386
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,839
a recent phd shen chen

387
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,720
who is an absolute genius when it comes

388
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,480
to

389
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,560
both plant breeding and for the the

390
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,600
manipulation of ploiety

391
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,039
so he's really the one that is uh is

392
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,360
the driving force behind this at our

393
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,000
company um so dr shen chen

394
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,879
and brandon rojas who who works with dr

395
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,200
chen

396
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,159
um are really the really the

397
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,879
intellectual

398
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,879
uh weight behind this project um so i'm

399
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:58,559
i'm just basically the uh

400
00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:01,600
the communicator of general science

401
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,599
so triploids are so cannabis is

402
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,879
traditionally a diploid species which

403
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,600
means that it has

404
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,320
uh two sets of homologous chromosomes it

405
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,360
inherits

406
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,240
one set from uh one parent and the other

407
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
set from

408
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,399
its other parent uh unless it's a

409
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,278
self-pollinated plant in which case it

410
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,519
is inheriting

411
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,399
from that that previous uh just from

412
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,399
that initial parent

413
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,159
so two copies of chromosomes are great

414
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,278
it gives you you know the opportunity if

415
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,078
you have

416
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,360
say one bad gene or two good genes to be

417
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,759
able to

418
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,879
you know basically have a fully

419
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,720
functional plant

420
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,519
or a plant that ends up expressing

421
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,480
things in a in a really profound way

422
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,320
triploids are plants that have three

423
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,639
sets of homologous chromosomes

424
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,000
which uh you know if two sets are are

425
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,600
good three sets ought to be

426
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,159
really really good but

427
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,519
to get to that point you have to have uh

428
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,519
tetraploid plants

429
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,198
so tetraploid would be a plant that has

430
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,560
four homologous sets of these

431
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,519
chromosomes

432
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,399
so what i just described is diploid

433
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,600
triploid

434
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,000
tetraploid uh you can continue going up

435
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,959
the the polyploid scale and having more

436
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,600
and more sets of homologous chromosomes

437
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,479
however as you as you start to increase

438
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,680
those numbers

439
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,519
there tends to be uh uh

440
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,519
basically a dropping off of the positive

441
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,560
impacts and an increase of some of the

442
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,480
negative impacts

443
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,319
so one of the challenges in employee

444
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,600
bringing polity breeding

445
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,839
is to identify at what level of ploity

446
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,000
does this particular species end up

447
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,199
having its maximum expression of health

448
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,958
vigor vitality etc

449
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:45,599
so um so the fact that these uh triploid

450
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,479
plants were kind of like superhero

451
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,600
plants with the

452
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,759
this extra chromosome really um

453
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,800
struck me you know i understood right

454
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,958
off the bat

455
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,958
that a you know that a triploid was not

456
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,958
going to reproduce right and

457
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,879
therefore you know it was not going to

458
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,638
be impacted by pollen

459
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,320
and i'm like you know cool seth that's

460
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,399
that's a great thing but then as i

461
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,480
research the scientific papers

462
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,839
preparing for the interview today i'm

463
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,680
all like oh my gosh

464
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,800
the list of um increased

465
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,439
benefits to plants from triploid

466
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,000
it's it's really astonishing so so here

467
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
here's a

468
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,519
short list of what i've picked up from

469
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,319
the science um

470
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,360
uh pest and disease resistance stem

471
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,440
straightness

472
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,759
increases in chloroplast number which

473
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,079
results in strengthening

474
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,759
photosynthesis flowers of

475
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,599
aaa plants are generally larger and more

476
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,560
colorful than those of their diploid

477
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,278
counterparts

478
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,958
because the energy is devoted to instead

479
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,198
of seed formation is used for

480
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,000
flowers and other organs height and

481
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,159
yield

482
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,360
so i mean my god it sounds like by

483
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,679
adding this

484
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,639
third set of chromosomes that you're

485
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,239
creating these super plants it's exactly

486
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,560
true

487
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,079
and really what it comes down to it

488
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,319
it's a little bit more complicated than

489
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,439
that um in the sense that

490
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,519
all of these things that you're saying

491
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,160
are 100 percent true but um

492
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,159
the the challenge for us has been to

493
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,039
identify which combinations

494
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,719
of genes uh will result in the

495
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,838
attainment of all of those wonderful

496
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,240
attributes um what we have seen is that

497
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,720
in the same way that you can you know

498
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,440
take a specific combination and create

499
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,440
incredible triploid plants you can also

500
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,000
get the wrong combination of genes and

501
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,800
create a plant that is

502
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,120
i would say less than a diploid in terms

503
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,559
of

504
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,078
its ability to be very successful in any

505
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,719
given environment

506
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,120
so the real challenge this summer has

507
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,040
been

508
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,320
doing field trials to identify which of

509
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,799
those crossing patterns are going to

510
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,519
give you the best results

511
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,439
wow that that you just put the my whole

512
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,399
idea on its end because so so

513
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,199
so technically you could get all of

514
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,240
these

515
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:04,159
um you know good variables in the plant

516
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,160
but but you also could uh breed

517
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,519
something that's especially bad it kind

518
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,798
of reminds me of like

519
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,639
you know maybe with your earlier

520
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,480
breeding product projects you were

521
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,959
trying to solve a rubik's cube

522
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,798
but now it's a cube like with like 10

523
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,078
rows instead of just three rows or

524
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,599
something like that

525
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:25,038
uh you're spot on with the metaphor

526
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,879
uh as you as you increase the polity you

527
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,240
begin to increase the complexity of what

528
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,799
you're dealing with

529
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,000
um and you know with a with a plant that

530
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:35,279
is as complicated

531
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,919
as cannabis uh and up until very

532
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,440
recently

533
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,200
so little known about the underlying

534
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,440
genomics uh

535
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,038
it was in a lot of ways a guessing game

536
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,160
and to be perfectly honest going into

537
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,720
this summer

538
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,600
we we had ideas about what could work

539
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,160
and uh

540
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,879
what should work and you know some of

541
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,200
those did

542
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,640
definitely have have panned out already

543
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,200
um but others have been

544
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,480
huge huge surprises and we basically had

545
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,720
to go back to

546
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,000
the underlying data that we're able to

547
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,960
luckily in-house

548
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,240
generate using our whole genome sequence

549
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,840
equipment

550
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,079
to produce these these really high

551
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,639
resolution genomes

552
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,439
we can basically figure out you know

553
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,240
you've got

554
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,000
gene a and gene b we've got two copies

555
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,480
of gene a and one copy of gene b

556
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,640
and you end up with a plant that is uh

557
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,640
12 inches tall when it finishes

558
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,559
if you get one copy of gene a and two

559
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,320
copies of gene b

560
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:30,399
the the inverse happens and you end up

561
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,879
with a five foot tall autoflower plant

562
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,640
that's

563
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,280
you know yielding two and a half pounds

564
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,600
of 20 cbda flowers

565
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,639
um so it's it's really really important

566
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,918
to be able to get those

567
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,480
those proper combinations mapped out

568
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,600
what what is the tool that you use

569
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,079
to figure out the percentages

570
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,439
of variability for all these traits

571
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,399
showing up because

572
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,840
you know i'm i'm imagining that triploid

573
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,880
kind of like

574
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,240
makes breeding uh squares cry you know

575
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,799
where you're figuring out what what

576
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,319
traits are going to be passed on right

577
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,639
i would imagine that triploids makes

578
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:09,359
that very complex and at some point

579
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,080
you want to you know just dump all of

580
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,879
these data

581
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,599
points into a computer and say okay

582
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,960
figure out

583
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:19,439
of these uh of these genetics

584
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,679
which ones are expressing which how many

585
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,919
of them we have that are advantageous

586
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,440
and which of these parents we actually

587
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,559
want to bring together

588
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,960
to to secure the most

589
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:33,038
most of the traits what we want is that

590
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,880
is that simply dropping it into a

591
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,720
database or what it what is the tool

592
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,200
that you use to help move you ahead on

593
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,640
that

594
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,480
when the variability is so

595
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,320
mathematically high

596
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,839
uh two two things and you know i'm

597
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,119
coming from my

598
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,279
we've talked about this before but my

599
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,639
phd is in sociology and one of the

600
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,279
things that we have to do in

601
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,160
sociology is take very disparate amounts

602
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,160
of data

603
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,320
to try to explain a particular social

604
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,600
outcome and in those situations you end

605
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,038
up explaining

606
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,879
you'll come up with a list of variables

607
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:01,440
that are you know eight to ten really

608
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,600
really

609
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,558
explanatory of variables have a big

610
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,719
impact

611
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,558
on your on your final outcome and

612
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,240
they'll end up explaining

613
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,918
you know if you're lucky thirty to forty

614
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,679
percent of the total variation within

615
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,640
any given population for any given

616
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,798
question

617
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,400
uh i think the same thing is pretty

618
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,879
accurate when it comes to this

619
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,798
particular crop we're dealing with

620
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,640
in a diploid plant you're dealing with

621
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,918
over roughly 30

622
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,480
000 different genes that are in the

623
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,919
plant

624
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,880
and you have to deal with you know

625
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,120
different alleles and different

626
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,960
combinations of those in crosses

627
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,798
that obviously is going to increase to

628
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,759
about 45 000 when you have

629
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,558
a triploid plant so that the tools that

630
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:42,558
we use

631
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,558
uh you know the whole genome sequence

632
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,558
data is is really useful

633
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,158
um but at the same time we're also

634
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,440
basically in discovery mode

635
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,360
trying to figure out what each one of

636
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,759
those genes are and

637
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,399
what they actually do in the plant

638
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,400
chemical data is also really useful

639
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,480
so we're using genomic data chemotype

640
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,480
data and then

641
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,159
you know that the the last leg of this

642
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,720
and triangulating

643
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,480
which crosses work the best is just make

644
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,558
the crosses and grow them in the field

645
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,240
uh it's your phenotype data

646
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:17,519
so for us i think we can kind of

647
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,960
we can create a broad a broad stroke

648
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,558
broad outline of what

649
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,480
could come out of a cross based on the

650
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:24,240
underlying genomics and we have a really

651
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,599
good idea of what the chemical data is

652
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
going to look like based on that

653
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,439
underlying

654
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,519
those underlying genes but the actual

655
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,080
things that mean the most to us

656
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,440
outside of of chemicals the the vigor

657
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,678
the flowering time

658
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,720
the uh the ability to deal with with

659
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,080
plant stresses

660
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,600
and uh you know drought disease pressure

661
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,960
etc those things really only show up

662
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,319
when you're in the field

663
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,960
and it's field trials and growing them

664
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,079
out and

665
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,840
and just visually taking a look at

666
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,558
each combination seems to be the best

667
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:00,639
approach but

668
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:01,678
you can't do you really can't do modern

669
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,759
breeding without

670
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,038
all three if you're not using all three

671
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,679
you're really just kind of swinging in

672
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:07,519
the dark

673
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,038
right on it probably also keeps you a

674
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:10,720
better balanced person instead of

675
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:14,400
keeping you in the lab you have to put

676
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,600
on your boots and go out into the field

677
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,559
exactly well i mean that's where you

678
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,158
want to be in the first place so it's

679
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:21,599
what an excuse you know one of the

680
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,720
things that um

681
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,319
is of remark in in the state of the

682
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,400
of the science right now is you know

683
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,359
with you trying to like

684
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,000
um you know activate these different um

685
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:36,959
parts of the genome to see what they do

686
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,720
it it's it's as if we're still at a

687
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,960
state of science where there's still

688
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,400
some intuition involved

689
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,159
whereas a lot of other plant species

690
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,280
where triploids are very common

691
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,480
and everything's become very mechanized

692
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,200
and just kicking out

693
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,079
seeds you know that that science has

694
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,960
already settled

695
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,558
whereas the cannabis genome is still so

696
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,279
tasty and fresh

697
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,798
that that yeah you've you've got your

698
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,599
analytical equipment

699
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,720
that that helps you quantify what's

700
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,719
happening

701
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,480
but really since we're talking about

702
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,720
real world

703
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:17,120
expressions that mean a lot in the field

704
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,839
it really takes for you to go out walk

705
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,399
the plants

706
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,519
see the ones that you know strike your

707
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,440
fancy

708
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,839
touch them feel them smell them and then

709
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,159
go back to the lab with that information

710
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,839
and um i you know i like the idea that

711
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:35,120
there's still some analog

712
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:36,720
left in this kind of breeding oh it's uh

713
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,959
once you're once you're able to kind of

714
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,720
nail down the the science side of it and

715
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,480
you have a good data collection

716
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,839
process going from the genomic side from

717
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,400
the chemical side

718
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,038
uh and even on the phenotype side there

719
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,200
really is an

720
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,720
art to to the selection process there

721
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,360
always has been i think there always

722
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,679
will be

723
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,879
um you know and this is true in any type

724
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,559
of breeding program

725
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,799
we're uh we're in close contact with a

726
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:00,960
lot of the folks at the usda ars

727
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,319
here in uh in corvallis and at the

728
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,278
university at oregon state

729
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,960
um because we're part of this larger

730
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:10,000
plant breeding community at this point

731
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,079
now that there's some uh

732
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,679
some acknowledgement that you know this

733
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,119
is a legitimate industry and it is

734
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,120
having a big impact on oregon

735
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,599
agriculture and and farms across the

736
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,918
country um

737
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,879
at the end of the day there's always

738
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,880
going to be art

739
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,960
involved you know this you want to you

740
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,960
know take berries for instance you know

741
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,240
you want a blackberry that has you know

742
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,000
the right sugar content

743
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,839
and the right harvest harvestability and

744
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,440
you know all the all the right variables

745
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:38,558
all the boxes get ticked

746
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,000
but at the same time you also as a as a

747
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,000
human you have a

748
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,200
if you have a fairly developed pallet

749
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,880
you can pick

750
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,720
you know and discern between a berry

751
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,720
that has just the right amount of

752
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,759
sweetness versus a berry that's say

753
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,038
overly sweet or under sweet or whatever

754
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,158
it happens to be

755
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,599
and i think that's where the beauty is

756
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,278
at because everybody has

757
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,199
it everybody has a different

758
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,119
interpretation of what that

759
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,038
that ultimate is going to be what that

760
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,759
perfect version is going to be

761
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,278
and it it leads to all of these

762
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,879
different spaces being available for

763
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,200
different breeders to to come in and

764
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,679
sort of make their mark

765
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,798
so um before we go to the first

766
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,640
commercial break because i think we're

767
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,319
all excited about set two

768
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,840
where we're actually going to talk about

769
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,038
you know the science and how they are

770
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:27,278
uh triploids are actually made since

771
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:29,440
this topic today is actually triploids

772
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,079
and not like a profile of your company

773
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,440
you know can you is there anybody else

774
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,240
in the cannabis industry

775
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,519
who is uh working on triploids that we

776
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,839
want to give a nod to

777
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,038
is also you know being a leader in this

778
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,599
area

779
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,679
uh not commercially at this point um

780
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:47,119
however we are working with uh the

781
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,798
university of connecticut

782
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,239
uh just as a sort of an informal

783
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,679
research relationship

784
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,159
um i believe we're a little further

785
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,440
along uh in our process and our breeding

786
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,320
program than they are

787
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,000
however they are definitely definitely

788
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,879
involved in doing some really really

789
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,919
cool work

790
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,520
uh there there's uh

791
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,880
uh it's jessica level brand i believe is

792
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,720
the professor there

793
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,720
her and her husband and then uh there's

794
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,720
two or three graduate students who are

795
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,440
working on projects

796
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,038
they're doing some really cool stuff and

797
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,480
there's also some folks at oregon state

798
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:22,000
university that are working on this as

799
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,200
well

800
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,200
but in in terms of uh commercial uh

801
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,480
adaptation of triploids and being able

802
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,480
to release them i'm i'm

803
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,000
confident that we're the only ones uh

804
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,558
right now in the world that will be

805
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,519
releasing

806
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,639
uh triploids for 2021. man you're gonna

807
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,519
be making a lot more

808
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,799
uh commercial seed buyers cry just like

809
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:44,879
when you brought out your

810
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:46,798
auto flowering cbd seeds or they so

811
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,960
the goal it's the goal every year you

812
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,558
have to get better uh you know if you're

813
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,360
not getting better at what you're doing

814
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:53,119
then

815
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,399
there's you know i think it's

816
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,079
questionable whether or not there's room

817
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,480
for you in the space

818
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,678
right on so uh we will start talking

819
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,480
about how these uh

820
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,000
seeds are made after the break um we are

821
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,919
going to take that short break now

822
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,159
you are listening to shaping fire and my

823
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,360
guest today is socioecologist

824
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,440
seth crawford if you listen to shaping

825
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,119
fire and you grow your own cannabis

826
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,278
chances are high that you are very

827
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,398
particular about the inputs you use for

828
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:20,480
growing

829
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,879
people like us painstakingly

830
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,599
self-educate on cannabis nutrients and

831
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,320
techniques

832
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,480
so we can cultivate the best tasting and

833
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,000
cleanest flowers possible

834
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,919
and when we go to purchase those

835
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,240
nutrients we want to be sure that our

836
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,880
supplier shares our values and is

837
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,519
providing

838
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,679
exceptional quality this is why i

839
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,879
recommend

840
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,399
buildasoil.com to my friends who care

841
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,278
about quality

842
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,639
build a soil empowers organic growers to

843
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:49,119
do their best work

844
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,440
by sourcing and shipping only the finest

845
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:55,038
cannabis growing supplies

846
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,159
from organic inputs soils soil testing

847
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:59,038
and pots

848
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,399

build a soil founder jeremy silva

doesn't just stock his store with what's

852
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,639
available

853
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,759
he goes deep to personally vet each

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,600
product for quality

855
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,359
and determine that there isn't a better

856
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,480
version of the product that he could be

857

selling

858
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,079

881
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,158
while i love growing under the sun

882
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:06,798
there's a lot of good reasons to grow

883
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,720
indoors

884
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:10,558
and if you're like most folks you want a

885
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,480
lighting source that grows high yielding

886
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,319
healthy plants without using excessive

887
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,319
amounts of electricity

888
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,359
bios lighting creates biological

889
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:19,038
lighting solutions

890
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,599
that brings the natural brilliance of

891
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,599
the outdoors into your grow room

892
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,278
bios lighting has the attributes that i

893
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,240
look for in a horticultural lighting

894
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,159
solution

895
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,679
i've bought those cheap lights online

896
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,120
and they're difficult to work with and

897
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,080
fail in no time

898
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:36,158
in contrast my bios led light is

899
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,359
industrial grade to last a long time

900
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,880
it is ip66 wet rated so little foliar

901
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:42,719
overspray won't harm it

902
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,720
it is easy to clean without taking it

903
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,278
down and of course the most important

904
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,600
aspect

905
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:49,679
it is built for the exact light spectrum

906
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:50,959
i want for great yielding healthy

907
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,320
cannabis plants

908
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,558
and it doesn't hurt that their lighting

909
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,798
rigs look badass too

910
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,398
many horticultural led lighting systems

911
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,398
are based on irrelevant performance

912
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,678
metrics and people love to argue online

913
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,599
about these numbers

914
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,919
i prefer to judge on par photon

915
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,678
efficiency and how happy my plants are

916
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,000
and the bios lights exceed my

917
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,320
expectations in these categories

918
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,640
bios lights have an optimized broad

919
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,759
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis

920
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,600
and plant growth

921
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,319
while also providing the ideal

922
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:22,719
conditions for superior par efficacy

923
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,000
and a comfortable visual experience i

924
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,558
also love their attentive and

925
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,880
over-educated customer service folks

926
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,798
bios starts with a team of biologists

927
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,600
before getting the electrical engineers

928
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:33,278
involved

929
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,599
they have studied how light impacts

930
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,278
cannabis plants and devised an overall

931
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,558
strategy that works

932
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,440

942
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,440
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

943
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,278
growing is so valued by farmers

944
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,360
is because the mycelium networks in the

945
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,159
soil remain established from year to

946
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,918
year

947
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,080
and we know these fungal networks are

948
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,240
essential because they are the nutrient

949
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,480
super highways that extend far and wide

950
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,880
in the substrate to feed your plants

951
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,480
the trouble with growing in new soils or

952
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,240
blended cocoa substrates

953
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,319
is that it takes most of the plant's

954
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,599
life just to create these mycelium

955
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,639
highways

956
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:28,959
dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

957
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,000
reduces that time and gets your plant

958
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,159
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

959
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,240
and it's three times the concentration

960
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,360
of the current leading brand in the u.s

961
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,278
at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal

962
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,119
species selected specifically for

cannabis cultivation

964
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:47,278
this new product called dinomyco is the

965
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,278
result of 30 years of research and

966
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,119
trials at the vulcani agriculture

967

research institute in israel

968
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,879
it has also been vigorously trialled by

969
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:56,719
cannabis and food growers

970
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,399
across the u.s since the product first

971
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,919
arrived here last year

972
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:01,918
you may have already even heard about

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,278
dynamico by its original name

974

states for the first time

977
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,278
i love using dinomico to both speed up

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,759
the growth of mycelium networks in the

979
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:18,079
soil but also as a biostimulant

980
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,919
to make clone cuttings more virile you

981

growing results and appreciate the

985
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:30,479
importance of an active root zone in

00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:33,960

shaping fire i am your host shango los

998
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,038
and our guest this week is

999
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,679
socioecologist

1000
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,798
seth crawford so seth we got everybody

1001
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,640
all excited about

1002
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,960
uh triploids during the first set

1003
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,880
because uh we're gonna make these uh

1004
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,200
you know these superhero uh chemovars

1005
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,240
that also can't be pollinated

1006
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,080
accidentally

1007
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,240
so of course the big question is how are

1008
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,720
they made and i know that there are

1009
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,599
people

1010
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,240
listening that are saying man f that gmo

1011
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,599
stuff

1012
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,399
and so let's start there by being really

1013
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,918
clear

1014
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:34,239
that this is not genetically modified

1015
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,440
organisms so would you go ahead and make

1016
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,120
a clarification

1017
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,720
on the science so that people can be

1018
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:42,079
really clear that this is actually

1019
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,400
nature these are not genetically

1020
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:46,240
modified organisms

1021
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,480
[Laughter]

1022
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,399
uh yeah this is it's actually something

1023
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,519
that does spontaneously happen

1024
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:55,199
in nature on its own and when you maybe

1025
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,720
step back and and take a look at some of

1026
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,038
the most successful

1027
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,519
invasive weeds that have propagated

1028
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,839
across the country across the world

1029
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,120
many of them are tetraploids because of

1030
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,119
all of those previous

1031
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,559
uh evolutionary advantages that we were

1032
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,480
talking about before

1033
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,159
in terms of you know vigor and and

1034
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,280
chloroplast count and

1035
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,320
efficiency of using resources um so it's

1036
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,119
something that

1037
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,960
you know in the long span of history

1038
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,119
happens regularly

1039
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,398
and has actually given rise to most of

1040
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,919
the uh

1041
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:27,598
the diploid species that we've seen

1042
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,000
today so

1043
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,000
what you end up seeing is a spontaneous

1044
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,800
transition to say a tetraploid

1045
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,519
and then sometime in the future uh

1046
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,679
you'll have a

1047
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:38,639
having again and you'll go back to to

1048
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,240
diploids

1049
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,919
and it's it's part of the reason that we

1050
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,918
see a lot of the diversity in

1051
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,118
in many different plant species is

1052
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,158
because of these sort of

1053
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,879
go to tetraploid go back to diploid over

1054
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:54,639
the over these long periods of time

1055
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:56,960
in our program we're taking plants

1056
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,400
that have been very specifically bred

1057
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,960
for characteristics

1058
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,400
that we felt were important and are part

1059
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,159
of our our

1060
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,000
previous diploid breeding program and

1061
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:08,879
now we're bringing in uh

1062
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,679
new what what were new characteristics

1063
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,079
of new traits

1064
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:12,879
in diploid form and then we're putting

1065
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,160
them through

1066
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,720
uh essentially a chemical transformation

1067
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,559
so we're taking a diploid plant and

1068
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:23,679
doubling its chromosomes

1069
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,679
uh not inserting anything new but taking

1070
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:26,239
what's there and literally just doubling

1071
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,960
it

1072
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:33,358
um using using chemicals in vitro

1073
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,240
and then having to grow those plants out

1074
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,679
repeatedly

1075
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:40,319
take cuttings grow them out again

1076
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,838
take cuttings grow them out again and at

1077
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,240
every single one of these

1078
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,920
stages it's anywhere between six to

1079
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:47,519
eight months to make this this happen

1080
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,519
from start to finish

1081
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,759
we have to test every single one of

1082
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,480
those plants with a flow cytometer which

1083
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,280
is a

1084
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,719
very fancy piece of science equipment

1085
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,880
that is able to

1086
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,879
tell you the size of the underlying

1087
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,920
genome of the plant that you're looking

1088
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,680
at

1089
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,240
so we're having the screen to make sure

1090
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,440
that these formerly diploid plants have

1091
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:11,039
been successfully

1092
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,400
transitioned to tetraploids

1093
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,719
you know one of the things i think it's

1094
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,000
important to point out is that you know

1095
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,919
while you use a lot of technology in

1096
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,280
this sort of breeding

1097
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,559
um you know the use of technology itself

1098
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,000
does not set it up for being gmo and the

1099
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,039
way i normally talk about it with

1100
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,400
patients is that

1101
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,800
it's kind of the difference between

1102
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,599
technology between a magnifying glass

1103
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,880
and a scalpel you know when it comes to

1104
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,280
a magnifying glass

1105
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,880
you're you're looking what is there and

1106
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,160
then with a scalpel you are

1107
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,400
cutting and rearranging and and all of

1108
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,000
your technology that you're using is

1109
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,119
essentially different forms of a

1110
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,440
magnifying glass

1111
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,559
you are you are using analytics and

1112
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,838
testing

1113
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:58,880
and uh and gene mapping to see

1114
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:02,159
what there is so that you can have

1115
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,200
a better grasp of what's naturally

1116
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,920
in your plants so that when you have

1117
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,719
your plants

1118
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,480
naturally interact you get it right the

1119
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,399
first time-ish

1120
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,480
instead of kind of like just shooting

1121
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,280
from the hip without knowing what's in

1122
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,400
your

1123
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,040
um genetic makeup like most of us

1124
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,680
pollen chuckers do do you think that's a

1125
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,480
fair

1126
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,118
characterization most definitely yeah

1127
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,358
and uh

1128
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,240
the the magnifying glass versus scalpel

1129
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:29,920
is a good metaphor

1130
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,159
the the way that i usually describe it

1131
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,960
is uh it's we're reading rather than

1132
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,358
writing

1133
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,960
um so like our our pack bio sequel ii

1134
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:38,078
it's a whole genome sequencer that

1135
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,920
allows us to

1136
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:45,440
get every single a t g and c that

1137
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,599
makes up the entire basis

1138
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,720
of each one of these individual plants

1139
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,280
we're able to read

1140
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,679
all of those letters you know up to 100

1141
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,680
times

1142
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:59,519
to know with 100 close to 100 certainty

1143
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,079
99.99

1144
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,759
is where the accuracy is at now what is

1145
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,480
actually in those

1146
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,800
and in the case of these tetraploids you

1147
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,199
can

1148
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,880
liken it to a copy machine so rather

1149
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,239
than you know making some sort of big

1150
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,000
edits and changing things

1151
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,639
we're taking what's already there and

1152
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,400
just making an additional copy of it

1153
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:20,078
and that's like i said before that's

1154
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,760
kind of where we get into the

1155
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,920
you know that the nitty-gritty is being

1156
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,760
able to figure out which of those

1157
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,838
which of those genes are good which of

1158
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,040
those genes you know when combined with

1159
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:33,199
themselves again end up being bad uh and

1160
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,320
which of the more importantly which of

1161
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,879
the plants

1162
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,599
uh in these crosses which one do you

1163
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,599
want to have

1164
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,280
two copies of the genome versus which

1165
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,960
one do you want to have just one copy

1166
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,320
uh on the triplet crosses so this this

1167
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,800
this next question is probably going to

1168
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,680
be dry for some folks but i know that

1169
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,519
there are

1170
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,279
serious breeders listening who are

1171
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:55,440
really going to be grateful that we took

1172
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,359
this extra step down this path and this

1173
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,039
is what i'd like you to do if you would

1174
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:00,799
you know since you're talking to me that

1175
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,279
since you're saying that each of these

1176
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,039
cycles and trying to find you know tease

1177
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,800
out the attributes you want take you

1178
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:10,559
know six to eight months

1179
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,920
would you just give us um a timeline of

1180
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,960
milestones

1181
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,920
on the creation of a of a triploid

1182
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,280
kimovar

1183
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,960
like and what i'm imagining is you're

1184
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,960
like okay we start with this

1185
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,119
and then we do this and then we do this

1186
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,119
a few times and then we end up with this

1187
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,240
just because i know that the breeders

1188
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,559
want to be able to

1189
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,559
picture the process in their heads so

1190
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,159
they can wrap their heads around it

1191
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:34,000
so would you would you go through that

1192
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:37,199
process for us

1193
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,480
yeah so we release f1s which means that

1194
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:42,319
you have to have two

1195
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,719
independently developed highly inbred

1196
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,240
parents one is a pollen donor one is a

1197
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:49,279
pollen recipient

1198
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:50,639
uh those just getting to the point where

1199
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,000
you have developed

1200
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:56,239
the two parent lines is you know roughly

1201
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,960
a three year process

1202
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,439
and i have explained it elsewhere um

1203
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,280
over the

1204
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,119
over the years but it's you know you

1205
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,040
find a you find a cross that you really

1206
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,640
like it has the attributes that you want

1207
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,559
you inbreed that plant you take the

1208
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,960
seeds off you grow those out you test

1209
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:11,599
them

1210
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,679
you find the best one uh you grow that

1211
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,440
out you self-pollinate

1212
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,279
over and over and over as many times as

1213
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,000
you possibly can to lock in

1214
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,599
all of the traits that are you know

1215
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,159
exactly what you're looking for in terms

1216
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,240
of stabilization with that one variety

1217
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:27,199
simultaneously you're doing exactly the

1218
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:29,679
same process

1219
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,960
with a separate line uh inbreeding

1220
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:34,078
inbreeding

1221
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,039
inbreeding etc doing your selections at

1222
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,960
the end of all this

1223
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,039
you know four to five generations down

1224
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,079
the road then you can actually bring

1225
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,279
them back together

1226
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,359
and create your f1 so you pollinate one

1227
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,720
highly inbred line with another highly

1228
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:48,960
inbred line

1229
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,639
that results in seeds that would

1230
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,480
actually go into the farmer's hands and

1231
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:55,759
go into their fields that

1232
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,639
rather than being highly inbred they're

1233
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,960
they're very heterozygous which gives

1234
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:01,118
them

1235
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,960
hybrid vigor and allows them to thrive

1236
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,280
in a field

1237
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,880
that's a that's a three-year process

1238
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,119
when you add the

1239
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,640
when you add tetraploids to the mix to

1240
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,200
make a triploid f1

1241
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:14,639
you basically take you have to choose

1242
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:16,078
and this is the important part choose

1243
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,199
which one of those parents you want to

1244
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,920
have

1245
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:21,519
the the two copies uh donated to your

1246
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,800
your triploid

1247
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:26,880
um identify which of those

1248
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,720
you want and then go through the process

1249
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,920
of chemically transforming

1250
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:35,118
uh those plants and we do that basically

1251
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,760
from uh from cuttings and you have to

1252
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,318
have

1253
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,359
hundreds of those cuttings treat them

1254
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:41,679
with the chemical

1255
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,920
most of them are going to die a handful

1256
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:47,199
of them will survive and those survivors

1257
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,559
end up being the the tetraploids that

1258
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,358
then get

1259
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,639
cuttings taken off of them tested again

1260
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,679
grown out

1261
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:58,480
cuttings taken off of them again tested

1262
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,838
grown out and then they become if they

1263
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,119
pass all of those tests and remain

1264
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:04,400
tetraploids then those plants will end

1265
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,079
up going into our

1266
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,920
our production environments to make the

1267
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,400
triploid seed so

1268
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,280
you're really looking at what used to be

1269
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,519
if you were really

1270
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,040
if you were really pushing uh and and

1271
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:15,599
doing your hybridization programs

1272
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:17,119
quickly

1273
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,720
and still giving yourself a year to do

1274
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,838
field trials it's about a three year

1275
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,959
process

1276
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:24,318
now we're looking at closer to four four

1277
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,318
and a half years

1278
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,480
from the time that we start a project

1279
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:29,599
until we can we can get seed into a

1280
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,719
farmer's hands

1281
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,599
as a triploid f1 well i like the

1282
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,559
compactness

1283
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,318
of that explanation it's always nice to

1284
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,799
interview somebody who was formerly a

1285
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:44,079
professor

1286
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,720
my question for you though is if

1287
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,640
if did so you started this project like

1288
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:51,199
five years ago

1289
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:52,000
uh so the inbreeding to get to the point

1290
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:54,399
where we had the

1291
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,838
the diploid parents uh you know we've

1292
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,838
been working on that this this whole

1293
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,838
time

1294
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:02,318
um basically where we're at right now is

1295
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,078
we can we can take any of these parents

1296
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:05,599
that we've developed over the years

1297
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,920
and we're continually developing

1298
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,880
obviously new parents uh so like

1299
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,119
this upcoming year we're releasing cbdv

1300
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,200
dominant plants and cbgv

1301
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,720
dominant plants so new compounds all

1302
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:18,480
together that allow

1303
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,799
industrial hemp farmers to meet the

1304
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,000
super stringent usda enforced

1305
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,880
0.3 thc limit uh even at

1306
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,039
harvest so uh it's basically a fairly

1307
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,720
revolutionary development for farmers

1308
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,318
um so we've got these plants hold on a

1309
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:33,679
second we need to stop there for a

1310
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,239
second you know

1311
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,118
all of these growers whose chins just

1312
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,358
dropped

1313
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,119
what you just said is like a bombshell

1314
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:42,400
we've got two brand new novel

1315
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,440
cannabinoids

1316
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:49,440
that that don't test hot at

1317
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,119
um at harvest

1318
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,960
correct that's a that's a pretty big

1319
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,680
deal to just slide on through

1320
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,440
so yeah it's kind of it's kind of big um

1321
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:59,039
and it's not just like one variety

1322
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,280
we we've spent the last three years

1323
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:05,838
working to completely

1324
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,280
uh remake our entire library so

1325
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:09,119
all the varieties that we've released

1326
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,000
over the last couple years super haze

1327
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,318
special sauce

1328
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,679
lifter etc etc those have all been

1329
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:16,880
converted into these

1330
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:21,358
varen rich triploid forms

1331
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:25,358
so we're releasing uh fully compliant

1332
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,759
uh fully infertile uh female flowers so

1333
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,960
this is

1334
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,520
veren rich triploid varieties for 2021.

1335
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,119
that's uh very exciting all right so i

1336
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:35,280
uh so i interrupted you but essentially

1337
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,559
you were saying that you can take any of

1338
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,760
these varieties

1339
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:39,440
um that you've been bringing in the

1340
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,200
market for the last few years do this

1341
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,000
dance remix on them

1342
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:45,679
and boom now they can be uh triploid and

1343
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,880
so you're you're taking stuff that

1344
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:50,559
you've already proven and and you know

1345
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,519
upgrading them essentially

1346
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,078
yeah that's exactly right exactly right

1347
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:55,759
so

1348
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,760
so one of the things that i found

1349
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,839
interesting is that you know

1350
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,200
when you're using these three sets of

1351
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,679
chromosomes

1352
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,439
um there are all of these attributes

1353
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:07,199
good and bad that are

1354
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,599
bouncing around that you're trying to

1355
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:12,879
get a a handle on

1356
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:16,000
um but a lot of these um are not good

1357
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,400
and they create imbalances you know uh

1358
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,599
like you know epigenetic changes and

1359
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,200
genome size

1360
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,359
and you know you know increase and

1361
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:28,000
decrease genomic diversity

1362
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:29,440
um what are some of the imbalances that

1363
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,719
you have seen

1364
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,599
are common in cannabis to come out when

1365
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:38,639
attempting to you know find a triploid

1366
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,640
that's in balance

1367
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,000
you know that the number one thing that

1368
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,039
we're seeing is

1369
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,880
uh you know that process of inbreeding

1370
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,880
while it does lock in very specific

1371
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,838
traits that you target

1372
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,720
it can also lock in uh deleterious

1373
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,318
alleles

1374
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:59,439
over time and what's really problematic

1375
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:01,599
is that you don't always see uh

1376
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,280
the full expression of the negativity

1377
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,079
that goes along with those particular

1378
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,960
genes

1379
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,119
when there's only two copies but they

1380
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,519
are coming out when there's three copies

1381
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,960
on a much more regular basis so you

1382
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,559
could have a variety that you know

1383
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,519
you've worked over a long period of time

1384
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:18,000
to stabilize

1385
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:19,679
and it seems to be you know hitting

1386
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,440
hitting all the marks that you want

1387
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,838
but as soon as you add one additional

1388
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:28,318
copy then everything goes haywire

1389
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:31,519
um basically it's just it's that that

1390
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:33,838
accumulation of of negative alleles uh

1391
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,039
over time now i could also see this

1392
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:38,400
being problematic

1393
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:40,400
uh we're we're very specific in

1394
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,000
uh flowering time it's something that

1395
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,720
we've been spending a lot

1396
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,800
of time on the on the genomic side and

1397
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:49,039
just in in terms of data collection

1398
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,640
being able to catalog every possible

1399
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,239
permutation that is

1400
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:53,759
that's out there with these different

1401
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:56,078
flower time genes

1402
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,839
and flower response genes that all end

1403
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,318
up working in concert together

1404
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:02,799
to end up forcing a plant to go into

1405
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:05,358
flower at particular times

1406
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,240
what's really problematic with triploids

1407
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:09,119
is that if you get

1408
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:11,439
say two copies of you know for example

1409
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:15,200
uh uh

1410
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,838
the gene set that goes along with say

1411
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,799
a haze plant you know an old haze that

1412
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:21,838
is

1413
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,480
uh equatorial in origin

1414
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,039
two copies of that will even when you

1415
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,838
have

1416
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:29,440
say a copy of an autoflower gene also

1417
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:31,279
you're going to end up with a plant that

1418
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,679
doesn't finish flowering until

1419
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,119
december right so it's understanding

1420
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:37,199
which combinations

1421
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:40,079
end up leading to the results that you

1422
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:42,159
want and for us right now that is

1423
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,839
identifying different flowering genes

1424
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,558
that allow you to have staggered

1425
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:46,880
harvests

1426
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,559
from say early august all the way

1427
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,358
through the end of october depending on

1428
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:53,280
the the bioregion that you're in

1429
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,358
really being able to nail that down is

1430
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,000
is critical but it's also probably one

1431
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:58,639
of the most

1432
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,559
uh problematic areas i think where it

1433
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,239
will be a problematic area as folks get

1434
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,280
into triploid breeding uh just

1435
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:05,118
understanding what those

1436
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,720
those genes are and how those gene

1437
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,599
networks interact when you increase

1438
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:09,039
plating

1439
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,480
and when you're using this at a

1440
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:12,239
commercial level and you're using

1441
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,199
thousands of seeds that becomes really

1442
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:15,039
important

1443
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:16,639
for the simple reason if you think about

1444
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:18,960
succession planting

1445
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,159
in your home garden your food garden you

1446
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,960
know we're

1447
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:23,838
we're planting you know lettuces and

1448
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,240
things that grow

1449
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:27,759
quickly you know sometimes once a week

1450
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:30,078
maybe every other week

1451
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,680
and the idea is that so you get lettuce

1452
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,000
all through the summer and you don't

1453
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:36,960
just get a hell of a lot of lettuce

1454
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,559
just one week right and and for a lot of

1455
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,960
commercial folks

1456
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,920
they don't want to have to harvest all

1457
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,800
of their

1458
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,400
acreage all at the same time and so

1459
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,599
they'll plant some and then a little

1460
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,000
longer later they'll

1461
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,200
plant some more but but that kind of

1462
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
succession planting

1463
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,399
only really works if you if those seeds

1464
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,880
are

1465
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,079
locked in to go from germination to

1466
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,880
being finished in

1467
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,280
in a set number of days say 90 days so

1468
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,559
that

1469
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,680
so that if you if you sow seeds a week

1470
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,640
apart you know

1471
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:09,598
that they'll be ready to harvest a week

1472
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:12,239
apart

1473
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,880
and uh so i can imagine that is probably

1474
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:14,799
why you

1475
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,720
you know you put so much focus on that

1476
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,400
because if that doesn't work then this

1477
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:20,078
doesn't work at scale

1478
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,358
that's exactly right and you know when

1479
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,800
you're when you're talking about

1480
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:25,679
non-psychoactive cannabis

1481
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,720
farming uh you really are talking about

1482
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:29,279
large scale

1483
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:30,000
um you know it's there are smaller farms

1484
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,599
and it's great we

1485
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,199
love them we we are doing everything

1486
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,559
that we can to support them but on the

1487
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:36,960
biomass side

1488
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,160
uh you know there there are really

1489
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,280
really large farms

1490
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,399
and as a plant breeder you're standing

1491
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,240
naked before the world

1492
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,000
when you've got a thousand a thousand

1493
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:48,318
acres of your seeds in a field

1494
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,719
you know and if there's any type of of

1495
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,440
hiccup in terms of that flower response

1496
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:52,959
time

1497
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,720
you're going to hear about it and the

1498
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,119
farmer is not going to be successful

1499
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:59,919
and for us if farmers aren't successful

1500
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:03,200
then then we haven't done our job

1501
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,720
and unsuccessful farmers are nasty so

1502
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:06,399
you don't you want to be real you want

1503
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:07,759
to make sure you do your job well

1504
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,440
so that they're not coming with

1505
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,640
pitchforks and uh

1506
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,838
and fire torches and such exactly we'll

1507
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:16,879
save that for the government

1508
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:18,639
yeah so um so let's talk a little bit

1509
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,920
more about some of the challenges

1510
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:25,358
um when making uh triploids so you know

1511
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,000
um alba albinos albinism is a pretty

1512
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:28,558
common

1513
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,599
when making triploids and that would be

1514
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,920
no chlorophyll

1515
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,760
and so those die pretty quickly because

1516
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,200
of a lack of photosynthesis

1517
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:39,040
are you seeing that pop up with working

1518
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,199
with the cannabis genome

1519
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:43,679
because it's entirely possible that

1520
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:47,199
albinism is more just common in other

1521
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:49,039
species you know we we do see that

1522
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:50,318
but uh we have not seen a heightened

1523
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:53,039
expression in triploids

1524
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:55,358
and that is that's the case even on uh

1525
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:58,239
say the poorly performing inbred

1526
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:59,598
varieties um it is not popped up now you

1527
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:02,000
know in a field of of

1528
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,920
you know hundreds of thousands of plants

1529
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,358
you're definitely going to see that and

1530
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,599
we we've seen it in certain crosses

1531
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:10,719
in field trials in previous years with

1532
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,838
diploids

1533
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,879
uh it's not a high frequency but it's

1534
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:17,838
definitely something to

1535
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,480
to to be concerned with um the flip side

1536
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:20,159
of that though

1537
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,000
i would say is that if you can lock that

1538
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,558
trade in some of those uh

1539
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,280
some of those plants that either have

1540
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,400
albino

1541
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,119
expressions or have uh uh

1542
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,358
significant extreme variegation or say

1543
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:36,880
even a belief shape change

1544
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:39,838
that is becoming very popular right now

1545
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,400
you can make those express in particular

1546
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:43,440
ways

1547
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,480
that would be fantastic for say like a

1548
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,639
home garden

1549
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,318
so there's there's challenges for

1550
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:51,358
large-scale field production for

1551
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:53,440
say cannabinoids or fiber or for food

1552
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,119
but there's also some i think some

1553
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,880
really unique opportunities

1554
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:01,119
from just a home gardening uh ornamental

1555
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,559
plant standpoint that we haven't seen

1556
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,559
with cannabis before which is

1557
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,880
kind of exciting well here's a

1558
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,160
non-sequitur for you so if you've had at

1559
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,640
least one or two

1560
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,239
albino cannabis plants through all your

1561
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:13,920
trials

1562
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:15,439
i would love for you to compare and

1563
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,639
contrast what you

1564
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:22,079
saw as an albino plant versus

1565
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:25,358
you know very often we will see indoor

1566
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:28,400
plants a photograph posted to

1567
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:31,119
instagram or similar and there's always

1568
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,680
the ensuing fight in the thread below

1569
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,358
arguing whether or not this is an albino

1570
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:37,440
plant or whether or not this is a plant

1571
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:40,719
that was bleached by being too

1572
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:44,240
close to a uh an led

1573
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:46,318
light and so visually i'm assuming

1574
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,039
you've seen these photos too so yeah so

1575
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:50,000
so

1576
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,400
compare that those those those stark

1577
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,480
white

1578
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,519
plants that we that were grown under

1579
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,639
leds

1580
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,719
is that how a cannabis albino

1581
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,639
presents itself because i know some

1582
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,519
species look more pink and some look

1583
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:03,598
more white

1584
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:04,960
i don't think that i can know

1585
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,760
scientifically

1586
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,280
true that i have seen an albino it's

1587
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,240
always been someone showing me

1588
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:15,359
a picture so so what does an albino

1589
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:19,598
cannabis plant actually present as

1590
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:22,078
uh what's really interesting is that it

1591
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,519
very rarely will it actually encompass

1592
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,079
the entire plant

1593
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:26,960
um more often than not you'll get a a

1594
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,839
you know a sport

1595
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,639
a side shoot uh or you know say a half

1596
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:32,719
of a

1597
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:34,318
the really interesting ones or the uh a

1598
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:37,118
shoot that half of the plant

1599
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:39,039
or excuse me half of the shoot is green

1600
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,720
and half of the chute is white

1601
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:42,639
those are pretty good examples partial

1602
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:43,598
partial albino-ism

1603
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:45,358
the ones that you're seeing on the

1604
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,200
internet uh you know if the top of the

1605
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:49,199
flower is you know a half an inch from

1606
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:49,919
the led and the only thing that's white

1607
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:52,159
on the plant

1608
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,519
is that bleached out spot a pretty good

1609
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:55,838
indication that it's

1610
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:58,000
it's uh from the light rather than

1611
00:53:55,838 --> 00:53:59,440
genetic abnormality

1612
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,519
one of the things that's really cool

1613
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,200
about uh especially the

1614
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,280
the variegated plants that have a

1615
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:08,318
tendency towards albinoism

1616
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,800
is uh two years ago we found a beautiful

1617
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:14,318
example of this in the field and

1618
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,640
eric in his infinite wisdom uh dug it up

1619
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:18,000
and you know i'm like what are you doing

1620
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:19,118
why are we spending this time to dig

1621
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,440
this plant up

1622
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,720
so he digs it up puts it in a pot and we

1623
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,519
took it back to our

1624
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,399
to our uh other farm and just stuck it

1625
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:28,318
in the shade

1626
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,838
that he had this idea that uh you know

1627
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:31,119
if you just take that plant get it out

1628
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:32,799
of the direct sun and put it in the

1629
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,800
shade it would actually start to

1630
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,039
put uh you know chlorophyll back into

1631
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,480
the leaves lo and behold that's exactly

1632
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,798
what happened

1633
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,760
so essentially what you've got is a

1634
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:44,480
plant that

1635
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,559
thrives in shade grown conditions rather

1636
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,838
than a plant that's thriving in these

1637
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:51,680
high intensity you know solar radiation

1638
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,279
in the in the field

1639
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:54,960
just really really interesting i think

1640
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,280
it it lends itself

1641
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,159
to the explanation of just how plastic

1642
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,640
this

1643
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:01,759
cannabis plant really is give it a

1644
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:04,239
different environment

1645
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,920
uh it would thrive but for you know

1646
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:07,358
field production it may not necessarily

1647
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,760
be the best case

1648
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:12,000
um kind of as a side note i've i have

1649
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,520
been really enjoying seeing all these

1650
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,599
um atypical morphologies of cannabis

1651
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:19,358
you know kind of have their heyday as

1652
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,200
there's more people breeding and more

1653
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:23,039
people being able to share and feeling

1654
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:25,919
free to share their photographs

1655
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:28,079
you know on instagram we're seeing lots

1656
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,400
more pictures of variegation

1657
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,680
and the ensuing argument about whether

1658
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,798
or not it's variegation

1659
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:36,078
or whether it's mosaic or something

1660
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:38,079
so there's there's a lot of that but

1661
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,599
it's it's cool to see people sharing

1662
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:42,318
pictures of

1663
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,760
variegated plants that historically we

1664
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:45,920
haven't been able to see

1665
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,559
because everybody is seeing these in

1666
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,400
hiding right during the prohibition days

1667
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,480
and um and that's really cool and then

1668
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,960
of course like the um

1669
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,760
the freak show plant that like has got

1670
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,599
everybody

1671
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,359
you know tantalized for the last couple

1672
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,519
years it you know it looks more like a

1673
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:03,440
tomato plant than like a cannabis plant

1674
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:05,119
and then of course the newly arrived

1675
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,159
australian bastard

1676
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:10,160
uh genetic line that that again looks

1677
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:13,279
like a you know a fern of some sort

1678
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:15,118
instead of a cannabis plant and and you

1679
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,119
know all these different morphologies

1680
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,200
it's um you know i never thought there

1681
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,760
was a thing and now there's these kind

1682
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,239
of

1683
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,920
you know interesting plants to grow and

1684
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:24,318
experiment with for people who just like

1685
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,880
love

1686
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:28,000
the cannabis plant itself you know you

1687
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,920
know at this point

1688
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,559
and and maybe never they will never be

1689
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:35,760
production level

1690
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,040
plants but i really like my freak show

1691
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,760
that's on my deck right now

1692
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,838
it looks super cool you know yeah and

1693
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,720
one that's the whole idea i think

1694
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:45,199
you know in in previous years if you're

1695
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:46,798
capped

1696
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:48,000
with you know a certain number of plants

1697
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:49,199
and you're going to obviously want to

1698
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,039
call the

1699
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:52,318
the individuals that are not going to

1700
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:53,679
give you what you need

1701
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:55,358
you know in most cases that was

1702
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:57,919
cannabinoids uh

1703
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,119
now everything is a little bit laxer and

1704
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,838
people are starting to look at the

1705
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,880
potential

1706
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,798
of not only you know the

1707
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,000
the medicine but also the food and the

1708
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:08,400
fiber and

1709
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,440
quite honestly the just the fundamental

1710
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,318
beauty of

1711
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,838
a unique you know a unique individual

1712
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:16,480
from a population

1713
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:18,000
um i mean there's the entire ornamental

1714
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,440
uh plant breeding industry is

1715
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,199
is built on that and i think we're going

1716
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,519
to probably start seeing ornamental

1717
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:25,039
cannabis plants in people's yards

1718
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:26,559
you may not be able to tell that it's a

1719
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:28,079
cannabis plant anymore but i think

1720
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,920
that's part of the fun and the beauty

1721
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,720
and the plasticity of this awesome

1722
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,720
species

1723
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:33,919
yeah i totally agree with that that is

1724
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:36,318
going to be nice too

1725
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,440
you know the to be able to grow the

1726
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:39,519
plant for

1727
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,480
you know the joy of gardening right

1728
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:42,719
instead of

1729
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,838
feeling like you have to do it in

1730
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:47,358
prohibition

1731
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:47,838
mindset you know yeah yeah so this next

1732
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:50,159
question

1733
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:51,599
i think to a certain degree i'm asking

1734
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:54,159
this next question just because i want

1735
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:56,960
to get this phrase into the show

1736
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:59,199
and so um there's this uh there's this

1737
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,920
uh

1738
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:02,798
this thing called mixoploid chimera

1739
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,760
right

1740
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:08,079
and so a mixoploid chimera happens

1741
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,760
sometimes when breeding triploids

1742
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,640
and and its definition is an

1743
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:15,920
inconsistent ploidy from one plant right

1744
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:16,558
and so in my mind i'm i'm picturing that

1745
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,358
like

1746
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,000
like in instead of the the breeding

1747
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:22,719
process

1748
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,440
kicking out all triploid seeds it's

1749
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:25,919
actually

1750
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,559
kicking out seeds that have got

1751
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,960
different

1752
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:32,559
numbers of genetics in them different

1753
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,000
different numbers of sets

1754
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:39,119
and so the resulting seed stock is going

1755
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,119
to be not ubiquit not

1756
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,280
uni comprehensively ubiquitous they

1757
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:48,318
won't be the same right

1758
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:50,559
so so how hard is it when you are

1759
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:51,519
ramping up the scale right after you've

1760
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,000
done this

1761
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,639
long arduous process that you've already

1762
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,239
um

1763
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:58,879
described to get the plant that you

1764
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:02,159
actually

1765
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:05,760
want how challenging is it to then

1766
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:09,759
make you know tens of thousands or more

1767
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:13,119
of of these triploid seeds that are all

1768
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,799
exactly the same so you get the success

1769
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,000
in the field

1770
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:18,239
uh that's a it's a great question um and

1771
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,318
it

1772
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:22,719
the answer comes down to just repeated

1773
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:24,960
testing um so even though you know we've

1774
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:26,959
as i described before you know you take

1775
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,559
a significant amount of time to test and

1776
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,079
test and test over and over using the

1777
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,760
flow cytometer

1778
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,119
to establish that you have tetraploids

1779
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,160
and you have diploids in your breeding

1780
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,880
population

1781
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:38,719
um you have to continue to do that and

1782
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,960
it gets even more complicated with what

1783
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:43,199
we're having to do for 2021 which is

1784
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,159
also you know making these these varan

1785
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:47,519
rich plants

1786
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:50,558
uh in the in the process it means that

1787
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:51,358
every single pollen donor that goes into

1788
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,519
one of our

1789
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,838
our uh our greenhouses has to be

1790
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:58,159
individually tested both for its ploiety

1791
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:00,159
and for its varan content to ensure that

1792
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:00,719
we've got everything that we're looking

1793
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:02,159
for

1794
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:05,039
in terms of being able to produce seeds

1795
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:06,480
that are and i wouldn't say 100 uniform

1796
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:09,119
on the seeds because there still is

1797
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,358
variability uh however

1798
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,760
they they are hitting all the marks for

1799
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,480
the traits that that we're interested in

1800
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,720
um

1801
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,920
what's kind of interesting is to to

1802
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:20,558
actually get to

1803
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,318
a plant that is a 100 percent uniform

1804
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,359
would require a different type of

1805
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:25,279
ploiety

1806
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:27,119
induction so rather than increasing the

1807
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,119
ploidy level you decrease it

1808
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,559
to a haploid level where there's only

1809
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:33,599
one chromosome

1810
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:37,680
uh one one set of uh

1811
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:41,119
excuse me a single chromosome uh

1812
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:42,960
from the parent from the donor so

1813
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:45,440
that would be an individual haploid that

1814
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:48,480
could then be chemically altered to have

1815
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,559
uh two sets two copies of those same

1816
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,760
chromosomes but they're identical and

1817
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,240
that's when you end up being able to

1818
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,160
produce

1819
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:55,519
they're called doubled haploids which

1820
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:58,239
are essentially uh

1821
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:58,798
seeds that act just like a clone would

1822
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:01,279
um but

1823
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:01,838
come along with all the benefits of seed

1824
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,160
vigor

1825
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:08,400
and having no no diseases no pests that

1826
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:10,078
sort of thing on the clone itself

1827
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,838
no that sounds like a gold standard

1828
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,680
right there it really is

1829
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:14,798
um and it's to be honest i know there

1830
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:16,879
are other groups that are working on

1831
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:18,559
this they have been for a while um we're

1832
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,000
we have a research contract with oregon

1833
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,599
state university uh

1834
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,239
working on this just to figure out if

1835
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:26,000
it's viable um i think in the long term

1836
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:27,519
it's an interesting area for me because

1837
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,679
what you just described and saying

1838
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:30,639
uh you know your triploids are are

1839
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:32,480
uniform

1840
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:34,480
they're uniform to a certain degree

1841
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,960
we're we're very interested

1842
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,880
in maintaining some diversity within

1843
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,760
these different genotypes

1844
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,880
to ensure that if there is some kind of

1845
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,720
you know if you have some sort of

1846
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,720
environmental problem or you have a pest

1847
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:48,959
pressure

1848
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:50,159
you really do need to have a certain

1849
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,318
level of diversity

1850
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:53,920
even in your seed crop that's in a field

1851
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:54,798
to be able to handle those types of

1852
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,798
pressures

1853
01:01:54,798 --> 01:02:00,000
and to identify you know certain certain

1854
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:01,440
genotypes or certain uh phenotypes

1855
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,039
that can withstand those types of

1856
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,159
pressures um so it's

1857
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:08,480
it's kind of that that idea of trying to

1858
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:10,078
trying to get towards a monocrop in a

1859
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,000
monoculture crop in the sense

1860
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,599
of uh you know maximizing your

1861
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,679
productivity of acres

1862
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:17,280
while at the same time balancing that

1863
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:19,440
with the necessity to

1864
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,200
not have a monoculture in your field you

1865
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,720
know having that enough diversity to be

1866
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:25,519
able to respond to

1867
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:27,759
um you know short-term pressures so

1868
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:30,318
let's dig a little bit more into that

1869
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,599
uniformity question because you know one

1870
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:33,759
of the

1871
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,519
biggest aspects of uniformity in

1872
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,440
cannabis that's important is with

1873
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,318
feminized seeds right because it doesn't

1874
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,679
take

1875
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:44,880
many sneaker males to ruin a crop of

1876
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:46,078
otherwise female plants and and you're

1877
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,599
kind of

1878
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,240
adding another variable that really must

1879
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,359
be

1880
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:55,519
at you know if not 100 percent

1881
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:56,480
really damn near 100 like we are with

1882
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:59,358
feminized seeds

1883
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,079
this fact that the seeds won't pollinate

1884
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:03,279
right

1885
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:05,200
so like how uniform are

1886
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,559
these triploid seeds that are being

1887
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:10,078
produced

1888
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:12,960
in their uniformity and they are

1889
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,000
pollen impervious yeah that's it's a

1890
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,358
really good question uh

1891
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,679
in two two two questions all bottled up

1892
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:19,279
there

1893
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:20,879
uh one is you know what what sort of

1894
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,880
feminization rate are we seeing with

1895
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,680
these triploids is it comparable to the

1896
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,720
diploids

1897
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:30,000
um with our diploids it's 99.98

1898
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:32,318
so one in four thousand roughly uh

1899
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,760
would end up having a male phenotype in

1900
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:35,440
the triploids we're seeing exactly the

1901
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,520
same numbers which is

1902
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,039
super interesting to me and we're going

1903
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:40,719
to dig into that a little bit deeper on

1904
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,480
the genomic side to get a better

1905
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:45,519
understanding of it

1906
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,119
but the other side of it is given uh you

1907
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:50,719
know a triploid plant

1908
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:53,200
uh exposed to pollen how how seed free

1909
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:54,239
is this plant um and what we're saying

1910
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:57,439
is that it is

1911
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:59,118
nearly seed free in the sense that

1912
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,200
last summer we had an experiment in a

1913
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:01,599
sealed greenhouse this is a 7 000 square

1914
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:04,000
foot

1915
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,760
sealed greenhouse no air coming in no

1916
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,920
air going out

1917
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,359
where we had a triploid that was

1918
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,599
pollinated by

1919
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:13,119
i believe we had 300 different pollen

1920
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,920
donors that had all been reversed and

1921
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,640
they're they're

1922
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,000
making copious amounts of pollen um you

1923
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:19,440
know you walk into that greenhouse and

1924
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,719
you would get sick if you're allergic to

1925
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,559
pollen

1926
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:24,318
uh the triploids that were in that

1927
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,519
greenhouse produced

1928
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:30,318
um one produced i believe four seeds

1929
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:30,719
and another one produced i believe five

1930
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:32,239
uh

1931
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:35,038
which we were comparing it to the

1932
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:39,038
diploid uh sisters right next to it

1933
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:41,359
um those those plants were fully seated

1934
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:42,640
and on a weight comparison you're

1935
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:46,480
looking at about 1 4

1936
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:48,159
000 of uh which is pretty phenomenal

1937
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,000
the interesting part about that too is

1938
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:51,838
that the seeds that come off of those

1939
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,519
triploids are actually non-viable

1940
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:55,519
so you would end up with you know like i

1941
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:58,480
said four four to five seeds

1942
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:59,920
per plant in a greenhouse that is

1943
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,559
completely inundated like

1944
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,680
inches of pollen on the benches when we

1945
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,839
were all done with

1946
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:07,279
you know at the end of the day uh

1947
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:11,038
they're they're highly

1948
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:12,798
highly resistant to to pollen which is

1949
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,799
really really interesting because not

1950
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:17,358
only are you you protecting your

1951
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:18,880
your neighbors from you know your own

1952
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:20,798
crop if you're planting all female seeds

1953
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,880
you're already doing the right thing

1954
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:24,559
but now you're basically guaranteed of

1955
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,000
not you're not going to pollinate your

1956
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,599
neighbors because the pollen coming off

1957
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,719
of those triploid plants are also

1958
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,400
non-viable

1959
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:32,318
uh there's no risk to yourself you're

1960
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,559
not going to you self-pollinate because

1961
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:36,000
you know honestly the plants don't get

1962
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:38,880
pollinated

1963
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,199
so it's really a win-win and they are

1964
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,838
are

1965
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:45,439
very very uh very difficult to pollinate

1966
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:48,000
it's interesting too that it's not

1967
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,880
simply an on or off switch

1968
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,599
where the triploids that did produce

1969
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,559
seeds

1970
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,119
it wasn't like oh yeah these produce

1971
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,680
seeds

1972
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,880
and now they're full of seeds it's like

1973
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:01,279
it's like oh yeah

1974
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,318
the the plant produced seeds but it's

1975
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,798
only like three or

1976
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:07,599
four it means that you know even though

1977
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:10,480
some of the individual flowers

1978
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:13,039
you know kind of failed if you will to

1979
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,760
be pollen resistant

1980
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:17,440
it wasn't the plant as a whole and so

1981
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,000
there's like multiple layers of

1982
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,358
threshold

1983
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,798
there to resist the pollen exactly

1984
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:26,798
exactly yeah it's like

1985
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:29,119
like we'd said earlier these are they're

1986
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:31,038
super plants

1987
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,160
yeah and you know really interesting to

1988
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,480
think about so

1989
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:36,078
so let's go ahead and take our second uh

1990
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,920
break here and when we come back we're

1991
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:40,559
going to talk about some of the

1992
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,480
some of the uh applications of triploids

1993
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,559
and and where this is going to go

1994
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,000
you are listening to shaping fire i'm

1995
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:48,079
your host shango los and our guest

1996
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,619
this week is socioecologist seth

[Music]

1999
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,280
for years organic cultivators have been

2000
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,000
looking for a replacement for using peat

2001
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,000
moss

2002
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,599
peat moss has long been the go-to soil

2003
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,639
amendment for water retention and

2004
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,720
container growing

2005
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:02,480
but organic growers know that peat moss

2006
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:04,399
is an unsustainable resource

2007
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,960
and the mining of peat bogs destroys

2008
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,798
habitat and releases sequestered carbon

2009
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,400
but peat moss works so well that many

2010
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:12,318
have continued to use it

2011
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,160
but now there's finally a revolutionary

2012
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:15,119
replacement for peat moss that shares

2013
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,159
the same benefits

2014
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:20,480
while also being sustainable pit moss

2015
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:22,318
sounds and axe like peat moss but

2016
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,199
instead of being mined from fragile

2017

ecosystems

2018
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:26,798
it actually is made from upcycled

organic paper and tree bark

2020
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:30,400
pit moss is excellent at retaining water

pit moss is the result of decades long

2030
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:46,798
research into the use of recycled paper

2032
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:51,519
pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat

2033
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,318
moss and handles exactly the same

2034
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:56,318

01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,520
stuff even though i'm not growing acres

2176
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,640
of it

2177
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,920
um are these you know is anybody doing

2178
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,960
triploids

2179
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:51,760
that are thc dominant right or or

2180
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,480
is it just other novel cannabinoids at

2181
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,719
this point

2182
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:56,879
which are being designed for the uh for

2183
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:59,359
the medical hemp market

2184
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,319
yeah it's a great question uh and every

2185
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:02,639
home grower

2186
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:04,399
once they have grown a triploid uh i

2187
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,960
don't think you will ever grow a diploid

2188
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:08,158
again

2189
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:11,679
uh that much there's some fighting words

2190
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:12,879
i i i i'm not a betting person but i

2191
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:16,399
would uh i would

2192
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:19,440
definitely wager in that in that camp

2193
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:19,839
um you're looking at a good example

2194
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:21,839
there's

2195
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,440
really good papers uh scientific papers

2196
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,239
describing the differences between a

2197
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:27,359
triploid

2198
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:29,119
uh hop versus a diploid hop

2199
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:31,599
very similar families and what you're

2200
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,039
seeing is uh essential oils so that the

2201
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,560
terpenes and the other olfactory

2202
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:35,198
components that make up the flavor

2203
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,640
profile

2204
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:41,519
of a of a hob um are more than double

2205
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,800
in a in a triploid versus a diploid uh

2206
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,719
the same thing is true

2207
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,960
in the triploid cannabis plants that

2208
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:49,279
that we're creating right now

2209
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,960
you've never smelled you've never

2210
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:51,519
smelled a plant that had a stronger

2211
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,000
flavor

2212
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,159
than these triploids um conversely

2213
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,920
they're also producing more cannabinoids

2214
01:13:56,158 --> 01:13:59,759
uh so you end up with a plant that's i

2215
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,560
mean it's basically the ultimate

2216
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,920
expression

2217
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:07,199
of what a cannabis plant can be

2218
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:09,840
um so to answer your question in short

2219
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:11,359
no unfortunately there are not uh

2220
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,079
triploid versions of

2221
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:14,639
thc plants that are available right now

2222
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:16,559
um

2223
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,840
but it would not surprise me if there

2224
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,640
are a bunch of folks who are claiming

2225
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,199
that they have them

2226
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,239
after uh people hear about this because

2227
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:24,799
they are they are

2228
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:26,158
just so awesome um one of the things

2229
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,079
that we are working on

2230
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:29,359
is uh you know obviously we're an

2231
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:30,960
industrial hemp seed research and

2232
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:34,158
development company so we have to

2233
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:36,640
to honor the uh the federal rules and

2234
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:38,319
the usda's guidelines on

2235
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,560
who we can give seed to and and that

2236
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:42,880
sort of thing but i will say that we

2237
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,159
are pushing very hard at the federal

2238
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,039
level to be able to

2239
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:48,319
offer seeds to home growers i think

2240
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:50,719
we're going to be able to do that in

2241
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:52,639
oregon for 2021

2242
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,880
just trying to work it out nationally at

2243
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:56,239
this point for others to participate in

2244
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,880
that process

2245
01:14:56,238 --> 01:15:00,799
but i will say that as part of the

2246
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,400
research and development process we end

2247
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,079
up with a lot of plants that are

2248
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:07,119
considered type ones

2249
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:08,319
type one are high thc plants uh in

2250
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:09,840
addition we also have type

2251
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:11,359
2 plants and this is something to think

2252
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,279
about from a

2253
01:15:11,359 --> 01:15:15,759
from a gene stacking perspective if you

2254
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:19,279
have a type 2 plant that's both

2255
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:21,280
has an active cbd and an active thc gene

2256
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:23,359
what does that look like in terms of the

2257
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:25,599
underlying ratio when you have

2258
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:27,198
three potential copies so you can stack

2259
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,520
these in different ways to achieve very

2260
01:15:27,198 --> 01:15:33,279
different results

2261
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:36,480
we're definitely working on

2262
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:37,519
making sure that we have tetraploid

2263
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:40,739
versions of

2264
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,840
many very very famous and

2265
01:15:40,739 --> 01:15:44,719
[Music]

2266
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,560
useful thc plants we're allowed to keep

2267
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,600
those as part of our genetic library but

2268
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,600
we're not allowed to

2269
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,199
flower them out they would they would

2270
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,079
not meet the obviously not meet the

2271
01:15:51,198 --> 01:15:53,919
industrial hemp

2272
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:55,600
standards however we can do the

2273
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:58,000
transformations uh

2274
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,679
on site at our company and then because

2275
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,719
we live in oregon you know we take these

2276
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:02,640
plants home and we can

2277
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:04,079
we can make seed with them and make make

2278
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,480
triploid seed you know say in your

2279
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:08,319
basement or your garage

2280
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:09,919
we're not doing commercial quantities of

2281
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:11,840
that and we're not legally allowed to

2282
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:13,920
sell them at this point but

2283
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:17,279
they're definitely out there and they

2284
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:20,319
are definitely awesome

2285
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:22,880
so so

2286
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:23,840
if i understand this correctly you can

2287
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:27,600
develop

2288
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:31,199
the genetics legally in your hemp

2289
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:34,239
company but because though that is not

2290
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:35,198
a viable product under your license you

2291
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:37,678
have to stop

2292
01:16:35,198 --> 01:16:38,960
there so if theoretically the laws were

2293
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:42,560
to change

2294
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:43,920
and and hemp breeding you know hemp seed

2295
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,719
manufacturers were

2296
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,000
able to now produce type ones you

2297
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,198
actually have got a

2298
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,238
library of this seed that you'd go oh

2299
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:54,479
we're just going to put this into

2300
01:16:52,238 --> 01:16:55,759
production now even though they're kind

2301
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:57,119
of um

2302
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,360
they're kind of it's like it's like

2303
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:00,960
spin-off technology from the work that

2304
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:03,279
you're actually trying to do

2305
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,480
that's exactly right that's a very nice

2306
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:06,079
way to describe it

2307
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:08,158
we are basically just in a holding

2308
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:08,960
pattern waiting for federal legalization

2309
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:11,279
to open up

2310
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,239
uh we're cannabis breeders and the

2311
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:14,639
underlying

2312
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:16,479
chemical compounds are very very simple

2313
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,880
targets in terms of breeding

2314
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:20,079
it's the rest of it that interests us uh

2315
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,319
but you know

2316
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:23,760
as as good plant breeders we're always

2317
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:26,079
keeping our work backed up

2318
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,679
and uh are always ready to move forward

2319
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:29,679
when the time is right

2320
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,719
so so let's say that you did you know

2321
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,840
take one of these

2322
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:34,880
these uh type one seeds that's triploid

2323
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,960
and you take it home

2324
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,560
and and you make that your patient

2325
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:41,920
garden and you grow it and

2326
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:43,520
everything's all nice and legal is are

2327
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:46,719
the differences between

2328
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:51,040
a triploid and a diploid seed

2329
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:51,679
growing is it so remarkable that you can

2330
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:53,519
tell

2331
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:55,119
that as the you know assuming that you

2332
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,480
have some experience growing cannabis

2333
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:58,158
plants right already

2334
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:00,479
like if i grew this plant would i be

2335
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:01,359
like holy hell this is a different kind

2336
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:04,000
of plant

2337
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:05,519
or is it like yeah you know yeah it's

2338
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,359
it's a better seed like how how

2339
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,880
remarkable is it

2340
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:13,839
uh you know in terms of uh say like

2341
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,560
olfactory components you know not just

2342
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,560
terpenes

2343
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:18,400
we know now that terpenes make up about

2344
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,880
50 of what actually

2345
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:21,599
smells in a cannabis plant the rest of

2346
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,960
them are

2347
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,600
different forms of alcohols and

2348
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,279
especially aldehydes

2349
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,280
the triploid plants tend to have

2350
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:32,079
anywhere between 30 to 50 percent

2351
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:33,920
uh increased expression of those

2352
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:34,800
particular compounds which means that

2353
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,119
they are

2354
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,079
the loudest flowers that you that you're

2355
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:40,399
going to uh

2356
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:42,238
that you're going to end up smelling um

2357
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:44,479
just as an example uh

2358
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:46,718
we've got one of my my favorite plants

2359
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:49,039
of all time is uh chem dog number four

2360
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:50,079
so it's uh one of the chem dog um

2361
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:52,800
there's kim dog d

2362
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:55,439
chem 91 in uh chem four chem four has

2363
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,840
always been my personal favorite

2364
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:59,519
in diploid form now when you see it in

2365
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,679
tetraploid form

2366
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:04,480
it's a whole other animal same smell

2367
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:06,719
same giant flowers same great structure

2368
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:08,399
same over-the-top resin production but

2369
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,719
the smell and

2370
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:12,479
the uh trichome content on it when you

2371
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:14,319
look at it under a microscope

2372
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:16,238
or even just a you know a loop a

2373
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:18,319
jeweler's loop uh

2374
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:20,639
unbelievable like the the concentration

2375
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:23,359
is is incredible and the smell is just

2376
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,840
overwhelming so you can you can take

2377
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,639
that

2378
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:28,319
and then say like in in the case of uh

2379
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,079
chem 4 you can cross it with something

2380
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:33,039
else it has a completely different

2381
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:34,238
flavor profile say like a train wreck

2382
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:36,880
with a terpenoline

2383
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:39,359
dominant expression and then end up

2384
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,159
creating this new flavor profile that is

2385
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:42,639
not only

2386
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:43,519
incredibly intense in a plant that's you

2387
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,400
know

2388
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,719
really really vigorous but it's incre

2389
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:48,319
it's

2390
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:49,920
completely unique it's an expression

2391
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:50,559
that has never been seen before because

2392
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,039
those two

2393
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,600
types of terpenes don't end up lining up

2394
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:56,640
when you're

2395
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:58,239
when you're making crosses so it really

2396
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,560
opens up the possibility

2397
01:19:58,238 --> 01:20:03,599
not only of having a a more vigorous

2398
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,760
plant with higher yields and better oil

2399
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:08,239
but also just increasing that total

2400
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,000
amount of diversity that's present

2401
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:11,198
wow that's pretty sexy i should we

2402
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,719
should have started the show with that

2403
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:13,519
question we would have kept people a lot

2404
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:15,679
longer who

2405
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:17,520
we lost because of the science wow

2406
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,000
that's that's really exciting to be able

2407
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,360
to try

2408
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,560
these plants you must have been

2409
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:21,439
flabbergasted because they're like you

2410
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,920
know i know you're

2411
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:25,039
you know uh uh you know you're a breeder

2412
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,440
and a professor

2413
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:28,719
and a and a business person but like

2414
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:29,919
you're also a toker

2415
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:32,079
you know what i mean at the end of the

2416
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,239
day i love cannabis yeah

2417
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:35,359
so this is my flavor cannabis you must

2418
01:20:34,238 --> 01:20:38,879
have been blown away

2419
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:40,079
to see to experience chem 4 as your own

2420
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,639
triploid

2421
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:43,279
yeah yeah and we're basically doing that

2422
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,400
process

2423
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:47,039
right now this is a shout out to to csi

2424
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:49,119
humboldt

2425
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:50,639
and uh caleb's work uh i've been

2426
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:52,158
following his work for a number of years

2427
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:54,719
and have just always appreciated

2428
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:56,158
his level of detail when when hunting

2429
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:56,800
for different phenotypes and making sure

2430
01:20:56,158 --> 01:20:59,599
that things

2431
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,079
are quote unquote real uh he does a lot

2432
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,560
of work

2433
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:04,800
making s-ones so taking these really

2434
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:06,400
famous plants these famous cuttings

2435
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,920
self-pollinating them and then offering

2436
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:10,638
the seeds and

2437
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:12,000
for a plant breeder sifting through

2438
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:13,760
s-ones is where the

2439
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,279
a lot of the magic really happens you're

2440
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,920
able to lock in the traits that you

2441
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:19,279
really want

2442
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:21,520
and get unique flavor profiles so

2443
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:23,359
for a lot of the thc varieties that i

2444
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,639
personally work with

2445
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:25,920
you know if it's not a cutting or

2446
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:27,199
something that's been shared by other

2447
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,520
people in the community

2448
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:30,399
uh we're going to seeds from you know

2449
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,880
reputable

2450
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:34,319
uh reputable underground breeders who

2451
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,800
continue to stay underground and i

2452
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:38,158
appreciate

2453
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:39,679
that who are making these s-ones of

2454
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:42,158
famous plants so we've got things like

2455
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:44,800
durban poison california orange

2456
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:47,920
train wreck purple oracle uh you know

2457
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:50,079
all of these different s1 varieties

2458
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:52,560
that have been released and we're now

2459
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:54,238
basically sifting through

2460
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,239
figuring out which ones have exactly

2461
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:57,439
what we're looking for both on a genomic

2462
01:21:56,238 --> 01:21:58,718
standpoint and then from the chemical

2463
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:00,719
standpoint and then we're going to make

2464
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:04,079
tetraploids out of them and

2465
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:05,840
basically be ready for 2022 when we're

2466
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:07,439
hoping that federal legalization happens

2467
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,560
and everybody in the world can taste

2468
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:11,678
these flavors

2469
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:14,000
damn that's exciting uh i also love uh

2470
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:15,920
caleb's s1 packs like you know

2471
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,119
people will put out rag seeds and call

2472
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:20,000
it a breeders pack

2473
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:20,880
and you know it'll just have more seeds

2474
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,079
right so you get

2475
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:27,199
more more phenos at a good price

2476
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:30,238
but for me caleb's s1 packs

2477
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:31,759
are like the gold standard as far as

2478
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:34,238
breeders packs you know

2479
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,760
there's so much variety he he describes

2480
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:38,399
that he was actually on

2481
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,000
shaping fire episode 49 talking about

2482
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:41,519
feminized uh cannabis

2483
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,279
and he's all like you know these these

2484
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:47,040
s1 seeds if you have enough of them

2485
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:48,000
you kind of have a a snapshot of what is

2486
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:50,399
possible

2487
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,479
you know in that line of seeds and you

2488
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:52,879
know it's it's actually a lot of credit

2489
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:55,439
to

2490
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,960
caleb as well uh you just mentioned him

2491
01:22:55,439 --> 01:22:59,198
as somebody that you respect

2492
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:00,079
and a couple weeks ago we had ryan lee

2493
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:02,399
on the show

2494
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:04,880
and he mentioned out of nowhere that he

2495
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:06,399
respect caleb inspector from csi

2496
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,480
humboldt as well so

2497
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:10,319
that's you know that that that's a lot

2498
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:11,359
of that's a got a lot of good love for a

2499
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:13,599
guy who you know

2500
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:14,479
mostly tries to stay in the underground

2501
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,480
yeah and i i

2502
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:17,759
feel bad just for bringing his name up

2503
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:20,718
i'm sorry but uh

2504
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,280
well you know he he's not in the shadows

2505
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:24,319
he's just

2506
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:26,079
uh he's just uh happy to stay uh small

2507
01:23:24,319 --> 01:23:27,519
and local to humble you know

2508
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:29,600
it you know and it's one of those things

2509
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,600
where he's actually doing a tremendous

2510
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,320
service to other breeders by being able

2511
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,760
to

2512
01:23:32,319 --> 01:23:38,079
uh to take these these famous clones

2513
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,679
and not just you know reverse them and

2514
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:41,119
make c but he's actually

2515
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:42,719
doing the due diligence to make sure

2516
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:45,119
that it is what it is

2517
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:46,800
uh and and verifying that to the best of

2518
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:48,158
of his ability and i think anybody's

2519
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,079
ability at this point

2520
01:23:48,158 --> 01:23:51,839
but then also making something like that

2521
01:23:50,079 --> 01:23:52,559
available so you know it used to be that

2522
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,800
we would ship

2523
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,639
clones around the country in you know

2524
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,079
dvd cases and that was how the

2525
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:59,840
underground

2526
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:01,519
stayed alive it's how we shared cuttings

2527
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,159
with each other and and made sure that

2528
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,320
there was

2529
01:24:02,158 --> 01:24:06,158
not only you know cannabis plants across

2530
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:08,079
the country and you had sour diesel in

2531
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:10,238
you know new york and in oregon

2532
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:11,920
uh but it was a way of basically

2533
01:24:10,238 --> 01:24:13,839
creating culture and camaraderie

2534
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:15,600
uh with people who were taking the same

2535
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:18,159
type of risks that you were

2536
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,639
he's been living that and also making

2537
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:20,799
these

2538
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,319
these seeds available uh from a breeding

2539
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,119
perspective if you can get an

2540
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:26,079
s1 of say train wreck if it's you know a

2541
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:29,039
legitimate

2542
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:30,079
cut which in this case it is you have

2543
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:32,719
all of the possible

2544
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:34,639
permutations of that particular variety

2545
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,800
in seed form available to you

2546
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:38,000
and because it's an s1 you're actually

2547
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,320
getting uh

2548
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,760
expressions of both of the parents and

2549
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:43,599
you can start to sift through that and

2550
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,880
figure out well what was it that made

2551
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:48,239
that particular plant

2552
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:49,600
the original train wreck so amazing and

2553
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:51,599
for us we're doing it from a chemical

2554
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:54,079
and a genomic standpoint so

2555
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,280
really exciting it's exciting to to be

2556
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:56,719
able to have that as an

2557
01:24:55,279 --> 01:24:58,399
opportunity and it's exciting to be

2558
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:00,639
alive at this moment at a time

2559
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:03,279
being able to subject all of these

2560
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:07,039
classic flavors these classic varieties

2561
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:08,639
to really unprecedented analytical

2562
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:10,880
capabilities

2563
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:12,400
this summer actually we got a couple of

2564
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:16,079
the skittles

2565
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:18,079
s-ones uh from caleb here on vashon

2566
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:19,679
and we just opened the packs and we

2567
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:20,639
spread them around different patients on

2568
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:23,279
the island

2569
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,920
and um you know we we spread them around

2570
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:26,238
before

2571
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,440
the pandemic got more serious and the

2572
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:28,718
idea that we were going to do is that

2573
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:31,039
everybody was going to grow

2574
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:32,880
different seeds from the s1 pack and

2575
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:35,519
then we were going to do kind of like a

2576
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,880
a progressive you know wander your way

2577
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,800
around the island and

2578
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:40,079
and check out everybody's gardens and

2579
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,159
everything and so we're gonna have to do

2580
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:43,359
that somehow more creatively with masks

2581
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:46,319
and crap this year

2582
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:48,399
uh now but um it's really enjoyable you

2583
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:51,599
know for anybody who loves the plant

2584
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:52,559
to check out these s-ones where you're

2585
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,960
all like oh

2586
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,560
yeah these are all skittles plants i i

2587
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,960
can see and smell that

2588
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,080
but they all have got you know subtly

2589
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,239
different

2590
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:03,600
uh personalities and you know if you're

2591
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:04,638
a nerd for the plant that's just a lot

2592
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,800
of fun

2593
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:08,400
but i would love to go along on that it

2594
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,880
sounds like it's not going to happen

2595
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:11,920
this year but man what a great idea yeah

2596
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,719
i love that

2597
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,239
actually you're probably going to

2598
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:15,920
appreciate it more next year because we

2599
01:26:14,238 --> 01:26:18,559
also got some of the

2600
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,480
the chemdawg s ones and so that's what

2601
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,280
we're planning on doing next year

2602
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:25,279
so so let's talk about something that is

2603
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:28,319
uh really a theoretical because

2604
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:31,279
um we'll talk more about you know uh

2605
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:32,079
licensing issues uh here in a little bit

2606
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:34,158
but um

2607
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:35,119
you know i know that the way that your

2608
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:37,519
seeds have to be

2609
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:39,198
sold you know due to the government

2610
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:41,199
regulations is you need to you know you

2611
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:43,359
need to sell to particular farmers and

2612
01:26:41,198 --> 01:26:45,279
you can't just sell to the public

2613
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:47,439
and but but as we know you know

2614
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:49,679
occasionally some of those seeds will

2615
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:52,000
find their way into like you know a

2616
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:55,279
friend of a farmer's hands

2617
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:59,039
um what would happen if if

2618
01:26:55,279 --> 01:27:02,880
uh um if if you know a home grower

2619
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:05,198
tried to replicate these triploids like

2620
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:07,440
you know some pollen chucker

2621
01:27:05,198 --> 01:27:08,879
oh is it like uh pollinating a triploid

2622
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:10,719
yeah totally like like they

2623
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,000
you know like well essentially like

2624
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:13,840
people were doing with your other

2625
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,079
autoflower cbd seeds right

2626
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:17,119
your autoflower cbd seeds would be put

2627
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:18,479
into the market

2628
01:27:17,119 --> 01:27:20,079
there you know the farmer who bought

2629
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:20,638
them from you isn't supposed to share

2630
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:22,559
them

2631
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,920
yet somehow miraculously their neighbor

2632
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,360
gets some and

2633
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,960
and they hit him with pollen in the

2634
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:31,039
basement to try to keep

2635
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:33,119
going on the triploid yeah the the

2636
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:34,079
unfortunate for uh the folks that are

2637
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:35,760
trying that um

2638
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:37,439
you're gonna waste your pollen uh

2639
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,639
because just because the flowers are

2640
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:41,119
non-viable

2641
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:42,800
and that's the whole point that's and it

2642
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:44,559
you know we're not doing it to

2643
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,960
to stop people from breeding with our

2644
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,800
work uh we're trying to help farmers

2645
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:50,239
from being you know cross-contaminated

2646
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,920
by a neighbor that's not being

2647
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:53,678
wise in their their planting decisions

2648
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:56,719
or even you know for a farmer that's

2649
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:58,719
uh say planting near a feral population

2650
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:00,158
of hemp like we see all over the midwest

2651
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:02,158
you know basically from

2652
01:28:00,158 --> 01:28:03,279
uh you know the southern united states

2653
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:06,879
all the way to

2654
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:08,639
minnesota um yeah you're just not going

2655
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:10,800
to end up with anything except

2656
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:12,400
uh probably increased allergies if

2657
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,480
you're you know you have viable pollen

2658
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:16,960
in your basement

2659
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:19,279
so what does the future of triploids

2660
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,239
look like right so if we've established

2661
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:23,439
that

2662
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:25,119
we can do a lot more with three sets of

2663
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:29,039
chromosomes than we can with

2664
01:28:25,119 --> 01:28:32,158
two and we're just putting our big toe

2665
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:32,719
in the pool of triploids in cannabis and

2666
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:34,319
where we're

2667
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:36,079
you know where you're starting is it for

2668
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:38,319
to be pollen resistant

2669
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:39,359
and you know you're going for you know

2670
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:41,679
yield

2671
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:43,039
and you know pest resistance and drought

2672
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:45,199
resistance and such

2673
01:28:43,039 --> 01:28:46,238
i'm assuming that there are a lot other

2674
01:28:45,198 --> 01:28:48,960
traits that

2675
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:49,599
can be toyed with um but just aren't

2676
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:53,039
going to be

2677
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:55,360
in you know the first rev of of seeds

2678
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:56,560
what what do you expect us to see coming

2679
01:28:55,359 --> 01:28:59,519
from triploids

2680
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,480
you know over the next few years it's a

2681
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,960
really good question

2682
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:04,479
and uh to be perfectly honest outside of

2683
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,000
different flavor combinations that have

2684
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:06,718
never been seen like i was describing

2685
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,600
before

2686
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,960
uh in the these new cannabinoid profiles

2687
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,719
um

2688
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:14,639
you know your flowering time disease

2689
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:15,439
resistance those big things that you'd

2690
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:19,199
already mentioned

2691
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:20,079
uh i'm i'm really just scraping the

2692
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:22,479
surface

2693
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:23,359
uh you know every single week we're

2694
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:25,759
getting another

2695
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:26,399
four whole genomes sequenced and

2696
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,320
assembled

2697
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:29,599
and uh you know available for us to uh

2698
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:30,880
basically start digging through and

2699
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,480
mining

2700
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,239
uh trying to figure out which of these

2701
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:37,599
different genes are

2702
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:39,919
contributing to different aspects of the

2703
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:43,039
plant that could potentially be useful

2704
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:45,039
um i i think in the in the longer term

2705
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:46,960
the way that i view this you know i i

2706
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:49,279
don't have a specific answer but i think

2707
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,880
in the longer term what we're seeing is

2708
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:52,559
that these plants are going to have the

2709
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,239
capability of having greater

2710
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,000
evolutionary adaptability

2711
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:57,759
uh this is a you can go back to the

2712
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,158
notion of punctuated equilibrium it's

2713
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,039
the

2714
01:29:58,158 --> 01:30:02,960
this specific concept of evolution and

2715
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:03,439
how it operates it was put forward by

2716
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,359
stephen j

2717
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:06,799
gould one of the most brilliant 20th

2718
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:11,198
century evolutionary

2719
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:13,440
biologists um notion that

2720
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:15,439
over long historical periods you end up

2721
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:16,399
with essentially stasis not a lot of

2722
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:19,198
change that happens

2723
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:20,960
and then in specific moments you have

2724
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:23,198
what's called punctuated equilibrium the

2725
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:25,760
equilibrium is punctuated by

2726
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:27,198
uh either external events that end up

2727
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:30,239
challenging a particular

2728
01:30:27,198 --> 01:30:32,638
organism uh an organism's survival

2729
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:34,559
or you know something that is localized

2730
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:36,800
say in the soil or

2731
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,080
you know predators coming in and eating

2732
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:41,199
the plants

2733
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:43,439
the idea here is that the more

2734
01:30:41,198 --> 01:30:44,719
adaptability that a particular species

2735
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:47,439
has

2736
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:48,079
for any of these particular challenges

2737
01:30:47,439 --> 01:30:50,559
the more

2738
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:52,399
fit it is actually going to be so as we

2739
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,960
see you know the ravages of climate

2740
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:56,158
change

2741
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:58,399
or uh issues with you know

2742
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:01,119
weeds and in fields or you know some of

2743
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:03,679
the the larger ecological pressures that

2744
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:05,840
that are undoubtedly going to be coming

2745
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:08,399
down on us in the 21st century

2746
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,520
these plants have the capability of

2747
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:12,079
responding to that

2748
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:13,840
in a way that we we can't even foresee

2749
01:31:12,079 --> 01:31:16,079
at this point

2750
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,639
right on that's very exciting and it

2751
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:20,639
also sounds like it's a real

2752
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:23,600
open-ended kind of answer right the

2753
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:25,279
the answer is um we don't know what

2754
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,079
might still be in these plants because

2755
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:28,559
we're still

2756
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:29,519
learning the genome and also we're not

2757
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,800
sure what we're gonna

2758
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,280
need them to do yet because our you know

2759
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,000
as our

2760
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:36,399
as climate change continues we're not

2761
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,399
sure

2762
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:39,920
how it's gonna manifest so it's kind of

2763
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:41,599
like a you know a big

2764
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:43,520
open-ended question which actually makes

2765
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:47,440
me feel really like

2766
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:50,239
enthusiastic for you know the the

2767
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:51,119
the the i don't know the the future

2768
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:52,879
geneticists

2769
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:54,880
and probably even more so the pot

2770
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,719
smokers that are in college right now

2771
01:31:54,880 --> 01:32:00,719
who are studying these sciences

2772
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:02,719
what a great time to be a you know 18 19

2773
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:05,198
21 year old something like that in

2774
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:07,920
school where you're able to actually

2775
01:32:05,198 --> 01:32:08,719
study this in the classroom get into a

2776
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:11,199
lab

2777
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:12,239
and then find yourself matriculating out

2778
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:15,279
of school and go

2779
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:16,479
into legit companies that are working

2780
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:19,119
like this and have this be

2781
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:21,279
your life's work i mean how badass is

2782
01:32:19,119 --> 01:32:23,198
that what a great time to be coming into

2783
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:25,439
your career in cannabis

2784
01:32:23,198 --> 01:32:26,719
yeah and i i only got here because i you

2785
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:28,479
know basically got let go from the

2786
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:30,560
university for being a proponent of

2787
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:31,919
cannabis uh so i'm incredibly thankful

2788
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,760
to be in the position that i'm at

2789
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,279
but you know the younger folks that we

2790
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,800
have in our company right now who are

2791
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:38,479
recent graduates you know with

2792
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,480
horticulture degrees or botany degrees

2793
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:44,399
or plant breeding degrees

2794
01:32:40,479 --> 01:32:46,319
uh they they have a really hard time

2795
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:47,759
uh keeping a smile off of their face

2796
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:49,920
because this is like this is

2797
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:51,600
the moment in time it's this golden age

2798
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:54,000
of cannabis breeding and discovery

2799
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:55,199
that you know you really only get to be

2800
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,198
around

2801
01:32:55,198 --> 01:32:58,719
one time you know as it's happening and

2802
01:32:57,198 --> 01:33:01,198
it's it's happening

2803
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:02,239
um one other thing that may be

2804
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:03,919
worthwhile noting

2805
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:05,759
is this idea that you know one of the

2806
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,319
problems that the midwest has i brought

2807
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,760
that up

2808
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:09,198
it's good to have a triploid because you

2809
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,960
can't be pollinated by the feral

2810
01:33:09,198 --> 01:33:13,599
populations that are left over from

2811
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:15,119
uh you know fiber farming uh in the

2812
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,560
first part of the 20th century these

2813
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:18,079
native populations have established

2814
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:20,080
themselves and basically continue to

2815
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:22,880
thrive because it's a fairly adaptable

2816
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:24,238
and plastic plant um one of the ways

2817
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,560
that we can end up

2818
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:28,638
dealing with that i think over time it's

2819
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:30,400
a bigger concern here in oregon where

2820
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:32,319
you know you had a

2821
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:34,000
huge explosion of industrial hemp farms

2822
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:35,439
where people were using male and female

2823
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,600
seeds inappropriately

2824
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:38,799
and then basically just leaving the area

2825
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,159
and they let you know

2826
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,760
we're seeing it right now there's fields

2827
01:33:40,158 --> 01:33:43,039
all over in the willamette valley and in

2828
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,039
southern oregon

2829
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:46,319
where the farmers farmed last year

2830
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:49,279
didn't take care of their crop

2831
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:50,880
and they're gone now but the seeds

2832
01:33:49,279 --> 01:33:52,639
remain and so you have male and female

2833
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:54,639
populations popping up

2834
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:56,480
creating a feral population where there

2835
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:59,520
never was one before

2836
01:33:56,479 --> 01:34:00,799
um that's a very very difficult thing to

2837
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,239
control

2838
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,840
one of the things that we're working on

2839
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:06,399
is being able to use uh

2840
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,679
tetraploids and diploids in rotation so

2841
01:34:06,399 --> 01:34:09,359
you basically grow

2842
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,800
your tetraploids for four or five years

2843
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:12,639
in a specific area and then you can

2844
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,800
switch back to a diploid

2845
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:16,639
to make sure that you don't have uh

2846
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:19,039
feral populations that pop up

2847
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:20,560
you can use the ploity to your advantage

2848
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:24,000
to basically

2849
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:25,600
stop uh feral populations from emerging

2850
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,198
that reminds me a lot of those

2851
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,840
mosquitoes that are in the news right

2852
01:34:27,198 --> 01:34:30,319
now

2853
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,159
where they they gmo'd up some mosquitoes

2854
01:34:30,319 --> 01:34:34,559
that don't breed and they're introducing

2855
01:34:32,158 --> 01:34:35,439
the population so the mosquitoes are

2856
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:38,560
breeding with

2857
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:40,638
with sterile other mosquitoes

2858
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:42,159
and even though you know we're talking

2859
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:45,199
about triploids which are not

2860
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:46,238
gmo we will repeat um the idea is kind

2861
01:34:45,198 --> 01:34:47,198
of the same what you're talking about

2862
01:34:46,238 --> 01:34:50,559
this weed you know

2863
01:34:47,198 --> 01:34:53,919
this feral reduction because it will uh

2864
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,800
it'll stop them from producing um usable

2865
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:57,118
seed

2866
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,000
that's exactly right and again just to

2867
01:34:57,118 --> 01:34:59,759
highlight that

2868
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,039
not gmo we're taking something that

2869
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:03,520
naturally occurs

2870
01:35:01,039 --> 01:35:05,279
it's just we didn't we didn't know it

2871
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,719
and to be perfectly honest i bet there

2872
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:07,759
are people who are growing cannabis

2873
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:09,520
plants right now

2874
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:11,600
in their basement in their garage in

2875
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:13,440
their closet

2876
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,440
that are tetraploid and they just don't

2877
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:15,759
know it because these these plants do

2878
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:17,439
pop

2879
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:18,960
up naturally in populations it's just

2880
01:35:17,439 --> 01:35:20,399
very very rare and

2881
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,239
most people don't have a forty thousand

2882
01:35:20,399 --> 01:35:24,079
dollar piece of uh

2883
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:25,279
uh science equipment to be able to test

2884
01:35:24,079 --> 01:35:28,479
in their home you know whether or not

2885
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:30,399
it's a tetraploid or a diploid so it's

2886
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:33,759
basically using this new knowledge

2887
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:36,799
uh to really be able to push

2888
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:39,520
both farming and ecology forward

2889
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:41,119
um you know we don't have to insert

2890
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,360
genes from other species

2891
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:44,639
to have a good outcome it's you don't

2892
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:47,920
have to genetically modify

2893
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:50,000
organisms to be able to be good

2894
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,199
ecologists we can actually use what's

2895
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,279
naturally available

2896
01:35:51,198 --> 01:35:55,279
and use the tools that we've learned

2897
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:56,800
about in science to make the

2898
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:58,399
success rates much higher and much

2899
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,960
faster uh

2900
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:02,079
to actually push us forward right on

2901
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,960
that's beautiful i don't think i'm going

2902
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:05,439
to top that

2903
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,960
so as we as we wrap up here you know i

2904
01:36:05,439 --> 01:36:07,439
want to do something different you and i

2905
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,960
have talked

2906
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:10,719
you know this is your third time on

2907
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,800
shaping fire and

2908
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:13,760
each time you come on you're usually

2909
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:17,119
coming to share

2910
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:20,320
some some new aspect of science with us

2911
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:23,920
um and then after the interview

2912
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:25,679
you get bombarded with emails and

2913
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:28,719
contacts and all this kind of stuff

2914
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:30,719
more more than you can handle so um

2915
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:32,880
why don't we go ahead and answer a

2916
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:33,439
couple of the questions that you get hit

2917
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,118
with

2918
01:36:33,439 --> 01:36:36,799
well this stuff's all on your frequently

2919
01:36:35,118 --> 01:36:38,880
asked questions on the website

2920
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:40,000
but let's just let's let's let's hit the

2921
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:43,679
big two

2922
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,840
um like how do people buy your seed

2923
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:46,960
and i guess that's pretty much the

2924
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,279
question and is there any

2925
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:50,079
and is there any left for this year

2926
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:51,599
because

2927
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:53,439
like people are generally pretty

2928
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,400
disappointed when they find out to get

2929
01:36:53,439 --> 01:36:57,599
your seed

2930
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:59,279
that they generally have to be a prior

2931
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,119
customer so why don't you lay that down

2932
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:04,000
real quick before before we wrap

2933
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:04,639
up uh yeah great question i appreciate

2934
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,560
it um

2935
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:09,079
we can always get seed from our webs not

2936
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,560
always we can get seed from our website

2937
01:37:09,079 --> 01:37:12,319
oregoncbdseeds.com

2938
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,239
at this point you have to have an

2939
01:37:12,319 --> 01:37:17,359
industrial hemp license issued by

2940
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:19,759
either your state or by the usda there's

2941
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:22,000
really nothing that we can do about that

2942
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:23,920
we did stop sales and we do this every

2943
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,960
year

2944
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:28,719
unless you are in a state like

2945
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:30,158
california or florida where there's

2946
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:33,520
different growing seasons

2947
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:35,839
we shut our sales down for for each year

2948
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:37,280
july 1st because we don't want to take

2949
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,480
advantage of farmers

2950
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:40,719
if you're trying to get plants in the

2951
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:41,839
ground or seed started after july 1st in

2952
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:44,239
the northern hemisphere

2953
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,360
you're you're really missing out you've

2954
01:37:44,238 --> 01:37:46,638
missed the boat and you're not going to

2955
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:50,000
have a good crop

2956
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:50,319
so we halt um we'll start sale uh sales

2957
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,679
for

2958
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:57,118
2021 on these new triploid veren rich

2959
01:37:53,679 --> 01:38:00,639
100 compliant with the usda 0.3 thc rule

2960
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:01,599
uh on january 1st of 2021 and hopefully

2961
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:03,199
by that point

2962
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,520
uh we can have a little bit more clarity

2963
01:38:03,198 --> 01:38:05,919
from the usda on who's actually allowed

2964
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,840
to

2965
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:09,359
to purchase seed and whether or not we

2966
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,039
can get these to home growers

2967
01:38:09,359 --> 01:38:12,639
so we'll be working diligently to try to

2968
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:16,079
make that happen in the meantime

2969
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:18,400
after you brought your uh your cbd

2970
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:19,600
autoflower to the market which honestly

2971
01:38:18,399 --> 01:38:23,279
kind of remade

2972
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:25,520
the cbd market globally

2973
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:27,198
you sold out of those wicked fast

2974
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,960
because of course everybody wanted tens

2975
01:38:27,198 --> 01:38:31,198
of thousands of them

2976
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:33,118
should we expect that with triploids for

2977
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:33,678
the next few years as well kind of like

2978
01:38:33,118 --> 01:38:35,839
we're still

2979
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,279
seeing with like some of the cbg stuff

2980
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:40,000
is it you know you're here

2981
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:40,559
talking about it because triploids are

2982
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,359
the

2983
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:48,320
cutting edge of of cannabis uh breeding

2984
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:50,000
but is it gonna take three four years

2985
01:38:48,319 --> 01:38:50,719
for enough of them to be produced that

2986
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,039
they're going to be

2987
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:54,639
widely available how how much should we

2988
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:56,719
expect on seeing these

2989
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:58,560
uh we have enough production capability

2990
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:01,600
to take care of the entire country

2991
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,639
next year uh no problem we've spent the

2992
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:05,520
last two years

2993
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:06,639
focused on uh building out our our

2994
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,480
facilities

2995
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:10,239
and basically taking everything that we

2996
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:11,039
