2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:11,939
vaguely remember when I started hearing

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,830
about fake marijuana on local news

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,378
stations it sold under the brand names

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,329
like spice and k2 I didn't pay much

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,000
attention because you know come on fake

7
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:23,549
marijuana fig marijuana is oregano that

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,050
some rookie accidentally buys but one

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,599
time I came across it and they didn't

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,699
refer to it as fake marijuana instead

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,980
they called it synthetic cannabinoids

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,039
and it was then that they had my total

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,980
attention fake marijuana is a stupid

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,869
name synthetic cannabinoids is specific

15
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,250
enough and shows enough understanding of

16
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:43,409
the plant that I decided it was worth

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,299
searching online and I'll be darned

18
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:47,640
people were actually making synthetic

19
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,828
cannabinoids in a laboratory and selling

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,009
it on the street and folks were getting

21
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,679
[ __ ] up folks were having outlandish

22
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,599
side effects like blurred vision

23
00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:00,628
vomiting seizures hallucinations heart

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,579
attacks and some folks even died the

25
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:05,609
crazy thing is that calling it fake

26
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,579
marijuana is just totally untrue and

27
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:10,618
really lazy journalism somebody made

28
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,200
cannabinoids in a lab that do not even

29
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,299
occur in the marijuana plant these are

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,100
totally not of nature they may

31
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,020
technically be in the same chemical

32
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,478
class as what is in a real plant

33
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:24,629
cannabis sativa but they really have 0

34
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:27,478
in common in nature that said synthetic

35
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:29,459
cannabinoids why they exist and how they

36
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,289
made it out of the laboratory and for

37
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,259
sale at your local gas station is a

38
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,299
really interesting story if you enjoy

39
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,978
hearing frank discussions that dive deep

40
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,659
in the cannabis health business and

Greger demon and today we're going to

55
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:09,689
talk about synthetic cannabinoids greg

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,000
is a neurophysiologist with expertise in

57
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,560
the endocannabinoid system he has

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,818
received research support

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,439
from the National Institute on Drug

60
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:18,238

00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:19,889
Foundation and his articles have

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,189
appeared in journals such as nature

63
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:24,449
neuroscience trends and neuroscience and

64
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:26,579
neuropsychopharmacology his ongoing

65
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:28,799
research while an assistant professor of

66
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,660
biology at Eckerd College includes the

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,370
molecular physiology of cannabinoid

68
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,669
receptors in their evolution within

69
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,409
neural systems welcome to the show Greg

70
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:39,689
hey Chango thanks for having me I'm glad

71
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,549
that you can be on so you know before we

72
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,919
get into synthetic cannabinoids let's

73
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,500
review what actually are naturally

74
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:50,039
occurring cannabinoids so that people

75
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,449
can see the contrast sure what it's

76
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,909
going to be easy for your audience to

77
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:56,488
realize that the naturally occurring

78
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:58,500
cannabinoids as their name implies are

79
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,689
those that are naturally synthesized

80
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,669
from the cannabis plant that's when I

81
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:06,598
think about cannabinoids I'm thinking

82
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:09,059
about that family of molecules that are

83
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:12,329
made by cannabis now I know that there's

84
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,580
more and more interest in other natural

85
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,010
products that have some interaction with

86
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,320
the cannabinoid system like say beta

87
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:22,078
carry a saline is a you know natural

88
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,239
product in black peppers and in cannabis

89
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:28,189
but when I think it cannabinoids i'm

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,989
thinking of THC CBD varieties thereof

91
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:33,599
look at those are the are the real the

92
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:37,259
most popular ones things that come from

93
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,329
the cannabis plant and so you know some

94
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,429
people talk about endocannabinoids you

95
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:43,349
know the the endogenous cannabinoids

96
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,510
that are produced inside the human body

97
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,150
then other folks are talking about fight

98
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:51,269
okinawa dodes that uh you know phyto

99
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,959
meaning coming from the plant our

100
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:57,030
synthetic cannabinoids neither of those

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,120
therefore they are they are a third

102
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,709
thing you know yeah I think I'm as a

103
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,730
third thing and I like those

104
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,859
distinctions of course the

105
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:07,169
endocannabinoids are as natural as can

106
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:10,439
be that's really waxed and my time

107
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:14,189
mostly thinking about and our are found

108
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:17,100
all throughout animals and if the plants

109
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:20,339
have molecules that we now see as

110
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,320
endocannabinoids like an and amide phyto

111
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,478
cannabinoids come from the plants and

112
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,699
mostly I'm thinking about cannabis you

113
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,269
one could use synthetic chemistry to

114
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,978
make

115
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:35,189
a a cannabinoid like THC can be made

116
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:37,110
synthetically you know and it is and so

117
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:42,598
if that would be a synthetic or semi

118
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:44,189
synthetic cannabinoid in my view but if

119
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:46,378
it's just mimicking a natural

120
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:48,269
cannabinoid it may be gray area most of

121
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:52,949
what we call synthetic cannabinoids are

122
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:55,500
chemical structural analogs that are

123
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:59,759
based on either the phyto cannabinoids

124
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,038
or the endocannabinoids but tweaked a

125
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,069
little bit at a different atom here

126
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:07,199
there give it a proprietary new look to

127
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:08,819
see if it can act in the body a little

128
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,400
differently a little stronger a little

129
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,229
longer less psychoactive that kind of

130
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:17,339
thing right on that makes a lot of sense

131
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:18,899
so you know when when k2 and spice came

132
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,750
out and people started talking about

133
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:24,508
them as being you know fake pot or or

134
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,968
synthetic cannabinoids I remembered you

135
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:30,509
know anybody who's a cannabis enthusiast

136
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:32,848
was just you know it makes you pull your

137
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:35,129
hair yea verily why on earth would you

138
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:37,439
do something so evil with something so

139
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:39,598
natural and beautiful but you know as I

140
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,550
got into this doing my research you know

141
00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:43,528
for the show today I actually realized

142
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,810
that the synthetic cannabinoids were

143
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:47,098
made you know for the good of humans

144
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,430
would you go ahead and tell us that

145
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:52,918
story well yeah I mean what we call

146
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,139
synthetics I mean they came out of the

147
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,560
research endeavor the research

148
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,939
environment because the people who

149
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,759
understand sort of the narrative of

150
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:04,550
discovery may not get that but honestly

151
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,259
I mean when we celebrate the zendo

152
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:10,439
endocannabinoid system the receptors and

153
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:13,288
the and the ligands that the

154
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:16,918
endocannabinoids themselves in some way

155
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:20,189
we really owe that to synthetic drug

156
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:23,098
tools case in point I mean some of the

157
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:25,439
hot potent THC analogues were discovered

158
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:28,649
in the were synthesized and created like

159
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:34,879
in the 70s and 80s and they were just

160
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:34,879
chemical structural analogs of TAC and

161
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:39,968
pharmacologists we didn't know what CB

162
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:42,338
recept cv1 cb2 receptors were

163
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:44,918
but they knew that this drug looked like

164
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:47,439
TC it was made to look like THC and it

165
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:50,528
was much more strong much stronger than

166
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:54,699
TAC in like how it affected rodent

167
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:58,178
behavior especially and then some

168
00:06:54,699 --> 00:07:01,809
chemists stuck a little radioactive

169
00:06:58,178 --> 00:07:05,198
probe on it made it hot leg into what we

170
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:07,779
call a radio isotope that's a weekly

171
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,809
radio active and those synthetic

172
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:13,588
cannabinoids became probes that were

173
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:17,169
used to probe around brain tissue in

174
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:18,879
experimental animals and and discover

175
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:20,918
that in fact there was a specific

176
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,139
receptor it's how the receptor was

177
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:28,269
initially discovered was a binding site

178
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:30,668
for these synthetic THC analogs then as

179
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:33,069
the receptor was discovered the

180
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:35,139
endocannabinoids were discovered amongst

181
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:37,679
the and I was just getting into the

182
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:41,439
field at that point and at a young age

183
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:43,088
and the there was so much excitement

184
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,399
amongst the small field of

185
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:48,009
endocannabinoids researchers but those

186
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:49,869
can have cannabis cannabinoid

187
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,538
researchers who were chemists were

188
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:57,129
continuing to tweak the molecules and

189
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:59,438
try to come up with with analogs of an

190
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:01,838
anime ador ta see that could be more

191
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,149
specific or maybe a more useful

192
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:07,360
therapeutic or just used as a research

193
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:11,110
tool to figure out hey is cb1 doing this

194
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,239
or a CB to doing this it is it

195
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,249
responsible for something that's seen in

196
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:17,998
the lab and you don't know unless you

197
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:22,989
can specifically activate or block them

198
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:25,329
with synthetic drugs and so as far as

199
00:08:22,988 --> 00:08:27,038
you know a lot of people don't I mean I

200
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:29,528
didn't even know when I first got into

201
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:32,528
this you know the idea that has a lab

202
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:37,000
tool so can you kind of explain a little

203
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:40,418
bit how building a lab tool to be used

204
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,269
in an experiments as helpful because

205
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:45,970
sometimes you need to run a test that

206
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:50,230
that the molecule you need doesn't

207
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:54,089
actually exist in nature yeah I mean in

208
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:58,240
a general sense you said it quite what

209
00:08:54,089 --> 00:09:01,709
it's it mean the brain is so complicated

210
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:06,610
the pharmacology of our bodies are so

211
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:11,049
complicated that trying to get

212
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:16,120
specificity of a of a drug that hits

213
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:18,189
certain targets and not others it is not

214
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,629
something that you necessarily have I

215
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,149
mean it's not something you have in the

216
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:24,519
cannabis plant those molecules are

217
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:28,629
actually the phyto cannabinoids are

218
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:31,000
actually delightfully wide acting I mean

219
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:32,828
it gets a bad rap historically to say

220
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,470
it's a dirty drug because th Co hit

221
00:09:32,828 --> 00:09:37,409
multiple things it come to find out I

222
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,940
think that's a big part of why it's a

223
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:40,958
surprisingly gentle kind of medicine

224
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,870
that you have this entourage of

225
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:49,419
molecules that hit so many things I

226
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:51,639
digress a little bit with that I mean as

227
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:54,370
a tool to try and figure out the fine

228
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:57,699
nuts and bolts of how these this unseen

229
00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:00,339
world of molecules in our mind work you

230
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,980
have to develop specific compounds that

231
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:05,980
really target them or in the world of

232
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,259
genetics tinker with an animal so that

233
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,209
it has slightly different receptors I'm

234
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:12,458
not saying all of this is necessary to

235
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:14,349
come up with the best medicine as part

236
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:17,649
of where the disconnect is but it is

237
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:20,889
necessary for this quest to understand

238
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:23,259
how things work right on so to kind of

239
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:25,179
like summarize that you know dr. Hoffman

240
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:27,730
and others in those early days they were

241
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:29,769
developing these synthetic cannabinoids

242
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,899
not because they ever intended them to

243
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:34,870
become a product but because they for

244
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:38,019
example wanted to take a receptor and

245
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,990
say okay well natural cannabinoids can

246
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:44,049
can you know highlight this receptor up

247
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:46,329
to you know forty percent but but what

248
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:48,789
would it take to open up all the way to

249
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:50,979
a hundred percent or whatever and those

250
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:53,620
those didn't exist in nature but they

251
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,500
wanted to see what it would take to to

252
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,929
open it up all the way and so they may

253
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,909
made fake ones synthetic ones to see

254
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:02,649
what it would take and then maybe you

255
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:04,159
know after the fact they would try to

256
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:05,720
find something that in

257
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,240
nature that acted the same way so

258
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,430
essentially they're kind of like they're

259
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,948
kind of like crutches to move the

260
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:15,679
research on which aren't really ever

261
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:18,109
supposed to get out of the lab perhaps

262
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:21,169
yeah I mean in a way I see it that way I

263
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,568
mean it developing a tool like I made

264
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:26,269
that example without full much

265
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:28,909
forethought but how the tools were used

266
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:31,250
as probes to find the receptor to work

267
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:33,740
to work experimentally it's got to be

268
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:38,240
it's going to be a better molecule as a

269
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:41,448
probe if it binds more tightly than THC

270
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,188
does and though binding tightly isn't

271
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:45,708
synonymous with being a POW more

272
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:49,240
powerful potent drug it tends to check

273
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:55,219
that way so these super powerful

274
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:57,649
activators that are like a thousand

275
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,910
times more potent than THC they were

276
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:04,759
developed as a tool to be strong binding

277
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:06,769
ligands drugs now you know when you say

278
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,269
that the drugs were never meant to be

279
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:11,720
out of the lab I mean it's not like

280
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:13,399
these medicinal chemists are open to it

281
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,100
becoming a product I mean when they

282
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:19,730
synthesize a series of things John

283
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:24,319
Houseman at Clemson developed at jwh

284
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:26,319
series of drugs that is his initials and

285
00:12:24,318 --> 00:12:28,789
and there are other like real eminent

286
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:31,399
chemists who have done stuff including

287
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:34,458
rough you missoula my mean the series of

288
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:37,278
drugs called hu hu 210 is 1 i've used

289
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:39,258
experimentally it's a very strong THC

290
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:42,379
analog and it has appeared in some of

291
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:45,379
these illicit spice products not as many

292
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:47,720
as the jwh series because they're easier

293
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:51,828
to synthesize by the clandestine

294
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,870
chemists who whip them up and so you

295
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:56,269
know here's a thing science scientists

296
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,459
aren't so they may have been open to the

297
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:59,929
idea that this could be a therapeutic

298
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,969
and then course they would patent it and

299
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:04,818
spin it off and that's you know not

300
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:08,269
outside their thinking but you know when

301
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:10,519
they go to scientific conferences and

302
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:12,889
say here's this drug in it works to

303
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,438
target this population of receptors and

304
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:16,990
not this one and in our animal model it

305
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:18,659
shows hey it might be useful for

306
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,970
diabetes or so

307
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:23,189
saying in a way that won't make you high

308
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,410
I mean these are these are trying to

309
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,440
scientists chemists trying to contribute

310
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:31,469
to their view of the greater good and

311
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,600
developing therapeutics and in the

312
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,028
process of giving scientific talks and

313
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,790
publishing papers you know they show

314
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:41,159
what the molecule is and someone with a

315
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:45,240
decent organic chemistry background can

316
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:48,149
look at molecules like the jwh series

317
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,188
that look a lot like a arachidonic acid

318
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:53,100
and Ananda mind things that are very

319
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:56,188
easy to obtain and they can make it in

320
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,689
the lab so you open these things up

321
00:13:56,188 --> 00:14:00,328
there's all there's all kinds of

322
00:13:57,688 --> 00:14:04,110
parallels with the other you know

323
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:06,149
serotonin reuptake psychedelics I mean a

324
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,669
lot of drugs that were developed as

325
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:14,188
research tools got out into a club scene

326
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:17,250
and some of them have led to fatal

327
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:21,360
overdoses right on so we're going to

328
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:23,250
talk more about their uses bye bye you

329
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,600
know recreational drug users after the

330
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,198
first break but before we go to

331
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,370
commercial I wanted to ask you you know

332
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,528
when I first got into researching

333
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,759
synthetics I kind of thought that people

334
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:36,629
were developing the synthetic

335
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:39,060
cannabinoids because using real cannabis

336
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:41,698
was so restricted in research by the

337
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:44,159
federal government that they had to

338
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,838
create other synthetics and I've heard

339
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,549
this from other people but now hearing

340
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,170
you talk about it it sounds like

341
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:52,528
synthetic cannabinoids would be useful

342
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:55,049
as tools in the laboratory regardless if

343
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:58,470
the if the research scientist had access

344
00:14:55,049 --> 00:15:00,990
to real whole plant cannabinoids is that

345
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,449
true I think it is true but what you

346
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:05,519
said I mean I wouldn't be surprised if

347
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:08,849
that has entered into the equation

348
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,818
either I mean there you know when a lot

349
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,889
of these drugs were were developed they

350
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:15,958
were already hundreds of labs interested

351
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:21,028
or at least dozens and cannabinoids

352
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:22,799
there are now thousands and yeah I mean

353
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:26,370
developing something that could get

354
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:28,258
around the DEA scheduling because it's

355
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,509
so proprietary

356
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:32,249
would have been an advantage but a lot

357
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:35,159
of the synthetics I mean I remember very

358
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:39,899
well when the hu compounds is suddenly

359
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:41,759
got moved to schedule one and and it put

360
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:44,668
our huge burden on people who are using

361
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,019
it for their research right on that

362
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:47,278
makes sense we're going to go ahead and

363
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,589
take our first short break and be right

364
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,208
back you are listening to shaping fire

365
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:55,109
and my guest today is cannabinoid

366
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:56,548
researcher dr. Greger dhiman now that

367
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:57,869
the health benefits of terpenes have

368
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:59,879
become well known in the cannabis

369
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:01,379
industry people everywhere are looking

370
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:03,359
for the purest terpenes without

371
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,949
adulterants the problem with most

372
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:06,989
chirping providers is that they're not

373
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:09,538
sourced naturally and instead are made

374
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:12,028
as a byproduct of refining petroleum and

375
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:13,859
that's so sketchy the terpenes sold by

376
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:16,769
true terpenes are entirely different

377
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:18,449
they are certified organic non-gmo and

378
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:21,089
food grade that means that they are

379
00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:23,008
extracted from real plant sources there

380
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:25,079
are no solvents of any kind they are

381
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:28,438
distilled only with steam that's right

382
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:30,088
only steam in fact terpenes from true

383
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:32,368
turbines are so pure that you can eat

384
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,679
them not only that but you can stack

385
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:36,778
them with better results too what I mean

386
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:38,909
is other companies turbines have got a

387
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:40,859
few percent of impurities and when you

388
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:43,078
stack those terpenes to make your blend

389
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:45,509
you're adding a variety of impurities

390
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:46,918
that degrade your final product true

391
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:49,288
terpenes also have strain-specific

392
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:51,480
turbines for a wide range of cannabis

393
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:54,028
strains like durban poison sunset

394
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,980
sherbet and granddaddy purple true

395
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:57,869

experience if you are a cannabis product

407
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:23,730
developer these are the terps you want

408
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:26,219
to add to your oil or edible or capsule

409
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,620
or whatever true terpenes are simply the

410
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,839
best your money can buy don't try and

411
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:33,658
make a premium product with substandard

412
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:36,839
terms choose true terpenes for a

413
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:40,169
top-shelf experience go to shaping fire

414

calm board flash true terpenes to find

415
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:42,580
out more or

416
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:44,589
on the link in this week's newsletter

417
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:46,750
welcome back you are listening to

418
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:48,638
shaping fire i am your host Shango Lohse

419
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,490
and our guest this week is cannabinoid

420
00:17:48,638 --> 00:17:53,439
researcher dr. Greger diamond so before

421
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,179
the break we were talking about the

422
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,330
development of synthetic cannabinoids

423
00:17:55,179 --> 00:18:00,788
and their beneficial original uses that

424
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:03,278
they were being used for in the lab well

425
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:05,440
you know right towards the end we were

426
00:18:03,278 --> 00:18:08,220
talking about how they got out into the

427
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,630
open and they started being produced by

428
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,788
folks who want we're more interested in

429
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:15,759
using them as an enlisted or at the very

430
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:19,089
least recreational drug for for just

431
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:21,759
drug users can you kind of explain Greg

432
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:25,329
how that works how does this information

433
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:28,720
that's being used in the lab get into

434
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:30,730
the possession of somebody who sees you

435
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,360
know an opportunity to make money as a

436
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:37,389
street drug with it well I can speak in

437
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:40,028
general ways to it I mean I'm not privy

438
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:42,878
to the route with which really any of

439
00:18:40,028 --> 00:18:45,759
these escape from the lab in specific

440
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:48,189
but you know people publish their

441
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:54,808
science and discuss it at conferences at

442
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:58,179
in open ways and someone who is a savvy

443
00:18:54,808 --> 00:19:00,308
organic chemist can look at structures

444
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,409
especially if there's a publication they

445
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:05,859
found that talks about the synthesis I

446
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:09,309
mean I think that some of these some of

447
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:11,918
these drugs whether they're in the first

448
00:19:09,308 --> 00:19:16,329
papers that use them or in patent

449
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:19,240
filings described the synthesis so what

450
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:21,189
you need is some glassware and burners

451
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,970
and knowledge about how to do synthetic

452
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:27,009
chemistry and you can do it if you've

453
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,288
got that chemistry background yeah and

454
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:31,349
it's interesting too because you know

455
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:34,658
they're there are to a certain degree

456
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:36,459
you know how to guides in in the

457
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:39,009
appendix right because a lot of these

458
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,288
papers you know they give you the the

459
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:43,419
data and the research and explanation in

460
00:19:41,288 --> 00:19:45,308
the main body but man there's a treasure

461
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:47,759
trove of good stuff in the appendix a

462
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:50,558
lot of these papers that really give you

463
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,500
give you secrets so how do you make it

464
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,420
in your own lab at home if you've got

465
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,119
the right apparatus if you some of the

466
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,680
require certain precursor molecules that

467
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:03,629
are not just something you go get at the

468
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,740
store but you know I mean those

469
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,900
compounds that are easy to synthesize

470
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:11,079
and are so potent that's the thing I

471
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,850
mean with some of these synthetics again

472
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:18,369
are a thousand or ten thousand times

473
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:22,719
more active at cb1 receptors than THC is

474
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:24,509
so it you know you think about testing

475
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,789
cannabis or something with key force to

476
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:30,390
elevate the THC content these people use

477
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:33,970
various whatever cheap dried herbs and

478
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,890
just spritz a little bit of these super

479
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,779
potent cannabinoids on now and then and

480
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,850
it's enough that at least sometimes it's

481
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:42,970
going to cause a powerful psychoactive

482
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:45,129
effect so you know I'm sure that there's

483
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,230
some people are alike Wow thousand times

484
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:50,860
stronger than THC get me some of that

485
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:53,589
but it was when when you know start to

486
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:55,329
research you know phyto cannabinoids you

487
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:58,389
find that they're all kind of they've

488
00:20:55,329 --> 00:21:01,829
all got a braking system inside of them

489
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:04,900
so that you can't is so it doesn't act

490
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:07,029
open-ended ly on your endocannabinoid

491
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,990
system would you explain a little bit

492
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:13,869
why you know using synthetics is so much

493
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:16,900
more dangerous than using a naturally

494
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:19,119
occurring phyto cannabinoid well I think

495
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,730
the way to talk about it is breaking

496
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:24,479
down how drugs work under two different

497
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:28,269
terms that are very different to a

498
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,299
pharmacologist one is potency and the

499
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:32,950
other is efficacy and this is jargon

500
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:34,659
people wouldn't know the difference when

501
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,900
you're talking about it drugs about

502
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,640
drugs if they haven't studied it but

503
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,550
potency means you know the concentration

504
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,700
of a drug how much do you need in order

505
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:49,599
to elicit its maximal effect or like

506
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,610
half maximal effect and we use that term

507
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,089
potency very generally like oh there's

508
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:59,769
more THC and pot so it's more potent now

509
00:21:54,089 --> 00:22:03,069
but to a pharmacologist potency the

510
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:04,809
potency of THC is the potency of THC if

511
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:06,700
you have more than you just have a

512
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:07,480
higher concentration so you're pushing

513
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,870
the effect

514
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:15,349
but THC in different cells and tissues

515
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:17,928
of your body or any molecule but just

516
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:21,469
take th see it has because that's the

517
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:24,288
problem child of cannabis right THC will

518
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:27,169
still only activate and turn on that

519
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:32,048
receptor to a certain extent it maxes

520
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:34,970
out and that is the property of the THC

521
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:37,398
receptor relationship that's referred to

522
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:40,640
as efficacy and that's what protects all

523
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:41,750
of us cannabis users from from having a

524
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,690
bad day that's why there's been zero

525
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:48,140
deaths that's why what advice is safe

526
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:51,288
herb to use is because of this just cap

527
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:54,140
if you will that nature intended well

528
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:56,859
the final cannabinoid certainly have a

529
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,600
certain limited bit considered partial

530
00:22:56,859 --> 00:23:02,750
efficacy agonist or just partial agonist

531
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,519
so yeah THC has its own sort of limiting

532
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:07,640
step so to speak and we didn't know that

533
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:09,319
honestly until all these synthetics were

534
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,140
made for the various reasons we talked

535
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:13,700
about before the break and and you

536
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,288
suddenly you have a drug wow wait a

537
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,740
minute we thought TC was turning the

538
00:23:15,288 --> 00:23:21,230
system on but you wash on this CP

539
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,839
compound and it's like a thousand times

540
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:27,620
it's active at a thousand times smaller

541
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:29,359
dose that's potency and it drives the

542
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:30,619
system stronger it doesn't it's not

543
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,558
going to have a thousand times the

544
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:35,808
efficacy it has a thousand times the

545
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:37,428
potency but what we do know and this is

546
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:40,428
still growing we're learning more about

547
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:42,919
these different synthetics they not only

548
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:45,080
push the receptor system to a higher

549
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:47,028
level than anything the plant will do

550
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:49,308
especially if it's within an entourage

551
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:52,669
with molecules like CBD that will help

552
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:54,408
temper THC but even if you've got a

553
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:56,600
straight THC and a lot of it you know

554
00:23:54,409 --> 00:24:00,559
like some sort of straight THC dab or

555
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:03,589
something taking a synthetic that has a

556
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:07,278
higher efficacy or a higher intrinsic

557
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:09,408
activity we also say we'll do more than

558
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,690
that high level of THC because it pushes

559
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:15,049
the receptor further it's a molecular

560
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,700
property and I'll plug a little bit I

561
00:24:15,048 --> 00:24:19,099
wrote something about this that was over

562
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,710
on project CBDs website recently if

563
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:23,889
people want to look that up

564
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:27,009
oh right on yeah and you should everyone

565
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:30,190
should know about project CBD org not

566
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:32,679
only is it a great repository for for

567
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:34,240
research like Greg is referring to but

568
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,250
also they've got a great section on the

569
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,190
website where you can go and click on

570
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,569
the word conditions and it goes down i

571
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,700
don't know maybe fifty different

572
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:44,678
conditions that you may have as a human

573
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,919
and it gives you easy links to the

574
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:48,940
Western science that's been done about

575
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,538
cannabinoids in that in that condition

576
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:55,480
so we're both big fans of project CVD

577
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:57,069
org yeah and i felt i hope the kind of

578
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,500
curate those lists over time and i

579
00:24:57,069 --> 00:25:00,970
advise if emma lon right well thanks for

580
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,390
that work because i use them with

581
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:07,990
patients all the time so so what is the

582
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:10,240
experience that a user an end user would

583
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:13,480
have experiencing some of these

584
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,710
synthetics that have got you know so

585
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:20,230
much increased potency well you know one

586
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,899
thing is that it'll knock you on your

587
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:26,409
ass i mean it can well for one thing

588
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:27,788
inning it's there's absolutely if people

589
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:29,919
think it's tough to know what's in your

590
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:32,829
cannabis i mean these products that are

591
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,710
sold as you know spice products there

592
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:38,980
may be nothing in there but but you may

593
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,899
get some super potent agonist and you

594
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:44,110
know for example is several of us in the

595
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:46,750
field know someone who was an early used

596
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:49,119
synthesizer of this or tester of one of

597
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:54,339
these drugs and and tried some on

598
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:57,759
himself and was like literally unable to

599
00:25:54,339 --> 00:26:00,668
move for like 48 hours and i won't drop

600
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,980
this person's name but it was terrifying

601
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:05,649
i mean you talk about someone compare

602
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,048
that to the worst you know brownie over

603
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:11,528
ingestion that you possibly can have and

604
00:26:08,048 --> 00:26:15,609
it's not it's not the same it alright

605
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:19,000
curiously it is somewhat similar to what

606
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:21,729
happens in rodents i mean you can give

607
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,009
TAC at such high levels to a rat that

608
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,720
he's unable to move and though it's been

609
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:28,179
known for a long time it's called a

610
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,579
cataleptic response you can like lift up

611
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:33,250
the animals legs and stuff and he just

612
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:34,220
can't move that's what these and THC

613
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,589
doesn't do that too

614
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,259
people I mean you can be totally out

615
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:41,599
there from a super high dose but it

616
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:43,990
doesn't make you an able to move and

617
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:47,509
some of these super potent agonist I

618
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:49,308
believe can the other though I think the

619
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:52,960
more alarming a thing is that

620
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:55,879
cannabinoids do have cardiovascular

621
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,380
effects they affect your heart rate they

622
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,309
affect the dilation of your blood

623
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:04,309
vessels the endocannabinoids are used to

624
00:27:01,308 --> 00:27:06,950
help maintain an optimal balance with

625
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:10,928
blood flow and cardiovascular tone like

626
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:13,640
that the phyto cannabinoids do influence

627
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,409
these things hence you know you can have

628
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,740
sort of a postural drop in blood

629
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:21,230
pressure if you smoke smoke a bowl and

630
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,788
and get a high THC that lowers your

631
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:29,210
blood pressure it can make you need to

632
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:32,058
sit down the and it letici elicits a

633
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:35,150
transient increase in heart rate the

634
00:27:32,058 --> 00:27:37,668
synthetics do so much more and those

635
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:40,700
increases in heart rate those quick

636
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:43,700
dynamic changes in blood flow very

637
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:46,159
possibly or increasing the risk for

638
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,319
suffering a cardiovascular incident like

639
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,299
a stroke and there's literature to

640
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,819
suggest that there are I've talked to

641
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:56,000
multiple neurologists who they haven't

642
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:57,288
you know done a controlled study but

643
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,179
they're convinced it's real because

644
00:27:57,288 --> 00:28:00,859
they've seen people who have taken these

645
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:03,650
synthetics and of our suffering

646
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:07,009
significant strokes at ages where it's

647
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:09,500
not common and and that has been used to

648
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:12,259
malign cannabis as well because that

649
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:16,400
literature will pop up and people from

650
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:18,349
like whatever project Sam or something

651
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,210
will say oh yeah we know that cannabis

652
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:22,369
increases the risk of stroke but they're

653
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,950
citing papers that are looking at its

654
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:28,879
synthetic cannabinoid that is not just

655
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:31,190
fake THC is a super potent full agonist

656
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,590
instead of a partial agonist it does

657
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:36,169
things to your receptor system drives it

658
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:38,119
more powerfully causes it to activate

659
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:42,020
cells and ways to teach he doesn't even

660
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:44,479
at heroic doses so we don't I couldn't

661
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:46,730
tell you all the reasons why it these

662
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,870
synthetics are likely to be more

663
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,450
dangerous

664
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:52,789
just named a couple of them but there

665
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,740
may be others in it it won't be known

666
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:57,109
unless it's really studied carefully and

667
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,269
in the meantime people should pursue a

668
00:28:57,109 --> 00:29:01,519
more natural alternative it's been safe

669
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:03,950
for thousands of years yeah I think

670
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,859
that's really the end point as far as

671
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:10,069
the the end consumer of these it's like

672
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:13,099
okay well we recognize that your you

673
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:15,319
know you're using spice or k2 or any one

674
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:16,879
of these marketed products because you

675
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:19,009
know it's written it's available you can

676
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,559
buy it at you know the local bodega or

677
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:23,569
you're partying or whatever and you know

678
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:26,289
maybe where you live cannabis is hard to

679
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:29,689
get but just because it's synthetic

680
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:30,589
cannabinoids it doesn't mean that it is

681
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,080
going to your head and have an

682
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:36,319
experience that's in any way like like

683
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:38,178
safe natural marijuana that's been you

684
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,220
know you used interaction with with

685
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:42,559
humans for thousands of years this is

686
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:45,460
more like some crazy frankenstein

687
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:48,049
version of it with none of the natural

688
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,990
safeguards that come with using whole

689
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:52,428
plant cannabis ray yeah I mean there's

690
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,200
natural safeguards and there's the

691
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:56,720
safeguards with people who are are

692
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,420
trying to create a medicine as opposed

693
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,759
to just you know trying to make a buck

694
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,740
yeah right on that makes sense well

695
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,879
let's go ahead and take our second short

696
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,460
break when we come back we're going to

697
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,429
talk about a potential for synthetic

698
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:12,289
cannabinoids be useful in the future you

699
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:14,269
are listening to shaving fire and my

700
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:18,019
guest today is cannabinoid researcher

701
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:20,150
dr. Greg tournament for anyone who is

702
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:22,220
paying attention to cannabis medicine it

703
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,470
has become incredibly apparent that full

704
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,839
extract cannabis oil known to some as

705
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:29,029
rick simpson oil is the cornerstone of

706
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:31,549
healing humans with medical marijuana if

707
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:33,379
you own a medical dispensary or retail

708
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:36,440
store you know that your customers are

709
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,970
asking for it every single day and if

710
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,610
you have been working with patients and

711
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:42,650
seeking out quality full extract oil in

712
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:45,619
the Pacific Northwest you know the

713
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:47,929
provider deep green cat Jeter and her

714
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:50,329
team at deep green had been making full

715
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:52,550
extract cannabis oil and setting the

716
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:55,069
standards for quality and exact dosing

717
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:57,289
for years in Washington state the deep

718
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:59,509
green brand is known by patients and

719
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:01,700
cannabis media as a premium quality

720
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:04,638
provider for sick children

721
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,110
cancer patients and others in need at a

722
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:08,359
time when there are no national

723
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:10,819
standards for cannabis oil ensuring a

724
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:13,189
product as whole plant quality assured

725
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:16,849
and lab tested is often a matter of

726
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:18,860
knowing your sources reputable trust and

727
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:20,898
a quality brand is essential in choosing

728
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:23,269
a cannabis medicine that is going to be

729
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:25,219
used concentrated and in volume by any

730
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:28,250
patient and especially those with

731
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,409
weakened immune systems deep green is

732
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:32,538
looking for national brand partners to

733
00:31:30,409 --> 00:31:35,028
expand the availability of their legacy

734
00:31:32,538 --> 00:31:37,970
top-shelf cannabis oil to emerging

735
00:31:35,028 --> 00:31:39,409
medical and licensed states partners

736
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,839
benefit from the deep green brand

737
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:43,639
recognition and credibility as well as

738
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,428
ongoing customer and marketing support

739
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:49,129
not only that but deep green knows how

740
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:51,950
to employ the 280e tax rule so you can

741
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:53,750
deduct it all from your taxes working

742
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:56,240
with deep green can provide the trust

743
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:59,000
and authenticity too often pushed aside

744
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,798
in favor of lifestyle products your

745
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,630
customers can assure themselves that

746
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,599
regardless of the state in which it is

747
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,278
made grand licensees adhere to the same

748
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,469
strict standards that patients

749
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:12,500
everywhere have come to expect from deep

750
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:14,630
green deep green licensing includes

751
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,308
startup and capital planning as well as

752
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:19,070
operational and manufacturing

753
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:21,558
instruction as you'd expect for more

754
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:23,569
information on how your company co-op or

755
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:25,460
medical dispensary can benefit from

756
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:28,308
partnering with deep green to provide

757
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:32,329
full extract canna soil to patients go

758

to connect with cat Jeter and her team

760
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:40,429
that's shaping fire calm forward slash

761
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:42,349
deep green welcome back you are

762
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:44,210
listening to shaping fire i am your host

763
00:32:42,349 --> 00:32:46,730
Shango low so i guess this week is

764
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:49,659
cannabinoid researcher dr. Greger dhiman

765
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,679
so Greg you know we kind of trashed

766
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:54,470
synthetic cannabinoids pretty hardcore

767
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,210
in the last set but you know we know

768
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:59,149
that they came out of a lab where they

769
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:01,990
were you know trying to do good research

770
00:32:59,148 --> 00:33:03,859
you know do you see a future in

771
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:05,870
pharmaceuticals for synthetic

772
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:09,408
cannabinoids to be used for something

773
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:12,199
that's you know positive I see that it

774
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:15,040
certainly could happen I mean you know

775
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,500
for for 20 years now

776
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,839
in researching in this field you know I

777
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,380
can't tell you how many grant proposals

778
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:27,609
or sort of paper discussion taglines

779
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:30,040
have sort of played the language that we

780
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:31,929
could develop more specific drugs or

781
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:34,029
that our have a better profile

782
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:38,170
specifically that don't have the kind of

783
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:39,759
psycho activity that cannabis does and I

784
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:43,000
mean as we learn more about the

785
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:46,329
endocannabinoid system being everywhere

786
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,109
in the body you know I read a read of

787
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:52,179
paper the other day by you know some big

788
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:54,189
research team not a usual suspect

789
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,279
cannabinoid team I mean so many people

790
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:59,170
on the cannabinoids and they said very

791
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:01,389
straight forward in their paper the

792
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:05,070
endocannabinoid system is now seen as a

793
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:08,760
mast as V they use the word V master

794
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:11,668
regulator of physiological homeostasis

795
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,860
that kind of thing if I to set it in

796
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:17,889
1999 I'd have been you know laughed out

797
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,780
of the room and now we so we know the

798
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:23,319
importance of the endocannabinoid system

799
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,880
its robust its diverse and there are

800
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:29,500
many different targets and some

801
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:33,640
synthetics may be developed that have

802
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:37,719
better delivery better a longer lasting

803
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:39,668
effect something of those nature that

804
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:42,189
nature that makes it very usable by

805
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:45,579
physicians and could target specific

806
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:48,220
things like maybe there's a subset of

807
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:52,000
mitochondrial disease that as we learn

808
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:54,730
more that certain synthetics like target

809
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,889
really well and on the other hand maybe

810
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:59,289
some of the minority cannabinoids that

811
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:01,449
have been terribly understudied might

812
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:05,440
treat those populations as well too so I

813
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:07,569
think there's promise in both i and also

814
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,780
you know synthetic cannabinoids can be

815
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:12,670
used in researching you know full plan

816
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,960
natural cannabinoids too because you

817
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,360
know they're just they're being used in

818
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,159
the experiments as well so maybe maybe

819
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,380
there may be synthetic cannabinoids can

820
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,849
still be used maybe maybe not as

821
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,960
pharmaceutical products but they

822
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:26,630
certainly seem to have

823
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,179
uses in the lab in conducting your

824
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:33,230
experiments oh for sure for sure they do

825
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:35,690
and drugs that block receptors are very

826
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,579
useful tools drugs that have different

827
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:40,309
little labels on them that you can see

828
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:41,869
them on brain scans have tools but you

829
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:44,559
know what funds and drives brain

830
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:46,820
research is the promise of discovering

831
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,889
treatments and cures for brain disease

832
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,390
primarily I mean I'm a total science

833
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:53,769
geek I'm all about our drive to

834
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:56,929
understand how it works but primarily

835
00:35:53,769 --> 00:36:01,190
research is funded to find new tools and

836
00:35:56,929 --> 00:36:03,889
I mean new treatments and and Jersey

837
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:05,480
even some some synthetic tools could be

838
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:07,819
useful for that even if the end result

839
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,650
is I mean I should back up some

840
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:12,980
synthetic tools will be useful for that

841
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:14,570
are useful for that even if we should be

842
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:17,030
able to step back from the end result

843
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:19,700
and say maybe the best answer

844
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:22,339
therapeutically is something that's been

845
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:24,169
here all along oh I love that segue to

846
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:26,838
because the next point I wanted to make

847
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:29,570
is you know as much as as you are

848
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:32,989
positing the possibility of synthetic

849
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:34,849
cannabinoids being useful in for future

850
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:37,669
patients from the pharmaceutical

851
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:41,059
industry I know you to be a whole plant

852
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:43,250
guy like I am and and you know if

853
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:46,070
there's if there's you know X amount of

854
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:48,019
money available for cannabinoid research

855
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,970
I'm guessing that you're going to say

856
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:52,280
put all that money into naturally

857
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:54,259
occurring whole plant medicine and set

858
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,580
aside to synthetic cannabinoids until

859
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,910
we've done a hell of a lot more research

860
00:36:55,579 --> 00:37:01,190
on the plan you know with with apologies

861
00:36:58,909 --> 00:37:02,690
to all of the classical pharmacologists

862
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,909
who have trained me and worked with me

863
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:07,220
yeah I do think I also I don't think

864
00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:09,079
it's a total zero sum game you know

865
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:13,009
within certain Institute's there will be

866
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:15,380
certain budgets for research mostly if

867
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:18,170
the constraints for research weren't

868
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:21,320
there funding would come in to support

869
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:24,680
whole plant cannabis therapeutics and

870
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,330
there are enough really good minds that

871
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:30,139
are fascinated by this because it's the

872
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:32,659
most fascinating subject you know I'm

873
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:35,239
just amazed by how many bright thinkers

874
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:37,529
want to study cannabis if they can and

875
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:40,079
if the constraints to studying it

876
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:43,680
there you know I think that that's where

877
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:46,159
a lot of the the money would go and that

878
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:48,929
is of concern to the sort of traditional

879
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:51,420
pharmaceutical industry I think where

880
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:52,769
they're trying to adapt to it I took

881
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:57,780
your question a little bit of a twist

882
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:59,130
but yeah I mean there is the and it's

883
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,740
the kind of thing that mr. Ullom has

884
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:05,150
been saying like a profit for decades

885
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:09,929
and others but of course he's such a

886
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:13,769
real mentor to so many of us that this

887
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:15,359
plant is a treasure trove and it's just

888
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:17,309
one of the hugest discoveries and we

889
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,230
shouldn't be attached to the fact that

890
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:21,900
it was discovered a long time ago and

891
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:24,079
rediscovered and rediscovered and we now

892
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,880
have the state of Technology to dig

893
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,710
deeper and and do the kind of studies to

894
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,599
understand how these different molecules

895
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:36,389
work and how different preparations work

896
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:38,279
and what they work to help you know I

897
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:40,289
was I was talking to a group two weeks

898
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,260
ago and somebody asked a question during

899
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:45,809
Q&amp;A about synthetic cannabinoid and and

900
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,970
you know I was just getting ready for my

901
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:50,130
my talk with you and I wasn't too deep

902
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:51,509
on it but I said you know what I

903
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:54,210
understand about something that can have

904
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:56,310
annoyed so far is it's as if you were

905
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:58,470
going to judge yourself on your worst

906
00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:00,299
cousin you know your cousin that comes

907
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:02,549
with a party and it's disruptive and

908
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,769
gets drunk and you know hits on your

909
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:07,620
sister-in-law or whatever right you

910
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:10,380
can't judge you know you and your whole

911
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:12,779
family based on that one that one cousin

912
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,670
and synthetic cannabinoids kind of seems

913
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,310
a bit to be like that you can't judge

914
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:21,240
the cannabis plant and all of the

915
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:23,730
healing possibility that it holds just

916
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:25,709
because synthetic cannabinoids found

917
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:28,139
their way out of the lab and are being

918
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:31,590
sold to people who are using it wrong

919
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:34,589
all right level well it mean it's funny

920
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:36,809
because it's like it's like THC has been

921
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:39,600
the bad uncle for a lot at least

922
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:43,259
according to the the propagandists you

923
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:46,799
know and and to an extent the the black

924
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:49,710
market illegality created the you know a

925
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,798
selection for high THC plants many of

926
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,329
which are feeble

927
00:39:50,798 --> 00:39:56,108
things that don't really grow very well

928
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:59,670
but they create a lot of THC and you

929
00:39:56,108 --> 00:40:02,170
know the THC has gotten a bad rap

930
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:04,778
because of simply getting you high at

931
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:08,409
all and we know that molecules like CBD

932
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:10,778
and THC V just to name a couple of

933
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:15,478
tremendous therapeutic value and they've

934
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:18,248
been short shifted because of

935
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:20,259
relationship with THC and now exposing

936
00:40:18,248 --> 00:40:22,478
it this is what drives me nuts when when

937
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:24,759
I see a local news story about fake pot

938
00:40:22,478 --> 00:40:27,248
it's because the media just don't know

939
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:29,559
enough at all or don't care to know that

940
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:32,409
it's not fake pot at all it's a chemical

941
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:36,789
that has never been found in cannabis

942
00:40:32,409 --> 00:40:40,538
ever so it's you know kind of like

943
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:43,599
saying crystal masses fake dopamine you

944
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:45,789
know they have biological interactions

945
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,859
but they're not the same they're not

946
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:51,609
they're not a mimic of one another it's

947
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:53,469
a it's a bad Act right on that's that's

948
00:40:51,608 --> 00:40:57,848
well said so in the end we come full

949
00:40:53,469 --> 00:41:00,818
circle around to holding up the whole

950
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:03,849
plant and the and the Safety's that

951
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:06,068
nature has imbued it with as being are

952
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:07,749
our primary medicine and not something

953
00:41:06,068 --> 00:41:11,889
that's necessarily coming out of the lab

954
00:41:07,748 --> 00:41:13,268
today I believe it yeah well Greg thanks

955
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:15,098
for being on the show you know I had

956
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:16,808
been curious about this for actually

957
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:17,979
actually that's not actually true i was

958
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:19,298
going to say i was curious about this

959
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:21,338
for a long time but most of the time

960
00:41:19,298 --> 00:41:23,588
spice and k2 is just been something i

961
00:41:21,338 --> 00:41:25,239
ignored because had nothing to do with

962
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:27,009
working with patients it was just some

963
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:29,170
crazy stuff i'd see on local news

964
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:32,199
sometimes but then when's the first time

965
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,999
i heard them say you know synthetic

966
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:35,739
cannabinoids I'm like well my whole life

967
00:41:33,998 --> 00:41:38,259
is cannabinoids I guess I should get too

968
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:40,298
worried about this right so even though

969
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:41,920
I understand now better that it's it's

970
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:44,018
you know doesn't really have anything to

971
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,559
do with marijuana except for how the

972
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:49,478
news reports about it I feel far more

973
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:51,579
confident in discussing it with people

974
00:41:49,478 --> 00:41:52,989
and and that I know what the hell I'm

975
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:54,910
talking about so thank you very much for

976
00:41:52,989 --> 00:41:56,259
sharing your experience well you're

977
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:59,498
welcome and of course you know it does

978
00:41:56,259 --> 00:42:01,869
act on a similar path ways it's just

979
00:41:59,498 --> 00:42:03,248
different and it is important because

980
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:04,630
you know wait like in Florida right now

981
00:42:03,248 --> 00:42:07,269
we're dealing with

982
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:09,940
where the industry is getting started in

983
00:42:07,269 --> 00:42:13,719
what I will delicately say is a very

984
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:15,309
clumsy way and it you know the medicines

985
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:17,409
are starting to roll out under the state

986
00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:20,039
legal system and they're they're

987
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:23,199
absurdly expensive they're not

988
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:25,659
