1
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:13,179
hey there shangela sort of shaping fire

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,400
here today and today we're going to do a

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:17,050
little bit something different I've got

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,000
a couple my friends with me this is dan

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,460
from and Laurie and genetics and sebring

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,980
from Sebring seeds and the reason why I

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,669
asked them to join me today was because

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:31,599
you know the back in the medical days

9
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:33,369
growers would breed seeds and give them

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,039
away the patient's because seeds were

11
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:38,649
really hard to get a hold of and

12
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:41,589
nowadays as you know medical becomes

13
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:43,659
more of this green rush thing you know

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:47,080
people are moving into doing seeds

15
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:49,829
primarily for profit and that's a whole

16
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,509
new and different world and as we see

17
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,609
you know as the state goes for medical

18
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:57,759
director a tional a lot of the patient

19
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:59,530
products go away too and so this this

20
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,969
continuing legalization which

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,540
theoretically should be great for

22
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:07,450
patients actually continually impacts

23
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,070
patients in a negative way so as I

24
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,710
travel the countries checking out these

25
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:15,548
new markets I meet more and more people

26
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:18,639
who used to make seeds for patients and

27
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:19,929
then they decided they wanted to you

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,118
know get involved with legalization

29
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:23,618
which is totally legit but a lot of

30
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:26,228
those folks don't make seeds for

31
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:28,209
patients anymore and I think that

32
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:30,188
something is really lost when patients

33
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:34,780
have a harder time getting good quality

34
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:37,358
seeds for free and so then I met Dan and

35
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,259
Sebring and I met these guys because

36
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:42,968
we're all interested in Auto flours and

37
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,209
they have both given me hundreds of

38
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:49,209
packs of seeds to give to patients here

39
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:50,798
on Vashon Island and at the various

40
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:53,288
places that I get my auto flower stalks

41
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,600
and by you know from talking with both

42
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,920
of them and I'm gonna say some things I

43
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,769
think you should make them feel awkward

44
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,420
but I'm gonna say it in front of them

45
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:03,728
what these guys are doing breeding

46
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,909
specifically for patients and then

47
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:09,099
giving the seeds away is something that

48
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:11,349
I think is lost and I'm hoping that with

49
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:13,609
this video maybe we can inspire some

50
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:15,259
people to start giving away some

51
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,310
they're seeds you know there's not

52
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:18,109
there's no problem with the you know

53
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,659
selling some of the seeds right we all

54
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,670
have to pay our bills but I want to

55
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:24,590
encourage people to breathe protect

56
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:27,819
potentially with patients in mind and

57
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,050
then to give some of the seeds away

58
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:32,810
because that's what these guys have done

59
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:35,540
and for me it reminds me of the medical

60
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,270
days when people were really in it for

61
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:40,489
the patient's instead of what we're

62
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,050
seeing now where people are more and

63
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,570
more turning cannabis into a commodity

64
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,790
so Dan Sebring thank you for joining me

65
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:49,099
and so we're just gonna ask a couple

66
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:51,829
questions to kind of you know get you

67
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:53,689
set up at the mindset of giving away

68
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,570
seeds and maybe it'll inspire some

69
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:58,430
people to start breeding or we're making

70
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:01,129
seeds for the first time so Dan let's

71
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,500
start with you man so so I know you got

72
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:05,329
into breeding because of patience it

73
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,709
wasn't that you were breeding first and

74
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,930
then you moved over to patient-focused

75
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:09,950
up but that was your whole point so so

76
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,629
what brought you to breeding for

77
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:13,099
patience breathe through patience came

78
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:13,849
from me because of a medical aid of a

79
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,939
family member

80
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:18,439
I mean basically stage one cancer you

81
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,780
know a short end of it and she needs

82
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:22,849
some pain relief and we needed to put

83
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,709
turnaround and all those were the key

84
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:26,389
and that's and then I started seeing the

85
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:28,370
benefits from the quicker turnaround to

86
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:30,229
continue that down the road and then

87
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,780
basically share out beyond my you know

88
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:35,750
circle of friends and family needs I've

89
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,580
been too fortunate benefit of meeting

90
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,259
you and making sure that those seeds get

91
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,239
beyond that circle that when I initially

92
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:43,849
start grow right on but when they they

93
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,219
certainly have I fell a little bit like

94
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:49,069
Johnny Appleseed given my way to sow sow

95
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:50,900
see purring I know that you as well got

96
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:53,329
into it specifically for the patients

97
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,390
and what are your motivations so I had a

98
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:59,510
couple motivations one was being able to

99
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:01,488
do seed preservation because my like you

100
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:03,500
sort of see that fall off a lot of the

101
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,659
really good strings that used to be able

102
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,479
to get your hands on these days you

103
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:09,090
can't or

104
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,439
to pay a fortune to be able to get a

105
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,840
hold of them and even then they're not

106
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,930
necessarily what you think they are on

107
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,199
top of that I had family members that

108
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,000
were in need of medicine as well one

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,189
with epilepsy another one with arthritis

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,490
so I needed a variety of different

111
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:27,839
answers and I need ones that would be

112
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,430
grovyle and self sustainable by those

113
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,560
family members so I could show them how

114
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,990
to do everything and I see the autumn

115
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,418
flowers answered that for me in both

116
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,000
cases in varying amounts with different

117
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:41,069
THC levels but both of them acted as a

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,779
way that I could hand seeds to a family

119
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:45,478
member of shown hey you grow a tomato

120
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:47,279
great even grow this there's a set part

121
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,019
of the state this is all you've got to

122
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,418
do this is you're making medicine

123
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,978
process come back to me if you need more

124
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:54,569
seeds or if it's not quite right and

125
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:56,909
we'll work with you on the genetics to

126
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,019
you know work it in the direction it

127
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,300
needs to go in and then that just

128
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:03,478
expanded out to wanting to help other

129
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,250
people like you I saw that more and more

130
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:08,310
semion seeds will grow on commercial or

131
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,839
seed breeders or leaving breeding and

132
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,168
we're just going into commercial

133
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:17,038
cannabis and so as I saw that void

134
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:20,219
happening people like me and you started

135
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,478
trying to fill that and so yeah just

136
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,370
like you I want to see more people

137
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:26,279
donating more seeds to people around

138
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,259
them patients that they need setting up

139
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,418
to us and we'll help distribute over to

140
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:33,360
the patients to contact us like that

141
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:36,509
part of the community is being lost and

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,030
it's essential for part of keeping our

143
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:40,728
community as a whole the stronger we

144
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:43,619
make each other the stronger we make

145
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:45,000
ourselves the community and so let's

146
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,370
talk a little bit about the distribution

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,259
now don't get me wrong right like like

148
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,840
seeds are fun to share even if you only

149
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,120
have one pack right so so we're gonna be

150
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,569
talking about like some numbers of packs

151
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,490
here but don't think I can't distribute

152
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:01,889
that many seeds or I can't grow them you

153
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,889
know produce that many seeds and think

154
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:05,500
that this might not be free

155
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:07,090
you because it's just giving away a few

156
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,279
packs those are great last year I only

157
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:11,619
made you know a couple dozen packs but

158
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:15,579
they felt really good to give away so so

159
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,740
Dan you know what did you do to figure

160
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:19,089
out how to give away your packs to

161
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,620
people because I know some people they

162
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:22,029
feel a little awkward to be like like

163
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,908
like even if I have seeds I don't know

164
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:26,500
where to where to give them well you

165
00:06:24,908 --> 00:06:28,029
know organization is like with your on

166
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
the island you know there's a outreach

167
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,938
to patients there and I was fortunately

168
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,918
connected with you and we had that look

169
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:34,389
there and then I've also made some cold

170
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,168
calls you know take a look for like

171

medical collectives or you know just

173
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,158
take a it's a quick search and you can

174
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,839
find the people that actually need them

175
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:45,728
and then just reach out to them make a

176
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,168
phone call you know I it's been very

177
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:49,028
well-received every time I've made a

178
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:50,198
call especially since it's free

179
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:52,209
you know I'll cover the shipping on it

180
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,098
to make sure that these people can have

181
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:56,649

just a it's a great feeling it's a good

190
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:14,468
way to you know strengthen the community

191
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:17,139
like we've been talking about and

192
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:19,149
Sebring I know that you've turned this

193
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,949
into kind of a manufacturing operation

194
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,549
like you're sending out seats like all

195
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,439
over the place

196
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,528
tell us a little bit about that so

197
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:29,288
they're receiving seats comm I ship out

198
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:30,158
any seeds to get sent in to me I go

199
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:32,860
through a sorghum

200
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:34,528
I only take the quality seeds and that's

201
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,199
what gets shipped out stuff that's

202
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:39,668
dark-colored plump not under guns all

203
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,580
the other guns get set aside and I've

204
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:44,258
got a purpose for those but those good

205
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,930
ones all get sorted out they get

206
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:49,120
individually packed in packs of 15 to 30

207
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,978
seeds and then as long as people are

208
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,408
willing to pay shipping we ship them all

209
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:56,620
over the world most of them qualify as

210
00:07:53,408 --> 00:08:00,310
hemp we only send seeds we don't send

211
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,408
anything else but we absolutely do any

212
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,569
anybody who comes on the website and

213
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:07,899
says they want to order a pack we take

214
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:08,370
care of it and then not all the time but

215
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:11,009
as

216
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,389
I can afford it when people contact me

217
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:15,149
and they don't have the money even for

218
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:16,439
shipping we take care of that as well it

219
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:19,109
helps if we only have a limited number

220
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:22,649
of those that are legitimate so I've had

221
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,030
a pretty easy time of it so far it could

222
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:25,649
definitely get to a point where I'd have

223
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:27,569
to borrow less put a hard number on it

224
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:30,659
like this is how many you know free

225
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:32,968
shipping is we're gonna give out but

226
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,460
right now where it seems like everybody

227
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:38,940
it's pecan tech and he's been honest and

228
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:41,339
had integrity and you know really said

229
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,020
what's going on with them like I don't I

230
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,690
don't get that hey seventy-three seeds I

231
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:47,639
get the I'm a son trying to help my

232
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,130
grandmother she doesn't know how to grow

233
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,990
I need to grow medicine for her I'm

234
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:54,659
unemployed right now can you help me out

235
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,970
and my answer is always yes absolutely

236
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,719
because I've been that guy that's where

237
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,470
I came from

238
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,060
that's that's my root is being that

239
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,980
person and living in that community and

240
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,439
so to me they're doing what I'm doing

241
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,460
which is trying to take care of people

242
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,470
that are in their community that they

243
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,080
love it shouldn't be in pain that's

244
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,430
right so so like this actually I think

245
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,839
he actually realized that this was gonna

246
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,939
happen this is kind of like a spectrum

247
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,060
right like I only produce like you know

248
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,440
a couple dozen packs every year and I

249
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:24,569
grew us some of those the following year

250
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,910
and then I give them away and Dan dance

251
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,040
producing like hundreds of packs and he

252
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:31,679
bundles them up and then sends them into

253
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,879
organizations and Sebring's got people

254
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,129
reaching out to him from all over the

255
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,860
world and if they pay shipping handling

256
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:40,528
he sends them see so you know you can do

257
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,209
a little or you can do a ridiculous

258
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:44,580
amount like and or somewhere in the

259
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:47,219
middle right right and so you can do as

260
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,220
much and in the way that fits for your

261
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,110
life so the way that I bet these guys

262
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,899
was because we're all into autoflowering

263
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,519
candidates varieties right now because

264
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,799
all three of us haven't realized that

265
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,600
they're really good for patients and so

266
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,458
so Dan you know

267
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,740
did you choose to start breeding Auto

268
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:07,198
flowers specifically for the patients

269
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,490
that you helped you know douchebag when

270
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:11,159
I said earlier is quick turnaround time

271
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,198
you know and the Terr profiles and the

272
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,909
cannabinoids that we needed were right

273
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:17,008
there readily available at that quick

274
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:20,039
pace and it made sense too because at

275
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:22,440
the time I was ahead access to both you

276
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,448
know regular sex seats I could get males

277
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,980
and females with no problem I mean not

278
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:27,149
there's an issue with feminized you know

279
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,370
there's a lot of them available today

280
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:31,169
but it was at a time where I was able to

281
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,970
actually begin that selection process

282
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:36,299
and kind of cater it towards what I

283
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:39,000
needed how about you see me so I started

284
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:40,349
doing autos because family members

285
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,350
needed something that they could grow

286
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,949
like a tomato they needed just like Jeff

287
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,440
Lowenthal's

288
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:49,289
said they needed something they can put

289
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,009
in the ground indoor or outdoor do

290
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:55,259
nothing but water it for 80 to 90 days

291
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:57,778
harvest it hang it dry it medicine just

292
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,519
that fast there's no no learning curve

293
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:02,879
no nothing the barrier of entry is

294
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,039
incredibly low and seeing how well my

295
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,470
mother succeeded on doing that how

296
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,750
basically she went from constantly being

297
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,399
frustrated with me talking about photo

298
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,350
periods which could be a real pain at

299
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,198
times especially for new growers to oh

300
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,329
my god I can do this I can actually do

301
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:20,758
this like I love you and I need you but

302
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:22,318
not for this yeah which to me that was a

303
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,509
huge weight off of my shoulders to know

304
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:26,490
not only that I could give her self

305
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:27,930
sustainable seeds and that she could

306
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,519
make her own medicine and then that

307
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:32,039
didn't have to be one more thing I had

308
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,959
to do freeing up my time preferably to

309
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:36,149
spend quality time with her instead of

310
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:39,508
just staring sending her that yeah

311
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:42,600
exactly but then I realized you know

312
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:45,720
she's older she's retiring if she is

313
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,339
struggling with this most retirees are

314
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,620
struggling with this so the reality is

315
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,060
what I had in my hand was something I

316
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,220
needed to distribute to the masses

317
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,258
because there really is a whole

318
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,370
community out there that needs it from

319
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:58,649
what I've seen they're more or less

320
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,278
being ignored there's not a lot of

321
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:02,740
seekers that are buried

322
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:04,899
for retirement baby boomers even though

323
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,639
they're like one of the largest sects of

324
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:09,458
people intersections of the community

325
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,259
that need this kind of medicine you know

326
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:15,188
and they're they're passed the drug war

327
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:17,230
stuff in the you know the propaganda

328
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:19,870
they understand that it helps them and

329
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,389
they want it they just need people to to

330
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,399
come to their level like drop down to

331
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:25,930
their level and speak on their level in

332
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,208
their terms and give them a plant that

333
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:30,370
they can that they can succeed let's go

334
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:32,078
set them up for success that's what

335
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,970
we're trying to do right I'm cool and

336
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,948
you know of course it's cool to breed

337
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,269
for cannabis cups too right there we're

338
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:39,458
not saying that you have to do one or

339
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:41,799
the other what we're saying is that as

340
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:44,679
legalization and the Green Rush takes

341
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:46,508
over less and less people are really

342
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:48,338
paying attention and listening to the

343
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:50,139
patients and what they need people are

344
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:52,809
offering patient products and patient

345
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:54,430
seeds but you know you know a lot of the

346
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:56,198
time they're not actually patients need

347
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:58,508
it's just that people want to fill a

348
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:00,998
patient market also one of the reasons

349
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:02,919
that I turned into got turned on to Otto

350
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:05,439
flowers for patients because they're so

351
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,240
coburn right the plants usually top out

352
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:09,549
around three feet you know I grew some

353
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,649
six-footers this year but but really

354
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:13,208
three foot is cut on average and you

355
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:15,370
know you can literally tuck those

356
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,750
between your tomato plants and your

357
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,339
neighbors won't even necessarily ever

358
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,589
see them you know so that's pretty good

359
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,910
and and you brought up Jeff phloem fells

360
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:24,550
we should go ahead and plug his book

361
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:26,799
right she's got a new book on Otto

362
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:30,729
flowers for the absolute beginner that

363
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:34,688
comes out next month October 22nd 2019

364
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:36,730
and it's all do-it-yourself Otto flowers

365
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:38,919
and he it's it's it's not really for

366
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:42,420
pros it's for people new like your aunt

367
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:45,849
your mom or your grandma or somebody who

368
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:47,269
like sebring see said is is it's kind of

369
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,490
over the taboo and they need

370
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:52,129
medicine and they want a garnet for

371
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,810
themselves and so with Jeff Lomond

372
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:55,220
fellows book you can boom put that in

373
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:57,619
their hands and it gives them the

374
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,500
history of auto flower seeds some basic

375
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:03,080
growing technique where to get auto

376
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,059
flare flowers and you know a bit of

377
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,060
encouragement that like you can do it

378
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:10,819
right it's it's a very simple book for

379
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:19,359
beginners and it's very effective so so

380
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:22,310
that's cool yeah yeah so so okay so if

381
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,980
there are people out there who are like

382
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:27,919
oh man I would really like to produce

383
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:30,830
seeds for patients what advice would you

384
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,479
give them like what what one piece of

385
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,759
advice would you give them about getting

386
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,279
started then I would say if it get some

387
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,870
access to some regular seeds if you get

388
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,549
access to regular seeds don't be afraid

389
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,169
to the mail you know make sure that you

390
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:43,969
know you kind of isolate it too

391
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:46,129
especially if you have a larger crop and

392
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,360
collect that pollen and bring it over to

393
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:48,950
the female and that's where you can

394
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,139
begin I mean we could go into great

395
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,060
detail on that and the process and how

396
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:55,100
to but there's several online resources

397
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,750
for that so you know don't be afraid of

398
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,399
that mail they can't they're not as

399
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,690
scary as they are yeah males we've got

400
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,340
terrible reputations right because

401
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,360
they'll seed your crop and most and

402
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,129
nobody wants that

403
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,840
unless you're producing seeds right

404
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:07,250
correct and so you know it takes a

405
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,350
little while to get over the fact that

406
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,509
the male can be seen as a threat in the

407
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,550
garden and actually see it as a partner

408
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:15,200
in making seeds so Steven what one piece

409
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:17,449
of advice would you give somebody first

410
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,210
I'd like to segue back to if you do make

411
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,560
seeds accidentally and they're not

412
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:24,320
hermaphroditic cross I'll help you get

413
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:26,719
rid of them we'll get them right to the

414
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,310
patients that need them for for new

415
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,460
breeders people that want to get into

416
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:34,459
breeding I would say that they first of

417
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,769
all don't don't be scared to just get in

418
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,780
there the first thing you've got to do

419
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,639
is get over that stumbling block of just

420
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:42,289
you know not being afraid get in there

421
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,679
and just do it my first cross is where

422
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:46,990
total accidents we literally just

423
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:48,639
three plants and we took one and it was

424
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,009
a male and cross it to two others and

425
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,389
grew those up to see what was there but

426
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:54,039
that's really what you've got to do you

427
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:57,039
better understand the genetics they're

428
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:58,629
stored stashed away in each of the

429
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,549
parents that you're working with you

430
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:03,189
need to understand the parents too you

431
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:05,500
need to be able to identify what came

432
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:08,020
from each parent to help figure out the

433
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,759
you know Britain's genetic level what's

434
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:11,649
going on with them what you know what

435
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,419
was dominant what was recessive and from

436
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:15,519
there you can kind of start to work in

437
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,528
the direction you want to go

438
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,480
my biggest thing I would suggest to

439
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:21,549
people that want to start breeding first

440
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,680
and foremost is honestly pick up a book

441
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:26,458
on Mendelian genetics and even if it's

442
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:30,729
confusing just work your way through it

443
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:34,208
even today I'm still running crosses

444
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:36,278
where I'm working through charts to

445
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:38,949
figure out okay what's this what's that

446
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:40,600
I know the ratios of what I should get

447
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:43,089
out of a cross based on whether it's

448
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,830
dominant or recessive and it's a lot

449
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,690
more complicated these days with

450
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,129
advanced genetics but a lot of the

451
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,260
principles still apply so if you can

452
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:52,629
understand the simplest Mendelian

453
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,850
genetics you'll begin to understand in

454
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:57,610
the crosses that you make what it is you

455
00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:01,269
see and that's the key really well that

456
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:03,009
said don't let that level of complexity

457
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:05,379
stop you right get in there and do it

458
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:07,269
you can just be a pollen sucker right

459
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,089
which was I thought I am I have not met

460
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:12,189
a breeding book and yet I've been

461
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:14,259
growing my own seeds year over year and

462
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:16,660
I get great plants right all you need to

463
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:18,338
do is have a female that you like and a

464
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,990
male that you like and put them near

465
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:23,438
each other and you will get seeds and

466
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:25,359
very often even accidentals seeds that

467
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,670
get made and you didn't even plan can be

468
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,469
great so so you know just certainly it's

469
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:32,590
one of these fun hobbies that you can

470
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:35,230
start and a novice pollen shucking level

471
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:36,039
and then go all the way to reading books

472
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,279
and

473
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:40,899
dominant recessive traits but don't let

474
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,609
that be your stopper because like you

475
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,769
know a lot of people don't have time to

476
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:46,779
read a science book and take notes don't

477
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:49,779
let that stop you just freaking do it

478
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:52,629
and give the seeds away because you know

479
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:56,589
putting the seeds in patient's hands is

480
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:59,350
the Goldmans so that's so if people want

481
00:17:56,589 --> 00:18:00,730
to follow you on Instagram and you know

482
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:02,919
continue to pick up some of this

483
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,089
inspiration how do they watch it now

484
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,210
that I can find me at the full-duplex

485
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:09,609
underscore AFN or about the genetic page

486
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,559
at Mandalorian genetics on Instagram

487
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:15,819
great how about you Cirie you can find

488
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:17,740
me under sea bring seeds at Instagram at

489
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:20,980
YouTube work got some videos on how to

490
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,170
make silver thiosulfate as well as some

491
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,589
growing tips the sea bream seeds calm

492
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:28,269
website through Facebook pretty much

493
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:30,220
everywhere just look look for Sebring

494
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:31,690
seeds and if you find a link that sends

495
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,579
you to somebody with that name it's

496
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:39,640
probably me right so so last thing is

497
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:41,379
you know oh yeah those links are in in

498
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,960
the description below if you didn't if

499
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,570
you didn't catch it but you know the

500
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,269
point of this video is just to get you

501
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:52,059
thinking about making extra seeds and

502
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:55,240
giving them away to people it is a lot

503
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:56,769
of fun to make extra seeds put them in a

504
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,930
little package and give them away to

505
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:02,889
friends you build your commit cannabis

506
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:04,900
community you you you create the

507
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,610
opportunity for giving somebody a few

508
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,900
packs and then they go on and give them

509
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:14,169
to a few people and and most importantly

510
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:16,840
good genetics get into the hands of

511
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:18,850
patients so that they can be empowered

512
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:20,259
to grow their own medicine and you know

513
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:22,169
it doesn't matter if it's Auto flowers

514
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,730
either we love red plants too right

515
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,130
whatever you have

516
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:29,309
access to start reproducing the seeds

517
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,300
and giving them away one last thing so I

518
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:32,069
probably made these guys a little

519
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:35,039
awkward but I kind of like you know

520
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:39,029
using them for an example of dudes who

521
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,039
or let's just say people who who produce

522
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:44,819
seeds and give them away to patients

523
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:47,369
right these guys are just examples of

524
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:49,559
that right there are people like this in

525
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:51,689
your community and talk to them and

526
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:54,240
maybe get together and maybe also trade

527
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,250
with them and you know they didn't ask

528
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,890
me to do this I actually bugged them to

529
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,200
do this video and s to put them on a

530
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,240
little bit of a pedestal so that through

531
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,980
their stories and me saying hey these

532
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,950
guys have given away hundreds of packs

533
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:11,250
to patients because they value that well

534
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:14,009
you know everybody wins right so so also

535
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:17,549
do not like jump on them and be

536
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:19,799
demanding facts is you know you know if

537
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:22,319
you've got an organization you know

538
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,690
perhaps reach out to mandalorian

539
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,639
genetics if you are individuals or

540
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,200
organizations and you're willing to pay

541
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,120
shipping and handling maybe you reach

542
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,190
out to Sebring remember man these guys

543
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,869
have got like day jobs and they don't

544
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,519
have a ton of time for customer service

545
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:37,889
so they you know they try to get back to

546
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,470
everybody just be considerate be kind

547
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,900
you know and if you decide to reach out

548
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,720
for them but but instead of you know

549
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,400
focusing on getting their C's for free I

550
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,650
encourage you to go ahead and make your

551
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,240
own so especially since it's fall time

552
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,370
now and if you accidentally had a

553
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,019
sneaker mail in your garden just gather

554
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:56,609
those seeds and put them in ten packs

555
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,529
and give them away it'll be great so

556
00:20:56,609 --> 00:21:00,419
guys thank you so much for for talking

557
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:02,639
with me and hopefully we will cause some

558
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,870
more people to grow and give away see so

559
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,050
