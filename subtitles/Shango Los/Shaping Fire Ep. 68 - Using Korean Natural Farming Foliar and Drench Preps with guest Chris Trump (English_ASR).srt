2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000
synergy is something that gets talked

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,679
about a lot nowadays

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,839
it comes from the greek word for working

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,280
together the idea that a few things can

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,960
come together and become something

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,480
better than the individual ingredients

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,400
is something that can apply to lots of

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,399
things like sports teams

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,559
musical arrangements and even natural

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,159
farming when the right ingredients with

12
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,000
the right attributes come together

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,359
wondrous things can happen that we may

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,039
not have expected

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,120
sometimes bringing those things together

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,880
incorrectly can be bad too

17
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,799
as we move through our lives we try to

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,079
put together more good synergies than we

19
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,919
do bad ones

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,000
cultivating cannabis is essentially a

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,200
practice in creating good synergies

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,799
and today we're going to talk about

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,920
creating good synergies in korean

24
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,199
natural farming

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,559

i'm your host shango los

50
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,799
my guest today is chris trump chris is a

51
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,320
master natural farmer certified by

52
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,320
master cho of korea

53
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,158
he has also studied microbial analysis

54
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,758
under dr elaine ingham

55
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,359
many consider his youtube videos

56
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,920
explaining korean natural farming

57
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,920
techniques

58
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,159
to have been the key to knf's wildly

59
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,759
increasing popularity in the us

60
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,439
it is especially helpful that chris is a

61
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,920
certified canf educator

62
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:50,118
who actually speaks english you can take

63
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,359
chris's courses online at

64
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:54,000
naturalfarming.co

65
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,239
and in person across the u.s chris has

66
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,159
been a guest before on episode 35

67
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,640
explaining the basics of knf and its

68
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,320
sudden rise of popularity in the us

69
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,718
today we'll be discussing how to blend

70
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,398
canf preps in order to use them properly

71
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,439
to create synergies

72
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,719
welcome back to shaping fire chris hey

73
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,159
thanks for having me shane go

74
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,400
right on good talking with you yeah good

75
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,359
to have you back so since i started

76
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,840
studying k f

77
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,040
a few years ago i have both made a few

78
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,719
preparations and i've

79
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,959
actually received a lot of them from

80
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,318
friends too and i have enough now that i

81
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,239
really actually need a small

82
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,759
fridge to store them in besides my

83
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,159
kitchen fridge right

84
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,159
um what that means even more though is

85
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,079
that not only do i have ferments but

86
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,199
like i've got enough to get myself into

87
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,000
trouble

88
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,919
when i took your nutrition cycle course

89
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,400
online last week i realized that much of

90
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,199
what i

91
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,360
thought i knew was actually wrong

92
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,878
classic bro science learning on my part

93
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,120
i'd say

94
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,318
so let's start by knocking down some of

95
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
those misconceptions

96
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,560
that are being repeated by you know

97
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,400
well-intentioned people online

98
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,640
the one that stands out for me is the

99
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,800
idea that knf preparations

100
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,158
should only be used one set at one

101
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,400
senate one at a time

102
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,759
i really thought that was the case so

103
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,400
you know what do you

104
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,959
teach about that uh that you learned

105
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,319
from

106
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:16,560
uh your teacher master cho

107
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:20,878
yeah it's um it is it's really common

108
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:24,239
and it's um it it's actually not good

109
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:27,840
some some of the preps by themselves are

110
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,959
so far from a balanced nutrient that um

111
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,519
we can get into trouble um

112
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,000
yeah so with natural farming there's

113
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,280
there's

114
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,639
never there's not a single thing we use

115
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,239
by itself

116
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,759
um so if you're if you've got a natural

117
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,680
farming prep

118
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:51,120
you're in need of the complementary

119
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,640
nutrients or or you know i call

120
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,759
the individual preps inputs and the

121
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,798
um the combination of them solutions

122
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,158
and so you're never using an input like

123
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,120
an fpj

124
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,280
or an ohn or something by itself you're

125
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,640
blending it into a solution

126
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,560
um for a balanced nutrient and so it's

127
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:16,560
uh it's important fpj by itself for

128
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,000
example probably the most common

129
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,839
you know one used by itself um

130
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,319
is imbalanced enough that you're um

131
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,799
potentially and likely gonna create a

132
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,360
bug problem um it's like

133
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,960
candy coating or fattening you're over

134
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,520
fattening your plant

135
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,239
and it's just asking for critters so

136
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,519
yeah it's

137
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,879
it's a big deal definitely so let's

138
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,240
let's break out that term

139
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,719
uh balanced nutrient so um

140
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,319
uh tell me a little bit um at the at the

141
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,639
real basic level

142
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,319
what is a balanced nutrient versus an

143
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,519
imbalanced nutrient what are their

144
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,759
characteristics and

145
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,839
and how will i know the difference when

146
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,199
i see them

147
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,198
yeah so um

148
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,680
so we use vinegar and kind of as a base

149
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,120
it's one of the

150
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,680
you know core um

151
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,199
inputs needed for for making anything in

152
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
natural farming and so the

153
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,400
the basic preparation that most things

154
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,240
are

155
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:26,000
are kind of added to would be um

156
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,439
vinegar rice vinegar preferably um

157
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,879
ohn oriental herbal nutrient and fpj

158
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,478
fermented plant juice

159
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,839
you would mix those um to get your

160
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,478
maintenance solution or seed soak

161
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,038
solution

162
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:44,879
i have a video i think on youtube on

163
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:48,800
seed soak solution or ses

164
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,959
but that is kind of your

165
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,199
starter if you will you start with that

166
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,239
and then if your plants in need of

167
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,038
nitrogen for vegetative growth you're

168
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,639
you're moving into uh adding you know

169
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,360
fish amino acid

170
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,960
but the the balance comes in the the

171
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,360
vinegar that ph

172
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:13,279
that sourness that acid

173
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:17,520
um plays well with this kind of compost

174
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:21,198
extract or liquid compost that fpga

175
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:23,120
is and then ohn um is this

176
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,960
you know we use it so little there's

177
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,560
such a tiny amount

178
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,439
um but the um the little bits of alcohol

179
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,478
in the ohn

180
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:36,240
actually promote um

181
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:38,399
the kind of or foster kind of a good

182
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,680
reaction in the circulatory system of a

183
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,758
plant

184
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,959
being able to take in nutrients like

185
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,360
fpga

186
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,038
and and there is a nutrient in the rice

187
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,800
vinegar or grain vinegar

188
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,318
there's nutrients and other vinegars too

189
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,280
and if you don't have rice vinegar it's

190
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,080
okay

191
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,638
but that that complementary kind of

192
00:06:54,079 --> 00:07:01,038
dynamic that happens in

193
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,038
these multiple types of inputs

194
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,680
is is really what makes this work and

195
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,639
using any of it by itself

196
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,879
you're off in experiment land with an

197
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,079
untried system

198
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:17,439
and something that none of us have seen

199
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:20,478
good results from so yeah it's it's um

200
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,918
it's kind of like don't bother uh making

201
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:22,959
fpga if you're going to try and use it

202
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,359
by itself

203
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,359
you're better off you know i mean yeah

204
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,759
maybe you can mix it in some water and

205
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,800
drench it on the ground with some other

206
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,680
things that you like

207
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,038
but generally speaking keep it away from

208
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,439
a foliar application by itself

209
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,159
it's interesting i actually really like

210
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,719
um

211
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,319
i don't know the level of magnitude that

212
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,919
you answered that question in about a

213
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,160
balanced nutrient

214
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,120
if i was you know talking to someone

215
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,840
else let's say

216
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,079
a reductionist scientist i might

217
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,159
actually hear like oh well you know a

218
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,000
balanced nutrient is one that has these

219
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,520
amino acids and these

220
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,680
other inputs and then when you put them

221
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,839
together you get this whole chemical

222
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,759
but but instead you answered it very

223
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,878
much based on

224
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,960
how we're going to use it like

225
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,520
tactically right you're all like okay

226
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,799
well if you spray the fpj on its own

227
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,159
you're spraying sugar all over your

228
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,598
plants and you're probably going to

229
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,160
attract bugs

230
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,759
but if we balance it with a vinegar the

231
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
the vinegar

232
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,919
checks the sugars is what i'm assuming

233
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,080
that is the thought behind that

234
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,038
and so you have made something balanced

235
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,038
and it's not really

236
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,478
balanced based on what is necessarily

237
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:34,240
under a microscope

238
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:36,718
it's balanced in how these two solutions

239
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,759
play out in nature and um you know

240
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,760
that's one of the things that i really

241
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,000
like about knf even though as you've

242
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,559
said

243
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,360
many times the um you know how it's

244
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,559
taught in

245
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,600
korea there's a lot of what you know

246
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:53,439
americans might consider mysticism um

247
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,159
really it's it's um it's it's taught by

248
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,760
like story almost like how how it is

249
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,879
actually used in real life

250
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:04,000
instead of um what's happening

251
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,838
at the microscopic level yeah yeah

252
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,159
i think that's the the part i play in

253
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,040
this too shane go i love

254
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,079
you know scientific papers i've spent

255
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,599
you know

256
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,240
a lot of time just enjoying and going

257
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,399
down the rabbit trails of understanding

258
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,680
with the the work and the research

259
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,559
people have done

260
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:28,239
and so much of what we are asking

261
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:30,719
nowadays with the microbiological world

262
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,759
hasn't been comprehend comprehensively

263
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,879
studied

264
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,838
and so there's these pieces and bits and

265
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,278
you got to understand

266
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,839
one thing to even access another and

267
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,360
i've i've really enjoyed the journey of

268
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,000
learning in that way

269
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,360
and uh getting to talk with a great a

270
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,039
lot of great

271
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,039
scientific minds and and people in

272
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,039
different universities around the world

273
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,559
but for me

274
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,559
though i i kind of think of myself as a

275
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:05,119
scientist i'm a farmer

276
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:07,278
um and and this teaching of this

277
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,399
the communication of this and the

278
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,919
application of this

279
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,720
is for farmers and so yeah we can get

280
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,958
into the

281
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:20,160
you know the um the amino acids

282
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:22,559
and or fatty acids in the cell wall

283
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,559
tissue of the you know plant that you're

284
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,639
fb jane and how that

285
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,239
gets pulled out through osmotic pressure

286
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,480
and that there's these

287
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,240
these complex nutrients that are made

288
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,079
plant available because

289
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,000
it's micronized through that

290
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,879
fermentation process or being broken

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,679
down into such fine particles

292
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,480
but really for a farmer that doesn't

293
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,519
help

294
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,959
or it can it can with understanding and

295
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,679
and that's valuable but um so much of

296
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,799
what's needed

297
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:56,399
is just succeeding in in

298
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,719
using tech that's been proven and

299
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,759
being able to apply it effectively so

300
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,879
it's um definitely where i

301
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,600
focus because if there's not a

302
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,679
billion scientific papers in natural

303
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,320
farming in the next 10 years i'm okay

304
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,319
with that

305
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,680
as long as we're starting to take over

306
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,278
the world and

307
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,319
in real quality of food and and medicine

308
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,799
production

309
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,079
right on um you know historically too

310
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,000
one of the reasons that

311
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,319
you know lessons of all kinds whether

312
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,679
they be like religious parables

313
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,079
or or or scientific

314
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,759
stories of the balance of nature between

315
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:34,639
different animal populations that you

316
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,958
get from

317
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,559
you know historical farmer anecdotes and

318
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,518
stuff in the end

319
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,639
um what we're trying to do is often

320
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,240
package

321
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:48,399
um package the learning in ways

322
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,320
that everyone can understand because

323
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,440
there's no doubt it's good to have

324
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,920
the universities backing up the

325
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,279
korean natural farming teachings with

326
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:02,958
actual repeatable results scientific

327
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:06,240
results but not everybody who is

328
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:09,199
who who wants to be a natural farmer

329
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,000
is interested in that level of detail

330
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
sometimes

331
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,839
they are more interested in knowing what

332
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,839
works

333
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,600
and and i think that that you know that

334
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,839
storytelling approach or or

335
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,200
you know as we've already said balancing

336
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,360
the fpj

337
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,959
with some vinegar that may be all

338
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,278
somebody needs to know to be able to

339
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:30,000
feed their family in their community

340
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,639
totally or or more make their bottom

341
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,720
line work

342
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,159
yeah or make their bottom line work so

343
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,320
um uh

344
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,159
let's uh let's hit on some specifics for

345
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,800
a moment for the folks who are

346
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,600
like me i you know i've been spraying

347
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,919
fpj

348
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,120
on its own since i started making it

349
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,958
right so i

350
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,320
i know i'm wrong i'm willing to cop to

351
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,599
that um

352
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,240
so so if if i'm going to spray

353
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,560
my fermented plant juice how much

354
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,560
vinegar should i be matching it with so

355
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,518
that i get that balance and i don't

356
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,239
turn it into a massive bug attractant

357
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,679
yeah

358
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,159
at the very minimum if you had just

359
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,199
just fpj and you're wanting to start

360
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,360
natural farming

361
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,480
and you didn't have ohn you couldn't buy

362
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,399
any and it's three months to make it

363
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:22,000
um you can do a one to five hundred

364
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,559
fpj in water and a 1-500 vinegar so it's

365
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,720
the same amount of vinegar and fpj

366
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,799
they're equal in the solution but

367
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,360
they're also used at a very small amount

368
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,799
and you don't want to overdo it

369
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,079
very very typical american uh

370
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:41,599
trait is if you know if i hear that

371
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,759
one to 500 is good then one to 250

372
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,440
you know double that will be better and

373
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,838
it's just not the case it's not how it

374
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,240
works

375
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,440
dude i'm that guy i i'm totally that guy

376
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,600
i can

377
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,639
so so would you would you you know go a

378
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,240
little deeper into that

379
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,959
like how can such small amounts

380
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,000
be so effective and how can a difference

381
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,479
between

382
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,519
one to 500 and one to two fifty that

383
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,639
small of a change

384
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,360
actually make a difference yeah it's

385
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,480
it's um it's how we get these nutrients

386
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,800
um it's how the

387
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,278
it's the process to make them that's

388
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,399
important um

389
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,399
you know the um

390
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:25,439
the word micronization um

391
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,119
or micronize it's a real word i didn't

392
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,040
make it up

393
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:34,879
and um and microbes

394
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:38,799
are incredibly effective at micronizing

395
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:42,000
um complex um nutrients so

396
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,039
and and and big things um there's a lot

397
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,078
of

398
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,078
um you know biochemicals that are

399
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,759
that are really not plant available

400
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:53,599
they're tied up in these long

401
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:57,519
chains and roots don't have the ability

402
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:01,600
um to uh nor does the kind of

403
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:04,480
plant tissue surface have the ability to

404
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,159
break those down or eat them it's kind

405
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,278
of like

406
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:11,039
it's kind of like that plastic packaging

407
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,320
you know when they send you like a flash

408
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,078
drive and

409
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,160
and you nearly kill yourself trying to

410
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:20,000
open it you know it's

411
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:22,399
that's that's the the level of tied up

412
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,039
that a lot of the nutrients in say a

413
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,198
stick

414
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:29,838
or a bladed grass um

415
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,039
are you know so so that's not food to my

416
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,279
plant it can become

417
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,399
food if it's broken down if it's

418
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,799
composted

419
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,198
or if it sits on the surface of the soil

420
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,719
and the microbes get to it there

421
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,399
those are great they can be great

422
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,519
nutrients but

423
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,000
as they are they're they're not

424
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,360
plant available or they're not readily

425
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,879
eaten by roots

426
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,560
roots are able to kind of take in they

427
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:58,078
have minor acids

428
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:00,958
roots do for for kind of like

429
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,479
creating space if you will they can they

430
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,758
can push in between a rock

431
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,720
or create cracks you know for so for

432
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,360
for kind of physiological movement for

433
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,600
physical

434
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,600
like creating space for their roots to

435
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,079
continue to push down

436
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,720
plants have the ability to do that but

437
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:18,159
as far as

438
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,399
breaking down what they're coming in

439
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,480
contact with it's just not

440
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,839
not possible so what you're doing is

441
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,440
you're taking

442
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,800
this really great food um you know these

443
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,000
plants that you're seeing

444
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:36,719
that are always lush and green and rich

445
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,559
maybe a wild weed or something and your

446
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,399
taking it through fermentation which

447
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,758
causes it to be

448
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,958
micronized so all that beneficial

449
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,278
biochemicals

450
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:53,039
and you know mineral content

451
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:54,799
and carbohydrate and then fats and acids

452
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,078
that exist in the structure of that

453
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,519
plant

454
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:02,399
become broken apart they start to break

455
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,199
down these chains

456
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,759
and all of a sudden this this really

457
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
kind of

458
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,558
full nutrient um albeit small i mean

459
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,439
we're we're not using a whole lot of

460
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,199
this

461
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:18,240
um is is really available to a plant and

462
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,519
you can if you overdo it

463
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,558
um even a little bit um you can make

464
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,918
your plants

465
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:29,200
drunk or or kind of loopy over

466
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,400
fed kind of like um you know too much of

467
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,519
a good thing

468
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,559
you'll see it in the plant reaction i uh

469
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:39,210
i made this mistake um

470
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,399
i my

471
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,840
[Music]

472
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:47,679
wife's grandmother had orchids

473
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,558
and she um

474
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,360
sweetest lady we named one of our kids

475
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,879
after him

476
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,439
after her uh ruth ruthie and

477
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,840
anyway she loved her orchids and so i

478
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,200
brought her over

479
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:07,038
some liquid imo

480
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:10,880
that was freshly made well made

481
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:12,720
and had all kinds of great nutrients for

482
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,760
plants and i'd been using it

483
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,279
successfully on trees and

484
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:23,519
vegetable gardens and so i had no

485
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:27,519
worry giving it to ruthie well

486
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:30,720
orchids are far lighter eaters

487
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,519
than um so much of what we're

488
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,960
encountering

489
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:38,319
in the kind of plant kingdom

490
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,279
and um her orchid

491
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,240
keeled over like it was drunk as could

492
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,279
be

493
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,759
and um and never recovered

494
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,879
and it was it wasn't likely fed it

495
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,000
poison

496
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,960
or you know gave it uh

497
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,079
anything that would cause that you know

498
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,079
because it was wrong

499
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,439
for the plant we just gave it too much

500
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,558
of a good thing

501
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,640
um what an orchid needed was that normal

502
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,798
dilution i use on plants

503
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,520
to be diluted probably a thousand times

504
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:13,200
and just have this really feather light

505
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:15,759
meal um and so that's

506
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,679
that's just one of the plant kingdoms

507
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,279
kind of interaction with it

508
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:25,038
um but um you know these

509
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:27,918
these mixes these recipes aren't new

510
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,720
they've been around a long time and

511
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,520
they've been

512
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,200
played with a lot in with plants in the

513
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,918
plant kingdom

514
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,038
to come up with the right ratios for

515
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,120
plants

516
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:41,119
um and so any and it gets into the

517
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,599
philosophy of what we're doing too which

518
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:46,399
we can go into more later but uh

519
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,159
go ahead and yeah go ahead finish finish

520
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,240
that thought what what is the philosophy

521
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,480
and how does it play in here

522
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,400
yeah so so it's the it's the right

523
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,798
amount of nutrition

524
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,600
at the right time this is kind of core

525
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:01,200
to the

526
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:04,399
the nutritive cycle theory and um

527
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,960
i say theory because though it's been

528
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,919
used

529
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,640
all over the world on many different

530
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,679
crops

531
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,280
there's still more to do when i

532
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,840
when i do when i give out a handout

533
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,759
kind of laying out what a potential

534
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,079
feeding program would be for a crop i

535
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,640
lay

536
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,319
i give rice because i was taught with

537
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,600
rice because that's very

538
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,240
korean crop you know they grow it all

539
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,879
over and

540
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,798
it's really incredible you drive down

541
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,039
the highway in korea and

542
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,720
the medians and those little triangles

543
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,919
in between overpasses

544
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,159
they're full of you know solid beautiful

545
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,919
you know full heads of rice that

546
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,360
somebody's cultivating

547
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,038
and it's really um neat and i think we

548
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,079
could we could definitely learn

549
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,519
something from that

550
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:57,119
but um no it's it's this

551
00:20:53,519 --> 00:21:00,639
this um kind of concept

552
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:03,119
that um you know and and again back to

553
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,520
story time we

554
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,000
we teach it when we teach this and we're

555
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,960
introducing kind of a new mind if you

556
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,880
will to

557
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,480
what we're talking about because it's so

558
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,440
foreign to

559
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,798
how we do agriculture currently or kind

560
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,159
of our traditional

561
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:23,519
conventional agriculture in the u.s

562
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,720
i use human life cycle to kind of talk

563
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,158
about it

564
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,679
and so like you know

565
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,320
a newborn baby you know what what is the

566
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,720
first

567
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:37,119
you know if it's you know getting its

568
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,360
food from mom what's the first food it

569
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,359
gets

570
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,639
that's the question shingo oh i thought

571
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,599
you were being rhetorical

572
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,960
sorry well mother's milk of course

573
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,279
mother's milk but

574
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,558
not the mother's milk you'll get for the

575
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:56,000
rest of its

576
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,960
you know breastfeeding journey it gets a

577
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,079
very different

578
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,079
first meal

579
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:08,079
a baby gets something called colostrum

580
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:11,120
it's it's a mineral rich

581
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,119
low nutrient

582
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,918
kind of meal it doesn't have all the

583
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,719
fats and proteins of mother's milk it

584
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,559
has

585
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,919
very little of that and and it's full of

586
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,720
mineral you know kind of minor nutrients

587
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,840
that the

588
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,720
the child will use to kind of do brain

589
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,279
development

590
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,319
and uh get its all systems going in a

591
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,440
new way

592
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:38,319
and um you know when

593
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,640
we take a seedling you know where it's

594
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,480
barely popped its first true leaf

595
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,759
and we're feeding it you know with the

596
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,640
big guns

597
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,798
we're giving the wrong level of nutrient

598
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,640
um to that plant we'll actually stump

599
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:52,079
the growth and we've done side-by-side

600
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,960
trials on this

601
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,359
where you though you think oh feeding it

602
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,319
a ton

603
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,359
as soon as it pops is the best way to

604
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,480
get it to

605
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,519
rush towards development and uh we've

606
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,640
proven out that

607
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:10,480
it's not you're actually stunting your

608
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,600
um potential growth by overfeeding a

609
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,000
uh a seedling and so i teach

610
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,519
that all we're putting on in the

611
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,400
beginning of a plant's life

612
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,000
is um maintenance solution just that

613
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,880
tiny bit of nutrient that comes from

614
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,279
the fpj but we're giving them that that

615
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,159
kind of

616
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:31,678
mineral and balanced nutrient of that

617
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:34,960
vinegar ohm and fpj

618
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,159
so so what i'm hearing and and please do

619
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,880
correct me if i'm if i'm not

620
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,720
understanding

621
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,559
how i'm understanding this is that going

622
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,200
back to your example of a stick you're

623
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,278
like okay

624
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,558
the nutrition in this stick there is

625
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,919
nutrition in this stick

626
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:51,119
but it's all um it's all wrapped up

627
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,159
it's all um you know hard

628
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:56,798
into this stick um

629
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,799
just like uh trying to open packaging

630
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:02,079
from best buy or something like that

631
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:05,200
where whereas what the k f

632
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:08,158
prep is is the removing of

633
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,798
all of that packaging which gets us down

634
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,159
to

635
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:16,400
the essential life force

636
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:19,360
nutrition of whatever it is that we are

637
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,080
fermenting or breaking down which kind

638
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,359
of makes it

639
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,879
like a super potent the the i you know i

640
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,199
don't want to say the soul of the plant

641
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,600
but

642
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,960
but it's most essential nutritive part

643
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,000
of the plant

644
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,558
and so you're suggesting that the

645
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,079
reason why one to five hundred or one to

646
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,359
a thousand is appropriate

647
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:42,798
is because it's so out of

648
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,959
um it's so out of my

649
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,359
u.s farming experience where we're used

650
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,519
to adding volumes of stuff

651
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,879
and this the korean technique is

652
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,278
actually re

653
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,159
reductive in the other direction where

654
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,038
they're removing

655
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,520
everything that may not be necessary and

656
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,240
then

657
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:03,200
through the fermentation incubating the

658
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,400
most essential nutrition to increase it

659
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,880
and so we've got only the part we need

660
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,919
and it's incubated to be super strong

661
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,120
and so

662
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,799
it's it's so reactive that we actually

663
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,839
have to be really careful with it

664
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,200
because

665
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:21,839
it can be very impactful on the plant

666
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,319
am i getting it all right yeah let me

667
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,599
let me

668
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:28,798
say that to you though um so so

669
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,480
in conventional agriculture if i buy for

670
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:35,359
my orchard say

671
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:38,079
30 30 30 nutrient npk nutrient um

672
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,759
you know just a chemical fertilizer i

673
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,720
apply that

674
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,440
expecting and this is very common and

675
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,480
hoping

676
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,519
that i'm going to get about a 20 percent

677
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,440
uptake in my crop this year meaning i

678
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:54,720
will benefit from that

679
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,200
application at about 20 percent

680
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,079
of the poundage i apply so if i apply a

681
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,200
pound

682
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:05,199
i'm getting 1 20th

683
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:08,319
or one-fifth of that in

684
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,120
kind of in my crop or in production this

685
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,079
year

686
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,439
um that's that's normal and and that

687
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:16,798
might not be common knowledge

688
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,159
but that's that's normal in conventional

689
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,240
agriculture we're

690
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,200
we're looking for hopefully getting

691
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,278
about a 20

692
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,440
uptake that's because the rest of it

693
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:28,960
goes into the soil

694
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,519
becomes locked up that's how we get hard

695
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,159
pans

696
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,440
is they go down it goes down about 12

697
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,679
inches 18 inches

698
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,798
and and just sits there waiting to be

699
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,840
made plant available by

700
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:45,918
microbes because even 30 30 30

701
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,918
isn't really plant available unless it

702
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,320
gets broken down to some degree

703
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,400
you know chemical fertilizer still needs

704
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,319
the microbiological world to

705
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,159
make it available the less alive your

706
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,879
soil is the less

707
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,640
of that you know total poundage applied

708
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,520
is going to become plant available this

709
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,559
year

710
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,440
and yeah in the converse or you know

711
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,879
alternately

712
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,519
in in natural farming we have um

713
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,120
fully available so available that we can

714
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,400
apply foliarly

715
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:18,639
and it's taken in through the leaf

716
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,519
tissue where the plant can actually

717
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,720
absorb it

718
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,000
through its um leaves in in a really

719
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,919
effective way

720
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,919
and so it's kind of like um

721
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,759
it's it's kind of like mainlining

722
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,798
nutrients i'm sorry for the

723
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,000
you know crass reference but it's it's

724
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,960
like it's like

725
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,798
i putting iv where it's going right into

726
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,200
the system rather than

727
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,038
you know needing to be digested before

728
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,440
you get access to those nutrients

729
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:49,278
right yeah i get it there's no buffering

730
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,360
through the rhizosphere and the roots

731
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,440
and coming up and all that kind of just

732
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,519
buffering and changing you're going

733
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,440
right to the underside of the leaves

734
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,918
where it just like sucks it right in

735
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,278
and boom then now it's in the now it's

736
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,600
interior

737
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,919
yeah you'll see you'll see results in in

738
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,879
24 hours 24 hours you'll see those

739
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,240
plants

740
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,799
react to that nutrient or in less time

741
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,798
sometimes

742
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,960
all right so let's talk about the size

743
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,079
of of the the nutrients at this one to

744
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,200
one thousand

745
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:25,199
one to five hundred or so um in your in

746
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
your earlier example you were saying you

747
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,759
know

748
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,519
how the roots interact with it and i've

749
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:34,000
i've only known you to teach

750
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:37,759
foliar so is do would we ever use these

751
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,159
um these preps as a as a soil drench as

752
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,158
well

753
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,200
i mean i i know some people oh

754
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,760
definitely okay well

755
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,519
um i i've only ever really used it as a

756
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:46,319
foliar except for occasionally i'll have

757
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,079
a little bit

758
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,359
you know left in the in the bottle and

759
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:50,879
i'll pour it on a couple

760
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,798
plants which is probably but not a good

761
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,679
idea now that i've heard what you just

762
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:58,000
said but

763
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:01,038
um so if if these are the ratios

764
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,960
for foliar are they the same ratios

765
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,599
for a drench and when you do a root

766
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,000
drench

767
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,639
you know generally i mean by the word

768
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
drench

769
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,520
you're going to use a lot more um you

770
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,159
know material water

771
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,759
when you pour it on the roots uh whereas

772
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,960
when you foliar it's that you know it's

773
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:20,879
generally pretty light

774
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,000
because even even though some products

775
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,720
specifically call

776
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,640
for you to make get the plant so wet

777
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,720
that it drips most the time that's not

778
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,720
what we're looking for and so

779
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,079
so what is the is there any difference

780
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,038
in the ratios

781
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:37,359
for a drench approach than there is from

782
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,919
a foliar approach

783
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,639
yeah that's a great question shingo and

784
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,440
um

785
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,440
you know just

786
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,439
starting i guess and from the beginning

787
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,399
starting at the back

788
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,159
with the cannabis community and and with

789
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:55,199
that your crop

790
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:59,039
that um you know

791
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:02,159
we don't recommend foliar in flower

792
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,398
um maybe in the first couple weeks

793
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,159
you can do it um but then where

794
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:10,000
everything goes to root drench

795
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:13,200
throughout the the flower cycle because

796
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,480
um you don't want to

797
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,200
bring in additional microbial life and

798
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,240
you don't

799
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,278
want to affect flavor um

800
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,480
in in any way um negatively

801
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:30,960
and so um yeah everything's

802
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,200
soil drench after that um

803
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,840
and in soil drench you don't really

804
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:40,080
change the recipe at all

805
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:40,079
but you can use more

806
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:44,719
also speaking of foliar when i talk

807
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,038
about

808
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,319
foliar application you are wanting them

809
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,640
to get to the point where they're just

810
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:53,359
barely dripping

811
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,440
but you're also i call it treating the

812
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:58,879
whole acre

813
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,960
where i'm spraying the stem the

814
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,080
leaves to the top of the plant all the

815
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,120
way down to

816
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,480
the whole surface of the soil around the

817
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,479
drip line of the plant

818
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:14,319
so the whole area is getting

819
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,798
fed not just you know a few

820
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,000
you know fan leaves or water leaves on

821
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,639
their underside you want

822
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,398
to get kind of the tip of the plant all

823
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,480
the way to the

824
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:27,439
kind of root zone the feeder root zone

825
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,440
around the drip line

826
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,480
so um it's interesting that you would i

827
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,278
mean because i i know that we're

828
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,120
we should not be spraying foliar on the

829
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:37,839
evolving flowers right i get that we

830
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,119
don't want to

831
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:43,359
uh add any taste to the flowers and we

832
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:46,158
also don't want to spike unexpected

833
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:49,359
microbe activity either so so i got that

834
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:52,799
but for me i usually just tapered off my

835
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,759
my knf after week two and just generally

836
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,879
went without it

837
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,000
in flower and yeah well clearly i'm

838
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,278
doing it wrong but

839
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,278
but you know this is this is what

840
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,278
happens when you know i

841
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:04,319
i learn things a little bit here and a

842
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:06,000
little bit there right

843
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:07,839
versus taking a course that is

844
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,519
integrative and putting it all together

845
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,199
uh but luckily you know i get a chance

846
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,038
to talk with you today uh

847
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,200
so so how what volume um

848
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,798
am i going to be at so after week two

849
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,960
when i have switched these

850
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:26,480
same preps to a a drench

851
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,840
how much uh of the

852
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,960
water with the the preparations in it

853
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,359
should i be using

854
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,319
for example you know when i make my

855
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,719
compost tea

856
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,439
i get myself a big old bucket and i get

857
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,600
a uh

858
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,278
you know i've got this uh this this this

859
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,439
mug that's about the size of like

860
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,359
you know one of those red party cups and

861
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,399
i go down the line and i put a i put a

862
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:49,839
cup in each one

863
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:51,599
you know and so you know i at least

864
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,278
if it feels like okay i'm not adding too

865
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,798
much i'm not adding too little

866
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:56,480
and and i'll do this you know

867
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:57,918
occasionally maybe maybe twice a week

868
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,960
with compost tea

869
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,000
but with something as powerful as these

870
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,679
k nf preps um you know i don't i don't

871
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,440
know whether a cup would still be

872
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,440
appropriate or if it should be

873
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,798
waste well way lesser amount and then i

874
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,159
just water it in with raw water

875
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:19,278
so yeah good good question

876
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:22,559
and uh this is this is kind of a hard

877
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:25,599
hard one um

878
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,319
for people to follow you know and i just

879
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,678
encourage

880
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:31,439
try it once on you know

881
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,960
this actual protocol that i'm going to

882
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,159
go over try it once

883
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,000
on a couple plants do a side by side

884
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,000
because i'm going to tell you this

885
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,119
really small amount

886
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,798
and then the

887
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:47,278
you know the typical american mindset is

888
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,158
well

889
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:52,398
if he said that amount and i double it i

890
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,799
should get double results

891
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:56,079
just doing better so yeah i'm just gonna

892
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:59,359
i'll i'll lay it out

893
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:03,038
and uh and just encourage a trial

894
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:05,599
um because it's it sounds crazy and

895
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,599
i i have so much empathy for how some of

896
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:10,639
this sounds on first hearing

897
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:14,078
because i grew up you know son of

898
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:17,039
a conventional farmer i grew up

899
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,519
you know conventional organic where you

900
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,878
still

901
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:25,039
are aiming at all those npk numbers and

902
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:27,519
trying to get your soil and tissue tests

903
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,800
to you know be corrected by all the

904
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:32,398
inputs you're putting on

905
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,399
and you know this just isn't the case

906
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:35,679
in in natural farming it's not what

907
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,960
we're chasing

908
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,240
um and so i do want a caveat before i go

909
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,838
into this though

910
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:46,719
that natural farming um and and i've

911
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:47,599
i've felt the need to repeat this so if

912
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,598
if

913
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,359
this has been said before or somebody's

914
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,519
heard this i'm sorry

915
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:56,078
but i feel like it's the it's the

916
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:59,519
necessary thing to kind of correct

917
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,720
maybe uh the the skewed the skewed

918
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:05,599
science that happens on the internet

919
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,279
eighty percent of natural farming is the

920
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,640
imo

921
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,760
process so imo4 applied

922
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,039
a week before planting and mulched and

923
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,280
watered in

924
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:21,440
is 80 of what you need

925
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,960
from the natural farming protocols and

926
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,200
if you're not doing that

927
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,400
then you can still play with the 20 but

928
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:30,480
just know

929
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:33,039
that that is the case um

930
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,320
because what's happening is so much of

931
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,559
the soil

932
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,519
nutrition is getting cycled into the

933
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:39,440
plants

934
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:41,599
kind of feeding program because the

935
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,480
microbes are breaking down sand silt and

936
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,960
clay

937
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,599
and making that plant available all that

938
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,159
silica

939
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,880
everybody's chasing silica in in

940
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,078
cannabis

941
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,039
and if you have sand in your soil and

942
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,640
fungi to eat it like you don't see

943
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:00,239
silica issues or or

944
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:02,639
need silica because there's plenty of it

945
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:05,039
it's just i'm not plant available unless

946
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:07,199
you have the fungi that can eat sand

947
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,400
i throw away all my microscope slides i

948
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,358
never clean them because

949
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,000
i deal so much with fungi that even if i

950
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:14,719
wash them with

951
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,480
alcohol i come back to use them a week

952
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,439
later and they're all etched because the

953
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:23,679
fungi has eaten the glass so it's cloudy

954
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,679
um so yeah there's imo is amazing

955
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,118
just a little plug there i know we're

956
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,399
talking about nutrients

957
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:33,760
um so the

958
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,680
the protocol for natural farming is that

959
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,200
um you know so the right amount of

960
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,039
nutrients we're talking about that and

961
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,838
then at the right time

962
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,279
um and so one of the things kind of

963
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,320
people

964
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,519
get wrong is they just put it on

965
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,960
all the time every day or every two days

966
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:56,000
and really we're putting on um

967
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,320
once uh really twice a week or

968
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,159
every other week sorry every other week

969
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,280
we're applying nutrients

970
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:06,480
and sometimes every week

971
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,720
but um that's really you know

972
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,320
that's really strange to people that are

973
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,439
used to feeding

974
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:17,519
all the time but if you have

975
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,559
imo's in process in your system

976
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:23,920
then the the nutrient is like this

977
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:27,679
little bit of an encouragement and

978
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,159
and uh kind of production booster

979
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,118
in your kind of whole system you got

980
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:34,719
going there so

981
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:38,079
for example if i was in flower

982
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,639
and i wanted to feed every week i would

983
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,079
apply

984
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:45,759
maintenance solution every other week

985
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:48,320
and a targeted feeding solution

986
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,880
the alternating weeks so maintenance

987
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,720
solution is that really simple recipe

988
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,880
fpga one to 500 brown rice vinegar

989
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,879
just rice vinegar one to five hundred

990
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,519
and ohm one to a thousand

991
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,200
really simple nutrient and that would go

992
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,239
on once a week

993
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:09,039
or once every other week and then

994
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,399
i would watch my plants and if i'm

995
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,440
thinking they need

996
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,079
some nitrogen and

997
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,200
but maybe some background calcium and

998
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,240
some background

999
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,960
potassium then i would do my maintenance

1000
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,479
solution

1001
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,880
fpga ohn vinegar

1002
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,599
and i would add in some fish amino acid

1003
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,400
maybe

1004
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,640
the main need is man these these girls

1005
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,639
need to be fed then i would

1006
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:35,920
put a one to a thousand which is the

1007
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:39,118
full strength of

1008
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,079
faa but then i'm like and i think

1009
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,440
they could use some balancing still or i

1010
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,160
need to help them a little bit

1011
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,358
put on structure then i would bring in a

1012
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:52,239
one to two thousand

1013
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:56,319
half strength wca which is a calcium

1014
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:57,039
and then um specifically cannabis and

1015
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,960
flour

1016
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:04,400
really benefits from a prep called wsk

1017
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,240
water soluble potassium and so i'd bring

1018
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,639
that in at one to two thousand

1019
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,159
and that would be my soil drench and i

1020
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:13,519
wouldn't i would be liberal

1021
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:16,719
um so i might do a whole watering with

1022
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:20,400
the the liquid or half a watering

1023
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:24,559
and then a flush if i was fertigating um

1024
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,720
and and because of the amounts

1025
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,159
everything's in balance and and it'll

1026
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:30,559
work out

1027
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,559
but i'm also not doing that every day

1028
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,679
i'm not creating this

1029
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,159
glut of nutrients in my soil um i'm

1030
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:39,279
putting

1031
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,480
a little bit on it'll it'll kind of ramp

1032
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,519
up or activate the

1033
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,199
soil microbial life as well as give a

1034
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,920
ton of great nutrition to the plant

1035
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,399
that's

1036
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,400
highly available for them to take up

1037
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,400
through all their feeder roots

1038
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,480
so that's kind of an example of how you

1039
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,400
might go about

1040
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,679
following the natural farming protocol

1041
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,639
now does that mean you can't

1042
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,759
also increase that interval or or

1043
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,639
decrease that interval

1044
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,240
to you know every you know every four

1045
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:11,118
days you can

1046
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,279
but i would just um be aware that you

1047
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,039
might get the same results

1048
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,599
by doing it once a week and um

1049
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,480
because of how these nutrients work and

1050
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,680
how

1051
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,240
easily you know they are to to

1052
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,759
for a plant to kind of digest or take

1053
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:30,879
into their systems

1054
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,839
and um yeah so so that additional

1055
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,400
applications

1056
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:35,838
might just be spending you you know you

1057
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,519
spending time and money you don't need

1058
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:41,279
to spend

1059
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:45,358
right on um the idea of of of taking

1060
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:49,519
the um the maintenance

1061
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,239
uh formula and have it at dilutions and

1062
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:53,440
then just

1063
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,598
do a full watering with that water um

1064
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,119
you know one part of me is like i might

1065
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,480
be adding too much but the other part of

1066
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,880
me is going well you know they're at

1067
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,318
such

1068
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,318
low amounts um you know

1069
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,400
it's kind of like just taking water with

1070
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,960
like a little bit of a supplement in it

1071
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,079
it's it's you it's you want a lot of

1072
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,358
water electrolyte

1073
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,760
yeah exactly exactly yeah and so and you

1074
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:17,279
want a lot of water so that it can reach

1075
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,480
all the parts of the pot and it doesn't

1076
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,440
just sit on top but at the same time the

1077
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,760
the amount of it in the water is such

1078
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,280
that

1079
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,359
um that you don't really have to worry

1080
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,880
about what what most of us think about

1081
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:31,119
is burning our roots

1082
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,160
which i actually like your idea of

1083
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,880
getting the plants drunk a lot better

1084
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,078
so um so we've had quite a long first

1085
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,559
set here let's go ahead

1086
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,920
and take our first break and then come

1087
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,559
back and we'll be

1088
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,800
talking about ohn next you are listening

1089
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:48,960
to shaping fire and my guest today is

1090
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,720
natural farming educator chris trump

1091
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,559
[Music]

1092
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,239
with the national hemp program in flux

1093
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,039
due to stringent thc testing

1094
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:56,719
requirements

1095
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,318
brother seth and eric crawford continue

1096
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:59,279
to release seeds to hemp farmers that

1097
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:01,119
will be legal

1098
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,440
no matter how you grow them or when you

1099
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,519
test them these new varieties from

1100
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,039
oregon cbd seeds have substantial

1101
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,480
amounts of cbdv

1102
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:12,639
cbgv cbcv and thcv

1103
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,159
while always staying below the 0.3

1104
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:16,318
percent thc limit

1105
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,239
and guaranteeing compliant crops for

1106
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,079
farmers every time

1107
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,439
also these new varieties cannot be

1108
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,720
pollinated by your neighbor's

1109
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,519
uncontrolled pollen

1110
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:28,078
or a rogue male in your own crop either

1111
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,119
oregon cbd seeds are non-gmo certified

1112
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,920
too

1113
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,079
oregon cbd seeds was founded and funded

1114
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,920
in 2015 by seth and eric

1115
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,000
maxing out their personal credit cards

1116
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,680
without outside investment

1117
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,880
they continue to refuse outside

1118
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:42,559
investment that would change their

1119
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,280
company culture

1120
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,119
oregon cbd grows tons of fresh food on

1121
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,760
their research farms for local food

1122
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,400
banks

1123
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,480
literally tons of food they also give

1124
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,599
away tens of thousands of pounds of

1125
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,800
r d flour to patients as their company

1126
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,720
began to succeed

1127
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,560
seth and eric started donating money to

1128
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:01,439
the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber

1129
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:03,440
cause 2

1130
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,519
by giving millions of dollars to oregon

1131
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,440
state university in order to establish

1132
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,880
the world's leading cannabis genomics

1133
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,960
research program

1134
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,200
and they treat their employees right

1135
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,119
oregon cbd pays for full health and

1136
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,759
dental coverage for their employees

1137
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,838
a 401k program and their minimum

1138
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,720
starting wage is 20 bucks an hour

1139
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:24,318
plus everyone shares food from the farms

1140
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,559
seth has been on shaping fire a few

1141
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:29,519
times to talk about novel cannabinoids

1142

with seth and soil expert jeff lowenfels

1148
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,640
talking about autoflowers

1149
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,400
if you are a hemp farmer and you want to

1150
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,000
grow reliable seeds that are sure to

1151
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,119
thrive in past testing

[Music]

1157
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,318
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

1158
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,079
growing is so valued by farmers is

1159
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,159
because the mycelium networks in the

1160
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,960
soil remain established from year to

1161
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:08,719
year

1162
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,880
and we know these fungal networks are

1163
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:13,039
essential because they are the nutrient

1164
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,280
super highways that extend far and wide

1165
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:17,679
in the substrate to feed your plants

1166
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,280
the trouble with growing in new soils or

1167
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,960
blended cocoa substrates

1168
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,119
is that it takes most of the plant's

1169
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,400
life just to create these mycelium

1170
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,440
highways

1171
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,760
dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

1172
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,720
reduces that time and gets your plant

1173
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,960
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

1174
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:37,039
and it's three times the concentration

1175
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,079
of the current leading brand in the u.s

1176
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:42,079
at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal

1177
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,920
species selected specifically for

1178
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,318
cannabis cultivation

1179
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,079
this new product called dinomyco is the

1180
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,000
result of 30 years of research and

1181
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,640
trials at the vulcani agriculture

1182
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,800
research institute in israel it has also

1183
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:55,598
been vigorously trialled by cannabis and

1184
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,440
food growers

1185
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,200
across the u.s since the product first

1186
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,720
arrived here last year

1187
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,838
you may have already even heard about

1188
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:06,078
dynamico by its original name

1189
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:07,920
dynamic now dinomyco is available at

1190
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,000
grow shops and online in the united

1191
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,400
states for the first time

1192
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,079
i love using dynomyco to both speed up

1193
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,639
the growth of mycelium networks in the

1194
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,280
soil

1195
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:17,920

cuttings more

1197

virile you can see side by sides showing

1198
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:22,799

1200
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,160
at dinomyco if you demand reliable

1201
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,760
growing results and appreciate the

1202
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:31,279
importance of an active root zone in

1203
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,680
creating a thriving plant

1204
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,920

while i love growing under the sun

1216
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,078
there's a lot of good reasons to grow

1217
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,760
indoors and if you're like most folks

1218
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,519
you want a lighting source that grows

1219
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,920
high yielding healthy plants without

1220
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:08,719
using

1221
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,559
excessive amounts of electricity bios

1222
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:11,279
lighting creates biological lighting

1223
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,960
solutions

1224
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,519
that brings the natural brilliance of

1225
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,519
the outdoors into your grow room

1226
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:19,280
bios lighting has the attributes that i

1227
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:20,239
look for in a horticultural lighting

1228
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,079
solution

1229
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:23,439
i've bought those cheap lights online

1230
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:27,039
and they're difficult to work with

1231
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,000
and fail in no time in contrast my bios

1232
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:30,239
led light is

1233
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,280
industrial grade to last a long time it

1234
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:34,799
is ip66 wet rated so little foliar

1235
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,640
overspray won't harm it

1236
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,640
it is easy to clean without taking it

1237
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:39,199
down and of course the most important

1238
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:41,519
aspect

1239
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,598
it is built for the exact light spectrum

1240
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:44,880
i want for great yielding healthy

1241
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,240
cannabis plants

1242
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,480
and it doesn't hurt that their lighting

1243
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,719
rigs look badass too

1244
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,318
many horticultural led lighting systems

1245
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:52,879
are based on irrelevant performance

1246
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:54,480
metrics

1247
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,039
and people love to argue online about

1248
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,039
these numbers i prefer to judge on par

1249
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,599
photon efficiency and how happy my

1250
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,920
plants are and the bios lights exceed my

1251
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,240
expectations in these categories

1252
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,559
bios lights have an optimized broad

1253
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,679
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis

1254
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,519
and plant growth

1255
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:13,519
while also providing the ideal

1256
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:15,358
conditions for superior par

1257
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:17,759
efficacy and a comfortable visual

1258
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:20,558
experience i also love their attentive

1259
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,800
and over-educated customer service folks

1260
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,720
bios starts with a team of biologists

1261
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,519
before getting the electrical engineers

1262
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:27,279
involved

1263
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:29,519
they have studied how light impacts

1264
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,200
cannabis plants and devised an overall

1265
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:32,480
strategy that works

1266
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:35,358

1276
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:56,799
host shango los and our guest this week

1277
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,599
is natural farming educator

1278
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,640
chris trump so most of this set we're

1279
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,920
going to be talking about

1280
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:05,358
ohn um oriental herbal nutrient but

1281
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,440
before we do that there's one thing

1282
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:08,558
more i want to hit on the foliar with

1283
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,760
you chris

1284
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,000
you know one of the reasons that i'm

1285
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,640
always tempted to add extra

1286
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,760
k f prep to the water is because when i

1287
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:18,799
look at how

1288
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,079
small of a mount that i'm adding

1289
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,720
to my five liter sprayer

1290
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,359
i'm thinking to myself how is this going

1291
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:27,519
to

1292
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:28,719
be how is this gonna become ubiquitous

1293
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:31,599
in the sprayer

1294
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,000
so some amount let alone equal amounts

1295
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,240
but

1296
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,079
how will some amount get on all of the

1297
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:37,519
plants and so i'm thinking to myself

1298
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,000
well if i add some more

1299
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:41,280
there's more likelihood that every plant

1300
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,679
will get some

1301
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,440
um how is that taught in in korean

1302
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:48,480
natural farming like what what

1303
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,400
what from that perspective ensures

1304
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,240
that all of the plants are get gonna get

1305
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,400
some of the nutrition out of the foliar

1306
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:57,598
sprayer

1307
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,880
yeah so um

1308
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:04,480
fun fun uh phenomenon natural law

1309
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,200
osmosis so if you throw it in there and

1310
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,639
let it sit

1311
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:11,679
for 30 minutes and give it a swirl

1312
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:13,118
it'll have a much easier time being very

1313
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,159
evenly distributed

1314
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:18,400
in solution than if you throw it in

1315
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:20,799
there shake it once and start spraying

1316
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,318
um so if you're really concerned then

1317
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:26,160
give it give it a little bit

1318
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:28,159
and what happens is those vacuums of

1319
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:28,719
water that are looking for chemical

1320
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:31,118
bonds

1321
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,159
will yank on all that stuff and evenly

1322
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,440
distribute it

1323
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,838
and the places that are higher

1324
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:39,280
concentration will

1325
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:41,440
the the additions you added will move to

1326
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,079
places of lower concentration

1327
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,440
naturally but then giving it a shake it

1328
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,839
it works even better

1329
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,358
right on sure yeah so maybe a shake plus

1330
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:52,318
a little bit of sitting time

1331
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:52,719
would probably be my solution and you

1332
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:56,480
can

1333
00:49:52,719 --> 00:50:00,078
you can use you know a 10 liter sprayer

1334
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:02,639
don't add more you know

1335
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,400
um in ratio don't don't double the

1336
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,000
amount you put in there but if you want

1337
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,160
to spray more to make sure

1338
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,760
it gets everywhere that's totally fine

1339
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,078
yeah it's it's very strange you know

1340
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,400
because i'm sure that a lot of people

1341
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,559
are

1342
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,079
like me where when we when we get to k f

1343
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,680
i'm thinking about ratios for like

1344
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,559
compost tea right

1345
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,719
and so going from a you know a ratio of

1346
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,880
of you know one to two one two three

1347
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:28,000
one to four depending on you know what

1348
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,079
kind of compost tea

1349
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,039
all the way to one to a thousand it's

1350
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,400
like wait

1351
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:36,159
you know is this a typo right

1352
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,838
yeah yeah yeah all right cool thanks for

1353
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:40,879
hitting that um i haven't thought about

1354
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:42,719
osmosis like that um in a long time so

1355
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,960
so let's talk about ohn

1356
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:46,318
so you know we were talking during the

1357
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,679
first set about

1358
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:51,199
how um you know all of these different k

1359
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:54,639
nf preparations

1360
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:57,358
um are are never used alone

1361
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,078
and and that kind of goes double so for

1362
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:00,400
ohn

1363
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,599
because ohn is a is a blend of five

1364
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,639
herbs but then even

1365
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:07,680
ohn you don't use on uh

1366
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:11,118
you know by itself so um

1367
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:12,318
you know would you explain the

1368
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,358
underlying principle

1369
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:18,000
at play justifying using

1370
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,400
ohn as a foliar and so what i'm looking

1371
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,559
for

1372
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:25,838
is both an explanation of what ohn

1373
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:29,359
is and and and why those

1374
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:32,799
five work together so magically

1375
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:36,719
you know when used as a foliar

1376
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:40,079
yeah um

1377
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:43,679
so ohn is um

1378
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:45,680
a combination of herbs that

1379
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:47,519
you know no matter who you're talking to

1380
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:51,279
in the scientific

1381
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:53,559
world um the herbs that we use

1382
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,720
are understood to be kind of

1383
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:57,760
anti-pathogenic

1384
00:51:54,719 --> 00:52:01,519
so they're they're immune boosting or

1385
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:04,079
um disease suppressing herbs

1386
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:06,239
no matter how you look at them it's just

1387
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:09,680
the components they have

1388
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:12,879
have that effect so ohn really

1389
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:17,199
in natural farming is a health tonic

1390
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,200
and specifically

1391
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,200
you know there's there's a lot of health

1392
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:22,880
things plant health

1393
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:24,318
animal health we're doing in natural

1394
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,200
farming but

1395
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:29,119
ohn is specifically targeted to plant

1396
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:32,318
and animal immune system and

1397
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:36,960
and immune support um so it's kind of

1398
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:36,960
a a prebiotic if you will a

1399
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:43,679
nutrient to support the overall kind of

1400
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:47,679
health and immune system of plants

1401
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:50,719
the technology comes from you know

1402
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:53,519
500 year old

1403
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:55,199
chinese traditional medicine recipes

1404
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,239
where

1405
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:59,279
you know good science was done before we

1406
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:02,719
had

1407
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,480
are our big universities and it was done

1408
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,199
by people with

1409
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,760
using observation and experimentation

1410
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:12,558
over thousands of years

1411
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,520
science is the study of nature through

1412
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,440
observation and

1413
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,199
experimentation that's the definition of

1414
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,960
science and so

1415
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:23,199
um we get this this pass down

1416
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,880
of something that works and has worked

1417
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:27,118
for a really long time

1418
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,160
and we're beginning to understand some

1419
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,280
of these

1420
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:34,000
complex biochemicals and and their

1421
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,200
their subtle you know um interactions

1422
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,159
with the human body

1423
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:38,799
or the plant plant and animal kingdoms

1424
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:42,000
but we're

1425
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:45,359
we're kind of limited so kind of the

1426
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,639
best i can do to deep dive into

1427
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:50,159
what the herbs are in natural farming if

1428
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:53,440
we really want to get into it

1429
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:56,000
why would be to to step over into

1430
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,960
a chinese traditional chinese medicine

1431
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,079
explanation

1432
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,480
um would that be helpful shane yeah yeah

1433
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,680
yeah yeah i'm comfortable with that and

1434
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,358
and um

1435
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:07,039
you might be getting ready for this but

1436
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:08,558
i encourage you to just go ahead and

1437
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,318
name the five too because i'm sure

1438
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,319
there's lots of folks listening who

1439
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,079
who don't know that all five of them and

1440
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:15,119
so why don't you start there and then

1441
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,039
and then go into the

1442
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,240
the chinese medicine which which i also

1443
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:22,400
appreciate

1444
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:25,679
yeah so um yeah so i do have a video

1445
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:28,079
on on youtube on how to make this and

1446
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,039
i will admit i've watched my own video

1447
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,640
when i've

1448
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:34,719
forgotten a step or or just got my

1449
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:36,159
you know wires crossed on what i'm doing

1450
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:37,759
next so

1451
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,879
no shame in watching a video while you

1452
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:43,920
make it but um

1453
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:48,079
yeah so it's we we in china

1454
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:51,599
in in making ohio we are fermenting

1455
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:53,200
five herbs that fermentation like we

1456
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:57,440
talked about earlier and

1457
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:59,838
um micronizes or or kind of breaks down

1458
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,960
um some of the the cell walls of these

1459
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:04,838
herbs

1460
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:08,720
and um so so the five herbs are cinnamon

1461
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:11,759
ginger garlic licorice root

1462
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:14,399
and angelica root and we use two parts

1463
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:17,200
of the angelica

1464
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,160
and the cinnamon specifically is cassia

1465
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:22,239
cinnamon

1466
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:24,239
not those real thin um cinnamon sticks

1467
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:26,000
that have that this kind of spiral of

1468
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,919
real thin flesh but we want the

1469
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,559
cinnamon bark it's it's a much thicker

1470
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:34,960
thing and then angelica

1471
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,798
generally we're using sinensis or gigas

1472
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,400
you can you can use there's some other

1473
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:41,358
varieties that work too

1474
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,680
but those are the ones i recommend most

1475
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:46,838
and then licorice we're using the root

1476
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:49,118
um but yeah they're they're

1477
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:51,358
pre-fermented and then tinctured and the

1478
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:56,000
tincture is a high alcohol

1479
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:59,119
30 percent alcohol minimum

1480
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,119
to to pull it into solution and this

1481
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:04,079
is a little different from the typical

1482
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:07,119
preps in natural farming where we're

1483
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,720
fermenting and just really want what

1484
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:11,200
comes out in fermentation

1485
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:11,919
here we're kind of yanking on the

1486
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:15,759
essence

1487
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:19,519
or the these these kind of prebiotic or

1488
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,640
or immune supporting um components of

1489
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:22,400
this plant so we're

1490
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:23,759
we're yanking kind of all of it out in

1491
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,440
the tincturing process it's

1492
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:30,400
it's really fun i i enjoy making ohm

1493
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,280
but um traditional chinese medicine is

1494
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,280
kind of

1495
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,640
where we get some of the explanation and

1496
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,000
and i'm going to

1497
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:41,279
um thank my friend

1498
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,239
jace i am not a traditional chinese

1499
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,680
medicine medicine practitioner and but

1500
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:48,078
i've talked to a few

1501
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:49,679
people that are over the years my friend

1502
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,880
yuki in hawaii

1503
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:55,919
and my friend jace's wife

1504
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,920
is actually a

1505
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:59,598
practitioner of traditional chinese

1506
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,640

this last month and i'll go ahead and

1513
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,119
read it

1514
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:19,358
cinnamon is a warming herb in chinese

1515
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:21,358

ki ginger fresh is warming

1518
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,440
dried ginger is hot in nature and used

1519
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:32,240
to tonify digestion

1520
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,798
garlic is warming and used for parasites

1521
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:35,919
cough

1522
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:38,639
and colds licorice is a neutral or

1523
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,079
herb used in most formulas to tonify

1524
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,480
other herbs

1525
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:45,440
angelica is warming and used for women's

1526
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,440
issues cold

1527
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:53,119
flush and damp condition

1528
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:57,920
to flush damp conditions and they

1529
00:57:53,119 --> 00:58:01,280
are all anthillmentic

1530
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:04,720
i hope i said that right but um but

1531
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:08,480
basically um to if if that was

1532
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:11,199
too much or or overly technical

1533
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,280
these are things that support immune

1534
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:16,798
system i mean we all

1535
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:19,680
drink some you know lemon tea with honey

1536
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:20,159
when we got a cold and we get that that

1537
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:22,798
kind of

1538
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:23,838
soothing effect and it's because that

1539
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:25,759
vitamin c

1540
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:27,119
and the things in honey actually are

1541
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,799
good for our bodies

1542
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,119
well there's a lot of stuff like that

1543
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:34,798
and these ones are specifically

1544
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:38,640
for a continual um

1545
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:41,838
kind of um aid to overall health

1546
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:43,759
uh continual aid to fight off disease

1547
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:44,960
but not in the way in that these

1548
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,400
directly attack

1549
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:50,798
disease or are their own sword and

1550
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,200
shield against disease these are

1551
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:54,798
preventing disease in that they are

1552
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:56,798
making healthier

1553
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:58,159
the plant or animal and so that they

1554
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:00,239
aren't susceptible

1555
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:01,199
i'm very i'm very grateful to have had

1556
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:05,519
the opportunity to

1557
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:07,838
date a gal who um was an acupuncturist

1558
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:08,960
and hearing you describe it from the

1559
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:12,639
chinese medicine

1560
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:16,400
direction you know she she would say oh

1561
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:19,199
these are all herbs that create movement

1562
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,559
are warming and increase the immune

1563
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:22,719
system because those

1564
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,839
those flavors all tend to work really

1565
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:26,078
well together

1566
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:28,159
and so i like how you said that you know

1567
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:31,200
these are not aggressive herbs that go

1568
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:34,078
and attack you know pests or or

1569
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,598
disease they are actually fortifying and

1570
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,000
help you build up

1571
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,880
you know your personal chi your strength

1572
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,760
your your

1573
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,440
core essence or whatever and i never

1574
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,880
really thought about those working

1575
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,480
in plants as well um and and even though

1576
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,559
to a lot of people who are new

1577
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,159
to like you were saying this the

1578
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:55,680
storytelling nature

1579
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:56,078
of oriental medicine um just because

1580
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:57,679
it's

1581
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:00,798
they talk about it in a different way

1582
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:03,759
doesn't make it any less true

1583
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:05,280
yeah yeah and that's that's where we we

1584
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,640
get into a little trouble

1585
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:11,119
we we say oh you know white lab coat

1586
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:12,078
and peer review studies is the only

1587
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,280
source of

1588
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:18,480
true information or explanation of

1589
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,040
natural law and um that's just not the

1590
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,559
case

1591
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:24,639
we we understand so little in that forum

1592
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,599
you know especially when we're talking

1593
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:28,719
about

1594
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:31,599
uh soil life and uh

1595
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:32,719
complex or diversity in microbiological

1596
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,640
communities

1597
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:36,558
we're just scratching the surface in

1598
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:39,598
that in that forum so

1599
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:41,440
we do need to um keep paying attention

1600
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,760
to the um

1601
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,119
well well i guess i i i like to say we

1602
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,319
need to keep humble

1603
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,358
in just how complex nature is and that

1604
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:51,599
we are

1605
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:52,880
as a scientific community moving towards

1606
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,838
understanding it

1607
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,440
but we are by no means um cresting the

1608
01:00:55,838 --> 01:01:00,239
hill of understanding

1609
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,159
how this all works in conjunction and

1610
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,879
you know even though there is a lot more

1611
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,199
to

1612
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,838
the human experience than lab coats and

1613
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:09,519
studies there's no doubt that

1614
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:12,000
you know oriental medicine has been

1615
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:14,960
proven out in universities and

1616
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,358
medical research as well um it's it's

1617
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,240
just

1618
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:18,639
that came after the storytelling did um

1619
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:19,838
when

1620
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:22,400
people have been trying this stuff for

1621
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:23,679
thousands of years so okay so let's

1622
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,079
let's circle back to

1623
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:28,078
the original question which was you know

1624
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,200
we're talking about the blending of

1625
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,240
these different k

1626
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:35,519
f preparations and we know why

1627
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:36,479
we blend the ohn inputs so that they've

1628
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:39,440
got this

1629
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,719
this you know warming movement and

1630
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,920
immune building

1631
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:47,118
uh uh impact on the plant

1632
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,200
um but you said even ohn is not

1633
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,640
used alone which is funny because it's

1634
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:53,759
already got five things in it

1635
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:56,879
so so what do we want to blend our ohn

1636
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,119
with when we apply it either as a foliar

1637
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,400
or

1638
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,680
as a root drench well yeah well you know

1639
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,400
broken record chris

1640
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:06,318
over here it's the same it's the same

1641
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,358
two things you know that that

1642
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:12,400
base it's kind of like

1643
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:15,199
you know we're making a pizza and

1644
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,318
um you know for my you know my

1645
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:19,519
six-year-old

1646
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:21,759
he wants anchovies and and my

1647
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:24,318
you know nine-year-old she wants

1648
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:27,359
tomatoes or or olives

1649
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:28,000
you know um i gotta have the crust the

1650
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:31,119
cheese

1651
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,719
and the sauce and then they can

1652
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:38,079
you know they can you know coat

1653
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:41,759
with the things that best feed them um

1654
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:43,440
you know from my condiment you know tray

1655
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,359
they can put whatever they want on there

1656
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,318
but we're not making pizza without the

1657
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:49,199
sauce

1658
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:51,038
the crust and the cheese and so the

1659
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:54,078
sauce and the crust and the cheese

1660
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:57,599
of natural farming is fpj

1661
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:59,920
ohn and vinegar and so

1662
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,880
those those stay together they stick

1663
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,318
together like

1664
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:07,440
sauce crust and cheese on pizza they

1665
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:12,000
they are they are always in combination

1666
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:15,039
so ohn is never used in natural farming

1667
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,679
aside from

1668
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,960
those those other two so maintenance

1669
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:20,798
solution is your base

1670
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,280
and then you can add per the plants

1671
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:25,358
nutrient needs so if they need to eat

1672
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,599
they're hungry they're they're growing

1673
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:28,719
teenager they're in vegetative growth

1674
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:30,880
and they're just

1675
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:33,439
need to be given as much food as they

1676
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,358
can then you're using fish amino acid

1677
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,720
and you're putting that in with that

1678
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:39,038
base

1679
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:41,038
so the anchovies you know if you will

1680
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:43,680
but um

1681
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,240
yeah but there are a few times where

1682
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:47,038
we're doing

1683
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:49,598
something with ohn when we make faa we

1684
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:53,280
put a tiny bit of ohn in

1685
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:55,039
with imo and that gets no fpj or vinegar

1686
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,798
so there are these few but as far as

1687
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,799
like really feeding the plants

1688
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:00,880
or even feeding animals because you can

1689
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:03,519
use ohn in like

1690
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,318
baby chick water or full grown chicken

1691
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:07,519
water or

1692
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:07,519
cattle or pig water

1693
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,960
yeah it's used in combination with those

1694
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,920
other two

1695
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,318
so vinegar and fpj while we're here real

1696
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,440
quick

1697
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:19,679
um what's the ratio of ohn into

1698
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,880
livestock water

1699
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:24,838
oh do i have that all off the top of my

1700
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,599
head

1701
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:30,960
um ah

1702
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:34,079
i think that ohn

1703
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,639
is one to seven hundred

1704
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:38,480
uh depends also it's like is it a baby

1705
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:39,199
chick is it a full-grown chick is it a

1706
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,519
pig

1707
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:43,038
or a cow oh so there are a lot of

1708
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:45,838
variables all right

1709
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,280
yeah um but it's it's a little bit more

1710
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:50,639
than plants

1711
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:53,519
um i think it's one to seven hundred ohn

1712
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:54,000
and then and and similar ratio you

1713
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:57,358
increase

1714
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:00,719
the fpga and vinegar also

1715
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:00,719
um you know

1716
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:09,358
i probably have it but yeah

1717
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:12,318
anyways and then and then you um

1718
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:15,838
you you know for bees even you can give

1719
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:19,279
ohn and lab and fpj and vinegar

1720
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:21,038
but generally speaking we're giving it

1721
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,480
other than baby chicks we're giving it

1722
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:26,079
as an optional

1723
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,920
drink a side next to water so that they

1724
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:31,280
have the option to drink this

1725
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,280
nutrient rich solution

1726
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:37,919
you know next to the water that's

1727
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,400
um always available so that they're you

1728
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,639
know as

1729
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,480
it's kind of like a mineral lick almost

1730
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:45,759
for cattle if you're familiar with that

1731
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:48,798
yeah for sure they'll put out a salt or

1732
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,720
complex mineral block and

1733
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:52,880
cows will go drink some water and

1734
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:54,399
they'll lick this salt cube for a minute

1735
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,720
and then they'll go off and

1736
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,760
go about their day and so that's kind of

1737
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:59,759
how

1738
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,520
the natural farming inputs are used in

1739
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,280
livestock right on well i don't want to

1740
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:05,920
guess to get too far

1741
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,880
far afield i was gonna say we could go a

1742
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,760
little ways in that

1743
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,880
yeah but but uh i may we should pick up

1744
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,240
on that another time

1745
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:17,519
um so so circling back to um

1746
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:20,479
ohn uh so so now that we know

1747
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:22,000
uh what's in it and and what we're you

1748
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:25,199
know what we want to blend it with

1749
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,280
to spray i'm curious when

1750
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:30,000
when uh you know after we've made the

1751
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:32,640
individual inputs for ohn

1752
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,440
do you normally store your inputs

1753
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:35,598
separately

1754
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,720
and mix it up fresh every time you're

1755
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:39,760
about to use it

1756
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:43,358
or do you go ahead and and

1757
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:47,280
mix it into the ohn and you know just

1758
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:50,480
put it away pre-made

1759
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:53,440
yeah so ohn's always stored separately

1760
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,318
um you can make as much as you need for

1761
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,599
like a year

1762
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:59,519
or six months which is generally what i

1763
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:03,680
do i'll make a six month

1764
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:07,119
amount for what i need but um

1765
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:09,118
typically i'm yeah it's for

1766
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:11,119
for storage for long-term storage and

1767
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:14,240
that's one of the cool things about ohn

1768
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:17,920
is it gets better with age it continues

1769
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:21,279
to micronize in storage

1770
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,920
and so it kind of gets more and more

1771
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:25,119
in solution if you will or small

1772
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,480
particles

1773
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:30,960
while it sits there and

1774
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,920
that increases its effectiveness

1775
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,440
actually

1776
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,240
so ohn that's been sitting for three

1777
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,960
years

1778
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:40,798
we consider twice as effective as fresh

1779
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:44,000
ohn

1780
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:48,318
wow because of how well it's taken

1781
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:51,199
in or or absorbed by the plant or animal

1782
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:52,719
and so actually if you have three year

1783
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:56,159
old ohn

1784
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:58,000
we um reduce the application rate

1785
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,399
by fifty percent instead of one to a

1786
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,159
thousand it becomes one to two thousand

1787
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,838
so i'm always encouraging people that

1788
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:05,358
are really they're they're getting

1789
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:06,480
serious about natural farming and

1790
01:08:05,358 --> 01:08:07,679
they're gonna go on their natural

1791
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,719
farming journey

1792
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:12,969
say make a five-year batch of ohn

1793
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:14,639
because just by making it

1794
01:08:12,969 --> 01:08:18,238
[Music]

1795
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:21,838
enough to last you five years you've

1796
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:24,399
nearly halved the cost of it

1797
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:25,920
for your farm because you're buying your

1798
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:29,759
inputs

1799
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:32,719
at scale right no because

1800
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:34,640
you're by year three oh because it gets

1801
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:36,640
stronger and more potent

1802
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,560
by year three you're using half the

1803
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:42,079
amount so

1804
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:45,279
by not making only enough for a year

1805
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:47,278
you effectively are making your same

1806
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,359
materials go farther

1807
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,880
so please resolve these two things you

1808
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:53,279
said you said

1809
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,719
we we store the stuff separate and then

1810
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:57,199
we only want to mix enough

1811
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,279
for six months to a year but now you're

1812
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:02,158
saying three and five year ohn

1813
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,759
totally kicks ass so how will you

1814
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:08,238
resolve those

1815
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:08,719
yeah so ohn is the combination of the

1816
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:12,798
herb

1817
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:15,520
of the the six parts or five parts

1818
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:16,560
it's just double angelica ohn is

1819
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,159
combining them all

1820
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:23,279
but they still age really well

1821
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:26,960
and age better separately and so

1822
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:29,359
my my six my six containers or my five

1823
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:32,880
containers and a double large container

1824
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:36,560
um are all sitting there separately

1825
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:38,798
aging oh i get it and i can i can

1826
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:40,960
i can make three year old ohn if they've

1827
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:44,238
been sitting there separately aging

1828
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:47,359
and i mix all those parts to make ohn

1829
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:49,599
my ohn is three years old but i'm just

1830
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,480
mixing it fresh for use yeah i get i get

1831
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,960
it you get you've got

1832
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:55,198
um you know multiple bottles that are

1833
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:58,079
three years old and then you blend them

1834
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:58,399
so it isn't that when when you say that

1835
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:01,439
they

1836
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:04,879
um you know they they evolve

1837
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:06,960
um you don't mean that they evolve in

1838
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,039
in combination to each other each one is

1839
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:12,158
evolving in its own jar

1840
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:12,560
yeah they continue to yeah kind of break

1841
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:15,599
down

1842
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,360
or or become more available in their own

1843
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,239
jars and then we still mix it

1844
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:22,319
but those those com those those five

1845
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:23,359
containers sitting on the shelf or six

1846
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:27,039
containers

1847
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:30,079
sitting on the shelf are aging

1848
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:32,158
appropriately got it um uh

1849
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:33,679
are you are you do you are is that your

1850
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:35,119
water that keeps on dingling or do you

1851
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:37,520
have a bell on you brother

1852
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:38,559
i'm sorry that's my water it's the ice

1853
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,760
in my water i'm

1854
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,320
all right probably shaking it a

1855
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,239
subconscious everybody who's got

1856
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:45,920
headphones on or it's probably really

1857
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:49,599
getting to them so

1858
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:52,640
um so sorry about that so the um

1859
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:55,840
so you said when we spray the ohn um

1860
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,719
we want to spray it with um brown rice

1861
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,400
vinegar

1862
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,920
um and you said you know there are some

1863
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:02,639
other types of vinegars

1864
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,000
that might work as well um can you talk

1865
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,000
about that a little bit because

1866
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,279
you know i i the the vinegar that i've

1867
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,319
got is a

1868
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:13,599
um is a as a bamboo

1869
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:15,198
vinegar um and uh

1870
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,640
you know i like it and it and it does

1871
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:19,279
what i want it to do

1872
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,640
but why do does korean natural farming

1873
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:23,439
default towards

1874
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,199
uh rice vinegar and and is that because

1875
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:27,279
rice vinegar is particularly

1876
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:29,839
attractive for some reason or is it

1877
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:32,158
because we're trying to avoid

1878
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,920
cheap crappy vinegar made out of bad

1879
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:37,839
ingredients

1880
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:41,520
really great question chango um

1881
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:45,199
so the

1882
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:48,400
um so the ph

1883
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:51,919
balancing effect for like liquid imo

1884
01:11:48,399 --> 01:11:54,879
or these different preps is

1885
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,158
um kind of universal for vinegars and so

1886
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,480
we're getting that

1887
01:11:56,158 --> 01:12:01,039
that balancing if you have some apple

1888
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:03,599
cider vinegar or your bamboo vinegar

1889
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:05,119
it works and you can use that and you

1890
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,840
should feel like you're doing the right

1891
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,158
thing

1892
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,360
um you're not cutting a corner it is it

1893
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:13,119
is great

1894
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:16,000
um however grain vinegar um

1895
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:18,158
has a different mix of nutrients in it

1896
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,760
we don't typically think of vinegar as a

1897
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:23,198
nutrient source

1898
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:26,320
um we think of it just as some

1899
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:26,639
acidic liquid you know but the reality

1900
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:28,880
is

1901
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,239
it has specific biochemicals and

1902
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:33,520
nutrients

1903
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:38,079
based on what it was made out of so um

1904
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:41,280
your body is being um you're being fed

1905
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:45,359
by your consumption of your you know

1906
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:48,479
um whatever uh

1907
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:51,839
your what is that really wonderful

1908
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:54,959
vinegar from modea in italy um

1909
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:57,440
um the balsamic the salmon

1910
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,359
yeah so balsamic or red wine vinegar

1911
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:02,238
you're getting the nutrients

1912
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:03,359
from grapes you know or from whatever

1913
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:07,279
they're making it out of

1914
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:10,559
bamboo with grain

1915
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:13,519
there's all this

1916
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,960
you know plant proteins especially with

1917
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,560
rice and fats

1918
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,079
that are getting broken down in the

1919
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:21,039
process of making that vinegar

1920
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:22,399
and those nutrients stay present in that

1921
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:25,039
vinegar

1922
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:27,119
additionally specifically with rice

1923
01:13:25,039 --> 01:13:30,399
vinegar and grain vinegars

1924
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:33,679
is they have even though they're an acid

1925
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:37,119
they are are said to have an alkalizing

1926
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:40,239
or a balancing effect um

1927
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:42,319
in their nutritional profile um when

1928
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:45,439
used or when consumed

1929
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:49,039
and so that that kind of

1930
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:51,039
nuanced effect is what we're going for

1931
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:52,079
in the rice vinegar and then why we

1932
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:55,198
recommend that

1933
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:58,079
right on that it doesn't have to say

1934
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:58,879
brown on the right excuse me on the rice

1935
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:02,158
vinegar

1936
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:05,679
they can just say rice vinegar right on

1937
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:09,119
um right on so um so

1938
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:12,399
one more detail yeah yeah go ahead so

1939
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:15,039
in korea they're really really

1940
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:16,158
into their brown rice vinegar creation

1941
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:19,198
process

1942
01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:21,679
and so legit korean

1943
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:22,719
brown rice vinegar um if you're if

1944
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:24,158
you're getting uh

1945
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,920
you know you're probably going to pay a

1946
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:29,839
little bit more for it

1947
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,840
if you find it but that

1948
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,679
is kind of made at this like artisan

1949
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,000
standard

1950
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:37,520
in the process and how they go about it

1951
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,520
it's definitely

1952
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,280
all of these are not the same you know

1953
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,880
the the way they make that and what

1954
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:45,279
you're getting

1955
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,199
as a result is is pretty different from

1956
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:49,679
your typical vinegar creation what you

1957
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:53,279
the only one you want to stay away from

1958
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:55,039
shango is uh like a white vinegar

1959
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:57,279
where you where you don't know the fruit

1960
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:59,840
that went into it because there

1961
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:01,519
is a vinegar process that's derived from

1962
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,440
petroleum

1963
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,440
where they make a like an ethanol

1964
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:08,559
alcohol and turn it into vinegar

1965
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:11,198
and it's a shortcut vinegar and

1966
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,080
the nutrients aren't good and that's

1967
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:15,039
actually

1968
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:17,198
um how monsanto started um they were a

1969
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:20,079
vinegar company and they came up with

1970
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:21,119
a shortcut in the vinegar making process

1971
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:24,559
that is called

1972
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:25,119
the monsanto process it reminds me it's

1973
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,320
kind of like

1974
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:29,599
whole plant vinegar you know you you

1975
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:32,639
want something authentic

1976
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:34,960
and true to the plant yeah yeah

1977
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:36,159
right on well cool so let's go ahead and

1978
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,439
take our second break

1979
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:39,920
when we come back we're going to be

1980
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:42,479
talking about germinating seeds

1981
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:44,560
you are listening to shaping fire and my

1982
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:45,459
guest today is natural farming educator

1983
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,719
chris trump

1984
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:48,399
[Music]

1985
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:50,239
for years organic cultivators have been

1986
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:50,960
looking for a replacement for using peat

1987
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:52,959
moss

1988
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,480
peat moss has long been the go-to soil

1989
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,520
amendment for water retention and

1990
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:57,599
container growing

1991
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,440
but organic growers know that peat moss

1992
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,360
is an unsustainable resource

1993
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:03,919
and the mining of peat bogs destroys

1994
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:05,759
habitat and releases sequestered carbon

1995
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,279
but peat moss works so well that many

1996
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,280
have continued to use it

1997
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:11,119
but now there's finally a revolutionary

1998
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:12,079
replacement for peat moss that shares

1999
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:15,119
the same benefits

2000
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:17,439
while also being sustainable pit moss

2001
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:19,198
sounds and axe like peat moss but

2002
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:20,158
instead of being mined from fragile

2003
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:21,759
ecosystems

2004
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:23,679
it actually is made from upcycled

2005
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,840
organic paper and tree bark

2006
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,359
pit moss is excellent at retaining water

2007
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,159
in your substrate and creating air

2008
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:30,639
pockets and

2009
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:31,359
tiny living environments for microbes

2010
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,920
pit moss

2011
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,559
instantly increases aeration nutrient

2012
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,359
absorption

2013
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,400
and water conservation too carefully and

2014
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:40,319
locally sourced

2015
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:42,639
pit moss is the result of decades long

2016
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,759
research into the use of recycled paper

2017
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,079
fibers

2018
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:48,480
pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat

2019
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:51,279
moss and handles exactly the same

2020
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:53,198
and like peat moss pit moss is inert so

2021
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:55,039
it won't change your ph

2142
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:57,119
shango los and our guest this week is

2143
01:20:54,158 --> 01:20:59,198
natural farming educator chris trump

2144
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:01,039
so chris you alluded to it earlier on

2145
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:03,439
for in first set but one of the things

2146
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:07,679
that i'm most interested in in now

2147
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:10,799
is the particular k nf preparation

2148
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:13,279
that is used to germinate seeds um

2149
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,000
you know we we all have got so much

2150
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:16,800
value in

2151
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,039
our seeds we want to get as good as

2152
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,960
germination ratio as we can

2153
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:22,800
and for many of us we're using seeds

2154
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,198
that are you know several years

2155
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,840
to potentially decades old and i'm sure

2156
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:28,799
that

2157
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,319
they can use all the support they need

2158
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,760
earlier in the show you were talking

2159
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:34,559
about

2160
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,159
the the nutritive cycle and how that

2161
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,960
relates to humans

2162
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:40,399
where um you know like really fresh

2163
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,239
babies get the colostrum

2164
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:43,759
and then they switch to mother's milk

2165
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:44,399
and then you know that they're starting

2166
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,480
out with very

2167
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,439
simple mashed foods and then you know

2168
01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:50,079
through life

2169
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:52,158
the food that we have changes um i know

2170
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:55,920
this is true for germinating seeds

2171
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:56,559
too will you lay it out for us please

2172
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,279
yeah

2173
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:01,120
yeah it's actually it's it's a a

2174
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:03,519
wonderful thing and especially if you

2175
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:07,039
have so much value in your seeds

2176
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,920
and um and maybe their kind of ability

2177
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:11,519
to germinate

2178
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:13,760
if they're 10 years old is is reduced

2179
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,719
yeah the the natural farming prep for

2180
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:19,420
for popping seeds is huge

2181
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:21,520
and um it's

2182
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:24,880
[Music]

2183
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:27,040
in side by sides the effect of giving

2184
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:31,039
them this minor nutrient

2185
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:34,399
in while they're in seed form

2186
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:35,279
persists so you will have a more vibrant

2187
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:38,399
plant

2188
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:41,679
with no other changes just by

2189
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:45,198
giving them this seed nutrient to

2190
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:46,800
get them to pop and and that's

2191
01:22:45,198 --> 01:22:48,719
we've done that out in side-by-side

2192
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:51,199
trials wendy kornberg

2193
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:53,520
did a cool side-by-side trial with that

2194
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:57,198
and she did it on multiple plants

2195
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:59,280
where she's she popped them with and

2196
01:22:57,198 --> 01:23:02,719
without seed soaked solution

2197
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:03,840
and she had lifelong or the whole life

2198
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:07,039
of the plant

2199
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:08,480
effect from um just that one step well

2200
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:11,359
everything else was

2201
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:11,678
kept the same and she photographed it

2202
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:14,799
and

2203
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:16,399
and and and tracked the the growth

2204
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,760
throughout their uh their whole journey

2205
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:21,198
it was pretty cool

2206
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:22,000
um but others have done that and um yeah

2207
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:26,000
so the

2208
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,079
the prep uh which in this conversation

2209
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
you're gonna get tired of me saying it

2210
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:32,479
but it's just those three

2211
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,840
that that base nutrient that we use in

2212
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:36,638
natural farming

2213
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,920
sbj one to five hundred brown rice

2214
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,760
vinegar vinegar

2215
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,279
one to five hundred and ohm one to a

2216
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:44,800
thousand and so

2217
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:48,319
um what you wanna do is soak em

2218
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,520
for um anywhere from an hour to you know

2219
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:51,920
10 hours

2220
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,840
if you are soaking them 10 hours just be

2221
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:57,279
aware they might be popping

2222
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,840
in that cup because it really does speed

2223
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:01,599
up that

2224
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:04,800
that germination time as well as

2225
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:05,360
increase kind of vitality in the in the

2226
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,239
seed

2227
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:10,079
um yeah but that's it i mean if you did

2228
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:11,519
nothing else with natural farming other

2229
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:13,600
than popped your seeds with

2230
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,360
seed soak solution i think you'd get a

2231
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:18,239
real boost

2232
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:19,119
the pictures that i've seen from after

2233
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:22,319
you mentioned

2234
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:23,679
uh seed soak solution a few days ago

2235
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:24,399
when we talked i went ahead and i looked

2236
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:26,960
it up

2237
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:27,519
and some of the side by side pictures

2238
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,158
people

2239
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,800
showed were really impressive like you

2240
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:33,839
know

2241
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:35,279
the normally a seed will will soak in

2242
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:37,440
just plain water

2243
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:40,399
and you'll get a tail and you know you

2244
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:42,399
move it over to soil or whatever

2245
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:44,000
but the ones that were in seed soak

2246
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:46,000
solution yeah they threw the

2247
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,760
tail but you know they've already got

2248
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,359
hairs coming out the side and they're

2249
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,119
like all rambunctious they're like hell

2250
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:54,479
yeah let's go

2251
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:57,198
yeah and it doesn't just feed the

2252
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:58,559
seed if you are farming in living soil

2253
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:02,000
you're also

2254
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,760
sending your kid to school with a

2255
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,719
bag full of cookies to share with his

2256
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:10,480
friends or her friends you know it's

2257
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:13,679
it's kind of like giving them

2258
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:14,158
some some social boosts in their root

2259
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:16,960
zone

2260
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:17,839
to make those relationships that will be

2261
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,239
lifelong

2262
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,760
uh symbiotic relationships with the

2263
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:24,319
microbial world

2264
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,000
in their root zone and so it's it's a

2265
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:28,639
it's a pretty big deal um

2266
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,079
and and really uh helpful it can be a

2267
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:33,679
little bit of a pain

2268
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:36,079
to deal with wet seeds and so if you

2269
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:38,158
soak them a short time before they pop

2270
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:39,439
but you have some sort of auto cedar or

2271
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:41,920
something

2272
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:43,678
you can soak them and then let them kind

2273
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,840
of

2274
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:48,239
just barely dry or dry enough that

2275
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:51,360
they're they function as a dry seed for

2276
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:52,718
like an auto seeder and still get the

2277
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:54,559
effect

2278
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:56,399
but if you obviously if you let them

2279
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,960
soak until the tails pop you don't want

2280
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:00,079
to

2281
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:01,039
dry them back out but yeah it's um it's

2282
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:04,158
a pretty simple

2283
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:05,439
process and and it's good for tree

2284
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:07,519
saplings

2285
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:08,879
all the way down to seeds let's talk

2286
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,120
about that idea of

2287
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,000
uh kind of banking some of those

2288
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:14,079
nutrients

2289
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,119
for the plant you know sending the kid

2290
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:17,359
to school

2291
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:18,158
so is the is the idea behind that

2292
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:21,519
anecdote

2293
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:24,638
that um if the seed is soaked in

2294
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:26,800
soaks seed soaked solution and those

2295
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:30,400
nutrients that are in that solution

2296
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:34,079
are binding um or even just

2297
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:38,319
statically clinging to the

2298
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:41,279
the the root tail um to become tap root

2299
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:42,238
that when you put it in the soil that

2300
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:45,599
seed is

2301
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:48,238
already um bringing

2302
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,760
nutrients to the party and so in the

2303
01:26:48,238 --> 01:26:50,000
same way that we've got an adult plant

2304
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,520
that

2305
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:57,039
is trading incoming nutrition

2306
01:26:53,520 --> 01:27:00,639
from the microbes in exchange for

2307
01:26:57,039 --> 01:27:01,920
giving exudates to everybody living in

2308
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:04,000
the rhizosphere

2309
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:06,639
is it that same kind of thing it's like

2310
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:10,158
the even this young

2311
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:13,359
this r this young tail of the seed is

2312
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:15,439
is is coming to the soil packed with all

2313
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:17,119
the nutrients from the solution

2314
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:18,879
and so it just jump starts that

2315
01:27:17,119 --> 01:27:21,039
relationship

2316
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:22,400
exactly right no you you explain you

2317
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:24,560
said that really well

2318
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:26,799
um and it's not just what's clinging to

2319
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:30,320
the root it's actually been absorbed

2320
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:33,679
into the plant itself and so it has that

2321
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:36,399
as a kind of strength

2322
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,359
almost like it has extra to share from

2323
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:39,599
the get-go

2324
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:40,639
rather than being super needy from the

2325
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,960
get-go

2326
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:44,319
um and then yeah that can really jump

2327
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,880
start that whole

2328
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:48,799
relationship and the rise of fear it's

2329
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,840
it's like being that person who shows up

2330
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,400
to the party

2331
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,199
with like like like like booze and

2332
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:54,960
beverage and

2333
01:27:53,198 --> 01:27:56,399
food and they walk in the door with

2334
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,840
their arms full and everybody's like

2335
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:01,119
yeah they're here you know and exactly

2336
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:03,360
yeah i can see how the

2337
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:04,880
how the soil would welcome that so all

2338
01:28:03,359 --> 01:28:07,119
right great well thank you i wanted to

2339
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:09,840
wanted to hit on that germination thing

2340
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:10,479
and so uh the next thing um let's talk

2341
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:14,239
about

2342
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:17,759
um the massive popularity of

2343
01:28:14,238 --> 01:28:19,839
fermented fruit juice versus fermented

2344
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:23,039
plant juice because

2345
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:25,920
a lot of people tend to

2346
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:26,960
you know think that these two different

2347
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,920
preparations

2348
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:31,119
work equally but we we know that they

2349
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,480
work differently and i know there's

2350
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:34,559
confusion because there's so many

2351
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:37,119
contrasting opinions online and if

2352
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,920
and if the bro science is teaching both

2353
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:40,559
um

2354
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,679
i i know that that there must be more to

2355
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,719
learn here so

2356
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:47,600
so would you clarify for us uh

2357
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:51,039
when to use fermented plant juice versus

2358
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:53,199
when to use fermented fruit juice

2359
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:55,198
you know shango this is one of those

2360
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:56,960
questions that i just don't share with

2361
01:28:55,198 --> 01:29:00,960
everybody it's behind the

2362
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,960
behind the pay wall and you don't uh

2363
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:05,599
this is this is the the korean

2364
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,600
intellectual property

2365
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:10,320
yes yeah this is this is where it stops

2366
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:12,880
that really sharing stuff no

2367
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:14,238
that's a joke this isn't uh this doesn't

2368
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:17,679
work like that uh

2369
01:29:14,238 --> 01:29:18,238
you know you get uh anybody gets any

2370
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:21,520
question

2371
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:22,799
answered in in this whole um kind of

2372
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,199
realm of tech and

2373
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,400
and um you know what what i do find

2374
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:27,839
though is

2375
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:29,679
when you're just starting out the

2376
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,319
questions are really similar they're the

2377
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:32,079
they're

2378
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:34,158
they're a lot of the same questions and

2379
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:37,119
they're in the basic understanding

2380
01:29:34,158 --> 01:29:39,039
and then as people get a little more

2381
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:40,319
into it they start to understand kind of

2382
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:42,479
how it works

2383
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:43,439
and the questions change and so i have a

2384
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:46,638
lot of

2385
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:48,238
past students that are you know um what

2386
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:50,319
they asked when they first learned this

2387
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:53,119
versus what they're asking now

2388
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:55,439
three four years later it's totally

2389
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:58,000
different and and i'm able to give

2390
01:29:55,439 --> 01:29:59,359
the nuance and and the the details of

2391
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,520
the information

2392
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:03,198
um where it just wouldn't be understood

2393
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,920
initially initially it's

2394
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:06,719
it is it's a bit of a rabbit hole and so

2395
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,399
it's um

2396
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:10,560
that you kind of need to travel down a

2397
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:12,719
little bit before you understand that

2398
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,760
that next bit and master cho when he

2399
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:17,198
teaches

2400
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:20,079
right now you you sit with him and

2401
01:30:17,198 --> 01:30:21,359
there's so much good stuff in in what he

2402
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:23,600
has to say

2403
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:26,158
but if you're just beginning and trying

2404
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:28,000
to understand what natural farming is

2405
01:30:26,158 --> 01:30:30,238
you're getting almost nothing out of the

2406
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,719
conversation because

2407
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:33,599
it requires a little bit of base

2408
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:36,158
understanding

2409
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,920
for um for some of the philosophy and

2410
01:30:36,158 --> 01:30:40,559
what not to be um

2411
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,679
understood and it's not it's not cultish

2412
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,560
it's just

2413
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:46,480
you know you don't you don't start at a

2414
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,239
you know a doctorate program when you go

2415
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:50,000
to college because

2416
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:52,879
there's there's a bit of a journey to

2417
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:56,158
understand how everything connects and

2418
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:57,440
um no i uh yeah you always get the

2419
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:00,158
answers if you ask

2420
01:30:57,439 --> 01:31:02,238
unless it's like a six hour explanation

2421
01:31:00,158 --> 01:31:04,158
to get you all the dots connected

2422
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:06,158
right on so how so when do we choose to

2423
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:08,638
use fermented plant juice versus

2424
01:31:06,158 --> 01:31:11,119
fermented fruit juice

2425
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:12,880
yeah so fermented fruit juice believe it

2426
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:16,399
or not even though it's

2427
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:20,159
highly talked about in the internet

2428
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:22,719
or on the internet is is very limited in

2429
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:25,039
its uses in natural farming

2430
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:26,399
we really only use fermented fruit juice

2431
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:30,880
in some

2432
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:34,238
livestock feed preparations

2433
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:36,319
and then just in ripening so in the last

2434
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:37,439
you know three four weeks of a plant's

2435
01:31:36,319 --> 01:31:39,439
life would

2436
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:42,079
fermented fruit juice be a valid

2437
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:43,279
nutrient and so if you were doing tana

2438
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:45,760
for example

2439
01:31:43,279 --> 01:31:47,759
and you were soil drenching you could

2440
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:50,159
bring in a fermented fruit juice

2441
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:52,239
there at the end and you would also add

2442
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:55,519
in

2443
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:58,638
1-30 seawater and that

2444
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:01,440
is the enzymatic profile of

2445
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:02,639
ripe fruit compared to unripe fruit or

2446
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:04,638
plant material

2447
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:06,239
is totally different and so what it's

2448
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:09,520
telling the plant to do

2449
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:13,279
as far as um what to do with

2450
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:15,840
with sugars that they have built up etc

2451
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:17,759
is very different when you apply a

2452
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,960
fermented plant juice versus a fermented

2453
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,480
fruit juice and if you're applying

2454
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:22,800
fermented fruit juice well it's in

2455
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:24,799
vegetative growth

2456
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,639
it just is not the right signals for

2457
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:29,679
your plants those

2458
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:32,719
those those enzymes

2459
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:36,000
the the way they're expressed in a ripe

2460
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:37,840
fruit is um is such that you really

2461
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,359
don't want that as a nutrient

2462
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:43,760
in your kind of early growth or

2463
01:32:41,359 --> 01:32:45,839
vegetative growth or even early fruiting

2464
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:47,679
you want that right as it's ripening off

2465
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:50,000
or finishing

2466
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:51,359
and and so that's maybe one or two

2467
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,960
applications

2468
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:56,639
three maybe um so it's it's it's

2469
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:58,239
and it would be better to be in the soil

2470
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:00,560
too yeah

2471
01:32:58,238 --> 01:33:01,759
well for cannabis it would be not for

2472
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:05,440
for an apple

2473
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:08,719
or or um you know or pears or

2474
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:09,439
you know tomatoes or something ripening

2475
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:11,359
solution

2476
01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:13,039
has a really important or can have a

2477
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:14,000
really important role like a tomato

2478
01:33:13,039 --> 01:33:15,760
farmer

2479
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,238
it's going to get all these tomatoes in

2480
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,920
the peak and then right as the weather

2481
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:22,000
starts cooling down they got all these

2482
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:24,639
green tomatoes on the plant

2483
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,000
and they want them to ripen before kind

2484
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:28,079
of the season's over

2485
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
it's a great time for ripening solution

2486
01:33:28,079 --> 01:33:32,880
it can be applied fully early

2487
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:35,439
and you're going to kind of boost boost

2488
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:37,600
those tomatoes right over the hump to

2489
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:39,198
get some more ripe fruit before they

2490
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:42,560
kind of

2491
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:43,119
pitter out but yeah so fermented fruit

2492
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:46,000
juice

2493
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:46,960
is important in natural farming but not

2494
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,238
necessarily

2495
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:53,920
in the importance as as people

2496
01:33:50,238 --> 01:33:57,519
talk about it on the internet

2497
01:33:53,920 --> 01:34:00,639
so um for folks who live um

2498
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:02,960
you know in sub-optimum cannabis growing

2499
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:04,319
areas like where i live on vashon island

2500
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,800
in washington state

2501
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:08,079
where we have got shorter summers that

2502
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:11,119
are not as

2503
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:14,399
warm as say california

2504
01:34:11,119 --> 01:34:14,880
would it be a good tool in my toolbox to

2505
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:18,158
use

2506
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:21,760
fermented fruit juice there

2507
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:24,158
after say week four to hurry up

2508
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,480
the flowering process process does it

2509
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:29,519
have that ability

2510
01:34:26,479 --> 01:34:30,479
it can it's gonna be limited i mean you

2511
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:34,159
can't

2512
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:36,879
you can't change the cycle of a plant

2513
01:34:34,158 --> 01:34:38,319
um with fermented fruit juice it's not

2514
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:41,679
like you can

2515
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:43,279
you know tell it to finish now um

2516
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:46,319
you're still gonna have that that

2517
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:48,158
genetic predisposition to

2518
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:49,359
going through its cycle in the way that

2519
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:52,238
it does

2520
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:53,279
but it can help with kind of that

2521
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:56,879
finishing off

2522
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:59,679
and give it some signal signals

2523
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:00,800
on which biochemicals to be working on

2524
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:04,399
as far as

2525
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:07,679
you know vegetative or or kind of

2526
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:10,238
photosynthesis type processes

2527
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:11,118
and structure in comparison to like

2528
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:14,399
fruit

2529
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:17,519
or flower finishing structure

2530
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:20,479
and so um yeah i think it could be

2531
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:21,280
useful in soil drench as you're

2532
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:24,319
approaching

2533
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:27,519
you know once you get within four weeks

2534
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:30,639
of harvest or three weeks of harvest

2535
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:32,239
depending on how long your cycle is

2536
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:34,079
it could be a great thing for soil

2537
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:36,919
drench definitely

2538
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:38,800
but you know since you brought up the

2539
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:42,480
seasonality of your

2540
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:45,679
area don't be tempted

2541
01:35:42,479 --> 01:35:48,879
to you know the snow's on the ground

2542
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:51,359
or you know it's cold and

2543
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:53,118
so you don't have access to fruit don't

2544
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:56,158
go down to your local supermarket

2545
01:35:53,118 --> 01:35:59,679
and buy fruit to make ffj

2546
01:35:56,158 --> 01:36:02,879
it is the wrong direction

2547
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:06,719
well you got to keep on going why yeah

2548
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:08,960
it's so um

2549
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:10,239
i get a lot of questions on the internet

2550
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:14,639
and i try and answer

2551
01:36:10,238 --> 01:36:18,238
it as much as possible sometimes when

2552
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:21,440
they're you know questions where

2553
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:23,439
people have spent zero time

2554
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:25,039
kind of learning the basics and they

2555
01:36:23,439 --> 01:36:27,118
want you know to

2556
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:29,439
understand how it all goes together i'm

2557
01:36:27,118 --> 01:36:31,198
like ah that'll be a couple pages i'm

2558
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:33,678
not going to answer that question

2559
01:36:31,198 --> 01:36:35,599
but generally i'll answer and one of the

2560
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:38,639
things i get all the time

2561
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,280
is pictures of fpj with all this weird

2562
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:42,960
green

2563
01:36:39,279 --> 01:36:46,319
mold all over it and i see that

2564
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:49,279
and i say oh you're making

2565
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:50,238
fermented fruit juice with bananas and

2566
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:53,198
you live

2567
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:54,319
in michigan and it's november where'd

2568
01:36:53,198 --> 01:36:58,799
you get your bananas

2569
01:36:54,319 --> 01:37:01,439
you know and uh you know without fail

2570
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:02,480
that's them you know going down to their

2571
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:05,519
grocery store

2572
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:09,839
and buying some bananas um from

2573
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:14,000
dole and and really there's

2574
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:18,800
what we use in making fpj or ffj

2575
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,800
um one second shingo

2576
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:26,000
what we use in making fpj or ffj

2577
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:27,520
is the natural microbes on the surface

2578
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,600
of the plant

2579
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:35,119
to ferment itself so if you look at a

2580
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:36,960
you know surface of a banana fruit under

2581
01:37:35,118 --> 01:37:39,039
a microscope growing in the wild

2582
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,639
it's covered in yeast and bacteria and

2583
01:37:39,039 --> 01:37:43,840
sometimes fungi

2584
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:45,118
and they they live on the surface of

2585
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:48,239
these leaves

2586
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:49,198
and fruit and they when you harvest it

2587
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:50,638
especially

2588
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:52,158
if you follow the natural farming

2589
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:53,118
protocol to harvest it early in the

2590
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:56,238
morning

2591
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:56,799
at the peak kind of do activity you're

2592
01:37:56,238 --> 01:37:59,198
getting

2593
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,800
all the microbes necessary to properly

2594
01:37:59,198 --> 01:38:04,079
ferment that fruit

2595
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:06,960
right there on the fruit surface whereas

2596
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:07,439
if you buy it from a store it's been

2597
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,840
bleach

2598
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:10,719
washed even organic has been bleach

2599
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,560
washed

2600
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:13,760
and the only microbes that are present

2601
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:15,679
to ferment that

2602
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,600
are what was on the hands of the grocer

2603
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:18,639
that put it on the shelf or on your

2604
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,280
hands

2605
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:23,279
when you put it on the conveyor belt or

2606
01:38:21,279 --> 01:38:26,158
picked it off the shelf

2607
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:26,719
or you know what was in the air and it's

2608
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:29,679
really

2609
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:32,079
too limited for proper fermentation and

2610
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:35,359
so you get really weird results

2611
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:38,559
i think that most of us are attracted

2612
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:38,960
by the sexy fruits the tropical ones you

2613
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,960
know

2614
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:42,480
because i mean heck how many times have

2615
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:44,158
i heard people say that they've used

2616
01:38:42,479 --> 01:38:45,519
papaya because they want their weed to

2617
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:46,960
taste like papaya which is like

2618
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,920
preposterous right that's not how it

2619
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:50,960
works

2620
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:52,960
but but here in the pacific northwest

2621
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:54,158
some of the local people they're using

2622
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:58,639
like stuff that is

2623
01:38:54,158 --> 01:39:02,319
you know not as

2624
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:04,480
popular say like rose hips right roses

2625
01:39:02,319 --> 01:39:06,158
are amazing yeah they work great but

2626
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:08,638
they're not they're not necessarily like

2627
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:11,359
sexy unless you're like cool farmer or

2628
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:12,000
herbalist people right and so so they go

2629
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:13,599
for the big

2630
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,760
bang thing and they want to go with the

2631
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,880
papaya or whatever from the store when

2632
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:20,639
actually

2633
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:21,840
that um you know the the the rose hips

2634
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:24,400
or maybe even the the

2635
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,880
crab apples on your tree that are on

2636
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:27,118
your

2637
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:28,480
tree with your microbes are going to be

2638
01:39:27,118 --> 01:39:32,960
way better for you

2639
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:35,039
than the more uh the more popular fruit

2640
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,039
heck yeah heck yeah and that's you know

2641
01:39:35,039 --> 01:39:38,319
you're you're lapping into the concepts

2642
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:42,000
of terroir

2643
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:44,960
and and the but but really it's

2644
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,520
i think in part it's a result of much of

2645
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:47,520
us

2646
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,360
being from hawaii where this landed as

2647
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:51,760
far as the english-speaking

2648
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:54,238
education of natural farming and so

2649
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:55,920
we're messing with banana i'm teaching

2650
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:59,678
it using banana flour

2651
01:39:55,920 --> 01:40:02,158
or people are talking about it using

2652
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:03,039
papaya and they do have wonderful

2653
01:40:02,158 --> 01:40:06,079
nutrients

2654
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:10,000
but it's not better than the rose hips

2655
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:13,519
or the crab apple or the

2656
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,439
apple from your neighbor's house or

2657
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:17,520
any of that it's it's not an it's not a

2658
01:40:15,439 --> 01:40:19,198
superior thing it might have a slightly

2659
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:21,040
different nutritional profile

2660
01:40:19,198 --> 01:40:23,198
but we don't necessarily chase

2661
01:40:21,039 --> 01:40:27,679
nutritional profiles when we deal with

2662
01:40:23,198 --> 01:40:30,079
fpga what we want is a thriving plant

2663
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:31,039
that isn't hit by bugs because what it's

2664
01:40:30,079 --> 01:40:35,118
doing

2665
01:40:31,039 --> 01:40:37,359
is it's expressing complete nutrition

2666
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:39,519
and therefore is packed with nutrients

2667
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:41,839
whereas if you have an anemic

2668
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:43,679
sexy plant you know like a papaya and

2669
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,719
it's totally struggling

2670
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:47,840
to make it and it's it's gonna have poor

2671
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:50,319
nutrition

2672
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:51,840
even though you're going for it for some

2673
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:55,279
specific nutrient

2674
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:57,199
compared to say ice plant or rose hips

2675
01:40:55,279 --> 01:41:00,479
or something that's just thriving

2676
01:40:57,198 --> 01:41:02,158
and you can't kill it with brick

2677
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:03,678
well well said yeah we got a lot of ice

2678
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:05,920
plant here too

2679
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:07,840
so ice plant would be amazing chango

2680
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:09,600
start making your fpj out of that

2681
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,960
oh all right cool i'm gonna go down that

2682
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:13,039
