taxonomy

40
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,320
cannabis breeding lineage and historical

41
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,000
milestones in canvas breeding

42
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,478
and then how some of the breeding

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,078
vocabulary evolved which is particularly

44
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:30,879
interesting and how we understand these

45
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:32,719
words

46
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,000

here is

99
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,519

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,120
into the cannabis industry

101
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,800
and also at what point and why did you

102
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,640
look into breeding after you got into

103
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,040
cultivation and uh

104
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:22,479
we'll start with you ryan

105
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,079
well it seems like forever ago um

106
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,000
i got into the cannabis industry quite

107
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,760
early um

108
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,360
well i guess kind of when i was you know

109
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,280
i was a consumer in high school and then

110
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
when i got into university

111
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,878
i was you know had a keen interest in

112
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,759
genetics and

113
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,120
was already making seeds and crosses and

114
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,798
so it was really kind of a way to

115
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,640
understand

116
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,360
you know i guess it put like a a

117
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,399
practical side to the the theoretical

118
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,440
stuff i was learning

119
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,959
in university um

120
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,639
so yeah it just kind of came naturally

121
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,680
after that really it was all about

122
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,158
finding new things

123
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,799
and just screening plants and learning

124
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:58,798
about the plant

125
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,039
right thank you and uh rob

126
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:15,840
rob i think you're on mute

127
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,960
give rob justice yeah we've got you now

128
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,719
thanks for joining um i guess my first

129
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:34,159
real opportunity was after going to

130
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,040
university in in indiana was to go to

131
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,040
the netherlands and work with david

132
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,759
watson and do the whole

133
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,680
hoard of farm experience and really our

134
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,479
breeding aim there was to try to develop

135
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,519
varieties for

136
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:50,159
medicinal use and went on from there

137
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,039
yeah what year was that rob oh i moved

138
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,040
there in uh

139
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,560
1987.

140
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,680
so yeah quite a while ago yeah when i

141
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,918
was three

142
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,879
um all right thank you and uh mark

143
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,599
yeah i'm uh also from i grew up in

144
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,000
indiana

145
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,080
and uh i think some of the fruits of

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,959
rob's labor trickled into our

147
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,560
our ecosystem and it was really dr dre's

148
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,399
chronic album that sent me into the

149
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,199
cannabis industry in

150
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:26,159
the the early 90s and i just happened to

151
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,639
be really good at chemistry and um went

152
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,720
to

153
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,680
uh on to get a chemical engineering

154
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,120
degree and a

155
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,000
phd in in chemistry with all just like

156
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,319
creating a really great great skill set

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,959
for

158
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,038
for this industry especially when in

159
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,560
indiana you go to 4-h

160
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,959
they teach you that seeds turn into

161
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,759
plants and the first time you buy

162
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,599
a sack of cannabis to have seeds in it

163
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,319
you naturally make the connection

164
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,919
and then if you can create seed you can

165
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,439
always have cannabis and you don't have

166
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:59,519
to depend on the

167
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:03,120
undependable so awesome that's good

168
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,799
and mojave yeah i um well i guess i was

169
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,639
kind of born into a

170
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,639
cannabis community i was born in big sur

171
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,038
california in 1969

172
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,000
and there was already a kind of a

173
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,360
thriving

174
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,680
cannabis culture there

175
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,479
and cannabis was kind of the connective

176
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,720
tissue of

177
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,318
our community so i kind of grew up in

178
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,759
the cannabis scene

179
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,120
but um it wasn't till uh 1993 when i

180
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,759
moved to the netherlands that i really

181
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,879
started to

182
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,120
get into breeding and trying to develop

183
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,319
varieties that kind of represented the

184
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,360
cannabis that i

185
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:42,800
uh remembered in my youth in california

186
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,400
wonderful all right um for some of

187
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,439
people who might not be as familiar with

188
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,519
some of the basics

189
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,759
um there seems to be a lot of confusion

190
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,439
around the terms indica and sativa

191
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,319
and rob can you kind of highlight some

192
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:57,839
of that for us here

193
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:02,720
well the words began with the uh

194
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:06,879
the taxonomists of the classical age

195
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,440
linnaeus coined the at least popularized

196
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,399
the

197
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,240
binomial cannabis sativa referring

198
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,239
really to european hemp that was what

199
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,439
was in his uh

200
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,319
purview at the time and then uh

201
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,319
later lamarck who had seen cannabis from

202
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,199
india which he named cannabis syndicates

203
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,039
so

204
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,038
that's where we got the terms to begin

205
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,800
with of course they're used completely

206
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,399
differently today

207
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,560
they've become part of branding and

208
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,679
advertising and uh

209
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,399
and uh street understanding of of the

210
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
cannabis

211
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,000
plant and the variety they're in

212
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,038
basically

213
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,918
sativa these days refers to uh

214
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,120
more narrow leaflet drug varieties maybe

215
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:48,959
their heritage would have been

216
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,759
ultimately from india

217
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,279
and uh versus some newer introduction

218
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,400
the afghan

219
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:59,679
varieties and pakistani varieties that

220
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,318
have come to be called indica

221
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,918
um in reality it's a giant taxonomic

222
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,720
snarl and we'll go there

223
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:12,000
but uh to to people today it means uh

224
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,879
a number of things it the main thing

225
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,918
is the effect it's all gone from using

226
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,479
these uh

227
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,359
names uh taxonomic names to to

228
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,560
representing

229
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,560
what the herb does and that's uh

230
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,000
yeah that's that's the way popular words

231
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,519
come

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,519
to be and be understood um

233
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:38,639
that's it's in my mind not

234
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,158
a productive way to look at things that

235
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,399
you can talk something being indica

236
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:45,278
predominant or sativa

237
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,679
predominant and that has something to do

238
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:47,519
with

239
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,359
its effect compared to the other one but

240
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,879
actually everything's a hybrid it's all

241
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,519
in between somehow

242
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,480
so it seems inadequate terminology but

243
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,278
that's what we got

244
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,639
so we'll run with it for now yeah

245
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:59,360
definitely seems like there's a lot of

246
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,480
improvement

247
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,360
for retail education and you know people

248
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,639
thinking that they need

249
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,399
something based off of this

250
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,958
classification which as you highlighted

251
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,000
is

252
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,359
a lot of you know polyhybrids um

253
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,679
rob another question for you what are

254
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,399
the botanical basics that everyone

255
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,359
should know about

256
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,360
in the cannabis plant

257
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,720
well everybody should know it's uh

258
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,200
dioecious

259
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,278
that means that there's male flowers on

260
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,320
one plant and female flowers on another

261
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,360
plant

262
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,120
at least under uh under uh normal

263
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,120
conditions

264
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,120
the conditions the way it evolved

265
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,919
monica's plants are very rare

266
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,480
um they've been used in breeding in uh

267
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,519
fiberhemp varieties now used for seed

268
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,399
production also

269
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,879
for for edible seed and but they're very

270
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,039
rare

271
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:56,639
and uh plants that change sex

272
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,159
are we talk about that you can induce

273
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,278
this and we'll talk about it shortly

274
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,958
that's another subject

275
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,320
but basically they're dioecious it takes

276
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,239
a male and a female

277
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,440
to make seeds they're not

278
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,919
self-pollinated

279
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,279
in nature so there's always that

280
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,199
variable throat in there which will

281
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,240
weigh on the next question

282
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,320
um it's an annual plant yeah

283
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,278
we've made it a perennial plant by

284
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,240
cloning

285
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,799
um but it's it's an annual normally it

286
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,839
goes through a seed cycle every year

287
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:28,240
and uh it grows as an escape

288
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,360
in places what people call wild plants

289
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,039
often

290
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,759
um and it does very well

291
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,319
on the edges of human habitation but it

292
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:42,240
doesn't really thrive in nature

293
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,440
so that's i guess it's a basic uh

294
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,799
botany of it wonderful any other

295
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,440
complimentary comments there from the

296
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,439
rest of the panel

297
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,439
okay uh ryan this one's a little bit

298
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,120
more geared for you

299
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,160
how does cannabis breeding actually work

300
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,159
can you walk us through that

301
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,640
yeah well i think again we'll come at it

302
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,240
first from

303
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,600
you know the kind of the perspective rob

304
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,879
is talking about it i think it's always

305
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
important to look at

306
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,078
what an organism does in the wild how it

307
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,800
how it

308
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,000
really naturally breeds and then you

309
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,120
know what we do to it

310
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,320
is really a different thing um

311
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,240
because there's there's important

312
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,079
consequences to learn about the the

313
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,519
species and the type of

314
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,919
genetic variation that you're going to

315
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,320
be working with from how it behaves in

316
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,360
the wild

317
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,440
this condition where

318
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,759
rob's talking about what we have diocese

319
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,600
plants males separate males and females

320
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,120
on different plants really leads to a

321
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,120
whole bunch of consequences in the

322
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,839
breeding scheme

323
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,320
one of those well the main the main

324
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,800
thing is

325
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,160
that it makes cannabis an obligate

326
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,519
crosser which means

327
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,519
you have to have two different

328
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,360
individuals um

329
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,639
that come together to breed in the wild

330
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,639
for there to be

331
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,079
made seed which will be the generation

332
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,879
for next year

333
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,319
um so really i think it's a good way to

334
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,240
think about it for people to think about

335
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,320
it as cannabis is kind of more like

336
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,919
um a human mating system than it is

337
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,040
you know like a tomato mating system

338
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:15,759
like a a different type of selfing plant

339
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,799
um and what i mean by that is the way

340
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,000
that we breed

341
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:23,199
we're never really shedding genetic

342
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
uh variation um because we're always

343
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,000
passing on

344
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,759
you know males always pass on genetics

345
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,399
to the female egg

346
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,759
um you know kind of father to mother

347
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,240
kind of thing

348
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,600
and those traits are then combined in

349
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,440
the offspring

350
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,040
in in other organisms

351
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,040
you get this thinning down of the

352
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,120
population that happens as a result of

353
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,039
the environment and the the traits in

354
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,120
the environment and that leads to

355
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,399
a narrowing of the genetic type but as

356
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,720
you can see with human

357
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,639
genetic diversity we have all these

358
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,839
different genetic forms from all over

359
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,200
the planet

360
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,519
and in the last 150 or so years we're

361
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,040
now

362
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,519
bringing all these different genetic

363
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:06,078
forms together through mating

364
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,078
and cannabis is much the same way we end

365
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,239
up with a lot of genetic variation a lot

366
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:13,039
of different possibilities

367
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,240
but inter-family breeding to make

368
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,399
something uniform is

369
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,519
it becomes quite challenging as a result

370
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,839
so it's

371
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,360
it's just important to understand that

372
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,720
when we have the males that are

373
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,519
producing pollen

374
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,040
and it lands on the female plant that's

375
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,039
really the creation of a seed

376
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,039
but what the plant does from there on

377
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,039
and how we shape it

378
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,078
is really a consequence of human

379
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,639
selection i mean

380
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,559
rob talks about this in the in cannabis

381
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,720
evolution one of his books

382
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,239
but really the plant that we found when

383
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,440
humanity started interacting with

384
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,039
cannabis

385
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,160
was a a small camp following plant

386
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,078
probably a few feet high and made a few

387
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,559
small flowers with a little bit of oil

388
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:58,879
and

389
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,559
maybe a little bit of cannabinoids and

390
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,480
all the changes that we see in modern

391
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,518
cannabis have really been

392
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,360
created or reinforced through

393
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,720
the eyes of man working with the genetic

394
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,720
possibilities within the plant

395
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,719
so maybe that was a bit of a rambling

396
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,240
explanation

397
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,560
it's very similar to corn right ryan i

398
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,639
mean corn when they first found it as

399
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,359
maize it didn't produce a whole lot of

400
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,839
the kernel

401
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,120
but then after 150 years of focusing on

402
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,560
that kernel

403
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,039
now it produces biomass of

404
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,838
corn star or corn syrup you know the the

405
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,120
sugar form

406
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,160
and and other less thans that is mind

407
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,560
boggling because it's you know

408
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,439
30 percent of the biomass which is very

409
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,599
similar to

410
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,720
to to cannabinoids in the way that

411
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,800
humans have

412
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,720
you know stuck their hands into that

413
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,838
machinery somehow just by selective

414
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,079
breeding

415
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,199
and created a plant that produces 30 of

416
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,479
a medical analyte

417
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,359
it's incredible yeah it really is and i

418
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,720
think people

419
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,199
don't really maybe don't really

420
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,720
understand the wild relative of corn was

421
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,319
about the size you know the cobs were

422
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,600
about the size of your baby finger or

423
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,839
smaller maybe

424
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,278
you know they had a few kernels per cob

425
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,839
and now we have these

426
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,600
massive cobs that produce you know

427
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,040
hundreds or even a thousand kernels per

428
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,720
month maybe a thousand to successive but

429
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,000
we have many many kernels much bigger

430
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,320
cobs

431
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,078
um and that was really done through

432
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,399
rudimentary breeding

433
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,078
um you know not using science i mean

434
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,159
even the

435
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,359
the the indigenous mexican human

436
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,240
population they

437
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,680
they created you know what we call maize

438
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,519
which is kind of protocol

439
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,319
kind of what we call protocorn right

440
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,278
it's it's a step before that's not quite

441
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,399
as

442
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,159
big and and indestructible as the corn

443
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,958
that we have now

444
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,480
but um it shows that even with simple

445
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,359
breeding systems what

446
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,759
humans can do just by looking at a plant

447
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,519
and saving the seeds from

448
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,039
the plants that are naturally breeding

449
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,278
in the environment

450
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,319
right and and i think a good way to look

451
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:02,720
at this talk is

452
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,000
is kind of to consider what the

453
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,959
technologies that we're going to be

454
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,480
using

455
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:10,559
or we have used in the past and

456
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,000
um the technologies that we'll be using

457
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,000
in the future and how we can use those

458
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,559
to shape and refine cannabis

459
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,039
and you know the 30 percent thca plant i

460
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,638
mean

461
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,719
that was bred by breeders

462
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,039
in in their bedrooms or their closets or

463
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,680
their backyards not really using science

464
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,838
i mean they're

465
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,799
they're just using their their head

466
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,079
state right

467
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:34,078
and and pretty much selectively bred

468
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,799
other cannabinoids out of that the the

469
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,000
plants biosynthetic pathways

470
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,399
yeah let's talk about some of those

471
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,240
early breeders um rob can you highlight

472
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,078
kind of what the early years look like

473
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:51,120
um for plant breeding

474
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:53,278
yeah for sure that the early years were

475
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,799
were basically people just crossing land

476
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,078
races which means

477
00:16:54,799 --> 00:17:00,559
they bought a lid and it had seeds

478
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,198
because almost all weed had seeds back

479
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,480
in the day

480
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,240
yeah they were seen samia

481
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,880
shipments that led to people

482
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,959
understanding the meaning of the word is

483
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:16,559
seedless but weed had seeds

484
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,439
and people were curious and as

485
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,558
as primates that we are and we stuck

486
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,038
them in the ground

487
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,558
in gardens and a lot of the early uh

488
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:25,119
growers or people who already had

489
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,759
gardens

490
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,558
vegetable gardens you know places where

491
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,480
it was natural for them to go

492
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,480
stick them in the ground and farmers as

493
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,120
well but it's really started as a garden

494
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,960
crop

495
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:41,519
and uh it's spread from there

496
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,960
but the early days where you got a bag

497
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,400
of mexican and you grew that

498
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,319
first year and then you got a bag of

499
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,840
colombians sometime in the interim

500
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,079
before the next spring

501
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,359
and then he planted some of those and

502
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,439
huh

503
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,279
lo and behold that sex thing came in

504
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,798
again and seeds were there and

505
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,798
he planted those and he had the first

506
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,720
hybrid and then

507
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,000
the next year somebody got some thai

508
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,079
stick

509
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,079
and then you throw that in there you

510
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,319
know and that became the mail because

511
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,399
you already had your stuff you knew

512
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,599
so then the next thing you have is half

513
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,919
thai

514
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,918
and and a quarter colombian and a

515
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,480
quarter mexican and hope that it goes on

516
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,038
and on

517
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,519
so he began with poly hybrids this is it

518
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,480
went from land races to

519
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:24,879
um human curiosity and basic breeding

520
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,679
like

521
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,880
like we've been talking about take over

522
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,240
and

523
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,400
that's what happened those are the

524
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,319
really the early days what happened

525
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,519
a bit later and it goes back to what

526
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,519
mark was just saying it's

527
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,480
what went on when when prohibition

528
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,880
suppressed cannabis so much

529
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,640
was that everybody hid out then the

530
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,280
internet came along and

531
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,000
i think cannabis breeding is one of the

532
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,839
earliest

533
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,960
and most poignant examples of

534
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:00,399
crowdsourcing

535
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,919
and this is uh this is the other end not

536
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,880
really early breeding sorry i kind of

537
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,640
jumped but

538
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,520
that they're tied together there and

539
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,520
yeah it's uh

540
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,399
the future we'll see what holds but so

541
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,640
far it's been a fantastic ride

542
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,679
that's for sure yeah mojave i'm

543
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,240
interested in

544
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,320
some of the um kind of input you have

545
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,960
you know being pretty much born into

546
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,000
you know a mecca for cannabis but what

547
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,919
were some of the early

548
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
pioneer breeders working with and how do

549
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,919
their breeding objectives also evolve

550
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,200
over time well um as rob mentioned the

551
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,759
early breeders

552
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,160
in my experience were all growing with

553
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:41,519
land raised varieties

554
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,440
and their objective was um

555
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,440
more to be to perpetuate what they had

556
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,558
already found you know i think it's

557
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,960
it's um i think most of the work was

558
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,839
done

559
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,519
before the imported cannabis reached

560
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:54,959
these modern breeders

561
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,440
that they they developed and they

562
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,400
crossed but most of the work was done if

563
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,840
you you know

564
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,640
i think um the some of the early import

565
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,359
cannabis was phenomenal and it was

566
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,200
already

567
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,439
kind of developed and it was more about

568
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,038
acclimating it to the region

569
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,840
and um growing it you know producing a

570
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,119
fresher

571
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:19,439
and more um you know healthier version

572
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,199
of these plants and i think it's

573
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,400
something to you know to

574
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,798
to recognize is that out of these early

575
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,840
land race hybrids land race-based

576
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:29,440
hybrids because once

577
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,279
everything once it leaves the land it's

578
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,159
no longer a land race

579
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,960
um that there was a little development

580
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,120
done

581
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,360
and then those the the product of that

582
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,639
those um of that breeding was then

583
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,639
passed on

584
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,159
to the netherlands for instance and then

585
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,200
they were utilized

586
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,919
for stock material to make seats but

587
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,558
the the bulk of the work was done you

588
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,440
know

589
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,399
before they made it to the netherlands

590
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,440
and they were

591
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,240
some some breeders um definitely did a

592
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,120
lot of work

593
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,679
and increased the potency and increased

594
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,399
the

595
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,880
various agronomic traits but if you

596
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,919
think of afghan one and hindu kush

597
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,600
and durbin these are

598
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,360
bag seed that came from imported

599
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,158
cannabis and then

600
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,359
was worked on a little bit and then was

601
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,720
used to make

602
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,199
um seeds for decades so there wasn't a

603
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,360
lot of

604
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,558
improvement on those original land race

605
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:29,359
varieties

606
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,319
um for for quite some time and some of

607
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,959
them are still

608
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,678
just a few generations away from their

609
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,798
original

610
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,679
um source material

611
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,480
okay we can't leave out the importance

612
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,720
of the hunt

613
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,240
that you know the the importance of that

614
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,200
the role of the hunt

615
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,279
played in this whole thing i mean we we

616
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,919
we tend to focus as cannabis consumers

617
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,960
or even

618
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,038
even breeders as on the the winds but

619
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,558
i mean there was thousands of people

620
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,400
trying to grow weed

621
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,879
from the seeds that were in their you

622
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,200
know in their stash like rob was saying

623
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,039
and they were a lot of that were

624
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,640
failures right i mean there's a lot of

625
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:09,359
plants especially that come out of these

626
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,200
land race populations that really aren't

627
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,719
they aren't very good we call them dogs

628
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,279
you know they're just plants that are

629
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,759
way way

630
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,558
sub-par and so you have to grow through

631
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,640
a lot of those

632
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,000
terrible plants to really find the ones

633
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,200
that are

634
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,960
exceeding for for drug content and often

635
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,558
what that was what we were doing like

636
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,840
mark said was

637
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:33,038
we were using our brains kind of like a

638
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,240
a little bit like a gc and selecting for

639
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,879
the compounds

640
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,440
of the plants that had the highest thc

641
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,440
content

642
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,000
and that was really based on how it made

643
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:47,199
us feel this kind of idea of a bio assay

644
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,720
right um it's the the the experience

645
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,080
that we get from consuming the plant

646
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,720
really dictates our choices in in

647
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,918
in selecting the plants right and of

648
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,360
course how it smells

649
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,000
and and tastes and it's like you cannot

650
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,879
you cannot talk about how important

651
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,640
bagsy

652
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,400
was and has been since day one i mean

653
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,400
that's that was like the treasure trove

654
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,880
and when we used to find seeds it was

655
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,440
like

656
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,880
you know finding that you know toy at

657
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,798
the bottom of the crackerjack box was

658
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,880
like awesome we get to grow one like you

659
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,558
know what i mean it's like awesome

660
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,080
yeah and also just to think that the

661
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:26,158
difference between bag seed

662
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:28,480
from a clone versus bag seed from

663
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,919
a pound of weed that was homogenized

664
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,038
from a big batch

665
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,159
of seeds you know most of the the

666
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,400
cannabis grown in the u.s was from seed

667
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,720
and

668
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,919
and when it would be distributed there

669
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,200
was not

670
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,799
you every single flower was different

671
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,880
from the next so you couldn't just

672
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,319
dip into the bag and pull out seed you

673
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,000
had to go and sort through

674
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,079
all the different flowers and then make

675
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,480
your selection which was really hard and

676
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,278
as

677
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,240
as you know time went on over the into

678
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:57,759
the late 80s

679
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,599
i started to notice that there was

680
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,079
definitely more consistency

681
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,639
among the batches but in the beginning

682
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:04,480
it was

683
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,759
you know sometimes it was a dog's

684
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,640
breakfast of

685
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,240
of you know different phenotypes all

686
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,278
sold as one variety

687
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,200
so it was you know it was a challenge

688
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:16,319
and that was a blessing growing up in

689
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,600
indiana was that

690
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:21,278
iu university had one of the two dea

691
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,240
permits and i'm sure rob can speak to

692
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,000
this but

693
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,759
david watson had sent over i think it

694
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,919
was 157

695
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,359
seed accessions for them to grow out at

696
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,480
the greenhouse there and

697
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,319
do chemotaxonomic analysis on it and as

698
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,360
you know i mean college kids growing

699
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,319
weed

700
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:40,000
those clones and seeds got out and like

701
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,319
indiana just happened to be one of these

702
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,519
little tiny epicenters that had kind bud

703
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:49,200
you know it was like very serendipitous

704
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,200
on that note too speaking of the 80s and

705
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,120
90s mojave how did

706
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,278
the isolated and clandestine nature of

707
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:59,199
modern cannabis breeders both hinder and

708
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:02,480
help the development of modern cultivars

709
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,038
that's a that's a big one um well for

710
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,839
one

711
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,960
what you started to see is the impact of

712
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:11,199
law enforcement

713
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,519
on cannabis in the late 70s into the 80s

714
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,558
and that became the biggest selective

715
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,798
pressure

716
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,720
for breeders was developing varieties

717
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,679
that could evade law enforcement

718
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,919
whether it was a lower stature plant

719
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:27,600
grown outdoors that could be hid under

720
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,000
under canopy of other plants or whether

721
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,719
or

722
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
just harvested early enough that law

723
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,440
enforcement you know

724
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
well you know camp california of either

725
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,278
marijuana eradication program they they

726
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,798
had a timing

727
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,880
when they would release the helic

728
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,558
release the hounds so to speak

729
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,120
and it was all based off of late

730
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,240
flowering narrow leaf semi-equatorial

731
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,399
varieties

732
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,759
and when we started introducing afghani

733
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,000
and making these earlier

734
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,079
crosses you could get things in before

735
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,119
the helicopter started descending on

736
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:02,399
your your crop and

737
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,759
in also you know the the hybridization

738
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,600
between these afghani

739
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,679
and narrowly varieties allowed for

740
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,798
plants to be grown indoors

741
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,559
because they weren't 15 foot tall

742
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,519
trees they were these squat little

743
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:18,319
bushes that you could grow under

744
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,839
under lights and you then at that point

745
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,200
you saw people growing cannabis

746
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,038
virtually everywhere

747
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,480
as opposed to just the most optimal

748
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,119
climates you could grow

749
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,519
cannabis on the moon at that point so

750
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:32,558
that inspired a lot of people to get

751
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:34,558
involved and have a hand in developing

752
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,759
their own varieties where they normally

753
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:37,759
wouldn't have

754
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,359
that opportunity and i think that did a

755
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,000
lot for preservation

756
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:44,000
of of cannabis that we now have these

757
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,960
little incubators going on all over the

758
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,079
world

759
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,519
but it also meant that the agronomic

760
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:53,359
traits became

761
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:56,639
maybe more important than the um

762
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:59,918
than the the chemo bar so it was

763
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,840
now the primary selection was for for

764
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,559
yield for size and for flowering period

765
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,000
where earlier cannabis was more all

766
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,839
about the effect

767
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,038
and certain varieties that had amazing

768
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,278
effects and and

769
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,798
you know positive attributes were no

770
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,880
longer you know

771
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,240
available because they just didn't make

772
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,679
it indoors or they just

773
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,359
took too long to grow

774
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,679
yeah we really can't understate the

775
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,759
influence of afghanica

776
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,960
being introduced in the into the drug

777
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,839
pool in like the what

778
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,720
rob mid to late 70s mid to late 80s or

779
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:36,639
sorry yeah

780
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,480
um because they they brought not only

781
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,520
the genes that you're talking about

782
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,440
um for small stature plants and

783
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,679
higher yield and higher resin content

784
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,880
but also some of the genes for

785
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,798
you know like the the source of the

786
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,559
hydroxylated terpenes comes from that

787
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,240
afghanistan too

788
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,158
right so we wouldn't have had those

789
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,319
things occurring in the

790
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,080
in in some of the more equatorial

791
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:01,359
populations so

792
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:03,359
um i mean we could talk about some of

793
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,639
the bad traits that came into right the

794
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:09,199
the lack of mold resistance um that came

795
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:14,240
along with that compact form

796
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:16,720
um yeah so it's really interesting how

797
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,919
the the plants that came into the pot

798
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,980
into the united states

799
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,038
predominantly um

800
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,240
[Music]

801
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,079
you know where where they were being

802
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,000
shipped from from when it was mexico or

803
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,119
thailand or colombia

804
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,599
in probably the late 60s and early 70s

805
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,398
and as these these more diverse sources

806
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,678
you know people

807
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,239
around the world looking for different

808
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,120
sources of cannabis to import

809
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,519
that's when really when the afghanica

810
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,678
plants kind of started flooding in

811
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,278
right and that's had a major impact on

812
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,798
the way that the

813
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,558
not only the cannabis community is

814
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:49,200
developed but also like how the plant

815
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:50,960
was grown

816
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,240
but you know the types of user

817
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,240
experiences that were available

818
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,000
hey mark this quick this next question

819
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,519
is for you and i don't know if you want

820
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,960
to comment on this picture on the right

821
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,839
that you've provided for us here on the

822
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,079
screen as well

823
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,519
um but what have been some of the major

824
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,398
milestones in the history of cannabis

825
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,519
breeding

826
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:12,558
in your opinion i mean

827
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:15,759
obviously david

828
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:19,119
watson's curation of land races and

829
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:22,319
um he and de meyers working to create

830
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,759
single cannabinoid plants that were then

831
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,599
you know ryan knows more about this than

832
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:27,440
i do but that was that was huge to learn

833
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:29,519
the plasticity of the plants through

834
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,798
demire's papers and

835
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:35,839
dave's work but then obviously

836
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:37,918
the removal of prohibition in certain

837
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:41,119
states

838
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,399
for medical uses open the door for

839
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,439
um you know for like napro research for

840
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,439
example to

841
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,440
set up a laboratory and start using

842
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,360
chemical markers to drive breeding

843
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,679
and then be able to tease apart the

844
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,079
different traits and then obviously now

845
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,720
with

846
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,158
the the the snip chips coming out from

847
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,360
eurofins and

848
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,200
you know groups like oregon cbd using

849
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,038
that technology to really drive that

850
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,319
single cannabinoid model

851
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,440
um the timelines you know it's pretty

852
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:12,639
there it's there

853
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,519
um but i think the true

854
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,038
innovative work was when you know we

855
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,278
started trying to create

856
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:22,798
you know some people get adverse effects

857
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:25,119
from from cannabis products and

858
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,158
and you know to remove adverse effects

859
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,239
from a product

860
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,559
is always a good thing to make a product

861
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,599
safer and still provide you with

862
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,678
the ability to get high or find pain

863
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:39,519
relief or whatever it may be

864
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,360
without paranoia anxiety or you know

865
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,519
different types of evers effects i mean

866
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,719
that's a true milestone

867
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,440
in in breeding similarly to you know

868
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,319
creating a plant that produces all cbga

869
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,320
in a

870
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,759
bud format but ryan probably has a great

871
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,439
perspective on this because he kind of

872
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,960
sits in the captain's chair

873
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,759
of the whole canvas breeding thing even

874
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,640
you know back into the into the 90s um

875
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:06,079
and i think that

876
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,799
picture at the bottom right there was

877
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:11,839
ryan's uh that's his grow right now in

878
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:11,839
british columbia i believe

879
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,240
you're on mute ryan

880
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,558
it's actually a picture of mark's

881
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:27,599
college uh college

882
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,639
closet but you know you know we're

883
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,639
talking about dave

884
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,759
dave watson's work david watson's work

885
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,200
in the creation of the single

886
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,679
cannabinoid varieties that ended up

887
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,919
being licensed by gw pharmaceuticals

888
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,880
i mean there's no better person to talk

889
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,200
about it than rob

890
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,360
i mean he was there and right in the in

891
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,319
the in the middle of the whole thing

892
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,918
um can you tell us rob about how that

893
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:49,678
came about in the pursuit of the single

894
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,038
cannabinoid varieties

895
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,120
and and the idea that you could explore

896
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,160
you know david's wild collection for the

897
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,439
plants that would become

898
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,278
[Music]

899
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,960
you know the the progenitors of what led

900
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,000
to all the different cannabinoid

901
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,000
chemistry on the market

902
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,720
well that got to be a big question um

903
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:13,678
back to the

904
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:16,720
gw um beginning of the question

905
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,919
um one thing led to another that was not

906
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,519
the first intent

907
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:24,559
the first intent was to produce thc

908
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:28,240
natural version of drennabinol

909
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:31,119
the registered name for delta 9 thc

910
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,079
and the pharmaceutical name and produce

911
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,119
it naturally

912
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:37,119
because marinol was based on synthetic

913
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:41,278
dernavanil

914
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:42,719
hence their easy approval as the pot

915
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:46,480
pill

916
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,558
um it was the answer to

917
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,759
people who smoked cannabis saying that

918
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,519
it was medicine

919
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,359
the government could say okay we have

920
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,880
medicine it's called marinol see

921
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,038
this little pill it's got the active

922
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,600
ingredient same thing you guys like

923
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,200
here it is that was that's why it got

924
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:02,158
fast tracked and that's why it ended up

925
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,880
where it was

926
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,880
but it was an easy uh target for a

927
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,840
generic equivalent

928
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,480
and that was originally what we were

929
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:16,079
doing um the gw thing came along later

930
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,599
and uh yeah that's where it all started

931
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,879
for a little history

932
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,398
um but gw came along because you guys

933
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,159
found all these different plants that

934
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:24,798
had different chemistries right i mean

935
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,760
they were

936
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,158
they were looking to set up a

937
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,839
pharmaceutical company and you guys were

938
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,200
the place that had the supply

939
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:32,798
right one of the only places in the

940
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,319
world that had this diverse chemical

941
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:39,839
supply

942
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,839
we did and they uh

943
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,720
they basically were focused on one

944
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,839
compound and that was thc

945
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,600
okay cbd was um

946
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:52,398
included in the program basically

947
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:56,398
because they wanted to um

948
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:58,319
ameliorate the naive user effect

949
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,918
that's when an old fart like me does it

950
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,119
for the first time and their heart beats

951
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,360
really fast and they go

952
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,319
you know i don't feel so good and and

953
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,038
that happens

954
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:07,519
in all their trials even the ones that

955
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:09,759
pass

956
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,599
at about around ten percent i mean

957
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,919
probably can give anybody a sugar pill

958
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,159
into is in the hospital and ten percent

959
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,759
don't feel good you know but that's they

960
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,039
were trying to ameliorate

961
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:24,240
um the effects and

962
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:27,838
through anecdotal evidence provided by

963
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:31,678
david basically um

964
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:34,000
cbd was not it kills your buzz

965
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,440
you know and and that's where it came

966
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,039
from and just that

967
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,918
simple user knowledge led to them

968
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,398
using it to ameliorate those effects and

969
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,199
uh

970
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,078
that's where we ended up and and on from

971
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,118
that then

972
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:52,320
cbd became a first-line um

973
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,280
pharmaceutical hence epidiolex all this

974
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,800
is a good thing

975
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,400
but that's the history of how cbd ended

976
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,960
up in the program

977
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,280
well and and to address your cbd kills

978
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,559
your buzz i would say that it attenuates

979
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,280
your buzz because if you have something

980
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:10,159
that's four to one thc to cbd

981
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,440
or 10 to one thc cbd it tends to have a

982
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:15,039
much more

983
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:18,320
indica effect like knocking you like

984
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:20,559
onto the couch hardcore whereas thc

985
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,599
alone has that more like you said heart

986
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,880
pounding effect

987
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,680
depending so it's it's i'd say when you

988
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,720
get one to one

989
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,000
and less it definitely kills your bus

990
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,519
yeah and that's something that we

991
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,039
learned through the napro breeding

992
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,280
programs was that

993
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,279
we could achieve cannabinoid ratios that

994
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,720
we we didn't find in the natural

995
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,160
population

996
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,879
right and those and some of those

997
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:45,118
stranger altered cannabinoid ratios

998
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,160
when you put them in a flavor profile

999
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,119
that's

1000
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,838
pleasing that the market is used to you

1001
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,680
know then you

1002
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:53,358
then you really have this new types of

1003
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,759
connect this new type of cannabinoid

1004
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:58,719
experience that just doesn't exist

1005
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,800
or hadn't existed i should say but you

1006
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,879
know up until that point in time

1007
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,960
and think about how one-dimensional

1008
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,838
today's marketplace is with just

1009
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,800
it's just thc but the vast majority of

1010
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,920
users

1011
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,640
of cannabis or hemp products are really

1012
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,800
using an

1013
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,400
enhanced or type 2 product because all

1014
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,200
of the hemp is getting sprayed with

1015
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,880
something

1016
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,319
and then getting bought and sold on the

1017
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,240
black market going

1018
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,000
you know the other towards the east or

1019
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,838
whatever it's really interesting to

1020
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,880
think that these people going to

1021
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:31,199
tobacco shops are essentially smoking

1022
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,480
an enhanced product and they're one of

1023
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:34,399
the biggest growth

1024
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,559
user groups in the united states right

1025
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,599
now just

1026
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:42,400
and then when you mix in th cv or

1027
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,960
for instance there's um cultivars that

1028
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,000
are

1029
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,720
out here that you know um that have that

1030
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,199
are a type

1031
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,559
2 which means they have thc and cbd but

1032
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,358
they also have

1033
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:55,199
a propyl so now you're talking about

1034
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:55,920
four cannabinoids in the mix and if

1035
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,399
there's a

1036
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,480
you know one plus percent cbg that you

1037
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,119
got five cannabinoids in the mix

1038
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,760
those cocktails really begin to create

1039
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,680
what is

1040
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,960
what was truly meant by the original

1041
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,919
entourage uh

1042
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,760
dubbed by shulam right like the

1043
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,559
cannabinoid entourage

1044
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,839
let alone layering on top of that like

1045
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,679
ryan said the

1046
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:22,320
og nose or the jack nose which

1047
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:24,399
also layers on another pharmacological

1048
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,519
piece

1049
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,760
yeah it's it's funny that we you know

1050
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:32,480
these things exist and i think that the

1051
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,760
market is

1052
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,760
you know they understand that these

1053
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,000
things can exist that these you know

1054
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,160
these

1055
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,519
types of cultivars could potentially

1056
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,440
exist on the market but they're real

1057
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,079
market penetrances like you said they're

1058
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,838
not

1059
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,160
really accepted the people that go to

1060
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:47,920
the the dispensaries looking for their

1061
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:52,879
cannabinoids i mean they're usually

1062
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,880
looking for thc right um

1063
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,320
but you know with the right consumer

1064
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:59,519
education again

1065
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,960
you have specific um you know as you

1066
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,639
know certain combinations of

1067
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,358
cannabinoids work great on

1068
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,039
you know skin irritation or you know i

1069
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,279
mean sativex

1070
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:10,559
you know is is a as a medicine for a

1071
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,079
reason and it's not

1072
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,279
thc and when you get into a recreational

1073
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,320
market that's looking for

1074
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,440
functional um products i mean

1075
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,000
consumers love holy crunch because they

1076
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,920
can

1077
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,320
use it in the morning get high drink

1078
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,000
some coffee and it lasts for three hours

1079
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,079
and then when they smoke their type one

1080
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,960
later in the day they actually get high

1081
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,720
again whereas

1082
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,519
you know you smoke type 1 all day all

1083
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:37,679
thc you have a tendency to kind of

1084
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,960
taper on that getting high a little bit

1085
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,358
it's like a refresher for your

1086
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,559
endocannabinoid system or something

1087
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:46,799
yeah that's what's it dr 80 ray

1088
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,239
you can accomplish some dr addy ray is

1089
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,320
about to publish some

1090
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:53,199
interesting data on that that they've

1091
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,079
collected at the uh

1092
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:58,000
one of the oregon festivals cannabis

1093
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,920
consumption events

1094
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,440
on the different preferences chemistries

1095
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,639
because again people are buying

1096
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,320
you know when they go into the store

1097
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:05,679
they don't really you're overwhelmed

1098
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,760
when you go into a dispensary

1099
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,960
of choice and and you don't really know

1100
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,240
how to differentiate between the

1101
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,079
different products

1102
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:13,519
right and so the natural thing that

1103
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,720
everybody goes to is what's the highest

1104
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:16,480
thc

1105
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,039
um and i think it's i've said it before

1106
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,320
but i think it's important to say again

1107
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:24,000
you know up until even the early 2000s

1108
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,000
that's not the way that cannabis was

1109
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,358
purchased nobody knew about

1110
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,519
you know everybody assumed that higher

1111
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:32,159
thc was better but nobody really knew

1112
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,079
i mean thc wasn't on the bottle right it

1113
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:35,598
wasn't on the label back then

1114
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,200
um so the way that you would select the

1115
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,960
cannabis that you'd want to buy is you'd

1116
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:40,719
put your nose into the bag and see what

1117
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,240
smelled and looked good

1118
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,879
right and it didn't really have anything

1119
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:47,759
to do with the number per se

1120
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,480
um it was more judged based on the user

1121
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,160
experience

1122
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,880
and we've kind of moved into this market

1123
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,358
where people are now buying based on a

1124
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,800
number

1125
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,719
on a metric because that's kind of

1126
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,720
something that they have to grab onto

1127
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,000
anyway i don't mean to divert our our

1128
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,959
talk here but

1129
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,960
no it's it's it's just great that you

1130
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,800
mentioned some of those things and

1131
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,679
the future is definitely a more

1132
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,960
robust cannabinoid offering and chemical

1133
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:14,719
offering right

1134
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,559
yeah let's see let's let's shift from

1135
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:17,838
the past to the present for the sake you

1136
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:19,679
guys are like most

1137
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,039
growers and breeders very ambitious with

1138
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:22,318
all the information that you are trying

1139
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:25,119
to accomplish today

1140
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:26,318
um but yeah if we can if we can shift a

1141
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,920
little bit this one's going to be for

1142
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:30,480
ryan and for mojave

1143
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,318
um present day what objectives drive the

1144
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,719
thinking of today's cannabis breeders

1145
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,318
you know what type of desired traits are

1146
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,358
they looking to enhance or

1147
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:41,920
to alter

1148
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:43,358
um well i'd say that just to follow up

1149
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,039
on what we were just talking about i

1150
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:48,400
mean it's all about predicting

1151
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:51,199
what the consumer's needs are you know

1152
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,720
we're in kind of this era where cannabis

1153
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,519
is now being marketed like other

1154
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:56,559
products

1155
00:40:53,519 --> 00:41:01,119
with packaging and media

1156
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:03,759
and um we're it's about connecting

1157
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,240
the cultivar or a variety with the end

1158
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,520
user

1159
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,118
right just like what mark was saying i

1160
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,400
think there's a cannabis variety for

1161
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,160
everybody

1162
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,440
but predicting what that variety is

1163
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,799
going to be

1164
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,760
is is the challenge and and and finding

1165
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,400
the user that's seeking that particular

1166
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,960
effect

1167
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,680
is extreme extremely challenging but

1168
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,519
cannabis does so much for so many people

1169
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,039
that we all know that that there is a

1170
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:30,000
variety for everybody

1171
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,519
um but as a you know in terms of

1172
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,159
selecting cultivars

1173
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,199
and selecting in and working developing

1174
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,440
new varieties

1175
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,960
you have to have foresight 12 months

1176
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,079
ahead of the market and you have to be

1177
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,318
able to predict

1178
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,640
where the market is moving so it always

1179
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,559
comes back to education you know we have

1180
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:49,358
the consumer needs to be educated so

1181
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,480
the supply chain can meet their needs

1182
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,719
right now

1183
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,079
you know people love purple weed for

1184
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,879
whatever reason i think purple's a

1185
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,519
pretty color

1186
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,160
and it sells well you know and people

1187
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:01,920
are driven

1188
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:03,039
by these uh you know associations with

1189
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,838
other

1190
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,800
um products you know we've got all these

1191
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:09,199
sweet

1192
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,240
cakes and and cookies and stuff like

1193
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,439
that which

1194
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,879
tap into our primal love of of uh

1195
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,639
carbohydrates

1196
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,440
so we got two competing fronts one is

1197
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:22,159
the marketability of the product and how

1198
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,559
you reach

1199
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:25,279
your consumer and the other is actually

1200
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:27,519
producing

1201
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,440
and developing varieties that address

1202
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:31,280
the needs of the consumer

1203
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,480
and i think that those are are

1204
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,640
challenging for

1205
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,719
breeders and challenging for cultivation

1206
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,799
groups in order to align those

1207
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,879
and be able to predict what the future

1208
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,640
cannabis varieties are going to be

1209
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,880
um so yeah it's it's um i i talk with

1210
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:48,000
with um cultivation groups all the time

1211
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,480
who you know

1212
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,960
stock their build up their mother blocks

1213
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,800
based off of the trends of today

1214
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,159
and by the time those blocks are all

1215
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,200
established and they're making clones

1216
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,719
and putting them into production

1217
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,598
everything's changed

1218
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,399
so it's it's a guessing game you know

1219
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,640
but

1220
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,599
yeah changeover at commercial scale a

1221
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:06,879
lot of people don't realize they're

1222
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,359
trying to stay with these trends by the

1223
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,760
time they

1224
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,799
identify a trend they're already midway

1225
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,319
in the trend and by

1226
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,560
time you get everything in a population

1227
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,239
it's a year later and it's and it's over

1228
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,719
um so i i can relate to that one

1229
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:21,279
personally um if you had to identify

1230
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:23,358
like a top three desired traits on a

1231
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,040
breeding project uh maybe a recent one

1232
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:27,838
is there something that rings out to you

1233
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:27,838
there

1234
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:35,680
um for me well it's it's um it's

1235
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:38,480
pest and pest in um pathogen resistance

1236
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,000
and the effect i mean that's i've effect

1237
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,358
has always been primary for me

1238
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,760
you know i i kind of feel like if uh

1239
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,759
if i had to chew a bitter pill to get

1240
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,280
the effect that i was the desired effect

1241
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,720
i would do that way over

1242
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,000
you know a strawberry flavored vicodin

1243
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:56,399
or something like that you know

1244
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,679
and i think that that's really hard to

1245
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,079
um

1246
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,039
to relay to a consumer when cannabis now

1247
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,760
is so dynamic

1248
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:04,880
and has such an amazing um aromatic

1249
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,880
profile

1250
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,039
but to me it's all about effects you

1251
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,440
know and that's that's why i was drawn

1252
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:13,759
to cannabis i think that's why people

1253
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,480
you know that that's our primary concern

1254
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,520
but

1255
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,639
now color and and flavor seem to

1256
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,440
predominate and

1257
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,159
and as mentioned for thc content you

1258
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,639
know

1259
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,598
so yeah i i've i've always felt that

1260
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:28,559
pest and

1261
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,760
you know resistance and um effect are

1262
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,960
the two primary

1263
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,319
you know concerns and ryan you want to

1264
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,639
piggyback on some of that

1265
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,838
yeah i think i think again to look at

1266
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,400
what we've been doing

1267
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,838
is really you know mohave calls it

1268
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,480
effect but truly that is

1269
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:46,078
smelling and cannabinoid content really

1270
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,358
our scent and cannabinoid scent flavor

1271
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,560
and cannabinoid content

1272
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:50,400
and that's kind of what we've been

1273
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:53,199
focusing on i don't mean we but i

1274
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,838
mean we personally but we as a as the

1275
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:57,759
cannabis community has been focusing on

1276
00:44:55,838 --> 00:45:00,000
we haven't had the ability to run proper

1277
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,319
breeding programs to be able to

1278
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,838
to lock down things like resistance

1279
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:05,838
right um

1280
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:09,358
those things take time and they take

1281
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,880
time to learn how to learn how to do and

1282
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,358
that was really some of the

1283
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,960
early work we were doing in april was

1284
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:16,838
trying to understand the inheritance of

1285
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,119
these flavor molecules or the scent

1286
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:20,239
compounds so that we could learn how to

1287
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,240
shuffle the deck

1288
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:23,279
to to get the desired outcome that we

1289
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:25,118
wanted

1290
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,119
and you know that was not that was

1291
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,599
really within the last 10 years you

1292
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,599
could say

1293
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:33,440
so the way i look at the industry is

1294
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,639
we've got this incredible genetic

1295
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,920
resource but

1296
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,639
you know with corn and a lot of these

1297
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,639
other species that all those crops were

1298
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:42,400
handed over to the plant nerds

1299
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:43,679
right way at the beginning of the crop

1300
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,119
right i mean

1301
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:47,039
that was those the people that naturally

1302
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,358
gravitated to it and cannabis really

1303
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:52,400
wasn't that way cannabis got harvested

1304
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:54,480
and sequestered in these these disparate

1305
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,318
and remote gardens like all

1306
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,000
over the world and so different people

1307
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:00,400
were starting with different populations

1308
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and they were kind of all cobbling

1309
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,960
together their own car that they could

1310
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,960
just make it run

1311
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,440
and now we're lucky to be you know 20

1312
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:11,199
years into that cycle where we can start

1313
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,880
dipping into these different populations

1314
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:16,000
that people have been

1315
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,599
developing on their own and we're able

1316
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,920
to bring these things back together in a

1317
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,200
more

1318
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,039
organized and structured way um

1319
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:25,118
and i think that when you're doing that

1320
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,800
the only real way to do that is to start

1321
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,880
piece by piece

1322
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,318
right and so so like i said when we were

1323
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,079
doing that at napo

1324
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:34,159
we started figuring out how to shuffle

1325
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,880
the the

1326
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:38,639
the cannabinoid and the terpene synthase

1327
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,039
genes in such a way

1328
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,400
that we could stabilize and lock those

1329
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:44,318
traits down

1330
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,599
and then the next step is going in and

1331
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:48,639
increasing

1332
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,760
uh you know fixing frog pro properties

1333
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,799
like you're talking about like

1334
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,359
resistances to mold or pester pathogens

1335
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,960
um and improving yield and stature and

1336
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,358
even a lot of these like basic

1337
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,000
plant architecture traits to do with

1338
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,279
mars

1339
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,199
morphology and structure for for making

1340
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,359
a plant that's ideal to grow i mean

1341
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:09,598
those things kind of have to be

1342
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:10,799
added back in one at a time as you're

1343
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,440
building this

1344
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,480
you know you get a good analogy is like

1345
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,559
you know to

1346
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,559
to build a plane while you're flying it

1347
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,400
like really that's what we're doing

1348
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,880
because we don't the cannabis industry

1349
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,800
doesn't have the type of crops

1350
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,400
that other industries like corn can rely

1351
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,480
on i mean if you're you want to be a

1352
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,559
huge corn producer you go and

1353
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,719
sign a deal with cargill or one of the

1354
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,280
big corn seed suppliers

1355
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,000
and you plant their bulletproof corn

1356
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,680
crops

1357
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,358
right and you pay them a hefty

1358
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,118
percentage of the crop

1359
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:44,159
because they're they're providing you

1360
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,760
with with a type of seed that is

1361
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:48,000
is going to be you know allow you to

1362
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,599
build a really robust business model

1363
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,358
and we're only kind of i think that

1364
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,960
we're only getting to that point in

1365
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:54,400
cannabis

1366
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,400
right now you know where we're starting

1367
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,639
to get to that point ryan and mark i

1368
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,079
think you brought up a good point

1369
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:01,279
and i encourage everyone to google it if

1370
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,240
you haven't seen it but they have these

1371
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,800
images of like

1372
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:05,759
every traditional commercial crop 100

1373
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,760
years ago

1374
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,480
or 150 years ago and what it looks like

1375
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,079
today and it's quite a bit different so

1376
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,480
you know from my perspective i think a

1377
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,240
lot of people are trying to

1378
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,318
in in their head at least breed towards

1379
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:20,159
the utopian plant

1380
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:21,599
and generally you know they're looking

1381
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:22,558
for obviously high yield

1382
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,400
um but they're looking for other

1383
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,839
characteristics as well uh you know one

1384
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,480
that i see people digging down on

1385
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:29,920
is like uh calyx to leaf ratio you know

1386
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,240
if you're in the business of growing for

1387
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,280
trim

1388
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:35,039
flower you probably don't want to grow a

1389
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,839
cultivar that's 40 percent

1390
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:38,318
you know trim in in a commercial setting

1391
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:40,480
so

1392
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:42,318
it seems to be pretty common from my

1393
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,920
kind of out and abouts

1394
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:45,920
but i see other people looking for like

1395
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,639
resistance to lodging um i know

1396
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,400
people are battling trellises uh on all

1397
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,279
kinds of different levels so the idea of

1398
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,400
having

1399
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,599
um in my opinion like a turgid plant

1400
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,920
um that's you know self-erects itself

1401
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,599
and can handle a little bit of wind and

1402
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,440
jostle here and there versus you know

1403
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,200
two or three layers of trellis

1404
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,559
would really speed up things from a

1405
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,318
labor perspective particularly

1406
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,599
associated with harvesting

1407
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:13,519
and maybe even increase things like

1408
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,359
better contact on sprays and things of

1409
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:16,159
this nature are there any other traits

1410
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:17,759
ryan

1411
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:19,199
mark in the in the group here that you

1412
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,319
really think are

1413
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:24,078
kind of um not not

1414
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:25,599
brought into the light yet that are

1415
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,200
critical

1416
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,519
i don't know about you know one of the

1417
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:32,318
traits that is critical for

1418
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,759
a lot of asexual propagators is a

1419
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:36,400
clonability of a

1420
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,680
of a variety or cultivar if it takes

1421
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,680
root really easily

1422
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,039
um and when you when you take clones you

1423
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:44,879
have this high

1424
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:46,800
frequency of stress uh stressed plants

1425
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,039
so if you can reduce that population

1426
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,559
through breeding a plant that's easily

1427
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:53,440
asexually propagated

1428
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:55,440
that works we're seeing terpenes is a

1429
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,519
big focus

1430
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,079
even for on the hemp side and some of

1431
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:03,039
the breeding programs we oversee that

1432
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,000
that terpene cannabis derived terpenes

1433
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:07,119
from hemp

1434
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,519
are proving to be a real market breaker

1435
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,119
for

1436
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:11,199
you know people are doing well

1437
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,760
cultivating hemp for terpenes as long as

1438
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,399
it's not

1439
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,760
mir seen because all hemp is pretty much

1440
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,240
mercy and there's a couple

1441
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,680
lines now that are terpenoline but

1442
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,078
there's six

1443
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:22,719
terpenes that can be dominant and when

1444
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,960
you get the

1445
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,719
into the limonenes the piones the the

1446
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,639
osamines and the linole

1447
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:32,639
then those essential oils uh really

1448
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:34,159
provide income for those hemp farmers

1449
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:36,879
who are struggling who are growing for

1450
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:39,598
cbd or whatever

1451
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,400
then you have like you know some plants

1452
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,440
we see

1453
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,880
exhibit uh you know reduced branching or

1454
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,880
no branching at all which could be

1455
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,559
useful in row crop

1456
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,160
similar to corn instead of getting

1457
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,839
christmas tree shapes you just have

1458
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:55,920
straight spindles and for fiber

1459
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:58,078
but the resistance obviously those are

1460
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:01,358
those are big big ones the flavor

1461
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,880
is is huge and creating terpene profiles

1462
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,400
that didn't exist previously

1463
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,720
because when you looked at the cannabis

1464
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,800
market seven years ago

1465
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:10,159
you had like five terpene profiles and

1466
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,039
that was kind of it

1467
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:14,159
and with help from ryan we've been able

1468
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,318
to assemble

1469
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:17,199
terpene profiles that never exist things

1470
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,000
that were

1471
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,719
uh you know pining is a recessive

1472
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,079
terpene like

1473
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:23,759
any time you hybridize it with anything

1474
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,920
the pining starts going away

1475
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,240
you have to really focus on keeping

1476
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,159
certain terpenes to be co-dominant when

1477
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:31,838
you when you breed through them so

1478
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:33,759
for example if you have something that's

1479
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:34,480
limonene pinene and beta-carotelline

1480
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,599
dominant

1481
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,159
that really doesn't exist in the

1482
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,800
marketplace because keratopheline and

1483
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:41,679
limonene

1484
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,680
kind of squash out the pinene the only

1485
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:46,799
way to preserve some outlier

1486
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:48,399
in that case is to have a clone or

1487
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,240
if you have a seed producer who has a

1488
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,318
parental that's pioneering dominant and

1489
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:53,039
a parental that is carefully limiting

1490
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,358
dominant

1491
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,039
and they homozygously breed those two

1492
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:59,119
terpenes to be codop those three

1493
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,199
terpenes be co-dominant in the seed

1494
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,200
then you have this new new way of

1495
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:07,439
sharing um

1496
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:09,439
homozygous uh seed crops based on flavor

1497
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,519
and mark can you elaborate a little bit

1498
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,679
on founder events and bottlenecking of

1499
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:16,400
gene pool

1500
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:16,960
you know i think that ryan is the king

1501
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,960
of the

1502
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,240
the the bottleneck of the gene pool

1503
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,119
because that used to be his

1504
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:24,159
uh sign off on his email was was it the

1505
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,000
the only

1506
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:28,480
was it the only crime against the

1507
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,519
cannabis genome is itself or seed and i

1508
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,639
don't know i can't remember

1509
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:34,159
i don't know it doesn't sound like

1510
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:35,838
something i would say but um

1511
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:39,199
that founder of events is all about

1512
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,199
consequences and so

1513
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:43,358
like for example a good a good a good

1514
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:45,358
one that people understand is og

1515
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:46,558
right og's a great plant it's got a

1516
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:48,078
great nose i don't know if i would call

1517
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,359
it a great plant but it's got a great

1518
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,400
nose and a

1519
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:53,358
and a flower profile from a consumer

1520
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,519
point of view it's

1521
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:57,119
there's a lot of things going for it but

1522
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:58,960
it's kind of like you said

1523
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,400
uh michael you know it's probably a

1524
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,119
plant that needs to be multiple

1525
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:06,400
trellised and it takes a lot of support

1526
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:09,680
um so think of it this way like when you

1527
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,920
choose a plant like og

1528
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,078
and everybody wants to have og

1529
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,920
everything og cookies or og

1530
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,280
whatever you know everybody like when it

1531
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,280
became popular everybody crossed

1532
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,240
everything to og

1533
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,359
and and so yeah you get those hot that

1534
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:26,000
high thc

1535
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:27,598
and you get that nice fuely kind of

1536
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
scent profile that gets added to

1537
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,318
whatever

1538
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,318
you're you're breeding with but you also

1539
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:33,838
get to inherit all the bad traits that

1540
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:36,400
come along with it

1541
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:36,880
um and what happens is when the entire

1542
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,240
world

1543
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,240
focuses on og

1544
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,519
you know when when darwin said you know

1545
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,200
survival of the fittest what he meant

1546
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:50,480
was survival of the

1547
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:52,078
the genes the genes that will survive

1548
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,240
are the ones that are passed on in the

1549
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,480
most frequency so when everybody's using

1550
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,479
og to breed with

1551
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,519
those genes become overrepresented in

1552
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,760
the population

1553
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:02,559
okay and so all the good things that

1554
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,079
come from og

1555
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,480
yeah they come into the pool but you

1556
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:09,119
also inherit all the bad things

1557
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,880
and when you only have a few individuals

1558
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,400
that are leading to

1559
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,960
the entire like i mean think about it

1560
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,240
like you know we're gonna go to mars

1561
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,400
and you want you you're gonna start a

1562
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:22,318
new colony on mars if you take

1563
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,358
five people right like those five people

1564
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:26,239
that

1565
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:27,838
leave that will have a big imprint on

1566
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:30,239
the future genetics from everything

1567
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:32,719
everyone that comes from them

1568
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,679
you're you're over emphasizing the

1569
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:35,838
traits that those

1570
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:37,759
that those people have right in the in

1571
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:40,078
the forming population and so

1572
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,520
it's kind of the idea that just

1573
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,359
understanding that

1574
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,039
when you go through a bottleneck and a

1575
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:46,000
bottleneck means that you know think of

1576
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:47,920
it like

1577
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,838
all the genes in a population are in a

1578
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,119
bottle i mean you turn the bottle upside

1579
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,279
down

1580
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,798
there's you know the limit of the amount

1581
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,920
of genes that can actually get through

1582
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:59,039
that

1583
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:02,400
that constriction is much lower

1584
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:04,079
right and so that has an impact on the

1585
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,119
future of the species from that point of

1586
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,680
view

1587
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,480
um and so it's really important to

1588
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,679
remember

1589
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,358
when you're doing things like

1590
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:12,960
everybody's breeding with og that you're

1591
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:14,880
yeah you're inheriting all the good

1592
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,519
characteristics but you're also

1593
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,519
inheriting all the bad characteristics

1594
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:21,440
and rob writes about this in a book

1595
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:24,318
called um

1596
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,440
sorry advances in hemp research palo

1597
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:28,318
vernale

1598
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,838
and rob wrote a great chapter about the

1599
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:32,480
you know the plants and the and the

1600
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:34,318
cultivars that really founded the drug

1601
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,679
gene pool mostly being i don't know

1602
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:39,440
northern lights afghani

1603
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:41,919
afghani one skunk one and hayes

1604
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,760
um and and it wasn't only those plants

1605
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,880
it was that a few or those those what we

1606
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,599
call varieties

1607
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,000
it was a very few individuals from those

1608
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,880
pla

1609
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,358
from those genetic lines that were kind

1610
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,838
of

1611
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:55,598
what we say made it intersect or cross

1612
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:56,719
between each of themselves amongst

1613
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,559
themselves

1614
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:01,039
and the different combinations of those

1615
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,920
very few plants

1616
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:04,880
for a long time had a big impact on the

1617
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,280
drug

1618
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,920
uh population the global drug population

1619
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,760
because

1620
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,280
everybody was growing seeds from those

1621
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,240
crosses

1622
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,280
right um so that's really what a founder

1623
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,759
event is

1624
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,960
okay yeah and and we you know we have

1625
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,240
gone through like i said we've gone

1626
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,000
through that a couple of times in

1627
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,199
cannabis once with the ogs and once at

1628
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,039
the beginning and i

1629
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:26,239
and i think that we're always going

1630
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:27,920
through that

1631
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:30,078
um it's always nice when people come

1632
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,599
along like dj short or

1633
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:33,280
these gentlemen out of colorado i don't

1634
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,119
know if you know them the cannabis

1635
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,720
potency research that have this freak

1636
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,880
show plant

1637
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:40,318
um with the with the weird leaf shape

1638
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,920
and you know

1639
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:44,159
it's nice when someone pops up and

1640
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,159
they've been doing their own thing

1641
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:47,679
and crossing to their within their own

1642
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:50,318
genetic program

1643
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:52,318
for say 15 20 years because they kind of

1644
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:54,079
become isolated from all the trends that

1645
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:56,719
are going on in the day

1646
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,280
and those are really great um what i

1647
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:00,480
call

1648
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:02,480
repair pools or their genetic um

1649
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,880
collections that we can go and draw from

1650
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,639
to kind of reinvigorate

1651
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,318
uh some of the interbreeding again

1652
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:09,598
remembering that cannabis is an

1653
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:12,400
outcrosser

1654
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,280
inbreeding is very unnatural to cannabis

1655
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,240
and so

1656
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,440
when we do these these inbreeding events

1657
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:19,759
we have to understand that there's

1658
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,440
genetic consequences to that

1659
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,520
um and they went through this with corn

1660
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,400
as well you know so it's not

1661
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:28,239
it's not to be unexpected yeah i like

1662
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,880
that terminology repair pull and save

1663
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:31,039
that one

1664
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,480
um i know one of the things that we

1665
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,679
talked about previously as a group

1666
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,559
was we're currently in a seed to clone

1667
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:38,480
market

1668
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,920
and i think a lot of people had some

1669
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,920
strong opinions that we're probably

1670
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,400
going to be shifting at some point to a

1671
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,599
a clone to seed market and move away

1672
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,920
from others altogether

1673
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,960
so collectively within the panel um i'd

1674
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,639
love to have a discussion

1675
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,119
and get some perspective on on your

1676
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:53,118
thoughts there

1677
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:59,279
well like rob said this is a seed crop

1678
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,079
i mean we don't grow corn not corn is

1679
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,480
bad example

1680
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,760
but we don't very few things in

1681
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:07,199
agriculture do we

1682
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,400
grow from asexual propagate if it has a

1683
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:10,639
hearty seed

1684
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,680
and when you compare the amount of

1685
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:14,879
horticultural

1686
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:15,440
horticultural required to produce from a

1687
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,519
clone

1688
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,559
versus producing from a seed there's no

1689
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,400
comparison

1690
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,079
you know when you grow from a clone you

1691
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,240
have to first propagate

1692
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,720
it which costs money a couple bucks a

1693
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:28,399
clone and then you have to

1694
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:29,919
skirt the plants when they get a certain

1695
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,119
age so that you you

1696
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:35,280
you know focus the the root to shoot

1697
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,480
ratio on the top so you get good bud

1698
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,559
formation

1699
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,760
and they're usually susceptible to

1700
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,559
diseases and pests

1701
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,960
that have just come along unless you

1702
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,798
have

1703
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,039
seggers technology which is tissue

1704
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:48,480
culture which cleans all the plants so

1705
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:51,119
that they're really nice for

1706
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,039
for production but it's really a

1707
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,079
no-brainer when you compare a plant with

1708
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:56,400
a tap root

1709
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,240
versus a plant without a taproot it's

1710
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,960
really remarkable you can even grow

1711
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:02,558
in low-light winter conditions with no

1712
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,199
heat and still get really great bud

1713
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,920
formation

1714
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:07,679
in good yields your pest and disease

1715
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,280
pressure goes way down

1716
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:11,039
and like i said the horticultural cost

1717
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,119
goes down you just have to

1718
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:15,119
be working with someone who has

1719
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,160
developed seeds for the purpose

1720
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:20,640
of production instead of

1721
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:22,399
someone who takes a strawberry kush and

1722
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:24,480
crosses it with a banana kush and causes

1723
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,079
strawberry banana kush

1724
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,000
if they didn't look at the chemistry

1725
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,000
behind those two products and

1726
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,440
or those two plants and the resulting

1727
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,358
seed isn't going to be what they think

1728
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,679
it is and

1729
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:37,358
all the panelists can can kind of vouch

1730
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:39,279
for that when you're just taking names

1731
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:40,318
and hybridizing hybrids and hybridizing

1732
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,040
hybrids

1733
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:44,639
you don't really it it's it's the same

1734
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:46,798
thing over and over and over again

1735
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:48,879
right like even when you look across all

1736
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,798
of the gelato cookies

1737
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,720
wedding cake sunset sherbet they're all

1738
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:54,400
beta-carotene dominant

1739
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,318
a little bit of limonene and a little

1740
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,720
bit of other secondaries and

1741
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:00,318
they basically have a very similar

1742
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:04,000
aromatic profile

1743
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:05,759
and that's one of the main drivers of

1744
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,280
what seeds are produced like ryan was

1745
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,599
talking about og kush

1746
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,280
well o.g kush has fallen out of favor to

1747
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,318
the cookies family of

1748
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,119
of hybrids right so so i think in the

1749
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:18,159
future

1750
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:20,318
as the hemp farmers have shifted to seed

1751
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:21,759
that's a great model for the cannabis

1752
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:23,759
farmers to shift to seed

1753
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,359
and pretty much anyone growing outdoors

1754
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,079
whether it's sonoma

1755
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:30,880
or santa rosa or santa barbara they're

1756
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:33,200
all growing from seed for the

1757
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,318
bcc marketplace because it doesn't make

1758
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:36,558
sense to

1759
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:37,759
pay what it costs to do the clonal work

1760
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,200
and put it in the ground

1761
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,359
and then it'd be a crap shoot if you're

1762
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:43,598
going to have a fire or a windstorm

1763
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:44,639
or whatever we know that that model's

1764
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,798
not um

1765
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:47,920
completely dialed in yet but if you had

1766
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:50,159
to predict a

1767
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,000
time where you see this transition being

1768
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,639
there at the level of like a

1769
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,838
monsanto tomato seed as an example what

1770
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:57,838
kind of timeline would you put on that

1771
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,680
well i mean we have clients who have

1772
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:05,679
products that currently

1773
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:08,719
are homozygous very stable

1774
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:10,000
and perform in the field but

1775
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:12,000
when you're talking about a complete

1776
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,480
catalog that's roundup ready

1777
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,559
uh you know monsanto has to step into

1778
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,358
the game to get roundup ready going for

1779
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,720
us but

1780
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:20,239
i would say in the next five years

1781
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,519
you'll see a lot more products entering

1782
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:24,558
the marketplace i mean

1783
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:27,039
there's a couple good good

1784
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,640
autoflower seeds that are finally

1785
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:29,039
starting to get better on the nose out

1786
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:31,279
there

1787
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:33,239
um molecular farms has a couple great

1788
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,079
products that are autoflower and

1789
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:39,358
photopredependent um yeah probably like

1790
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,720
five years and there'll be a lot

1791
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:42,480
and i'd say i just added that that i

1792
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:45,519
think that clones will

1793
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,440
always have a place i mean we

1794
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:49,679
we're the closer we get to homozygous

1795
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,318
seeds it's obviously and it depends on

1796
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:52,078
the

1797
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:53,599
cultivator and where they're cultivating

1798
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:56,400
and what they're cultivating

1799
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:58,318
um but clones and tissue culture will

1800
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,318
will have their place in the market um

1801
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,000
definitely for you know maintaining

1802
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:05,358
breeding parent stock

1803
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,519
at the very least um and it just it all

1804
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:10,798
depends i mean with there's a there are

1805
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:13,838
you know we some plants just are so

1806
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:16,000
um unstable like grapes and apples you

1807
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:18,159
know that we have to grow from clone

1808
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,440
and you know some markets are so

1809
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:21,279
discerning about

1810
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,559
what they want that we're not yet

1811
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,039
they're not ready to take

1812
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,559
the even limited variability that comes

1813
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:29,839
from sea crops

1814
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,079
um you know so i i think that they'll

1815
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:32,960
still be relevant you know and even but

1816
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:35,599
we all

1817
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,798
we all hope to be able to produce um

1818
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:38,318
better seed

1819
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:40,400
it's more reliable especially for

1820
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:41,519
international markets and i agree with

1821
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:45,119
that

1822
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:47,759
i'd like to add that broad acre is the

1823
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:50,640
future for most of cannabis production

1824
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,200
it's all cannabis whether it's hemp or

1825
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:53,920
seed

1826
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:54,239
or drug it's all cannabis and that will

1827
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,559
weigh

1828
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:58,558
in in a future question but

1829
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:04,480
you you need to think towards what

1830
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:06,559
agriculture really is

1831
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,679
and it's broad acre agriculture it's an

1832
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:11,359
australian term

1833
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:14,798
basically but it means growing um

1834
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:17,279
crops from seed on large acreage

1835
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:18,239
and this is the way forward for

1836
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,200
producing

1837
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:23,439
cannabinoids as just cannabinoid stock

1838
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:27,919
just like it is for producing cedar

1839
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:29,599
or fiber um so really we need consistent

1840
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,960
seed varieties for that

1841
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:36,640
sort of production they exist for fiber

1842
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,838
and for seed but they don't exist for

1843
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:39,358
drug cannabis and

1844
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:42,318
this is something that really needs to

1845
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:46,558
happen to really move

1846
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:50,960
the plant forward as a real crop point

1847
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:52,319
that's switching gears a little bit ryan

1848
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,880
did you have a comment i'm sorry

1849
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:56,639
before i do it or switch gears yeah i

1850
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,559
just wanted to say

1851
01:03:56,639 --> 01:03:59,920
you know i i think that there's a bit a

1852
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,798
little bit of a dichotomy and i mean

1853
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,519
like

1854
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:05,119
like mojave with sand there is all these

1855
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:06,159
trends there are all these trends that

1856
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,640
happen

1857
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:10,159
um and and cultivators have to be quick

1858
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:13,519
to adapt but the truth is

1859
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:16,159
the seed process takes time and so

1860
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:17,358
you know to get homozygous seed of all

1861
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:18,879
these really

1862
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:21,199
variants i mean april's doing a great

1863
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,599
job of it but i think that five years is

1864
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:24,239
probably pushing the envelope a little

1865
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:26,318
bit

1866
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:28,078
in terms of worldwide acceptance from

1867
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:29,038
most cultivation facilities i think most

1868
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,880
cultivation

1869
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:35,359
i think 10 to 15 years is probably

1870
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,400
a more realistic number of when people

1871
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:38,639
are going to start

1872
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,240
really planting the majority of cannabis

1873
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:41,440
drug crops from seed

1874
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:43,838
at least those that are growing for

1875
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,639
flour if you're going for extract

1876
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:48,558
it doesn't matter as much but the flower

1877
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:50,318
market kind of really depends on these

1878
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:54,000
clonal productions

1879
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:57,199
um yeah point

1880
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,119
yeah so i i mean i'd like to i think

1881
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:00,960
that going to seed

1882
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:02,559
would be it would solve a lot of the

1883
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,358
problems like mark was talking about

1884
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:08,000
there are there are tons of advances

1885
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:08,798
um advantages sorry but the truth is is

1886
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,159
that those

1887
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:12,159
you know we're like i said we're

1888
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:14,239
building this plane as we're flying it

1889
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:15,920
from parts that all these different

1890
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,479
growers have cobbled together over the

1891
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:20,798
last

1892
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,798
20 30 years and

1893
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,160
it takes time to develop those plants

1894
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,119
that are

1895
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:28,960
um you know they're what i call

1896
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:31,280
bulletproof plants right like like

1897
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,039
the corn of today where you can plant a

1898
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,400
thousand a field of a thousand plants or

1899
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,480
more ten thousand plants and they all

1900
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:40,240
look the same

1901
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:41,760
to make breeding parents that are stable

1902
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:45,919
to get to that point where you can start

1903
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,920
creating those hybrids is it takes time

1904
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:49,599
um yeah just kind of pushing on a little

1905
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,160
bit too because i know q and a is kind

1906
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:53,440
of a

1907
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:55,440
hot topic always on these webinars um

1908
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,639
as the market evolves um leading

1909
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,400
producers and brands are taking

1910
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:00,400
increasingly sophisticated approaches to

1911
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,680
curating cultivar menus

1912
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,318
particularly in the new booming

1913
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:05,519
recreational markets um

1914
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:08,000
you know i've seen this time and time

1915
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:09,679
again where people go spend 25 50

1916
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,039
500 million dollars and build out a

1917
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:12,719
facility and then you talk to them about

1918
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,920
their genetic portfolio and what their

1919
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,000
plan is there

1920
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:19,039
and it's kind of like this afterthought

1921
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,318
it's um oh we're gonna buy five or ten

1922
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:21,520
thousand dollars for the seeds and kind

1923
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:24,719
of hunt through some things

1924
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:26,318
um so you know i guess

1925
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:27,838
what should a producer's genetic

1926
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:30,880
portfolio management

1927
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:33,440
look like pre-operational and

1928
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,559
operational and that's kind of open for

1929
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,880
all of you guys but yeah

1930
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:38,400
what does what makes up a ideal genetic

1931
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,039
portfolio for

1932
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,318
you know a modern company today well i i

1933
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,839
would start off by saying probably just

1934
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:46,400
ryan's catalog

1935
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:48,159
but you know that's a big statement if

1936
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,318
you could pull up those three fido facts

1937
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:52,558
this is a great segue to kind of

1938
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:53,920
yeah to just show how you can have

1939
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:55,760
diversity within

1940
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,960
a dispensary or whatnot and these are

1941
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,400
all products that are

1942
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:03,760
on the shelf in in california

1943
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:07,280
but the idea is that uh in a true

1944
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:09,119
in the future you'll be looking at

1945
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,480
you're looking at phytofacts these are

1946
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:13,599
report formats

1947
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:16,000
for different cultivars being

1948
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,440
grown in california and sold in the the

1949
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,960
recreational marketplaces

1950
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:24,159
and sc labs

1951
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:26,720
now produces these for for cultivators

1952
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:28,159
so you can have a better standard of

1953
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:30,919
quality control because you have your

1954
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:33,598
terpene profile that's color coded

1955
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:34,559
semi-intuitively so if you if you notice

1956
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,519
on the left you have a

1957
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:38,720
the happy pineapple uh cultivar that's a

1958
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:41,440
true

1959
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:42,000
it smells like pineapple like pineapple

1960
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,679
express never

1961
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,119
really smelled like pineapple it was

1962
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:47,358
just the name

1963
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,880
but this plant has 28 plus percent

1964
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:52,078
cannabinoids

1965
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:55,039
it has 20 thc with like 8

1966
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:56,000
cbg but the dominant terpene is osamine

1967
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,240
and beta-carotene

1968
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,760
with limonene pinene and it is really

1969
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:01,598
bright and pineapply

1970
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,599
and then you go to the far right which

1971
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:06,480
is a space force one

1972
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:07,519
it's 32 percent cannabinoids 30 percent

1973
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,719
thc

1974
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:12,719
limonene dominant has a gassy back end

1975
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:14,159
but a lemony front end

1976
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:15,759
and then something in the middle that

1977
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:16,318
kind of smells like cookies is holy

1978
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,199
crunch

1979
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:19,600
and it's one to one thc to cbd and you

1980
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:22,559
have

1981
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,120
you know a host of consumer tools on

1982
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,679
this

1983
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:27,119
report format that dispensaries and bud

1984
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,838
tenders can learn from

1985
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:31,198
and understand how to direct a new user

1986
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:34,399
like rob mentioned

1987
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:38,639
or uh the the og who just wants the

1988
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:41,119
30 thc but also gives the

1989
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,640
consumer useful information about the

1990
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:43,198
product and how it's going to make them

1991
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,560
feel

1992
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,719
how it's going to taste how it's going

1993
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:49,679
to smell and then once you

1994
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:52,640
begin creating a whole menu that is

1995
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:55,359
based off of terpene profile because

1996
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,838
if you create a spectrum from you know

1997
01:08:55,359 --> 01:09:00,480
the warm colored tones to the cool

1998
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:02,318
colored tones on the phytofactory of red

1999
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,959
orange and yellow those are warm colors

2000
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:05,520
and then

2001
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,000
the purples and blues are cool tones the

2002
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,239
warm

2003
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,920
kind of you know tie into those

2004
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:12,158
sativa-like effects

2005
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,759
the cool tones associate with the

2006
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:15,759
indica-like effects and if you have a

2007
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:19,119
mixture of the colors those are hybrid

2008
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:20,880
like effects and when we look at plants

2009
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:23,198
we look at them from their morphology

2010
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,239
so if if you're looking at biotech seed

2011
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:26,479
catalog

2012
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:27,678
you'll have indica sativa and hybrid for

2013
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:30,079
the structure of the plant

2014
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,520
like rob was talking thin leaf fat leaf

2015
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:33,119
short and squatty tall

2016
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,279
and then you have the effects the

2017
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:36,318
terpene entourage indica sativa and

2018
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,400
hybrid

2019
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,440
and that's what these phytofacts kind of

2020
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:41,278
kind of do

2021
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:43,198
and they're really great tools for

2022
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:45,839
breeding so if you go to the next slide

2023
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,838
please michael

2024
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:51,278
this is a small shot of a of a seed

2025
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,839
population

2026
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,120
and you know there's four different sets

2027
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:57,039
of bar charts

2028
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:58,559
but as you can see each each individual

2029
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:02,399
cultivar is numbered 14

2030
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,719
21 22 etc and if you look at the second

2031
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:04,639
bar

2032
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:06,960
chart down with the orange and green

2033
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,199
bars the orange is the absolute

2034
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,239
terpene concentration and the green is

2035
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:13,519
the absolute

2036
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:15,198
cannabinoid concentration and then

2037
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,120
the next bar chart under shows the

2038
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:18,960
relative terpene profiles

2039
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:21,279
and then the bar chart under that shows

2040
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,880
minor molecules that most people don't

2041
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:26,238
don't even look at but they definitely

2042
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,239
look unlabeled

2043
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,520
and it truly affects the nose

2044
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,679
and it's it's really it's really neat

2045
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:37,040
and this is an example of an

2046
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:39,039
f2 so we're trying to get diversity in

2047
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:41,439
the terpene profile

2048
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:43,279
but if you look at number 19 it has like

2049
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:44,719
four and a half percent terps and 20

2050
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:46,880
some plus cannabinoids

2051
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:48,800
so it's like one of the clear winners

2052
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,640
you know of of this group

2053
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,159
but it takes you it takes you a little

2054
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,600
bit of time to look at these and

2055
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:54,319
actually understand what they're looking

2056
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,000
at but

2057
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:57,519
really if people focus in on the two

2058
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,960
middle rows

2059
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,199
of the kind of the rainbow row and the

2060
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:03,520
orange and the green one the orange

2061
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:05,678
the oranges correct me if i'm wrong mark

2062
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,920
or orange is cannabinoids and the green

2063
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:09,199
is

2064
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:11,520
terpenes you got exactly yeah well

2065
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,719
oh the opposite sorry all right but

2066
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,640
anyway

2067
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,319
you can you can really easily look at a

2068
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,119
population and start to see

2069
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:21,039
okay you know number six for example is

2070
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:22,000
obviously low in both cannabinoids and

2071
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:23,439
terpenoids

2072
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,039
but you can look at the ones with the

2073
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:26,639
high peaks and start seeing the ones

2074
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:27,920
that have the high levels of terpenoids

2075
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,679
and cannabinoids and

2076
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,279
you can even look at the ratios between

2077
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:35,840
those compounds

2078
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:35,840
um so it's a really informative way

2079
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,158
to look at an entire population rather

2080
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:43,359
than looking at individual

2081
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:45,759
lab reports one at a time

2082
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:47,839
uh the phytoefects make this possible

2083
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,520
and you know the guys that are

2084
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,039
growing the strawberry banana kush are

2085
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,480
breeding that that product

2086
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:55,359
they don't look they don't they don't

2087
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:57,439
have access to tools like this but

2088
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:59,759
we're we're planning on helping sc labs

2089
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:01,759
make this a product of the future for

2090
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,520
for cannabis breeders we can help move

2091
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,000
the industry forward a little bit more i

2092
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,320
mean yeah it's very cool

2093
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,439
these tools have been awesome in helping

2094
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:12,000
you know uh

2095
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:14,639
molecular farms and others create truly

2096
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:18,000
novel products in the marketplace

2097
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:20,400
that taste great have a great experience

2098
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,920
and it's truly tailored breeding when

2099
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:22,639
you break it down to the chemicals like

2100
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,480
this

2101
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,159
yeah and when you go back and i mean if

2102
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:27,439
you go back to this the slide before

2103
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:28,960
where you're showing the hot happy

2104
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:31,519
pineapple

2105
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,439
um most people won't tell by looking at

2106
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,600
these lab reports because you're kind of

2107
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:37,039
you know when when they're new to you it

2108
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,079
takes a little bit of time to read them

2109
01:12:37,039 --> 01:12:41,119
but once you've seen

2110
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:42,399
you know a thousand of them those plants

2111
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:43,840
that are up on the on the

2112
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:45,279
or the i don't know if you can go back

2113
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,279
to it michael but those plants that were

2114
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:50,559
on the previous slide

2115
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:52,399
their technical difficulties okay

2116
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,320
they're pretty interesting plants i mean

2117
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:56,559
that happy pineapple

2118
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:58,479
is a is a pretty cool plant 28

2119
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,719
cannabinoids eight percent

2120
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:04,158
cbg um with that terpene profile high in

2121
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:05,439
osamine and

2122
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:06,879
it looks like there's a bunch of other

2123
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:08,599
little miners in there yeah you got some

2124
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,920
limonine and some pinene and some

2125
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,960
beta-carotelline

2126
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,840
i mean that's a cool plant that's a and

2127
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,119
that ocean

2128
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:20,079
came from bag seed of hawaiian

2129
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:21,279
from 1994. that's not from the pinterest

2130
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:24,158
line then

2131
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:25,840
no no no no this that's from the the

2132
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:29,599
this ended up getting crossed with

2133
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:32,239
um a blue moonshine and then

2134
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,719
and then flow and then back back across

2135
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:36,319
to the

2136
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:38,480
the hawaiian parent and yeah dj short

2137
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:40,880
stuff

2138
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:41,519
not the chemistry it was more the early

2139
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,640
flower

2140
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:47,600
and the structure um because dj stuff

2141
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,560
often was really early like uh which i

2142
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:52,079
which i really liked

2143
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,640
so it's it's great to see this um you

2144
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:55,359
know

2145
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,239
the fido facts is such a powerful tool

2146
01:13:55,359 --> 01:13:59,279
um

2147
01:13:56,238 --> 01:14:01,119
and for breeders and ultimately for

2148
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:02,880
consumers which is really what we you

2149
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:05,198
know kind of the underlining

2150
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:07,279
theme here is consumer education and the

2151
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:10,479
fact that selabs is doing this

2152
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:11,119
with with napo and that the emerald cup

2153
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:14,158
is now

2154
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:15,840
has a terpene class awards which really

2155
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:18,479
you know these the cannabis awards

2156
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:20,880
really drives the market in a big way

2157
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:21,759
and the fact that we're going to see

2158
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,520
people

2159
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,840
acknowledging these different terpene

2160
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:28,960
classes and hopefully eventually

2161
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:30,400
the retail outlets um also

2162
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,800
realizing that they need to have a

2163
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:34,158
representational variety for

2164
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,199
all these different terpene and minor

2165
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:40,079
cannabinoids um that's great

2166
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:40,079
in that yeah

2167
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:46,719
2014 or 2013 i think but that's great

2168
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,800
for finally doing it i mean it's like i

2169
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:51,520
always use the example of a

2170
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,159
um like a best a dog show right it's

2171
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,000
like you have

2172
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:56,238
what we do now is kind of like best in

2173
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,158
show but you know they'd also

2174
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:59,839
say what the best labrador you know or

2175
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:01,279
the best poodle is right

2176
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,119
and so when you can actually start

2177
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:06,399
judging cannabis

2178
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:08,479
amongst samples that are similar to that

2179
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:11,759
type i mean that's quite interesting

2180
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:12,718
yeah like like the ipa versus a porter

2181
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,640
versus a stout

2182
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:16,480
i mean it's a natural way or a merlot

2183
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,840
versus a you know

2184
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:20,238
cab cabernet um and just so so everybody

2185
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,480
knows

2186
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:24,399
sc labs did a great job on their website

2187
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:26,158
if you guys want to check out the fido

2188
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:29,198
facts they put together video

2189
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:30,639
and all kinds of stuff so i think it's

2190
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:32,000
just also interesting how you know the

2191
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:35,039
cultivation classic

2192
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,679
um awards out of oregon their terpene

2193
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,640
class

2194
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:38,640
excludes myrsin

2195
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,920
yeah they're just like we're not even

2196
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:43,919
going to try it because otherwise you

2197
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,359
know the market is dominated with mere

2198
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,760
seeing dominant varieties

2199
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:49,679
we need to talk about other terpenes hey

2200
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:52,960
mir scene's not even on the grass list

2201
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:54,640
so stay away from that stuff really i

2202
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,119
didn't know that that's hilarious

2203
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,760
2018 they pulled it off the grass list

2204
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,880
yeah

2205
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:03,760
yeah all right guys so

2206
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,400
i am going to push us forward a little

2207
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,920
bit here

2208
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:07,759
uh last question and then we're gonna

2209
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,359
get into q a um what concerns should

2210
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,159
producers have when planning for new

2211
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:12,719
genetics

2212
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:14,319
um and we discuss educating and

2213
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:15,600
consumers through retail training and

2214
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:18,639
education

2215
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,480
and also how does geographic uh location

2216
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,719
and regulatory climate affects some of

2217
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:22,718
this

2218
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:28,319
regulation is huge yes i was just going

2219
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:29,519
to say it's huge especially in the

2220
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:31,599
international market

2221
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,679
i mean you look at all these new

2222
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,560
countries that are coming online

2223
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:38,399
they're uh you know they want to grow

2224
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,880
popular varieties but they might not

2225
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:40,559
have

2226
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,719
the right climate for it they might not

2227
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,920
have the right regulatory structure to

2228
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:48,800
allow it

2229
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:51,359
um yeah it's it's um it's huge

2230
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,880
i i mean i'm i'm biased as a vendor

2231
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:55,920
international vendor of seed

2232
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,800
genetics and clone shipping around the

2233
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,600
world

2234
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,960
but i really feel like in order to be

2235
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:04,320
successful

2236
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:06,079
you have to partner with um a group that

2237
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:09,840
knows what they're doing

2238
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:10,800
um trying to do your whole genetic

2239
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,760
program

2240
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,119
on your own is crazy if you're like i

2241
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,560
said if you're going to enter the tomato

2242
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:18,079
or the farm market

2243
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,199
you're not going to er you're not going

2244
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:20,479
to and you want to be a producer you're

2245
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:21,839
not going to go and collect your own

2246
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:23,439
land race seeds

2247
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,719
and start trying to put together a

2248
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:25,919
breeding program and make your own

2249
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,000
tomato

2250
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,000
right you're going to go to a known

2251
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,479
producer that has a reliable crop that

2252
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,600
you can rely on to support your business

2253
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:35,198
model and you're going to make a

2254
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:39,760
contract with them

2255
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:41,519
um and i you know

2256
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,600
in in a lot of these companies a lot of

2257
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:46,000
these these regular these

2258
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,679
markets what what they'll do is they'll

2259
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,439
allow a producer to have like a two or

2260
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:51,279
three week window where

2261
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:53,039
you know the regulator kind of looks the

2262
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:54,238
other way and whatever genetics end up

2263
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:56,158
in your facility

2264
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:58,399
they end up your facility but once that

2265
01:17:56,158 --> 01:18:00,479
period is over you're locked down

2266
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:02,238
and you can only trade genetics or buy

2267
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:04,879
genetics from other people that operate

2268
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:07,439
within your system

2269
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,039
and that creates challenges for

2270
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:11,039
producers that are always trying to

2271
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:12,800
create something new and stay relevant

2272
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:14,319
because you know any given producer only

2273
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,039
has you know

2274
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:18,079
a footprint of say a hundred x right and

2275
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:21,519
if you have to take

2276
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:22,800
25 x of that hundred and dedicate it to

2277
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,600
veg space

2278
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,440
you now only have three or 75 x of the

2279
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,039
rest of that space to use for production

2280
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:30,719
when we start taking away some of that

2281
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:33,119
space to do r d

2282
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:34,158
to try and develop that new new all the

2283
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:35,840
time

2284
01:18:34,158 --> 01:18:37,359
right like we're saying you know a lot

2285
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,800
of these places

2286
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:40,399
might want to roll out a new cultivar

2287
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:42,400
every two or three months

2288
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:43,759
right so that they can stay relevant and

2289
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:46,639
um

2290
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:48,159
it's tough to do that all on your own

2291
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,600
while you're trying to run a business

2292
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:52,799
and i think

2293
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,159
um you know in north america especially

2294
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,279
is becoming quite lucky

2295
01:18:54,158 --> 01:18:58,559
as we envision um full legalization in

2296
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:00,880
the states probably in the next five

2297
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:04,320
years with the new administration

2298
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:07,039
um and maybe that allows

2299
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:10,719
interstate commerce and potentially

2300
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:12,479
commerce within the north american block

2301
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:15,039
where canada and the united states can

2302
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:16,399
trade genetics

2303
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:17,840
canada is already able to do

2304
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:20,960
international business because we're

2305
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,960
fully legalized

2306
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:25,760
so you know segger for example just

2307
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:26,799
released news that they

2308
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,199
you know that we're shipping some

2309
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:32,400
genetics over to a company in

2310
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:34,839
in africa um and so the

2311
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:36,000
the movement of genes is becoming more

2312
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,960
commonplace

2313
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,800
but really having a genetic supplier

2314
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,359
that is going to be able to support a

2315
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,840
diverse

2316
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:45,839
menu i think is really critical

2317
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:49,359
clean stock i'd add into that you know

2318
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,320
we've talked with groups

2319
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:54,079
you know some in in fully regulated um

2320
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:55,599
countries they usually don't allow for

2321
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:58,079
immaculate conception

2322
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,159
so all material has to come in with the

2323
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:03,119
phytosanitary certificate

2324
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:04,719
and we've already heard um you know new

2325
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:05,439
emerging markets that have been

2326
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:07,600
completely

2327
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:08,479
infected and impacted by hoplay and

2328
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,840
thyroid

2329
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:14,079
you know that they brought in seed stock

2330
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,840
um and it's already spread throughout

2331
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:17,679
their whole facility so

2332
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,360
it's happening in canada too i mean we

2333
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,920
you know we're not supposed to have

2334
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:23,359
cross

2335
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,639
clone cross you know cross border clone

2336
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:28,399
shipments but

2337
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:30,239
it happens right um and i'm seeing bro

2338
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:32,319
i've seen broad mites now in a couple of

2339
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:34,000
canadian facilities and for those of you

2340
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:35,759
that don't know broad might start really

2341
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,760
indigenous to canada so

2342
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,199
that's that's a result of people

2343
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,159
bringing up cuttings outside of the

2344
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:42,158
system

2345
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:44,559
and outside of the regulations not only

2346
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:46,399
the cannabis act regulations but

2347
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:48,480
we have regulations on the international

2348
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:50,000
regulations on the movement of plants

2349
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:51,839
and um

2350
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,960
what mohave just mentioned this whole

2351
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,560
concept of phytosanitary certification

2352
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,679
and when people operate outside those

2353
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:02,639
regulations there's consequences

2354
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:04,239
so you know be careful of it's important

2355
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:06,560
to be really careful of who your genetic

2356
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:09,359
suppliers are because

2357
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:11,120
not only on the genetic you know not

2358
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:13,039
only the genetic comes in your facility

2359
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:14,960
also any bugs that are on that plant

2360
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:16,880
material come into your facility

2361
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:18,399
and it can absolutely devastate your

2362
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,000
business yeah

2363
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:21,599
do you have the cannabis aphid up there

2364
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,439
ryan

2365
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,000
not yet i haven't seen it yet but i'm

2366
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:28,158
sure it's on its way

2367
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,760
i've seen about every pest in canada at

2368
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:32,638
this point um

2369
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,119
but so my takeaways there were validate

2370
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:36,639
your

2371
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:39,679
partners or your resources um

2372
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:42,800
clean stock program is critical um and

2373
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:44,639
divergent portfolio and that'll give you

2374
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,119
enough building blocks for a good start

2375
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:47,119
to

2376
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:48,719
create whatever it is that's in your

2377
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:52,880
vision

2378
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:54,000
um go ahead rob i said well said that's

2379
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:57,600
exactly all right

2380
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,359
okay um so this is where i have to leave

2381
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,400
you with a cliffhanger um as much as we

2382
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:02,079
want to talk about

2383
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:03,839
incredible things like market recessive

2384
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:07,439
selection um

2385
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:10,880
predictive breeding programs pan-genomes

2386
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:12,319
um and and and uh that's gonna have to

2387
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,800
be for part two

2388
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:15,519
so at this point we'll transition to q

2389
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,960
and a

2390
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,480
uh thank you to all audience members

2391
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,920
that provided questions ahead of time

2392
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:20,879
we're able to select a few so we'll get

2393
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,800
started there

2394
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,400
and then we can grab some out of the

2395
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,520
chat um

2396
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:28,799
mojave ryan rob mark if there's anything

2397
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,320
any questions in the chat that you find

2398
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,119
particularly interesting go ahead and

2399
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:32,799
just you know

2400
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:34,238
um we'll pull them up after these next

2401
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,600
couple ones so

2402
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:37,119
um one of the first questions we had is

2403
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,960
do you think hybrid seed will displace

2404
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:41,439
traditional clonal propagation systems

2405
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,880
we've already covered that um we'll see

2406
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:44,238
i think we're all excited for that when

2407
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,560
it's when it's ready

2408
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:48,000
um the second one is a little bit more

2409
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,199
for part two but i thought it would be

2410
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,639
an interesting

2411
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:52,879
little teaser if anyone's got some

2412
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,600
experience but has anyone on the panel

2413
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,279
performed

2414
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:57,679
double haploid breeding techniques to

2415
01:22:55,279 --> 01:22:57,679
cannabis

2416
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:03,119
you're on mute right

2417
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:09,359
we we played with a bunch that's a big

2418
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:11,359
that's a big thing it's not that's

2419
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:12,960
not it's more than just spraying a plant

2420
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:15,439
with sts

2421
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,800
right um it's a quite involved process

2422
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:17,919
and we've played around with it a little

2423
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,719
bit

2424
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,399
um but we don't have any products it's

2425
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:25,920
really r d at this point in time

2426
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:28,238
it's i would say that again is ten years

2427
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:30,480
away from uh

2428
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:32,158
a reliable workable system where we're

2429
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:35,839
starting to see people generate

2430
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:35,839
lines derived from dihapps

2431
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:41,279
any other comments from the group here

2432
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:43,759
no one wants to take that one okay um

2433
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:44,399
speaking of sts or uh silver ethyl

2434
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,480
sulfate

2435
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:48,079
um does any of the panelists believe

2436
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:49,839
that using sts

2437
01:23:48,079 --> 01:23:51,920
to self an individual plant will make

2438
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,560
the seeds be more likely

2439
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,520
to intersect is there a way to use

2440
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:59,360
selfing without

2441
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,360
creating intercept problems

2442
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,439
does anybody else want to jump in i'll

2443
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:07,520
jump in first because it's gonna need

2444
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:10,479
modification by my peers

2445
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:12,239
but uh basically if you start with a

2446
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:14,319
female

2447
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:17,198
and i can't really describe to you

2448
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:23,039
exactly what a female is but an xx

2449
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:26,158
female with no intersex tendencies

2450
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:28,399
and then you use it to produce

2451
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:30,000
male pollen then you're probably good to

2452
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:32,158
go but a lot of the

2453
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,198
varieties we have are somehow sexually

2454
01:24:32,158 --> 01:24:35,599
unstable

2455
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:37,678
and i can't really explain that ryan's

2456
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:40,400
knows more about that than i do

2457
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:42,158
so there was a great paper just released

2458
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:44,079
by a group in canada

2459
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:45,679
that they actually sprayed sts on a

2460
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:48,000
plant and looked at the kind of an

2461
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,440
induced gene response looked at them

2462
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,198
looked at the genes that were altered in

2463
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:52,079
their expression and there's like a

2464
01:24:51,198 --> 01:24:55,359
whole list of

2465
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:57,760
you know 120 potential candidates

2466
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:59,759
um that that also seemed to make sense

2467
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:03,119
as genes for possible

2468
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:06,079
targets to be involved in intersexuality

2469
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:08,719
people gotta be able to separate male

2470
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:11,760
female-ness from intersex-ness

2471
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:14,079
their different traits um and they they

2472
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,840
overlap in the way that we experience

2473
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:17,760
them in the way that we see them

2474
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,520
but the truth is that they're separate

2475
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,159
separate traits

2476
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,040
um you can have male plants or female

2477
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:26,238
plants that are

2478
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:29,920
predisposed or not predisposed

2479
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:33,279
to intersexuality and what happens is we

2480
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:35,679
um when we breed those plants together

2481
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:36,479
or sorry when we self plants which is

2482
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,840
really what we're

2483
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:41,599
what we're most often doing when we use

2484
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:43,440
sts all we're doing is increasing the

2485
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,840
frequency of those genes in the

2486
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:48,799
offspring

2487
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,600
and so i would argue that it's not the

2488
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,639
sts

2489
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:56,079
itself that is causing

2490
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:59,279
intersex issues it's that using

2491
01:25:56,079 --> 01:26:01,679
sts allows us to execute

2492
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:02,880
breeding programs with tighter levels of

2493
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:05,760
inbreeding

2494
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,840
and it's that inbreeding that is

2495
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,760
exposing these traits that are buried in

2496
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:12,639
the cannabis genome

2497
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:15,039
like i said earlier cannabis being an

2498
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:17,760
obligate outcrosser

2499
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:18,719
what what that means is that plants

2500
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:21,840
accumulate

2501
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:24,000
genetic mutations there's no there's no

2502
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,159
drive to push those genetic mutations

2503
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,840
out of the population

2504
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:32,559
um and so when we do

2505
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:36,000
subsequently do things like use sts or

2506
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:39,199
create these tight inbreeding schemes

2507
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,520
those rare genetic mutations are more

2508
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:43,919
likely to pop their head

2509
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:46,080
and show us expressions that we didn't

2510
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:48,399
know were already buried in the

2511
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:50,000
in the cannabis genome and i think that

2512
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:51,599
that's more likely the the

2513
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
outcome is that we're seeing these

2514
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:56,239
things occur rather than

2515
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,760
that we're seeing these things occur as

2516
01:26:56,238 --> 01:27:00,158
a result of the breeding system

2517
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:03,119
rather than creating these things you

2518
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:06,319
know through our practices

2519
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:09,359
well and just from our experience across

2520
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:13,439
every chemotype and

2521
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:16,839
many many latitudes and environments

2522
01:27:13,439 --> 01:27:21,119
the environment plays a huge role in

2523
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:24,319
stress-induced stamina flower production

2524
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:27,279
so even if you do great breeding

2525
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:27,920
there is this opportunity for a cold

2526
01:27:27,279 --> 01:27:31,439
night

2527
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:33,600
or a photo period disruption or

2528
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:35,519
shitty root conditions that will create

2529
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,520
a stamina flower and

2530
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,800
once that plant produces a stamina

2531
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:41,360
flower

2532
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:43,039
it's hard to get that to stop expressing

2533
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:44,559
so if you take a clone off of a plant

2534
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:46,319
that you've stressed

2535
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,600
then you take a clone off of that plant

2536
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:50,158
and veg and

2537
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,120
your whole clonal straw stock has this

2538
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:52,638
central

2539
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:54,158
came from a single plant that was

2540
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:56,960
stressed one time

2541
01:27:54,158 --> 01:27:58,559
that stress could be enough to induce

2542
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,600
that stamina flower production every

2543
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,840
time you go into

2544
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,840
flower

2545
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:09,839
all right go ahead

2546
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:11,359
teasing that apart is that's the

2547
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,520
hairball

2548
01:28:11,359 --> 01:28:15,759
what's genetic what's epigenetic but

2549
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:18,800
yeah

2550
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:20,880
it it definitely can happen

2551
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,560
again one of the benefits of seed right

2552
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:25,279
it's like you you'd hope a lot of those

2553
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:27,280
things were reset when you go to seed

2554
01:28:25,279 --> 01:28:30,719
but there are also epigenetic changes

2555
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:33,920
that are passed on from generations

2556
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:35,439
right um the next question um

2557
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,279
where do you think the cannabinoid in

2558
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:39,678
terpene conversation will be five years

2559
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:40,399
from now will thc and cbd still be

2560
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:43,679
dominant

2561
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:45,359
and if so where do we think their

2562
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:46,960
maximum potential for

2563
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:50,319
peak restaurants are you know we've seen

2564
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:52,719
a lot of 30 uh thc cannabis in the last

2565
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:53,519
i don't know five years or so um but you

2566
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:57,039
know

2567
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:57,840
where is that limit i think we're right

2568
01:28:57,039 --> 01:29:01,279
up against it

2569
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:03,760
um you know 35 to

2570
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:05,840
35 total cannabinoids is really pushing

2571
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:09,199
it that's that's a really high number

2572
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:11,520
uh we see it regularly but it's a small

2573
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:14,000
percentage of the cultivars and

2574
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,800
things being bred what's more

2575
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,279
interesting

2576
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,400
than just absolute cannabinoid or

2577
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:21,599
terpene

2578
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:23,920
content is how they are not

2579
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,960
correlated so you can have something

2580
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,039
that has

2581
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,319
a whole lot of cannabinoid and not a

2582
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:30,158
whole lot of terpene

2583
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:31,519
or a whole lot of terpene and not a

2584
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:33,679
whole lot of cannabinoids

2585
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,719
or both a whole lot of cannabinoid and a

2586
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:37,920
whole lot of terpene

2587
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:39,119
or not very much of either so the fact

2588
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:42,158
that they're not correlated

2589
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:44,319
is really cool because it means that

2590
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:45,679
now that the cannabinoids you know are

2591
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:48,000
up to 35 percent

2592
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:50,319
and probably pretty maxed out based on

2593
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,560
the structure of the plant unless we

2594
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:54,479
create some new plant that just

2595
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,800
basically grows a giant mushroom-shaped

2596
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:59,839
trichome that fills up with 80

2597
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,480
thc you can still drive the terpene

2598
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:04,719
content

2599
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:08,079
up so you can add that flavor piece to

2600
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:09,920
those thirty percent thc products

2601
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:11,600
yeah i have a lot of i have this this

2602
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,560
comes up with chemists in the canadian

2603
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,320
space

2604
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,679
often a lot of people don't believe that

2605
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:17,599
those things aren't correlated i think

2606
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:19,119
that you and i know that because

2607
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,520
again we've been looking at breeding

2608
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:23,119
populations most people get their data

2609
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,400
from the marketplace

2610
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:26,880
and in the marketplace they are

2611
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:29,439
correlated um

2612
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,880
but you know i agree with you in that

2613
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:33,119
there's something to be said there's

2614
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:35,119
there's going to be something to be said

2615
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:36,399
both in the extract category and in the

2616
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:37,679
flower market

2617
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:39,359
for plants that are in the lower

2618
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:42,079
cannabinoid or what we call the mid-tier

2619
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:44,880
cannabinoid content you know the teens

2620
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:47,198
10 to 20 percent and you know higher

2621
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,679
levels of terpenes and terpenoids

2622
01:30:47,198 --> 01:30:51,759
um because that's gonna like you said

2623
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,359
it's gonna allow

2624
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,360
people to create a space where they're

2625
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:57,920
not getting whacked out on thc or

2626
01:30:55,359 --> 01:31:01,920
overloaded with thc too early in the day

2627
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:03,119
but are still able to access that flavor

2628
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:05,039
know i'd like to think that in the

2629
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:06,880
future we're going to be looking at kind

2630
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:09,359
of the um

2631
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,560
the the devil and the details that some

2632
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:12,799
of these compounds

2633
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,800
the relationship with within with each

2634
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:17,520
other are so critical that

2635
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,159
you know that very small infinitesimal

2636
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,480
amounts

2637
01:31:18,158 --> 01:31:22,719
of various minor cannabinoids and

2638
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:25,519
terpenes are actually contributing

2639
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:27,198
a huge effect to the overall ensemble

2640
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:30,320
effect you know it's the

2641
01:31:27,198 --> 01:31:31,119
second violin and the uh the third oboe

2642
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:33,439
in there

2643
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:35,760
that really may be making the song what

2644
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:35,759
it is

2645
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:42,960
um i had a question about i guess it

2646
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:44,079
really kind of comes back to holland so

2647
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:48,079
i remember when i was going

2648
01:31:44,079 --> 01:31:51,039
to amsterdam uh as a young kid

2649
01:31:48,079 --> 01:31:52,158
i was considered kind of uh crazy for

2650
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:55,039
rolling up a pure

2651
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:56,158
pure joint a lot of stuff was mixed it

2652
01:31:55,039 --> 01:31:58,479
also seemed like

2653
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:59,359
a lot of the general cannabinoid

2654
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:00,879
profiles

2655
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:02,479
i don't want to say they were low but

2656
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,600
they were kind of lower compared to

2657
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:04,799
common day

2658
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,560
i'd say maybe with the exception of

2659
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,279
maybe some amnesia haze or something

2660
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,960
like that

2661
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:10,319
um but most of stuff seem to be kind of

2662
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:14,560
in that

2663
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:17,920
mid-level cannabinoid profile um

2664
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:19,679
why why was that um and what when and

2665
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,760
where did it change where we started

2666
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:27,520
seeing these really elevated spikes

2667
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:30,159
of what i'll call extreme thc

2668
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:32,000
well the the cultural background in the

2669
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:33,599
netherlands is that they were hashish

2670
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,119
smokers

2671
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,800
and the way you smoked hashish

2672
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:38,559
discreetly and

2673
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:41,039
just you know without having a

2674
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:43,520
low-volume pipe of some sort

2675
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:44,960
was which is an american thing north

2676
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:47,600
american thing

2677
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,158
um you rolled them in cigarettes and

2678
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,760
most

2679
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:55,519
a lot of people smoked and the obvious

2680
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:59,119
no-brainer way to do it was to mix this

2681
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:02,639
sometimes not that flammable

2682
01:32:59,119 --> 01:33:06,800
hashish into a tobacco and dilute it

2683
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:09,279
a bit and make it not so strong and

2684
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:11,039
but it also the tobacco has its own

2685
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:14,238
physiological effects

2686
01:33:11,039 --> 01:33:16,800
i mean it's uh people become

2687
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:18,158
highly accustomed to smoking with

2688
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,560
tobacco

2689
01:33:18,158 --> 01:33:21,279
and without it they find it difficult to

2690
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,280
get high

2691
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:24,559
even if somebody rolls a pure joint like

2692
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:27,198
you were trying to do

2693
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:30,639
and it's the best thing you can find but

2694
01:33:27,198 --> 01:33:33,519
dutchies would smoke it and really not

2695
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:34,000
get high until they rolled one of their

2696
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,679
own

2697
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,439
or just smoked a cigarette and then

2698
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:40,960
suddenly they're bombed

2699
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:43,519
so it there was uh that

2700
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,319
it was both cultural in that that's why

2701
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,320
they did it

2702
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:48,079
and it also had a certain profound

2703
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:49,519
effect that north americans generally

2704
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:53,920
haven't followed

2705
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,920
um yeah that's that's the history of it

2706
01:33:54,079 --> 01:33:57,279
um this is a question for each one of

2707
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:00,320
you

2708
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:00,880
um what was the cultivar that in your

2709
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:02,960
opinion

2710
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,000
kind of changed the landscape or had the

2711
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:07,119
most impact

2712
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:10,479
on the cannabis uh industry and

2713
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:12,238
breeding in general i'll start with you

2714
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:14,879
mojave

2715
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:15,839
um well the cultivar that had the most

2716
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:20,400
impact for me

2717
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:23,199
was haze um just because that

2718
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:25,439
kind of rekindled my childhood love

2719
01:34:23,198 --> 01:34:27,759
affair for that particular

2720
01:34:25,439 --> 01:34:28,479
um cannabinoid profile interpreting

2721
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,960
profile but

2722
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:32,000
i'd say and i think that everyone else

2723
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,960
might agree that skunk

2724
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,479
one definitely had a profound effect on

2725
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,840
on cannabis and that it was kind of a

2726
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:39,839
backbone

2727
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:41,199
variety for a lot of the dutch seed

2728
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:44,639
companies and

2729
01:34:41,198 --> 01:34:47,519
helped to kind of rein in a lot of other

2730
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:48,480
varieties like pace for instance into a

2731
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:53,280
more

2732
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:53,279
um you know workable um line

2733
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:57,119
yeah i think that question for me is in

2734
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:59,920
what era i mean i would

2735
01:34:57,118 --> 01:35:00,319
agree with you both hayes and and skunk

2736
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:03,359
it's

2737
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:06,399
pretty hard to miss the

2738
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:08,238
the impact that kush has had on the kush

2739
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:08,719
has had in the marketplace over the last

2740
01:35:08,238 --> 01:35:12,158
15

2741
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:13,279
20 years um blueberry there's so many

2742
01:35:12,158 --> 01:35:17,279
and i think that

2743
01:35:13,279 --> 01:35:18,960
to me cannabis is kind of fashion um

2744
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:20,719
and these trends will come and go and

2745
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,760
they'll always be people looking back to

2746
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:24,239
the past

2747
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,360
you know bell bottoms come around every

2748
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:26,718
10 years or so

2749
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:29,279
people start wearing them again and i

2750
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:31,118
think that that will

2751
01:35:29,279 --> 01:35:33,679
too will be true with cannabis but i see

2752
01:35:31,118 --> 01:35:35,519
it as a as an evolution

2753
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:37,279
and there's always going to be something

2754
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:38,880
new that's interesting

2755
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:42,000
and that's part of the beauty of it is

2756
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:43,679
really to me is not focus on whatever is

2757
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,600
the most

2758
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:47,920
highest selling thing of the day yeah

2759
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:50,000
that's interesting for business reasons

2760
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,760
but you know go out there and experience

2761
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,279
the diversity that the cannabis plant

2762
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:56,079
has to offer

2763
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:58,000
um there's a lot of great flavors and

2764
01:35:56,079 --> 01:36:01,439
great effects that

2765
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,439
that she has hidden within

2766
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:13,600
sexy bag seed right yeah the

2767
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:15,198
same same thing for for us in the in the

2768
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:18,079
midwest it was

2769
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:18,559
you know the purple kush was was killer

2770
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:20,960
the

2771
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:22,239
the super skunk came through and it was

2772
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:24,158
killer

2773
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:25,839
and then you know when i first moved out

2774
01:36:24,158 --> 01:36:29,679
to california

2775
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:33,199
or early 2000s it was every

2776
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:35,679
it was purple and then it went to og

2777
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:37,359
and then it went to cookies and it's

2778
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:40,719
just

2779
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:43,039
those all are all great plants you know

2780
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:44,639
mojave mentioned everybody likes purple

2781
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:46,399
except for the cultivators because it

2782
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:49,600
takes like twice as long to grow

2783
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:51,439
you know like this doesn't seem yeah

2784
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:53,440
a lot a lot of the perps lines take

2785
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:55,599
forever to veg into something meaningful

2786
01:36:53,439 --> 01:36:59,198
especially ken's or

2787
01:36:55,600 --> 01:37:02,400
or or granddaddy um

2788
01:36:59,198 --> 01:37:04,719
or purple oracle even interesting

2789
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:05,599
next question is will breeders be able

2790
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:08,000
to breed

2791
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:09,039
cannabis varieties with extra long

2792
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,198
trichomes

2793
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:13,198
several times larger than ones today

2794
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:19,360
maybe that's possible we always felt

2795
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:22,399
that the

2796
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:22,399
northern lights

2797
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:30,559
lineage looked sparklier than it was

2798
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:33,279
because it had such long trichome stalks

2799
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,400
the heads weren't any any larger than

2800
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:37,840
than

2801
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:39,359
normal and the density of trichomes on

2802
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:42,960
the calyxes wasn't uh

2803
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:46,960
brach's better term i apologize for that

2804
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:49,520
um but the density on the bracks was

2805
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:51,760
was not any higher but they look really

2806
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,360
sparkly because those extensions of the

2807
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:56,719
least surface that are the

2808
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:59,759
stalks they they also glisten

2809
01:37:56,719 --> 01:38:02,719
but i don't

2810
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:04,079
other than i'm not sure why you'd want

2811
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:06,158
longer stocks

2812
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:08,319
if you're a hashish maker the largest

2813
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:08,879
proportion of trash you have in your dry

2814
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:11,198
sift

2815
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,800
is the bloody stalks even after you're

2816
01:38:11,198 --> 01:38:14,158
sophisticated enough to get rid of the

2817
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:17,039
green leaf particles

2818
01:38:14,158 --> 01:38:18,559
you still have the stalks so i would

2819
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:21,118
just like to have varieties where the

2820
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:22,000
heads fall off easy who cares how long

2821
01:38:21,118 --> 01:38:23,679
the stocks are

2822
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,560
that means well i think that was a

2823
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:29,679
question from from david actually

2824
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:30,159
um and i i think oh okay hi david i

2825
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:32,079
think

2826
01:38:30,158 --> 01:38:33,439
i think his idea is coming from he wants

2827
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:33,920
to be able to pick him straight off the

2828
01:38:33,439 --> 01:38:35,678
plant

2829
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,158
and peel it like a grape and just dip it

2830
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:42,158
in his in his in his dab rig

2831
01:38:38,158 --> 01:38:43,759
right yeah

2832
01:38:42,158 --> 01:38:45,039
again it comes down to you know we do

2833
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,960
have some plants that are slightly

2834
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:49,279
larger sizes and marcus

2835
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:50,639
you know richardson who's here knows a

2836
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:51,679
lot about this from the amount of hash

2837
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:54,800
he's made

2838
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:57,359
um but i think probably it comes with

2839
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:58,000
um you know if you get a bigger gland

2840
01:38:57,359 --> 01:39:01,679
you're going to have less

2841
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:06,000
of them per square millimeter right

2842
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:08,158
so um like we said 35

2843
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,359
cannabinoid content if you include oil

2844
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:11,039
content in there

2845
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:13,279
we're looking at upwards of like or not

2846
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:17,279
maybe not upwards but we're approaching

2847
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:19,599
five or forty percent by weight total

2848
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:21,920
of oil of cannabinoids and terpenoids in

2849
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:25,119
a plant that's a lot of oil that's a

2850
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:25,520
that's a pretty oily oily plant and so

2851
01:39:25,118 --> 01:39:28,000
from

2852
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,520
overall from a chemical output that's

2853
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,359
pretty good

2854
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:34,000
yeah you know i would mark was saying

2855
01:39:31,359 --> 01:39:36,559
earlier we're not going to push those uh

2856
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,880
firewalls much farther and there's no

2857
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:40,719
other plant the opium poppy any other

2858
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,600
plant that produces a drug

2859
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:45,279
and such proliferous amounts it's

2860
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:48,400
absolutely incredible

2861
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:48,880
yeah and a lot of botanists don't even

2862
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:52,000
believe

2863
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:54,400
it's possible they think we're all high

2864
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,439
and all the research is weird sometimes

2865
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:58,879
i really wonder

2866
01:39:55,439 --> 01:40:01,839
you know because that's an awful lot of

2867
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:02,319
of a secondary metabolite to get out of

2868
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:05,679
any

2869
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:08,639
any plant it's phenomenal right and

2870
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:09,440
and having said that and thinking about

2871
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,480
the future

2872
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:14,960
of being able to hack the genome and

2873
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:17,519
you know there's a common a common

2874
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:20,399
synthase and olivetolic acid synthase

2875
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:21,119
between cannabis and streptomyces and we

2876
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:23,839
actually

2877
01:40:21,118 --> 01:40:26,238
use streptomyces to produce you know

2878
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:27,039
bleomyosin which is an anti-cancer agent

2879
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:29,599
so

2880
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:31,039
with the right type of funding i mean

2881
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,880
you know

2882
01:40:31,039 --> 01:40:34,560
and and knowledge base i mean seth's

2883
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,079
group is probably

2884
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:38,400
light years ahead on this kind of stuff

2885
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:42,559
but like you could gene edit and

2886
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:44,319
very easily create different molecules

2887
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:46,400
for different reasons in a very

2888
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:50,238
efficient way

2889
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:51,118
right well i know this is a never-ending

2890
01:40:50,238 --> 01:40:52,879
conversation

2891
01:40:51,118 --> 01:40:54,158
it's been pretty incredible uh the

2892
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,079
people in the audience are

2893
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:57,198
all pretty rock star as well and it's

2894
01:40:56,079 --> 01:40:59,519
been great to kind of

2895
01:40:57,198 --> 01:41:00,879
moderate for you guys um we are at that

2896
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,760
point where we're gonna wrap it up and

2897
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,039
leave you guys

2898
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:07,119
um with uh kind of more to think about

2899
01:41:05,039 --> 01:41:08,079
um this is one of many series so we look

2900
01:41:07,118 --> 01:41:10,479
forward to

2901
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:11,279
everyone attending um it will be

2902
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:13,118
recorded

2903
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:14,559
it will be put up on i think youtube and

2904
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:16,880
some other channels so

2905
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:18,560
if you had to leave early or if you want

2906
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,279
to re-watch some things and learn some

2907
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:21,600
stuff

2908
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:22,719
again uh that'll be available and

2909
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:25,039
without further ado

2910
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:26,158
i will um i just want to thank everyone
