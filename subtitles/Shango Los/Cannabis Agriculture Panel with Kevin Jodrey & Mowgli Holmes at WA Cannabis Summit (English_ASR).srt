1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,549
Cindy Cooper when you started

2
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:16,178
how's that

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,320
okay I'm Sidney Cooper I'm with the

4
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:22,890
Washington State Department of

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,670
Agriculture plant detection division

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,439
I've been

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,199
seventy years and before that it was the

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,039
prettiest degree so that's no

9
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,969
understanding of nursery issues and

10
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:40,018
consider many

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:43,289
well I wanted to point out that

12
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:45,210
Washington ranks second information only

13
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,850
behind California production of

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,768
specialty crops and we have a huge

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,870
diversity of the crops that are produced

16
00:00:49,768 --> 00:00:55,140
during the state of over 300 resident

17
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:58,320
great commodities produced by Washington

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,689
growers so there's a lot of agricultural

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,939
research them here of course our

20
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:06,259
universities are

21
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:08,478
College are all primary to supporting

22
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:10,819
these agricultural industries with with

23
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:15,679
research they will assist growers that

24
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:17,929
do the best job direct plans our agency

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,290
specifically does provide money for

26
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,600
research to benefit the nursery industry

27
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,979
through licensing fees all nurseries in

28
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,769
the state of Washington are ardent

29
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:30,640
licensed cannabis growers were exempted

30
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:34,819
from that in the original legislation

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,179
that was put in place we also represent

32
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:40,669
the Department on commodity Commission's

33
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:42,920
these Commission's are primary movers

34
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:46,099
and shakers when it comes to providing

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,689
funding for research for marketing as

36
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:52,609
well but mostly research so one of the

37
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:54,469
things that I think this new

38
00:01:52,609 --> 00:02:03,450
agricultural industry

39
00:01:54,469 --> 00:02:05,519
I hope to see that that just provides

40
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,460
you a funding mechanism for all the

41
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,460
agricultural research that this crowd

42
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:21,420
so that needs to be in place so that

43
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:23,759
when the time comes that federal things

44
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:25,919
change and universities rate we're done

45
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,679
research for cannabis worked really that

46
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,829
this is all in place and we'll have that

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,959
system to fall back on another thing

48
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,380
that her today does is we manage

49
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:40,739
voluntary planting stock certification

50
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:43,109
programs and what that means is most of

51
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:47,509
your large industries in Washington like

52
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:51,090
apples grapes grapes those all have

53
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:52,979
clean planting stock portraitists and be

54
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,110
nervous to plant in America in their

55
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,789
operations something that's a primary

56
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,720
condition of my program

57
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:02,530
so these vines and my apple trees are

58
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,789
produced through a system

59
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:08,620
planting star best management practices

60
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:09,879
these are written rule this is certainly

61
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,270
something that would be applicable

62
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:18,819
applicable to any egg industry or a bank

63
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:20,890
crime so we can provide the best manual

64
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,319
practices around which you can build a

65
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:26,759
system of producing clean virus free

66
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,759
plant material

67
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:35,479
so the proponents of that program are

68
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:39,769
pretty consistent with developing system

69
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:43,379
read isolation from plants

70
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:46,349
you've got testing that can be done

71
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:49,479
your mother your plants that we show

72
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:54,409
that their career viruses and then

73
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:55,219
and reduce losses increase the yield

74
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:59,439
correct

75
00:03:55,219 --> 00:04:02,180
make the more robust market for organic

76
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,009
so pretty simply because three plants is

77
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,159
based on these best management practices

78
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:09,500
and I probably me today a bonus I put

79
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:13,400
together just based on my own experience

80
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:15,620
with nurseries government Rebekah's and

81
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,569
all sorts of different parts of your

82
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,489
growing operation that could be possible

83
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:25,339
so I encourage everyone to come up a bit

84
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:27,918
of a handout today suggested best

85
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:30,019
management practices to exclude pests

86
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:34,569
and diseases in greenhouses and outdoor

87
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:37,719
production facilities the way beyond IPM

88
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:41,269
most growers are a lot of these things

89
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,930
monitor for pests treatment when there's

90
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:47,029
reach but this management practice

91
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,220
systems are endorsed by national

92
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:49,939
organizations like the national plan

93
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,500
board

94
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:52,160
Washington State University other

95
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,480
universe

96
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,340
programs these are well-established in

97
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,640
something that this noodle industry can

98
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:05,379
take advantage of the Henan also has

99
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,399
some links to different that ppm BMP

100
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:10,360
websites you can look at as well

101
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,359
University California

102
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:15,878
the major components of to consider when

103
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:17,788
you're designing a best management plan

104
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,780
for your growing operation are

105
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:21,969
considering all the inputs to that

106
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:24,788
system these are called critical control

107
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,849
points and these would include plants

108
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:30,189
you bring in from outside your operation

109
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:32,500
the soil they're growing medium and

110
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:34,469
putting them in the containers that

111
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,079
you're using making sure those are

112
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,969
sanitized

113
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,470
the watering system the tools you use

114
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:43,259
and aluminum

115
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,870
throughout that operation these are all

116
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:49,800
things that need to be considered as

117
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:52,259
critical control points so starting at

118
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,780
Cleveland's prep unit from clean mother

119
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,930
style and that were tested for viruses

120
00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:00,869
and disease pathogens prior to this and

121
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,100
there is a national system called the

122
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,480
national clean

123
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:08,580
which does a lot of this work for other

124
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:12,960
major commodities and apples great

125
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:15,149
lights Hopkins and so the natural

126
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,120
pigment Network we do

127
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:21,569
resource or information and maybe

128
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,430
eventually producing foundational

129
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:26,129
material for growers to use that's

130
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:32,400
already been tested as noted the virus

131
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:34,469
degree the same think that model the

132
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,079
ability cannabis production but we need

133
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:41,280
research on what are the common viruses

134
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:44,449
where our fire worries and diseases that

135
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,349
are prevalent throughout the system

136
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:48,180
these are not things you can see

137
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,280
necessarily through visual symptoms but

138
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,629
they're still there so they do affect

139
00:06:50,279 --> 00:07:00,679
production so researching in primary two

140
00:06:54,629 --> 00:07:00,680
is going but one thing at one point

141
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,460
one of the NGO basic best mental

142
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:20,889
practices that you use in any of

143
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:24,969
operation would be the use of heinous

144
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:29,918
killer of cabinets steam this name would

145
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:32,670
be awakening all your partisan services

146
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:37,409
and instruments and

147
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:41,520
Oh operation consider here a growing

148
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:44,880
mixed media to the carrier of fungal

149
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:47,399
pathogens that's very possible and so

150
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,959
the use of steroids their customer is

151
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:52,579
growing media might be another very

152
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:55,139
important that's many more practice

153
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,579
staff training making sure that you

154
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,969
educate your workers to recognize

155
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:01,569
disease symptoms and listen pests and to

156
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,850
know what to do about it

157
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:07,149
early detection of courses is critical

158
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:09,160
to solving those problems taking photos

159
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,889
and symptoms and asking experts to ID

160
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,080
them it would be a good way to do it

161
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:17,310
since right now it may be possible you

162
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,310
move plant material to allow that put a

163
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,310
diagnosis

164
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,769
training on staff on best medical

165
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:28,069
practices and sanitation processes

166
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:30,038
writing it down heaven annual that you

167
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:33,708
adhere to

168
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:36,439
producing your plants plus the nurseries

169
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:38,059
do this in other systems around the

170
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,729
country and that found it really helpful

171
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:42,348
to the standardizing their practices and

172
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,070
making sure everybody's doing the same

173
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:46,780
thing

174
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,720
first mechanical transmission of pests

175
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:54,279
by the movement of employees through the

176
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:57,759
last is one major way of spreading

177
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:59,559
disease vectors of insects so making

178
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:03,250
sure that on your staff is working on

179
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:07,449
plants they move from the cleanest area

180
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:10,059
to the area that might be more invested

181
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,360
or something like that so you keep those

182
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,359
clean

183
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:23,778
the engrams include plants when you take

184
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:26,490
material cleaning and sanitizing

185
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:28,409
clothing making sure that the shoes

186
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:32,700
people are wearing are dedicated to that

187
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:34,980
clean environment putting squishy pets

188
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,800
and every door opening that goes to the

189
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,690
outside is her common there's your

190
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,419
practices and growing operation of the

191
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:45,959
12 you despite countless scrubbers as

192
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:49,500
well but I guess the take-home message

193
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:51,719
is that canvas grow with me the same

194
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,169
agriculture support network that is

195
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,759
available to all there any props

196
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:59,599
commodity permission funding for

197
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:02,490
university research standards and grades

198
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,909
clean plantings growing systems and best

199
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,310
management practices

200
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:10,610
resources exist there out there and

201
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:14,649
hopefully in the adopted by so that's

202
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,649
what dirty overseer watch

203
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:26,870
so next we'll have an Enderman and just

204
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:34,820
appeared recently do you see that five

205
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:36,320
minutes it's just about six level thank

206
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,110
you good morning everyone thanks for

207
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,060
coming and thank you to be Lions formed

208
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:44,090
by evening I'm very happy

209
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:52,549
probably here today I want to start out

210
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:54,980
saying I've never grown canvas but just

211
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:57,349
what city was talking about everything

212
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,060
applies I worked at the number of crops

213
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,009
and I you know started in the mid

214
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:04,159
nineteen eighties workings of soils

215
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:09,169
research assistance a cross study or a

216
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:11,759
forestry Duty I moved into forestry IBM

217
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:14,878
which is kind of youth

218
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:18,528
working for Michigan guitar Scotty for

219
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:22,220
Jackpine Butler another pencil issue

220
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:25,828
quickly got involved with agriculture

221
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:28,980
because IP animals huge time there's

222
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:32,638
nobody driving the IPM experience so I

223
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,680
depended nothing about garbage but I

224
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,769
spent some time in actually on the

225
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:41,159
forest and talking to the growers in

226
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:42,810
upstate New York and I was the only one

227
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,958
they interviewed that had any IPM

228
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:52,828
experience so I got hired I learned how

229
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:55,159
to fly from growers agriculture so

230
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:59,099
working on a number of crops of they're

231
00:11:55,159 --> 00:12:02,009
mostly vegetable crops quickly have

232
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,899
gotten to more education doing a

233
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:07,058
master's in Plant Protection that

234
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:09,578
Cornell University and then

235
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:13,658
created crop management specialist and

236
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:17,138
say to me or regional IPO specialist 14

237
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:19,979
County region in southeastern or in the

238
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:25,688
number of crops and then getting into

239
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:31,959
nursery greenhouse sports turf and other

240
00:12:25,688 --> 00:12:35,338
ornamentals so of big array of crops in

241
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,338
any very pest management

242
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:42,340
from there I moved to mission

243
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:47,629
and he kept the IPM thing going is

244
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:51,320
commercial corn soybeans Midwest but

245
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:53,419
then was hired as the project manager

246
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,720
for the long-term ecological research

247
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:59,179
project in world crop agriculture if you

248
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,070
don't know what Ltd are as I suggested

249
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:04,539
live develop into the penis' of programs

250
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:08,830
we want honest estate and it's big

251
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:12,889
Michigan is the largest agricultural

252
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:14,750
ecosystem project give us that sportsman

253
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:20,240
tough to manage that project for ten

254
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:22,970
years and simultaneously work HD looking

255
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,909
at transitioning conventional cropping

256
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:28,279
systems to organic because one of our

257
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:34,539
treatments and the healthy Karos organic

258
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:34,539
system and farmers will show up and say

259
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,078
you know we were trying to maximize our

260
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,509
productivity then our system there

261
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:46,409
basically depends baseline data of an

262
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:50,278
organic system so farmers had all kinds

263
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:53,458
of advice and based on the region and

264
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:56,129
the farmer advice I pitched my idea to

265
00:13:53,458 --> 00:14:00,569
do a PhD in transitional systems looking

266
00:13:56,129 --> 00:14:04,250
at the economics soil dynamics and then

267
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:07,320
weed seed bank transitioning from

268
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:11,100
conventional to organic so those three

269
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:14,100
years you have to be out of you know any

270
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:18,269
prohibited substances in order to be

271
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,670
certified organic and at the time you

272
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:25,379
notice when the lady just came into the

273
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:27,088
USDA or our 2002 a lot of partners

274
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:29,730
thought they had to lose a month or

275
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:32,430
three years in order to transition so I

276
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,500
wanted to look at that using some of the

277
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:38,689
advice of the local growers as to how

278
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,690
best to manage ecosystem

279
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,570
so all that academic stuff you know

280
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:46,209
writing papers and everything best

281
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:47,650
that's all a lot of good but my favorite

282
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,470
thing to do is to work with farmers

283
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:53,139
because I learned from farmers they

284
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:57,940
always have good ideas not afraid to

285
00:14:53,139 --> 00:15:00,309
tell you about and then I learned more

286
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:06,610
from the growers than our view from the

287
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:09,549
books or entire town so after the PhD in

288
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:12,759
Michigan I got a position out here as

289
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:16,179
the NAG faculty or the pastor is no

290
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:18,309
accounting section and we have a number

291
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:21,639
of organic and conventional growers

292
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:24,309
which is different from back of the

293
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,379
class because they really do learn a lot

294
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:32,979
for each other and don't marriage each

295
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:36,750
other there's kind of a bigger hard line

296
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,750
between the Midwest

297
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:42,599
and these things these days up here it's

298
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:44,490
interesting to see how a lot of the

299
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,990
conventional growers live to learn and

300
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:52,320
growers for advice

301
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:53,970
I spent eight years doing that and got

302
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,950
started getting into

303
00:15:53,970 --> 00:16:01,410
so you mentioned the specialty crops we

304
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:03,600
are big specialty crop state and once

305
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:06,209
you guys are federalized you will be

306
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,470
considered a specialty problem there's

307
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:12,930
no question cannabis is especially drunk

308
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:18,420
so I looked for everybody through that

309
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:21,979
program to sort of look at the our

310
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:25,370
compost situation here in the northwest

311
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:29,159
surplus compost all over the place

312
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:33,500
growers who may or may not be composting

313
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:36,569
their own stuff some better than others

314
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:41,730
but not a lot of compost going out on

315
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:44,420
farms so I pitched the idea to this

316
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,620
block programs the double usda's

317
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:51,059
distributes the money but it's federal

318
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:54,389
money from the USDA and I said why don't

319
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:58,109
we take some of the surplus compost and

320
00:16:54,389 --> 00:17:00,330
try to get farmers to spread it we can

321
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,180
do some researches demonstration

322
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:07,140
projects see if we can get that into the

323
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:10,440
ideas so it worked

324
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:13,860
I got money and I got a three-door

325
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:17,660
project going with local mostly so much

326
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:22,969
down to the San Joaquin County growers

327
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:26,070
over $65 participated we had three

328
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,460
really robust studies where we had

329
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:31,589
randomized replicated studies

330
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,329
statistically significant studies but

331
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:34,109
the rest of them were just okay if you

332
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:35,759
want to try it

333
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:40,490
we'll do a side by side demonstration

334
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:45,240
trial and see how it goes in that wall

335
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:47,250
so very successful program the u.s.

336
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,339
composting council invited me to come

337
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:56,159
speak a couple of years in a row about

338
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:59,639
the program and in doing that I was

339
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:03,019
attending a conference in Austin Texas

340
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:08,538
of all places and notice that there was

341
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:12,569
this person doing us doing a program

342
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:17,308
anaerobic digestion scale appropriate

343
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:20,129
for individual donors and he's from

344
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:23,269
Western Washington like I never heard of

345
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:26,669
this guy services much of his talk and

346
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:28,798
it was all pretty much still on the

347
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:31,679
drawing board and had to produce any

348
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,750
units yet but obviously nobody was

349
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,409
talking about a lot of the making happen

350
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:41,220
so I went up to him after the talk test

351
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:44,130
them who he has that staff that knows

352
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,409
how to talk to the fire because he needs

353
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,179
to be working with farms especially in

354
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:51,210
western Washington where there's a lot

355
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:54,480
of direct marketing farmers doing their

356
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:58,679
own marketing processing s

357
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:03,029
where they're not only generating

358
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:07,980
organic waste on site but also use that

359
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:11,639
waste once it's digested for both power

360
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,160
and fertilizer on site so that you have

361
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,660
a scale of every digester and site that

362
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:22,880
basically takes the whole shipping and

363
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,880
evil power of the equation

364
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:31,528
so he said maybe in Camilla

365
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:34,949
and this is where I ended up impact my

366
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:36,720
energy is a startup company here in West

367
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,778
Washington you build these units in

368
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:45,120
Auburn you have half a dozen up running

369
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:50,000
around the sound right now and I believe

370
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,000
that cannabis industry could really

371
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:58,528
benefit from this process I know there's

372
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:02,970
some issues with weights organic waste

373
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:05,069
through the cannabis production process

374
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:10,288
and that I know the rules are very

375
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:14,339
strict the quarantine time maybe could

376
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:17,398
be utilized with a digester you know

377
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:20,849
that's that time spent on site could be

378
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:24,148
digested you can use power to you keep

379
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:28,469
your dryer your greenhouse light your

380
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:31,048
greenhouse and then reclaimed not only

381
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:33,538
the nutrients or fertilizer in your

382
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:37,619
systems but also the water water support

383
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:40,250
we heard earlier of how we save water

384
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:40,250
here

385
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:45,049
with your process that's what saving

386
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,609
waters a big deal human in West

387
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:51,259
Washington he did a lot of it

388
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:53,509
so replanting the water and the

389
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:56,450
nutrients of using an on-site did mythic

390
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:58,789
benefit and you know a shameless plug

391
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,740
for our systems I would love to talk

392
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:03,649
with any growers that are interested

393
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:06,650
we're currently doing on part of trials

394
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:08,630
and the number of crops I am working

395
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:12,200
with one cannabis grower and you said

396
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:17,000
Washington just digesting but I would

397
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,710
love to see how organic waste

398
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,700
you know the floral waste and your

399
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:28,279
foliage waste the the woody stems those

400
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:31,250
get pretty big I mean those are my tree

401
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:34,420
trunks what I've seen that you know we

402
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:37,430
can't throw those in the digester but

403
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:42,920
everything else probably can

404
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:46,640
I am not aware of any studies using

405
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,710
floral canvas waste in Hanover dinosaur

406
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,130
so I'd love to start some of those

407
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:54,670
trials to see what does it do

408
00:21:51,130 --> 00:22:10,430
what is the end product how does it help

409
00:21:54,670 --> 00:22:14,509
does it doesn't enter a digester would

410
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:18,890
like to see possibly work with some of

411
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:22,129
you maybe a collective of you bringing

412
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:25,190
waste through a digester reclaiming the

413
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:29,360
water and some of the fertilizer on the

414
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:33,160
rod so that's why I think I'm here I

415
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:37,609
have a long history of IPM experience

416
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:40,120
and so I can cross a lot of what Cyndi's

417
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:42,959
done in the past and

418
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:42,959
and just here

419
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:59,048
he totally have you like his furniture

420
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:11,808
yeah so under the community important

421
00:23:08,358 --> 00:23:16,428
autopilots bioscience or science and

422
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:18,888
genomics company we study the canvas

423
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:21,879
genome when these sell genetic tests to

424
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:25,478
farmers they help them grow better

425
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:29,928
understand with the Ryan of them develop

426
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:34,069
new with better cannabis right I think

427
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:38,089
part of our our goal from the beginning

428
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:42,979
has been to bring this crop into the

429
00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:45,759
modern agriculture this world just like

430
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:48,679
everyone on this hand is talking about

431
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:52,610
the basic standards and approaches and

432
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:54,320
the science of modern act is just not

433
00:23:52,609 --> 00:24:00,048
then applied to cannabis and there's a

434
00:23:54,319 --> 00:24:04,308
lot of reasons I need to but one thing

435
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:06,139
that has been really cleared up as we go

436
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:09,889
through every process in bringing this

437
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:13,880
industry into the modern world is that

438
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:17,420
when we go and we look at how more

439
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,910
mature industries do things as a model

440
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:25,009
for how they do things in the same

441
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:27,200
industry we find that it's a lot of ways

442
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:30,798
that this industry stone dark ages but

443
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:36,230
we also find that the way that mature in

444
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:38,119
the streets two things really suck so

445
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:42,048
first for generating the testing rules

446
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:44,239
of Ramez decides in work and we wanted

447
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:46,548
to stop people using pesticides which

448
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,179
was a result of bad back offices and

449
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:52,700
sharing clones and understanding good

450
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:55,550
idea practices all of these things that

451
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,259
history of cannabis combined these

452
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:58,819
commercial pressures seven came to mind

453
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:01,849
everyone sees all these message sites

454
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:03,859
and you wanted to figure out a water

455
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:06,980
maybe the very system the test for

456
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:08,839
pesticides so we thought let's look at

457
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,430
the rest back and say how do you be a

458
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:13,669
rated its pesticides we'll just borrow

459
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:15,620
from these contrarian histories but it

460
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,269
turns out that those mature industries

461
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:20,750
that we really died and know how to do

462
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:25,819
things how they said pesticide notes how

463
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:29,720
they said toxicity limits it's just it's

464
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:31,519
terrible like it's not it ends of not

465
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,170
being assistant you wanna compliment we

466
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:37,789
wanted to better than that at the campus

467
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:41,090
industry in general so the same thing is

468
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:43,730
really true for just general economic

469
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:48,169
practices I mean it's there's all this

470
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:50,529
stuff which workers need to learn so bad

471
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:53,800
and there's all kinds of plan

472
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:55,629
and facility in infrastructure

473
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:59,339
environment and impact stuff where the

474
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:03,280
cannabis typical cannabis or it's just

475
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:08,439
decades behind but when we look how long

476
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:11,940
an agriculture has worked the results of

477
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:15,029
all the signs they've applied them just

478
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:18,029
terribly a lot of cases only hope I

479
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:20,250
think our goal as a company is

480
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:27,240
well Spears industry down different

481
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:29,490
paths so for instance right now cannabis

482
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,829
isn't developed as agricultural crop

483
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:35,549
hasn't been to all rivers here as a plan

484
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:37,558
for he had corn and wheat barley every

485
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:40,409
other major cross been through and so

486
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:43,379
it's not adapted to specific latitudes

487
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:45,870
doesn't have harvest optimization trades

488
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,290
doesn't have the basic pesticides in

489
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:52,159
straight-6 front lead every other crop

490
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:54,539
so canvas its closest relative is hops

491
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,730
hops good topic and relativity side

492
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:59,579
canvas does but it allows we notice it's

493
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:02,370
different assistance learners for

494
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:04,649
powdery mildew resistance and we know

495
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:06,989
how to read Rojas it doesn't get went

496
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,519
down at this opinion you know we just

497
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,670
don't know how to do that in Hamilton

498
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:13,349
so at Circo while the scientists are

499
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:17,670
they improve our practices in strength

500
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:19,529
improve the crop itself what's gonna

501
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:22,590
happen if we're not learning about the

502
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:24,599
same weight and thrust magazine so in

503
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:30,808
the court world we used to have 100

504
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:32,519
years ago in 250 varieties : tree and as

505
00:27:30,808 --> 00:27:34,109
big AG companies started to do

506
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,058
progressive breeding and are looking for

507
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:39,599
using the cultivars that are higher

508
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:41,339
yielding the perfectly optimized they

509
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,799
were able to find these incredible

510
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:45,869
varieties and drives them forward green

511
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:49,678
higher and higher yields what they ended

512
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:52,579
up with it we're decently cultivars that

513
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,019
are incredibly highly loaded but

514
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:57,710
paradoxically they've made our food

515
00:27:55,019 --> 00:28:00,230
security situation

516
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:02,390
we didn't protect the existing diversity

517
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,279
that was there before all of that

518
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,320
diversity is gone we're totally

519
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:10,369
dependent on just a small handful of

520
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:12,710
elite varieties that are dependent on

521
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:15,819
increasing amounts of chemical input

522
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,819
even function and

523
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:23,080
those are model doctors they can be

524
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:28,180
wiped out in a second by a single

525
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:30,609
disease so bananas are at risk for that

526
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:34,029
now the Irish potato famine was the

527
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:41,259
result of nationwide planting of 100

528
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:44,190
cultivar so contrary to what the

529
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:47,109
president administration made everything

530
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:49,950
that versity is what makes populations

531
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:49,949
really strong

532
00:28:57,288 --> 00:29:04,308
it's just the same look let's say you

533
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:07,439
can't just have a couple brightest and

534
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:10,769
big ads in and they start doing things

535
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,440
related to do it they would like and

536
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:15,929
they would just grow fields in the

537
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,740
highly optimized mood dream and that's

538
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:21,538
that's not one so one of the things that

539
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,179
that we did Johnson started a nonprofit

540
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:27,109
called open cannabis project I don't

541
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:30,690
work with them directly ignore but I

542
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:33,209
think they have the left here and their

543
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:35,970
goal is to protect all the existing

544
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,669
University because we know that and our

545
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,558
goals are at odds right we want to grow

546
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:41,980
tons of high yielding campus we want to

547
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,889
develop right

548
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,599
rude but we also want to preserve all

549
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,110
the genetic diversity that's out there

550
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:49,750
right now

551
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:51,308
so with all began this project does is

552
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,759
they just collect data from companies

553
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:57,490
the cars that we've been sequencing

554
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:59,679
cannabis genome data from all the world

555
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,210
for four years now and we take all that

556
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,250
need and give it development campus

557
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,200
project they make it public they're

558
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:09,160
collecting data from testing labs and

559
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,740
all that data serves as proof that these

560
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,440
varieties have been in existence because

561
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,419
there's no proof of that the patent

562
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,429
office can see and so it makes it harder

563
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:21,130
for big companies to pass varieties and

564
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:26,320
histories and it would continue to do

565
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:28,390
that Sheriff they take more of an open

566
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,089
source approach to things it's going to

567
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:34,600
be possible for community to protect all

568
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:38,039
the actually very enriching bizarrely

569
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:41,909
complex diversity that exists out there

570
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:44,039
and we do that we'll have that diversity

571
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,900
to draw on for years and years and years

572
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:48,029
and you keep working with the plan

573
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,210
and more interesting we can be reading

574
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:53,490
instead of passive resistance of a

575
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:56,970
sausage at black art keeping if you can

576
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:58,349
walk your plants and we can make these

577
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:01,410
incredible new varieties but what's

578
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:06,409
gonna have this rich background then

579
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:06,410
strong so that's all

580
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,319
before we move on Kevin they're

581
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:21,450
independent technology question asked

582
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:23,240
that we're going to be answering now

583
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:26,100
just take a second

584
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:33,359
so for all of you that are asking about

585
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:39,589
why 5 funny years ago 5 what's up pinky

586
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:43,189
I H G connect

587
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:50,839
password 980

588
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:50,840
8c that I gave you so it's all recipes

589
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:04,940
my name's Kevin Jones thank very much

590
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:06,799
for showing up to a allow me to speak in

591
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:09,110
front of you it's always a pleasure come

592
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,539
to Washington you're exceptional

593
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:13,519
audience to get to work with my

594
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:16,099
background canvas is pretty expensive in

595
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:20,559
terms of you know in a lot of ways try

596
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:23,389
to knock on cans about 41 years and I

597
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:26,869
always as he has child believe we would

598
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:28,700
end up here I knew what some morning

599
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:32,329
that Canada's would become except in a

600
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:35,660
different view and I approached it from

601
00:32:32,329 --> 00:32:37,399
that point of view and so I try to

602
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,900
understand as much as I could about what

603
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,850
I was doing so that I would have a

604
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,470
future I believed at some point I would

605
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:46,490
end up here and I knew that I would have

606
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:49,910
to be allowed skillset to survive so to

607
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:52,970
speak and a lot of money

608
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:55,490
studying cannabis and work again this

609
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:57,710
was trying to just understand primarily

610
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,299
how does one get cannibus to the table

611
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:02,000
which means are we headed to the market

612
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:04,039
and that's really the most important

613
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,619
thing to me because that dictates

614
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:09,079
everything backwards and then we put

615
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:11,179
ethics with it you actually have a

616
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:12,889
really sustainable situation so we use

617
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,340
combine how do we get product to the

618
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,850
table and how do we do it

619
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:20,908
no matter what you have between cannabis

620
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:24,829
is it was held in check for so long that

621
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:27,600
what we did was we created an entire

622
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:30,839
library of genetics that were improperly

623
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:34,379
source what we did all these years is we

624
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:35,939
we chose canvas of the Stealth so we

625
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,820
took away a lot of desirability and

626
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,070
smell and we use all these illegal

627
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:43,859
pesticides and fungicides and PGI

628
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:45,808
explain growth regulators to assist us

629
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:49,288
and what happen over all these years

630
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:52,769
decades is that we created a gene that

631
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:55,019
the week we chose varieties that were

632
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:57,569
Trinity and we bred them to heaven any

633
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:59,069
bottle member and so what you have is

634
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:02,658
you have a syncretic population of

635
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:05,278
cannabis varieties that we use that are

636
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:06,750
inherently prone to all these different

637
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:10,469
pathogenic problems

638
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:13,168
pest problems inherently in certain

639
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:14,819
circumstances exceptionally hungry for

640
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:16,888
exception at night nutrient loads

641
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,050
because everywhere else gave their

642
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:21,919
plants the most fertile soil the best

643
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:23,960
situation and when we select the nests

644
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,480
select his plants that have pride in

645
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,769
perfection I live in their vacuum what I

646
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,269
want to see is a plan that really

647
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:34,460
doesn't this treated in a horrible

648
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:35,838
situation that didn't get better because

649
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,780
that's one that we actually work with

650
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:41,210
and soul I don't know many canvases a

651
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,280
nursery operator I have a farm so I'm

652
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:45,378
kind of herbal so I won't find stuff

653
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,240
going on but I'm not primarily for

654
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:49,279
nursery work and in California I

655
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,789
basically created the modern nursery

656
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,980
model in terms of walking store nursery

657
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:58,009
front it doesn't have a done prior back

658
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:00,170
and I created the nursery model from

659
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,059
dispensaries where the dispensary itself

660
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:04,548
created in stock so the last ten years

661
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:07,910
I've been applying what I learned in the

662
00:35:04,548 --> 00:35:10,789
30 years prior and rather that what we

663
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:14,029
found was that most cultivators are

664
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:16,190
basically praying for success and

665
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:18,440
they're there they're up unfortunately

666
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:20,659
praying in the wrong direction because

667
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,730
what they do is they choose products

668
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:24,409
that are trendy with no consideration

669
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,849
for where they're going to call debated

670
00:35:24,409 --> 00:35:27,500
and with no consideration to the

671
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:31,338
cultivation methodologies or the

672
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:34,010
operators and and no diversity and what

673
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:35,539
happens is that you will use OG pushes

674
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,990
an example just because it's just such

675
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:39,480
an aha moment

676
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:41,608
so everyone wants to grow algae but oh

677
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,380
geez a massive family so depending on

678
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:45,059
what cultivar emoji you get you might

679
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,329
get one that's exceptionally high really

680
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:50,639
prone exceptionally attracts prone and

681
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:52,579
now we have for us in in Brooklyn's that

682
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,838
are everywhere we prefer with us also

683
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:59,098
and the fur layers thick top hasn't

684
00:35:54,838 --> 00:36:01,799
resist and so people use these inferior

685
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:03,180
cultivars and they wonder why they're in

686
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,970
the little craft you thought from the

687
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:08,309
entire time to cultivate and so what we

688
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:11,759
try to do through the normal nursery

689
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:13,829
model was do population sense so I

690
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,410
things I go through large populations of

691
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:19,019
plants and we find the outliers you find

692
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:21,179
plants that have an ability to resist

693
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:24,358
naturally and this is a normal

694
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:26,159
agricultural practice I looking in that

695
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:27,630
I get to do tomorrow kinds of neat

696
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,329
facilities I get to see some really

697
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:33,599
interesting stuff but I had to go and do

698
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:36,150
it for the largest redwood nursery

699
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,010
propagation facility in the world so

700
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,260
Reed I'm is the world's largest record

701
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:42,540
producer they're also the largest event

702
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,160
with nursery I got to talk to their lead

703
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:45,029
grower who's been cultivating there for

704
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:47,009
48 years

705
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,540
he's involved in a reading project that

706
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,790
will take a

707
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:52,309
fifty years and so he carries the first

708
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:54,769
thirty property but he took me out of

709
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:57,500
the into its mother library solicited

710
00:36:54,769 --> 00:37:00,349
which was acres and acres of ice and it

711
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:03,679
was from every thousand eight years of

712
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:05,989
redwoods the biologist selected one as

713
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:08,119
the greatest of 10,000 dangerous people

714
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:10,549
and they brought that in helmand as I

715
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:12,589
got to tour entire farm nothing of trees

716
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,490
but they had been selected from thousand

717
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:17,420
acre lots

718
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:18,739
and what these trees was not and it was

719
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,599
I mean one hundred and eighty percent

720
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:22,699
greater growth than any other rent

721
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:24,769
whatever the ever-important but they

722
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:26,599
were intelligent enough to Navarro Robin

723
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:28,670
they did not want prop that bulb are

724
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,829
what they did is acquitted so many miles

725
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:32,450
from the other plants that work with so

726
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:35,239
that these patches he's forty fifty

727
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:37,669
eight forests of that specific were laid

728
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:39,679
out so they had a diversity so even

729
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,630
though it's within the same family the

730
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:45,589
cultivars have been and it's separated

731
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:47,660
and ferment when it takes my 130 hundred

732
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,220
forty years to do see propagation and so

733
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:52,629
as well miss Briggs was it takes a

734
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:56,329
hundred years before she gets sexy

735
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:58,039
because I thought something that maybe

736
00:37:56,329 --> 00:38:00,199
understand that what we're doing now is

737
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:02,300
we're the very beginning of this where

738
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:06,219
where the foundation of this is

739
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,220
California's only four days

740
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:15,289
thunderation Canada's world in terms of

741
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:19,159
highway approach called our selection

742
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:20,839
how do we approach I most people have no

743
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:23,058
clue that that means it's a it's a rate

744
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:24,920
law pair of hands named because really

745
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:27,109
the most cultivators in Canada said

746
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,930
never been in mainstreaming the recharge

747
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:30,949
for Washington that had startled

748
00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:33,798
investment people for a while now so

749
00:38:30,949 --> 00:38:35,598
that's been very uh I only need to come

750
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:37,190
here for the years that I have because

751
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,289
you can see an integration and a level

752
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,960
that we don't have to have one in

753
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:43,339
California don't want to observe

754
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,380
situation where I get to work with the

755
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:47,960
tremendous number of professors from

756
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,150
universities scientists from private

757
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,548
organizations because they can't touch

758
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:53,930
cannabis it's they can't happen in their

759
00:38:52,548 --> 00:38:55,268
hand so to speak we can't have any

760
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:57,588
school they can have better facilities

761
00:38:55,268 --> 00:39:02,239
so they find guys like me that are

762
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:04,460
willing to play detective and we chase

763
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:06,379
problems so we have cultivars to see

764
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,720
would resist and they come in and

765
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:11,690
analyze and say this lens is virally

766
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:14,808
affecting this one it's not less Rapids

767
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:16,429
won't grow and so once I have happily as

768
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:19,099
you start having this intersection

769
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:21,068
between the science component and the

770
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:22,800
actual add component because it's really

771
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:26,380
radical

772
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,870
sciences is understanding but it's back

773
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:31,510
you've got all the variables constant in

774
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:33,789
order to solve for X you can't do that

775
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:36,100
as a farmer and I have farm - and I've

776
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:40,000
been fired for a really long time and I

777
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:41,920
work in a lab and so it's it's an

778
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,619
attempt to try to understand how does

779
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,829
one as a farmer take the information

780
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:49,809
from normal agricultural practices that

781
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:52,480
I say organically based biologically

782
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:55,360
driven and then apply it to what we do

783
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,480
and actually have some success and

784
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:02,890
you're you're seen you catch up mostly

785
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,400
by all and catch by the question is

786
00:40:02,889 --> 00:40:08,190
where you have a problem

787
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,050
trying to figure out how song and when

788
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:11,190
we have to be able to understand some of

789
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:14,160
the stuff going on aside be more

790
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:16,230
proactive in our approach and like I

791
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,599
said prior for me I like to work on

792
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:21,210
populations what I find is that if I

793
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,219
want to get a good friend he might find

794
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,380
in the movie too you might find it a

795
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:28,199
little better that's worth 200 you might

796
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,940
find a really decent person in 2000 you

797
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:32,189
get 20,000 you can find something

798
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,869
exceptional and that's how I see ken

799
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,639
it's called the bar selection 2 is the

800
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:37,619
population and it's been pretty

801
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:39,509
difficult for us you can learn these

802
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:41,519
black market operations who here so

803
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:44,070
these incredible populations that I work

804
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:46,139
with a highly legal town or not and I've

805
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:48,660
been illegally has a farm operator years

806
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:51,389
but all the R&amp;D all the work all prior

807
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:53,250
stuff that was all that room the desire

808
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:55,559
for people to really bring the cameras

809
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:58,079
where you are really about it willing to

810
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:00,480
take the risk to hunt the product that

811
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,969
was going to work for you whatever your

812
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,190
needs were and that was a nominee so

813
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:06,629
it's fine and if it was from the distal

814
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:09,690
needs and perfect than it is but

815
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:12,000
personally he's that's great but it

816
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:14,039
requires you to be able to have enough

817
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,760
of the ability to understand was that

818
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:19,338
you're seeking and I'm ascertain that

819
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,290
and what we tried to do is we frightened

820
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:23,239
to take these cultivars with these big

821
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:26,239
populations and then my use of

822
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:28,129
milwaukee's technology to map them and

823
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:29,808
what it does it allows people not to be

824
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,490
able to find in that cult apartment we

825
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:34,309
know is exceptionally academically

826
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:36,289
resistant cultivars that we have that

827
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:38,780
are exceptionally prone to problems like

828
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:41,029
home even if they're desirable because

829
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,670
of their they're too risky for

830
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:45,079
cultivators to take a gamble on and so

831
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,990
what happens is you end up having to

832
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:50,750
back down the populations we work with

833
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:53,209
you find specific cultivars the markets

834
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:56,019
trendy but when you chase those trends

835
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:58,730
much a seesaw brightness of accuracy and

836
00:41:56,019 --> 00:42:01,480
what we try to recommend individuals is

837
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:04,400
a diversity in terms of what would be

838
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,740
diverse in terms of resistance so that

839
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,838
we have the greatest chance of survival

840
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:10,759
of a portion of the problem and then we

841
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:13,400
work on diversity in terms of our

842
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,650
velocity how fast those products move

843
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,420
the food system so you have things that

844
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,970
are training it very quickly but there

845
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:23,298
is smaller markets and things that are

846
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:25,699
very stable in the larger markets with

847
00:42:23,298 --> 00:42:26,199
lower price points and so you try to get

848
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:28,329
this

849
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:30,879
we're an intersection of what is the

850
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:32,889
plan that you're trying to work with and

851
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,820
how you get it to function be your

852
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:38,319
weighted unique the final culture is an

853
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,360
important one and we decide to

854
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,030
secessionists or about the banana and so

855
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:45,400
the baby's assistance it was a song that

856
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:47,230
we don't want bananas was because it was

857
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,960
no longer minutes they had a few Sierra

858
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:52,210
Madre that went down all the bananas and

859
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,070
so they find another than in Tikal it's

860
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,110
called Cavendish the Cavendish health

861
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,970
month so they have finished all the part

862
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:59,890
about the country and they introduce it

863
00:42:57,969 --> 00:43:01,809
and what will be hauled it works clear

864
00:42:59,889 --> 00:43:02,619
and it's resistant to Fusarium and

865
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:04,570
everybody's happy

866
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:06,909
well why did that kind of our rarely

867
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:08,410
succeed it wasn't about the resistance

868
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:10,149
as much as he thought it was because it

869
00:43:08,409 --> 00:43:12,759
didn't have to be refrigerated when you

870
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:15,639
move it it can handle 45 to 55 degrees

871
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,110
on movement so it changed economic

872
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:19,269
consideration of that cultivar

873
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:21,370
dramatically it made it to where they

874
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:23,170
cheap in the price of shipping it so

875
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:25,719
that one was a resistant but it's

876
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:28,030
cheaper to move and then just in the

877
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:29,439
last year is another fallen Fusarium

878
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:31,330
that is attacking the Cavendish call

879
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,990
departs so now obviously another one of

880
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:37,230
these banana epidemics

881
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:39,779
and that's why I see with antennas with

882
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:42,389
certain populations that are exceptional

883
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:44,880
you notice when the fuse area came in we

884
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:45,329
noticed when looking out there for a

885
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,670
long time

886
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:49,829
go back on the 15 18 years Mike I went

887
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:52,079
when I first came in and I can be traced

888
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:54,029
back in the Oregon rows for the ropes

889
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,670
runners can kind of see where things

890
00:43:54,030 --> 00:44:00,690
moment but then the growth light that

891
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:02,579
came in for us is like to follow these

892
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:04,500
these issues or relative even with the

893
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:06,838
speed at which statement is incredible

894
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,769
and so it's the same situation where you

895
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,130
know what you're gonna find out

896
00:44:07,769 --> 00:44:12,409
resistance on Mises Academy and so

897
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,880
people try to keep everything as

898
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:16,469
protected as possible all the time in

899
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,150
the production end of it but really

900
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:20,759
there's very little are indeed done in

901
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:23,608
cannabis where they're actually exposing

902
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:27,150
these plants to these issues and detects

903
00:44:23,608 --> 00:44:29,848
them there is some for me I can do it

904
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:30,519
because I own a nursery so my hair's a

905
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:32,860
little different

906
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:36,340
nurseries because of my location of Mon

907
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:39,190
Ami and in English that means I supplied

908
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:42,640
people who produce touch for a long time

909
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:45,099
and so we estimate that the work that

910
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,319
the nursery creates money anywhere

911
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:49,869
between 150 to 200 million dollars a

912
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,180
year in product grown from the cutting

913
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:55,690
so last point years I might be about to

914
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:58,239
be 20 about to canvas on the dating so I

915
00:44:55,690 --> 00:45:00,909
was differently created under really

916
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:03,149
about was myself but my nursery stop

917
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:08,289
created approximately that much talent

918
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:08,920
and it's it's a huge responsibility in

919
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:11,409
your mind

920
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,990
notice and how you maintain this kind of

921
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:16,989
relationship with the farmers and how do

922
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:19,750
you keep people solvent how do you keep

923
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:23,289
the movement father and what we see now

924
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:25,690
is this we got calls from somebody right

925
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:29,590
grab something from some onion known as

926
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:31,929
any day time none and so for us you know

927
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:34,180
in order to make it work the way I do at

928
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:35,889
the tonnage grounds is if he only tree

929
00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:38,559
typically release a cultivar a year

930
00:45:35,889 --> 00:45:41,369
after selection and so what that does is

931
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,139
it lets me take a little plan and I

932
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:44,940
major production movements which is

933
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:47,789
indoor/outdoor a greenhouse in London

934
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,500
and in those four different situations

935
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:51,659
that rattle different impacts on the

936
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:54,530
contrast performance it's on the logical

937
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:57,329
traits its desirability to the marketing

938
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:59,850
and so all of this stuff takes time so

939
00:45:57,329 --> 00:46:02,789
you have a situation we're all operating

940
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:05,789
using stock that we've gathered unless

941
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:08,059
you start to DNA into the beauty of the

942
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:11,250
galaxy and I have no affiliation

943
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:13,469
nothing so it's not pushing about me

944
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:15,090
it's that I use the tool because it lets

945
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:18,169
me get a really clear moment where the

946
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:20,850
bottom words in red the diversities and

947
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:22,289
that way we can start saying listen les

948
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:24,630
diversify what we're working with

949
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:27,000
genetically and then in these things

950
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:30,210
what information we have and how we

951
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,369
start to work with it and whatever trust

952
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:35,190
me do all these ears which just cost

953
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:36,989
some of my friends and the passages we

954
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:41,039
humbly the stress was I was very open

955
00:46:36,989 --> 00:46:41,998
with this I shared that with Shari this

956
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:44,849
information

957
00:46:41,998 --> 00:46:47,608
the bachelorettes gloves better hold the

958
00:46:44,849 --> 00:46:50,099
proprietary put in a situation wealthy

959
00:46:47,608 --> 00:46:51,869
special individuals government the lower

960
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,489
you were ranked in the canvas came to

961
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:54,959
the kinder I was to use this

962
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:56,668
fundamentally that's what makes up the

963
00:46:54,958 --> 00:47:02,398
canvas statement is made up of a pecking

964
00:46:56,668 --> 00:47:03,808
order individuals how he is and to meet

965
00:47:02,398 --> 00:47:04,918
that that's the most important part

966
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:06,209
because that's the human connection

967
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:08,248
that's what allows us have a different

968
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:10,408
it should be mine that's what allows

969
00:47:08,248 --> 00:47:12,208
entities to be unique in the way it is

970
00:47:10,409 --> 00:47:15,209
it allows us to actually create an

971
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:17,668
industry based off our relationship with

972
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:19,288
the planet you'd see very little

973
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,868
relationship with planes whose

974
00:47:19,289 --> 00:47:24,509
relationship we plenty and I'm not aunty

975
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:28,048
business at all but that shouldn't be

976
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:29,338
the driving force all weekends and so so

977
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:32,128
much of the stuff that we're trying to

978
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:35,148
understand is is highly take the

979
00:47:32,128 --> 00:47:39,418
information from very intelligent

980
00:47:35,148 --> 00:47:42,269
scientists researchers nursery operators

981
00:47:39,418 --> 00:47:44,920
who work with regulatory process and

982
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:47,259
and how to apply it to what you do

983
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,480
because that it's applicability to bags

984
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:51,820
if anything you get out and talk to me

985
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,510
it's really Bob back again the prior to

986
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,490
the table

987
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:56,530
everything else is conversation like

988
00:47:54,489 --> 00:47:58,000
that's my main direction and I hope

989
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:00,190
today that we can get into some stuff

990
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,579
about how do we do that so thank you

991
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:02,579
very much

992
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:21,400
this is the way of a big questions your

993
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:25,568
hand and I will come to you and then

994
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,039
will be the master of this portion good

995
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:29,858
morning

996
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:32,859
I just love this report to the 70 years

997
00:48:29,858 --> 00:48:35,528
the paint's were doing this or anything

998
00:48:32,858 --> 00:48:37,690
a standard thing so we've got about 80

999
00:48:35,528 --> 00:48:39,760
minutes death rate is running this firm

1000
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:41,528
and tight and we want to get between

1001
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,990
lunch on time so that we can hear the

1002
00:48:41,528 --> 00:48:47,710
luncheon count we've got 18 minutes

1003
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:50,729
questions however on this is Ray and I

1004
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:54,760
will split the room the prepend up and

1005
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:57,579
we'll Lotus will keep you on deck but we

1006
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:00,849
want questions to be very brief no

1007
00:48:57,579 --> 00:49:04,500
speeches are not going to give up my two

1008
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:04,500
year old important

1009
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:15,210
okay so let's get going any questions

1010
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:19,050
any questions for the panel we've got

1011
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:21,590
two so we'll start with David and Jacob

1012
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:21,590
jingle

1013
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,830
so I guess there's been growers you've

1014
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,420
had issues where they're not able to

1015
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:30,610
track backward has decided to coming

1016
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:32,260
from whether it doesn't positively and

1017
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:34,930
maybe Oregon Washington it might be

1018
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:37,750
pretty annoyed chemicals like adultery

1019
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:39,759
in silicic acid in has decided forever

1020
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:42,010
lasers and I'm doing it especially

1021
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,200
heaviness why is it's not a problem we

1022
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:45,850
see in agriculture why is it significant

1023
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:51,279
cannabis and is there anything being

1024
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:54,789
done to solve it well we do a little bit

1025
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,890
of that but not why is this not a

1026
00:49:54,789 --> 00:50:02,380
problem in the crops general where is it

1027
00:49:56,889 --> 00:50:04,599
it is the department bank does a limited

1028
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,769
amount of has a site testing monitor

1029
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:07,569
crops

1030
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:09,719
you guys are definitely targeted right

1031
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,720
now

1032
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:20,358
but in other crafts we definitely do see

1033
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:20,358
that on occasion and

1034
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:25,259
depending on the regulatory structure on

1035
00:50:23,048 --> 00:50:30,000
that that crowd

1036
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:31,069
this mean crowd to destroy on TV there

1037
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:38,208
was an incident

1038
00:50:31,068 --> 00:50:39,288
features so yeah it does have her hand

1039
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:40,548
well because there's tainted

1040
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:41,959
there's fertilizers that are adding

1041
00:50:40,548 --> 00:50:42,949
these chemicals they're biting and

1042
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:44,149
that's why they're not evil to track

1043
00:50:42,949 --> 00:50:45,769
where they're coming from when they're

1044
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:47,479
doing it back Jackson I find that Oregon

1045
00:50:45,768 --> 00:50:51,689
and Washington about Fred the ins and

1046
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:54,250
products or labels they develop em in

1047
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:56,829
fertilize that maple products legally

1048
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,909
and so that's where the I think we're

1049
00:50:56,829 --> 00:51:00,160
the biggest problem is they're not

1050
00:50:57,909 --> 00:51:01,868
finding it until math because they look

1051
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,509
at oh well there's nothing ones in their

1052
00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:05,579
fertilizer energy and fertilizer is

1053
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:07,569
regulated differently

1054
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:10,568
pesticides are through the ITA doctor

1055
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:13,960
two experts Vic I think it did so much

1056
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:15,699
it is money driven take a little bit

1057
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,619
products as sold at canvas people that's

1058
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:17,798
money may be much more expensive they

1059
00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:19,930
are

1060
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:22,119
I mean when I wish I saw this article

1061
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:24,879
years ago it was about that Cee Cee

1062
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:26,829
specific bacteria as I said that's

1063
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,930
fascinating I said and how can it

1064
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:30,609
possibly targets by itself so I read

1065
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:32,199
researched it I found the company that

1066
00:51:30,608 --> 00:51:34,088
made the drive and then I found the real

1067
00:51:32,199 --> 00:51:35,618
act product which was the same product

1068
00:51:34,088 --> 00:51:36,608
it was five bucks for the container

1069
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:38,890
there's a hundred bucks

1070
00:51:36,608 --> 00:51:41,230
Canada's early enterprise and so the

1071
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:43,239
problem is Candice people can't sue you

1072
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:45,099
really a lot of the cernium to come

1073
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:46,989
after you in court we didn't have the

1074
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:49,240
ability to say listen and you've sold me

1075
00:51:46,989 --> 00:51:51,788
surprised that beacon on the stop when

1076
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:53,618
you can now and I think with the

1077
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:55,900
accountability you'll have to change it

1078
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:57,970
but it's it's we had some people all the

1079
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:00,759
time any product you see that's working

1080
00:51:57,969 --> 00:52:03,489
that well have that stuff checked

1081
00:52:00,759 --> 00:52:06,829
because if there's nothing that knocks

1082
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:09,868
anything back organically but

1083
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:12,269
slows the process it doesn't just wait

1084
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:14,608
out and so anything receive and it's

1085
00:52:12,268 --> 00:52:16,558
moving too well it's too trendy it's too

1086
00:52:14,608 --> 00:52:26,458
pricey we just wait and then it comes up

1087
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:30,839
analyst sales perhaps the clinic posted

1088
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:33,469
in writing okay today also is a young

1089
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:36,509
industry you're all here for a reason

1090
00:52:33,469 --> 00:52:38,389
you can demand better you can do any

1091
00:52:36,509 --> 00:52:41,418
kind of ability that's why I'm here you

1092
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:44,489
vote with your wallet

1093
00:52:41,418 --> 00:52:46,078
thank you my question is you know if

1094
00:52:44,489 --> 00:52:48,809
genetics have been moving around the

1095
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:51,318
world for generations regardless of the

1096
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:54,059
regulation from friend to friend now

1097
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:56,668
we're all of all of us including you in

1098
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:59,789
the room are working together to create

1099
00:52:56,668 --> 00:53:03,719
strains that are more pathogen resistant

1100
00:52:59,789 --> 00:53:05,399
and better eeling but we also are so

1101
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:07,039
luminous on the international level my

1102
00:53:05,398 --> 00:53:11,038
question for you is what do you see

1103
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:14,099
evolving and that's allowing us to all

1104
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:17,130
these new happen to pathogen resistant

1105
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:18,568
strains beyond the regulations that for

1106
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:20,999
example don't allow us to ship them

1107
00:53:18,568 --> 00:53:22,679
across state lines we ran into that a

1108
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:24,808
lot with developing the labs I'm sure

1109
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:27,088
that we're running into that now working

1110
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:29,039
with agricultural experts all over the

1111
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:32,188
world that can't touch each other's back

1112
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:34,829
Bobby will they be able to share the

1113
00:53:32,188 --> 00:53:37,288
data we're just coming maybe on the

1114
00:53:34,829 --> 00:53:38,969
share the data and so ultimately we're

1115
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:40,349
talking about plant breeding at the

1116
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:43,269
moderate level it's going to be all

1117
00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:45,640
market assisted and so be able

1118
00:53:43,268 --> 00:53:47,438
the scientists say this is what we

1119
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,998
looked for this is what we search I may

1120
00:53:47,438 --> 00:53:49,478
be able to search out those cultivars

1121
00:53:48,998 --> 00:53:50,858
too

1122
00:53:49,478 --> 00:53:52,448
because ultimately you don't want the

1123
00:53:50,858 --> 00:53:53,978
same cultivar every part of the United

1124
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:55,959
States because it's really not meant for

1125
00:53:53,978 --> 00:53:58,718
it it's it's shooting the geographical

1126
00:53:55,958 --> 00:54:01,389
zones so this way here you're optimizing

1127
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:02,708
an actual situation are made into as a

1128
00:54:01,389 --> 00:54:04,478
vacuum we can do whatever you wanted of

1129
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:06,578
everywhere you go in the world but

1130
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:08,739
that's the most expensive form of

1131
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:11,798
production and for a lot of individuals

1132
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:14,409
I'll go over this pretty accurate in

1133
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:16,929
terms of probability but it's going to

1134
00:54:14,409 --> 00:54:19,479
be specific for your location so you can

1135
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:21,068
share the information in the data but

1136
00:54:19,478 --> 00:54:23,259
ultimately you better have to do another

1137
00:54:21,068 --> 00:54:25,088
sifting process you get the cultivar

1138
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:29,648
working the dampness of coastal

1139
00:54:25,088 --> 00:54:32,199
Washington versus the interior dry so

1140
00:54:29,648 --> 00:54:33,699
even a little bit get across where you

1141
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:34,568
can ship them in whatever you want off

1142
00:54:33,699 --> 00:54:36,519
it goes that way

1143
00:54:34,568 --> 00:54:39,068
now you'll use the knowledge you get

1144
00:54:36,518 --> 00:54:41,768
genetic markers to do a localized

1145
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:43,559
breeding program and do it faster this

1146
00:54:41,768 --> 00:54:47,250
way

1147
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:49,710
I will say though that in the United

1148
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:51,409
States every breeding program has to be

1149
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:53,699
in every market you have to develop

1150
00:54:51,409 --> 00:54:56,299
plants that are specific to that market

1151
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:58,919
and start with genetic material network

1152
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:00,960
in the rest of the country is becoming a

1153
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,700
global industry by half a dozen

1154
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,289
countries have an export import rights

1155
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:10,439
now so this sort of global cultivar

1156
00:55:07,289 --> 00:55:15,210
bonus is going to happen you know the

1157
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:17,309
u.s. is gonna fall behind eventually

1158
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:20,130
hopefully there will be

1159
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:22,838
the National German lasa depository

1160
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:25,849
system for events

1161
00:55:22,838 --> 00:55:27,949
keeping the genetics in one place it's

1162
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:31,400
open publicly for three years and

1163
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:35,750
researchers to use and we have our next

1164
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:37,309
question hi my question is for Kevin you

1165
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,900
seem to be hitting the nail on the head

1166
00:55:37,309 --> 00:55:41,239
with a lot of the questions and concerns

1167
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,250
that I have you have a lot of

1168
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:47,868
information about strains that work well

1169
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:49,400
outdoor light deck greenhouse and are

1170
00:55:47,869 --> 00:55:51,140
you connected with anybody here in

1171
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,180
Washington where we could get this

1172
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:56,569
information and it all into your strains

1173
00:55:53,179 --> 00:55:58,250
or do you share this general knowledge

1174
00:55:56,570 --> 00:56:00,650
of certain strains so that it could help

1175
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:02,980
out the growers in Washington you can

1176
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:05,720
reach me direct I mean I'm pretty easy

1177
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:07,250
accessible okay and I'm talking about

1178
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:08,419
reaching attracted by the rock I'm just

1179
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:10,880
saying are pretty accessible to talk

1180
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:13,159
about products yet this year the

1181
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:16,039
information otherwise would collapse as

1182
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:17,750
a as a culture my left hand is so much

1183
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:20,329
because it's all these small individuals

1184
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:22,130
have made it up and I'm not against

1185
00:56:20,329 --> 00:56:24,529
corporations it's just how America's

1186
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:27,710
grown but I'm definitely against taking

1187
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:30,470
over an industry and at the hands of you

1188
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:31,298
and so for me I try to share as much as

1189
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:33,278
I can

1190
00:56:31,298 --> 00:56:35,318
it is many products in the market as

1191
00:56:33,278 --> 00:56:37,119
possible I can't share genetics in those

1192
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:38,858
states that's illegal but the

1193
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,689
information is definitely available so

1194
00:56:38,858 --> 00:56:42,548
you can check me out so you can see me

1195
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:43,958
after the thing about getting email and

1196
00:56:42,548 --> 00:56:46,148
then you can we can chop it up about

1197
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:47,528
what is it you're trying to do what you

1198
00:56:46,148 --> 00:56:49,389
struggling with and then we'll take a

1199
00:56:47,528 --> 00:56:50,978
look at what your market is because the

1200
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:52,868
market determines where you're going to

1201
00:56:50,978 --> 00:56:54,818
put this Drive so you can't just grow

1202
00:56:52,869 --> 00:56:56,949
stuff that you want or you can infuse

1203
00:56:54,818 --> 00:56:58,630
with that you have to grow things that

1204
00:56:56,949 --> 00:57:00,369
the market wants with a lot it's pretty

1205
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:02,199
big and you have to be able to take a

1206
00:57:00,369 --> 00:57:05,919
look at that market that from the neck

1207
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:07,719
down what works in your specific and so

1208
00:57:05,918 --> 00:57:10,358
much it is trying to find other farmers

1209
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:12,068
around use a similar geographical

1210
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:16,598
situations environmental conditions

1211
00:57:12,068 --> 00:57:18,639
cultivation sameness and then you'll be

1212
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,439
able working groups I'm lucky in the

1213
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:22,148
sense that I have to provide genetics to

1214
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:26,288
the state of California which is massive

1215
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:28,239
and it lets me work with hund thousands

1216
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:30,369
of people over these years about how to

1217
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:32,380
perform for you in those locations and

1218
00:57:30,369 --> 00:57:34,449
what happened it wasn't resistant with

1219
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,220
their problems and then we can start to

1220
00:57:34,449 --> 00:57:37,409
take a look

1221
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:39,329
hey this cultivar that was selected for

1222
00:57:37,409 --> 00:57:41,730
that shines here but does not do well

1223
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:43,409
there and it would allow you to get that

1224
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:45,929
information so yeah it's all it's all

1225
00:57:43,409 --> 00:57:48,269
there you won't build this situation

1226
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:50,848
with your friends you have to team up

1227
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:53,070
you cannot be a solo producer I love

1228
00:57:50,849 --> 00:58:06,359
whatever practice for Riot ory and CEO

1229
00:57:53,070 --> 00:58:08,070
the two words it for somebody down the

1230
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:11,309
street and now you're claiming it's

1231
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:14,250
yours it's not what you want to be able

1232
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:17,309
to do is work in conjunction and and the

1233
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:20,039
combined brainpower of many farmers is

1234
00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:22,320
really driven agricultural forward for

1235
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:24,559
millennia and now science is painted

1236
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:26,789
over and creates the situation where

1237
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,130
there's only certain things that can

1238
00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:31,259
enter the market because they have

1239
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:32,970
engineered resistance but at that level

1240
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:35,580
right now we're still in the level of

1241
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:37,739
back to the table and you have to really

1242
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:38,069
use conventional farming technology to

1243
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:39,868
do it

1244
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:43,260
and so to me sharing the information

1245
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:45,780
with your friends maybe the jackets

1246
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:47,369
available everyone thinks that if I give

1247
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,930
you this clone sort of take away my

1248
00:58:47,369 --> 00:58:51,240
whole world - well if your market is

1249
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:53,848
that small I've got your really a bubble

1250
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:55,549
on itself and so you have to be able to

1251
00:58:53,849 --> 00:58:57,200
just you know see it like that

1252
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:58,310
and be careful who you work with because

1253
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:00,879
otherwise you're not gonna get the

1254
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:03,320
native act but for someone who's a

1255
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,519
farmer who's trying to produce cannabis

1256
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,860
who wants to understand how to use

1257
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:10,039
varieties and these families you team up

1258
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:12,590
a lot of collaboration of I will see

1259
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:12,800
there's any other way otherwise come by

1260
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,990
me

1261
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,940
we are a massive Purdue so there is no

1262
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:22,549
brain there's no brain in Washington

1263
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:24,530
around 7 billion dollar operation and he

1264
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:27,260
gave me the lecture on this he was a CEO

1265
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:29,030
of 7 billion dollar of the stereo show

1266
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:31,400
and he said Cathy doesn't none of you

1267
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:34,310
were brand he said in the car brand is

1268
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:36,530
you can be in 44,000 stores at once and

1269
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:39,469
within 24 hours you could be stopped on

1270
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:42,140
because none of you guys are brands you

1271
00:59:39,469 --> 00:59:44,269
must work collectively to form regional

1272
00:59:42,139 --> 00:59:45,949
brands and then eventually over time

1273
00:59:44,269 --> 00:59:49,099
those things will become large

1274
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:52,789
powerhouse crimes but in the intro you

1275
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:54,529
must work together and canvas especially

1276
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:56,509
when we are humble I thought I was at

1277
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:58,850
fight those where everybody was a little

1278
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:02,570
mini king running her little bitty world

1279
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:04,429
and don't be one to buy anything but not

1280
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:08,320
the money's drained out of the system

1281
01:00:04,429 --> 01:00:08,319
people are a lot more willing to work

1282
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:16,250
your priorities somebody's good it's

1283
01:00:14,179 --> 01:00:19,368
humbling it's fun to stand to work

1284
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:21,199
together and you have to be able to team

1285
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:22,970
up in that in that respect and everyone

1286
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:24,679
believes if they're so smart or so big

1287
01:00:22,969 --> 01:00:25,819
and I think all these guys the giant had

1288
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:27,828
farmers and they're gonna revolutionize

1289
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:29,420
the kingdom and they get buried alive

1290
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:31,460
because again this is a speciality

1291
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:33,889
cultivar and so they have to go through

1292
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:36,559
this process to learn and understand too

1293
01:00:33,889 --> 01:00:38,809
and so there is no cheong advantage

1294
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,400
right now except in terms of scope and

1295
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:42,199
scale and and efficiency of production

1296
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,970
but in terms of knowledge of the

1297
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:46,009
cultivar I work with the product and

1298
01:00:43,969 --> 01:00:47,719
understanding how to work together we

1299
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:49,339
can build that we really have this

1300
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:51,949
opportunity can we have our next

1301
01:00:49,338 --> 01:00:54,529
question thank you for being here

1302
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:57,739
as you know LCB adopted that pesticide

1303
01:00:54,530 --> 01:01:01,280
action levels at where every 1455 108 in

1304
01:00:57,739 --> 01:01:02,659
August there 59 analyzed as you know and

1305
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,130
that everything else in the world is

1306
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,969
subject to at point one Hertz per

1307
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:07,250
million threshold

1308
01:01:04,969 --> 01:01:10,129
I wonder anything bill about the correct

1309
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:13,480
list of analytes or the wax should

1310
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:13,480
undergo event into the future

1311
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:19,539
well like any good rules that have to be

1312
01:01:17,369 --> 01:01:21,969
enough

1313
01:01:19,539 --> 01:01:23,500
so as far as if that was the right

1314
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:25,949
approach or not I know there's varying

1315
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:29,010
opinions within our agency about that

1316
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:31,858
but it is what we have right now

1317
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:32,350
it's a start I think that's going to

1318
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:34,279
have to

1319
01:01:32,349 --> 01:01:37,670
[Music]

1320
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:41,780
cusp and that US will be really changing

1321
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:45,380
not stuffing about but you know just

1322
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:47,570
this year our department put forward to

1323
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:49,730
EPA some federal labeling for four

1324
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:52,119
different products personals were denied

1325
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:54,750
but we are trying to move forward with

1326
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:59,039
any more products and worked

1327
01:01:54,750 --> 01:02:02,280
our growers best estate

1328
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:04,500
okay our next question is here thank you

1329
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:07,950
for all that you do at providing such

1330
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:10,139
great leadership state I have two

1331
01:02:07,949 --> 01:02:15,210
questions

1332
01:02:10,139 --> 01:02:17,730
was here from Bellingham why do we can

1333
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:20,730
get a quick update on what is happening

1334
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:26,030
with the Washington City

1335
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:26,030
and also a postive are important CBD oil

1336
01:02:30,048 --> 01:02:35,909
I really didn't compare come here

1337
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:38,969
prepared to incidents you know it is

1338
01:02:35,909 --> 01:02:42,058
pretty specific to my program but I will

1339
01:02:38,969 --> 01:02:44,039
not tell you that partner day is forming

1340
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:46,559
a new position for cannabis coordinator

1341
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:48,299
so within the next few months there will

1342
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,298
be someone you can call with all those

1343
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:55,030
kinds of questions a one-stop-shop

1344
01:02:50,298 --> 01:02:59,199
certain person and will will be able to

1345
01:02:55,030 --> 01:03:02,560
I think the reason people on the policy

1346
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:05,009
panel who will have some of those extra

1347
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,009
session

1348
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:12,979
okay next question from Sean hi Sean

1349
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:15,229
from Washington by the company this is a

1350
01:03:12,978 --> 01:03:16,998
question for Mowgli because over three

1351
01:03:15,228 --> 01:03:19,848
years ago you guys came through our

1352
01:03:16,998 --> 01:03:21,978
apartment and got some samples and we're

1353
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:24,259
on galaxy and I think it's just such a

1354
01:03:21,978 --> 01:03:26,989
cool site and I noticed that you've

1355
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:29,239
changed it recently and groupings have

1356
01:03:26,989 --> 01:03:32,239
gotten kind of tighter and you know

1357
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:35,749
oftentimes planets that share some

1358
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:38,028
similar genetics so I guess I have two

1359
01:03:35,748 --> 01:03:40,248
questions ways those similarities did

1360
01:03:38,028 --> 01:03:42,949
they also the similarities in to repeat

1361
01:03:40,248 --> 01:03:45,649
profiles do you know and second question

1362
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:47,478
is because these tight groupings and all

1363
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:49,608
these goofy names that we have for the

1364
01:03:47,478 --> 01:03:52,068
thousands of different I think you know

1365
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:55,219
canvas do you see in the future us

1366
01:03:52,068 --> 01:03:58,429
installment consolidating you know say

1367
01:03:55,219 --> 01:04:00,469
the cushions down to a few names and

1368
01:03:58,429 --> 01:04:05,899
that you know the different the

1369
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:07,608
different death groupies yeah so so the

1370
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,900
galaxy for those of you who haven't seen

1371
01:04:07,608 --> 01:04:10,548
it just interacted with

1372
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,469
three-dimensional map of all the

1373
01:04:10,548 --> 01:04:14,900
different canvas varieties of

1374
01:04:12,469 --> 01:04:17,088
achievements and they're just position

1375
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:20,259
and there was a lot mostly related to

1376
01:04:17,088 --> 01:04:20,259
each other so is

1377
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:26,519
and the last version of the galaxy we

1378
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:29,369
did we took all the all the varieties

1379
01:04:26,519 --> 01:04:31,199
tables clones of each other and we

1380
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:33,000
collapse them into heaps bigger clusters

1381
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:34,829
and if you click on that you can see all

1382
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,820
the all the cuts that are in there and

1383
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:41,460
you know you see exactly what you would

1384
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:43,559
expect that we get you know within one

1385
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:46,889
formal cluster there's tons of your

1386
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:49,380
names and you can usually tell most of

1387
01:04:46,889 --> 01:04:50,809
the names are the same or similar but

1388
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:54,300
then there's lots of stuff that's just

1389
01:04:50,809 --> 01:04:56,730
totally missed name and you'll see stuff

1390
01:04:54,300 --> 01:05:00,330
you know with the same name very far

1391
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:04,369
away so it's sort of a catalog with

1392
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:04,369
errors if you're looking at the names

1393
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:11,519
but it is evolving towards being cleaner

1394
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:14,650
and more accurate so people are logging

1395
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:18,409
in changing the names and they need

1396
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:20,030
and it's sort of cleaning itself up and

1397
01:05:18,409 --> 01:05:21,769
as we get more and more data more things

1398
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:26,119
are sort of coalescing into those coal

1399
01:05:21,769 --> 01:05:28,369
clusters the og cush cluster is

1400
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:31,160
complicated right Nick there's there's a

1401
01:05:28,369 --> 01:05:33,440
lot that Kevin said there's a lot of G's

1402
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:37,250
and so there's kind of a few different

1403
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:42,010
bingo G clusters and you know that

1404
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:45,550
answer the question which one was first

1405
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:47,869
that's not a scientific question that

1406
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:50,510
one of the clusters is bigger than all

1407
01:05:47,869 --> 01:05:51,619
the other clusters you know but you have

1408
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:52,790
to kind of look at the family

1409
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:55,460
relationships and see where they came

1410
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:59,029
from and see who submitted them to to

1411
01:05:55,460 --> 01:06:01,490
figure it out but thank you by the way

1412
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:03,080
for those samples so four years ago when

1413
01:06:01,489 --> 01:06:04,839
we started this whole project I took a

1414
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:06,889
drive through Washington State

1415
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:09,108
collecting samples and a lot of the

1416
01:06:06,889 --> 01:06:10,639
people that I collected this that first

1417
01:06:09,108 --> 01:06:15,019
batch of samples from right in the room

1418
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:20,829
here and then at 2:30 in the morning I

1419
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:20,829
was driving back to Oregon my car

1420
01:06:22,429 --> 01:06:29,808
and that fresh news and they were really

1421
01:06:25,179 --> 01:06:32,980
they really smell amazing and I got

1422
01:06:29,809 --> 01:06:35,750
pulled over by a cop and she and this is

1423
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:38,619
Washington it just become the hoses

1424
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:44,480
anyway so she set her head in part said

1425
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:47,890
sir how much marijuana in smoking I'm a

1426
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,889
scientist I swear to God

1427
01:06:54,670 --> 01:07:01,789
check that she left and she gave actions

1428
01:06:56,929 --> 01:07:02,509
they are to see this energy Shirley

1429
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:05,119
exactly

1430
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:08,869
this isn't been dry and meat like these

1431
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:12,680
are just fresh flowers very plastic back

1432
01:07:08,869 --> 01:07:15,349
there how would you smoke then couldn't

1433
01:07:12,679 --> 01:07:17,269
smoke it I just overall the samples is

1434
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:19,760
standing over there on the side of the

1435
01:07:17,269 --> 01:07:31,429
room talking about the internet expert

1436
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:35,990
like Paul's 25 minutes go anyway and and

1437
01:07:31,429 --> 01:07:40,069
I remember I was thinking is this whole

1438
01:07:35,989 --> 01:07:42,259
new world all these new loves are just

1439
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:44,630
wrecking your head you know all this

1440
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:46,820
stuff is to do that and she was like now

1441
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:49,910
you know this is Washington State we

1442
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:51,920
could roll in it and also like we don't

1443
01:07:49,909 --> 01:07:54,289
really care about the way your car

1444
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,519
smells like we're going to look you in

1445
01:07:54,289 --> 01:07:57,139
the eyes and we're going to see you

1446
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:59,630
should be on the road or not and you

1447
01:07:57,139 --> 01:08:02,358
seem to be driving towards she let me go

1448
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:06,010
outside I was felt like Washington is

1449
01:08:02,358 --> 01:08:06,009
certainly a good

1450
01:08:12,349 --> 01:08:18,068
before each other at each other the next

1451
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:20,750
question can you stir profiles tomorrow

1452
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:26,870
you can't do that should I care about

1453
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:29,539
your actual question so much R&amp;D for

1454
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:32,059
other companies on inputs and then I run

1455
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:34,220
all the tests afterwards to see these

1456
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:37,640
things and so I just did video on this

1457
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:39,500
because it's so fascinating that you

1458
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,900
couldn't this you could not tell the

1459
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:43,489
human could not tell which samples came

1460
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:47,210
out of those two bags but one of them

1461
01:08:43,489 --> 01:08:48,920
was very high alpha beta ie0 campaign

1462
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:51,439
and the other varietal was high you

1463
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:53,630
can't be no alpha made of money so

1464
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:55,809
therefore one of them is right one

1465
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:58,520
that's not right now they're all right

1466
01:08:55,810 --> 01:09:00,980
what people believe is that when you add

1467
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:02,750
input you just increase the terms it's

1468
01:09:00,979 --> 01:09:07,009
like it's all going to move linearly it

1469
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:08,989
doesn't think they it's complex and you

1470
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:12,319
can have bacteria that converts turkeys

1471
01:09:08,989 --> 01:09:14,838
and other beings you can have all these

1472
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:16,970
enzymatic conversions that make smell

1473
01:09:14,838 --> 01:09:19,760
fear and so when you're looking at that

1474
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:22,069
from that point of view it's move it's

1475
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:24,409
dutiful like the way it smells

1476
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:28,490
ultimately the big numbers are nice on

1477
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:30,260
the display board at the store but the

1478
01:09:28,489 --> 01:09:33,219
bottom line is trying to eat turkeys

1479
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:34,810
tomorrow right exceptionally inaccurate

1480
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:36,760
and we try to do this for a while and

1481
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:39,670
highly favored like that's what the DNA

1482
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:41,350
comes in and then it prints it now

1483
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:44,770
you're gonna have more watch the changes

1484
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:47,230
from in subtle shifts and what things do

1485
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:50,080
but on a gene level the same but terms

1486
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:51,429
all over the place and you don't know

1487
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:53,529
the difference that's what blew my mind

1488
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:56,470
was on comparing these these tests

1489
01:09:53,529 --> 01:09:59,229
preparedness bizarre indeed and no one

1490
01:09:56,470 --> 01:10:01,030
in my circle they're all career guys we

1491
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:03,879
know Candace pretty well you could not

1492
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:05,949
differentiate which one is wrong but one

1493
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,470
of them very high I mean you know when I

1494
01:10:05,949 --> 01:10:11,319
encamped me really know some say in

1495
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:13,630
terms of camping and writings but the

1496
01:10:11,319 --> 01:10:16,299
exact same training just two different

1497
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:19,029
inputs so you know you have harm could

1498
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:21,039
what you'll find is that for you you're

1499
01:10:19,029 --> 01:10:24,880
trying to find out what creates the most

1500
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:28,000
distinctive desirable impact on a

1501
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:29,710
customer and that's working with your

1502
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,260
inputs and you're going to discover what

1503
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:33,880
you use on your farm drives in the

1504
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:36,130
direction you want and that's what you

1505
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:37,960
care about but otherwise what the

1506
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:39,609
turkeys signature is oh my god is so

1507
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,829
variable is no word for it and I think

1508
01:10:39,609 --> 01:10:43,159
it's so complex that people are trying

1509
01:10:41,829 --> 01:10:48,180
to dumb it down

1510
01:10:43,159 --> 01:10:51,720
it's too big also so you know so the

1511
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:53,670
galaxy right now is just genetic that's

1512
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:55,020
all so eventually we're all in Turkey

1513
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:58,670
and something that you'd be able to see

1514
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:58,670
that over they not realize it yet but

1515
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:04,139
there's no question that genetics is

1516
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:05,880
just a piece of the puzzle it's you know

1517
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:07,260
it's the only way to make sense of your

1518
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:10,890
David you know what like you actually

1519
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:14,789
have but all art comes in after that and

1520
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:16,440
so there's a group called the grow-op

1521
01:11:14,789 --> 01:11:18,479
now they're taking genetically

1522
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,769
identified samples and we're sequencing

1523
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:23,609
them and they're giving them to

1524
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:25,910
different robbers to see who can get the

1525
01:11:23,609 --> 01:11:28,139
best out of them and people can keep one

1526
01:11:25,909 --> 01:11:30,920
genetically defined plan and push it in

1527
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:33,450
all kinds of directions so we have this

1528
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:35,760
organic canvas Cup in or in called

1529
01:11:33,449 --> 01:11:37,170
cultivation classic and we sequence all

1530
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,310
the winners and we give the prizes the

1531
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:41,670
way we show them where they are on the

1532
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:45,539
galaxy and I always have to stand up

1533
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:49,079
there and say you know this amazing

1534
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:50,279
plant one it's called a koala camel

1535
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:54,210
whatever I'm sorry I have to tell you

1536
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:58,399
it's just green hi it's a great plant

1537
01:11:54,210 --> 01:12:00,510
and then last year the outdoor CBD

1538
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:04,379
competition was won by the State Farm

1539
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:09,680
Buena for this plan called Corazon and I

1540
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:09,680
had to get up and say it's just a CDC

1541
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:14,269
put the feet all day and if you click on

1542
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:17,630
these you see cluster now the LC you see

1543
01:12:14,270 --> 01:13:09,080
this corazón they kept the name right

1544
01:12:17,630 --> 01:13:11,840
because they over so so we already would

1545
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:14,510
like to make that money is here and they

1546
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,760
are happening our kinetics and we're not

1547
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:20,619
able to grow the strength we've known

1548
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:24,140
for decades right so my question is

1549
01:13:20,619 --> 01:13:26,689
where are we what's the solution to that

1550
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:30,520
problem and is that compounding and

1551
01:13:26,689 --> 01:13:30,519
getting worse or is there

1552
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:44,319
yes all that stuff is happening there's

1553
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:46,420
a glimmer of hope I think that we have

1554
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:49,750
this project and making need a public

1555
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:51,489
about West are out there now is the only

1556
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:56,050
smart thing that we've come up with to

1557
01:13:51,489 --> 01:13:58,840
do about it though bananas partridges

1558
01:13:56,050 --> 01:14:01,119
recently plugged into the open-source

1559
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,300
software community who've been through

1560
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:08,050
the pack Wars for twenty years and they

1561
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:09,550
have a lot of wisdom about how to keep

1562
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:13,600
things out of that world and how to

1563
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:16,570
fight back against that system and so

1564
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:23,410
there's a lot that can be done but yeah

1565
01:14:16,569 --> 01:14:25,269
use your hands we should be able to stop

1566
01:14:23,409 --> 01:14:28,210
them from Chris Turney anything that is

1567
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:30,370
out there now we do this right it will

1568
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:32,909
be very hard to stop them from Western

1569
01:14:30,369 --> 01:14:32,909
computers

1570
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:41,740
question I women skirt from my curious

1571
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:48,460
crow I I have a question about rusted

1572
01:14:41,739 --> 01:14:50,590
mites I have some poop out of your mouth

1573
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:53,470
work and we just started notice the

1574
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:56,350
quest with my tongue two years ago and

1575
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:57,640
all sorts of different stories that you

1576
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:59,590
know that dish with the Department of

1577
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:02,110
Transportation at least on the side

1578
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:05,020
roads into weeds and they spread the

1579
01:15:02,109 --> 01:15:06,670
marijuana but all of those are there too

1580
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:10,450
many pesky little bastards in their

1581
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:12,699
difficulty arezzo and you know I would

1582
01:15:10,449 --> 01:15:16,449
fluorinated last year and it was almost

1583
01:15:12,699 --> 01:15:19,689
impossible creator and completely edible

1584
01:15:16,449 --> 01:15:22,420
insects and so what do you have any

1585
01:15:19,689 --> 01:15:24,299
suggestions for that you know I know

1586
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:26,980
what a lot of it has to do with you know

1587
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:29,590
space where they're multiple guards

1588
01:15:26,979 --> 01:15:32,349
around me and so if I'm doing you know

1589
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:34,180
organic pest management my my neighbor's

1590
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:36,010
not with me anything that's gonna be

1591
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:39,220
impossible for me to take care of my

1592
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:42,250
past but I was just wanting to get any

1593
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:45,670
suggestions - it's a possibility

1594
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:47,408
yeah well it's up to any other technical

1595
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:51,328
commodity

1596
01:15:47,408 --> 01:15:56,018
the definite pesky pests of all pests

1597
01:15:51,328 --> 01:15:58,719
and this year an outdoor girl so you

1598
01:15:56,019 --> 01:16:01,780
know the first thing would be making

1599
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:03,220
sure that he dusts down

1600
01:16:01,779 --> 01:16:05,559
facility on the roads around the

1601
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:11,970
facility because destiny is how might

1602
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:14,560
spread orchards and vineyards itself and

1603
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:17,800
sanitation is going to be your best

1604
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,900
friend because if you can after you

1605
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:22,119
cleaned out a crop you can go through

1606
01:16:19,899 --> 01:16:25,449
and speaking everything

1607
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:29,309
guys would be in every craft makes of me

1608
01:16:25,449 --> 01:16:29,309
everywhere annual bills

1609
01:16:30,649 --> 01:16:36,769
I think so I know not unless they did

1610
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:38,690
maybe they do apply with a product that

1611
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:41,449
we think you apply the week I was asked

1612
01:16:38,689 --> 01:16:43,368
by a reporter and I had talked to the

1613
01:16:41,448 --> 01:16:45,259
economy they use them before start this

1614
01:16:43,368 --> 01:16:47,420
whole the face of control they pioneer

1615
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:49,039
that in Canada so in homo economy they

1616
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:50,600
probably wiped out on a billion dollars

1617
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:53,090
with the Canada they're spraying this up

1618
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:55,400
continuously and so you can clean your

1619
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:57,560
crop as much as you want but it's going

1620
01:16:55,399 --> 01:16:59,569
to come back and what we found was

1621
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:01,760
called thought selection on things that

1622
01:16:59,569 --> 01:17:03,229
have a higher resistance and then you

1623
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,030
work with your beneficial it's that

1624
01:17:03,229 --> 01:17:07,579
company you work on a strategy of

1625
01:17:05,029 --> 01:17:08,988
juvenile or adults and a kinetic

1626
01:17:07,579 --> 01:17:11,779
radiation rate that's going to

1627
01:17:08,988 --> 01:17:13,879
out-compete it so I haven't blown that

1628
01:17:11,779 --> 01:17:17,029
hill and at a pharmacy or my department

1629
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:19,460
and we saw some bug's present so let us

1630
01:17:17,029 --> 01:17:21,679
know it was some food which means that

1631
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:23,118
eating something and so once we started

1632
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:25,010
to find the silicon diamonds on the

1633
01:17:23,118 --> 01:17:26,779
Bible as leads we like yet they go and

1634
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:29,300
it's too late do you salt or salt works

1635
01:17:26,779 --> 01:17:30,889
really lovely this is cheap and cymatics

1636
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:32,600
to talk because they bleach the equal

1637
01:17:30,889 --> 01:17:35,219
oxen and decide to talk and it's an

1638
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:37,110
actually look at culture I'm a

1639
01:17:35,219 --> 01:17:39,390
and this qualifies you can sell the

1640
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:41,729
bride so if any of what point in time

1641
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:43,350
you use some of these tools so sulfur

1642
01:17:41,729 --> 01:17:45,539
and never allow it so they need to

1643
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:47,100
affect the drive and cymatics members

1644
01:17:45,539 --> 01:17:49,350
wow this would affect the product in

1645
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:50,880
terms of bone but the beneficial insects

1646
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:52,920
work it's just the people that will do

1647
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,869
it at the level you need to I'm talking

1648
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:57,270
you let it get on everywhere those plans

1649
01:17:54,869 --> 01:17:59,340
to be juveniles and adults so that the

1650
01:17:57,270 --> 01:18:00,900
adults come out and go right to work and

1651
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:03,119
the neutrals collar eyes at work

1652
01:18:00,899 --> 01:18:04,619
basically I was burned three times the

1653
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:06,779
normal level of predation that was

1654
01:18:04,619 --> 01:18:08,309
required but I establish that crafter

1655
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:12,630
plus you know maybe five to ten percent

1656
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:17,640
of it my friends lost 95% which burners

1657
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:24,890
and attracts apartment well I know perky

1658
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:24,890
uh well it's the first of all this was

1659
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:31,369
outside they were the statutes I don't

1660
01:18:29,219 --> 01:18:31,369
know

1661
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:35,720
but it's satin sir

1662
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:38,779
it lacks for three to four weeks there

1663
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:42,190
they hatch inside the the Santa's month

1664
01:18:38,779 --> 01:18:44,719
ever beeps slow release it doesn't Jules

1665
01:18:42,189 --> 01:18:47,210
the news feminine invade but those

1666
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:49,159
people don't eat the cycles moment any

1667
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:51,710
adults get the adults because they come

1668
01:18:49,159 --> 01:18:53,510
priests are yesenin see what the adults

1669
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:55,489
and associate to resolve a little lunch

1670
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:59,530
box filled with vermiculite when you

1671
01:18:55,489 --> 01:19:00,829
open up these little [ __ ] run the boo

1672
01:18:59,529 --> 01:19:02,960
okay

1673
01:19:00,829 --> 01:19:04,340
hey talk to the family make sure they

1674
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:06,640
know you've been an impact on your

1675
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:08,760
underground

1676
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:14,130
so

1677
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:18,539
and I think about resonates with a lot

1678
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:22,380
of pastors business trips Hospital have

1679
01:19:18,539 --> 01:19:27,539
a wide range of inherent resistance just

1680
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:30,750
do that to determine for us at length do

1681
01:19:27,539 --> 01:19:36,439
we know that has significant genetic

1682
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:36,439
resistance determinants I don't know

1683
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,770
there

1684
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:45,599
there's no resistance

1685
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:47,360
and then come what do you think about

1686
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,310
the campus you see plants that have

1687
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:53,039
inherent levels of rest where is the

1688
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:55,890
sense that are significantly different

1689
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:58,439
than others I do and I always think it's

1690
01:19:55,890 --> 01:20:00,780
do I want to say top record or a layer

1691
01:19:58,439 --> 01:20:02,489
you see plants I have like rhinos skin

1692
01:20:00,779 --> 01:20:04,800
they seem to do better because when I

1693
01:20:02,489 --> 01:20:06,649
when I do intestine I have a tremendous

1694
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,909
number called the bars at the test site

1695
01:20:06,649 --> 01:20:10,649
certain ones getting to that certain

1696
01:20:08,909 --> 01:20:12,779
ones don't at different levels of

1697
01:20:10,649 --> 01:20:14,699
investigation but the problem is that

1698
01:20:12,779 --> 01:20:17,009
the stuff that's resistant there's like

1699
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:18,869
over that earlier yeah at least I know

1700
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:20,730
that what I could say is hey we've every

1701
01:20:18,869 --> 01:20:22,859
good success with this use this is a

1702
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:24,419
portion of your crop because you don't

1703
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:26,099
wanna eat so long coat for that way

1704
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:28,590
either because now you produce other

1705
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:30,000
after that problem so you have to kind

1706
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:32,250
of figure out what's your distribution

1707
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,069
based off of the market velocity and

1708
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:36,479
survivability and you'll be able to kind

1709
01:20:35,069 --> 01:20:38,840
of get yourself into a situation that

1710
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:41,969
requires a tremendous amount of

1711
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:44,220
pre-emptive or active on it before it

1712
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:47,539
ever happens that disappointed

1713
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:47,539
environmental culture

1714
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:56,618
okay next question my question is about

1715
01:20:53,738 --> 01:20:58,178
regulatory matters and the role an

1716
01:20:56,618 --> 01:21:00,308
integration of departments of

1717
01:20:58,179 --> 01:21:04,059
Agriculture into them I'm from Montana

1718
01:21:00,309 --> 01:21:05,559
we appreciate you early adopting space

1719
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:08,559
because we can look at what you do and

1720
01:21:05,559 --> 01:21:10,510
steal mechanisms but also we don't have

1721
01:21:08,559 --> 01:21:14,170
to do some things that you maybe had to

1722
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:15,820
do for political reasons and looking at

1723
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:17,889
the model of the campus and Liquor

1724
01:21:15,819 --> 01:21:20,618
Control Board you know of course we look

1725
01:21:17,889 --> 01:21:23,828
at that and understand the political

1726
01:21:20,618 --> 01:21:25,569
advantage of aligning cannabis with

1727
01:21:23,828 --> 01:21:28,479
something people understand that being

1728
01:21:25,569 --> 01:21:31,029
alcohol however worth looking since were

1729
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:32,979
not on the forefront of the way extent

1730
01:21:31,029 --> 01:21:35,469
we actually meet with the Department of

1731
01:21:32,979 --> 01:21:36,609
Agriculture because what medical where

1732
01:21:35,469 --> 01:21:39,340
the Department of Health and Human

1733
01:21:36,609 --> 01:21:43,058
Services but as this move towards adult

1734
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:45,248
use we are actually trying to lean in

1735
01:21:43,059 --> 01:21:48,279
the direction of act being between state

1736
01:21:45,248 --> 01:21:50,590
agencies and it was wondering you had

1737
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:52,059
any comments about that and also whether

1738
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:54,309
or not act was brought into the

1739
01:21:52,059 --> 01:21:56,769
Washington conversation after the

1740
01:21:54,309 --> 01:22:01,989
regulatory mechanism of the board was

1741
01:21:56,769 --> 01:22:03,889
established or after I'm sure there's

1742
01:22:01,988 --> 01:22:08,658
people in the room who can answer that

1743
01:22:03,889 --> 01:22:13,100
the chronology of that but yes I think

1744
01:22:08,658 --> 01:22:16,210
that having a lead organization in

1745
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:18,440
agriculture has some definite benefits I

1746
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:22,850
think if we were going back to do it

1747
01:22:18,439 --> 01:22:25,009
again we give LCB a help all some

1748
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:28,460
authorities in the original package bag

1749
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:30,280
didn't have any authorities so yeah it's

1750
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:32,840
going to take a team working together

1751
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:36,019
you need to give everybody a piece of

1752
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:40,079
that of that pie so now we have to play

1753
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:43,860
catch-up a little bit with our system

1754
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:47,399
so you know getting involved is key a

1755
01:22:43,859 --> 01:22:50,549
person controls one thing told

1756
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:52,589
subsidence all that but the agriculture

1757
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:54,840
piece is so key is so important

1758
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:59,760
I hope that you can build that into your

1759
01:22:54,840 --> 01:23:05,600
original legislation a strong advocacy

1760
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:05,600
group like cannabis and Weiss build

1761
01:23:08,579 --> 01:23:12,539
that will be our final question for this

1762
01:23:10,739 --> 01:23:14,880
panel there is a request to have a

1763
01:23:12,539 --> 01:23:39,600
picture of the panel and remember that

1764
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:43,590
there are correspondents in various

1765
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:50,010
cities around the u.s. they have what

1766
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:51,930
had been hurt by things in cannabis when

1767
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:55,470
they first went to the correspondents

1768
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:59,159
you standing there standing there

1769
01:23:55,470 --> 01:24:02,369
talking about what they're doing this

1770
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:06,090
suman if she went on here the three

1771
01:24:02,369 --> 01:24:10,710
people are all dead so there was an

1772
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:13,500
incident they with the various locations

1773
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:16,649
and another time language over confirmed

1774
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:19,130
she was standing here holding a gas mask

1775
01:24:16,649 --> 01:24:19,129
Paul

1776
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:37,569
[ __ ] and five during that section she

1777
01:24:32,619 --> 01:24:39,460
was giggling a lot more by the end and I

1778
01:24:37,569 --> 01:24:42,849
bring this up because the entire time

1779
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:46,119
they were joining her I was thinking how

1780
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:53,809
awful before session says something if

1781
01:24:46,119 --> 01:24:57,229
he's watching I'm sorry this really

1782
01:24:53,809 --> 01:25:00,340
you have a vintage let's release this

1783
01:24:57,229 --> 01:25:00,339
panel thank you offer
