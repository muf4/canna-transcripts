1
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:17,250
so as Mariah we have a lineup from the

2
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:19,589
us from great biogenetics next we have

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,100
the main mast of the self amoun gene and

4
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:24,228
finally we ended up Kevin's right

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,229
[Music]

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:33,510
so I want to slide it up today by

7
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:35,579
basically he's from that to the panel

8
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:37,019
what do you guys think open you give

9
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,509
them with practical breeding I think

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,500
it's it's abroad and to a lot of people

11
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:44,070
it leaves a lot of things

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,799
a quite a bit practical breeding in my

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,539
eyes is stabilization making sure you

14
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,279
don't have intersex traits looking for

15
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,049
her you know it's really every reader

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,370
has their own palate you can give every

17
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:54,509
one of us you know almost the same

18
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:56,759
genetics we're all gonna come out with

19
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:57,780
something different so practical great

20
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,988
for me is making sure you have

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,140
stabilized kinetics to your environment

22
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:06,840
though basically I guess it intersects

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,030
issues make sure things Hardy no gold in

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,200
tissues resilient to you know out there

25
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,540
word nasty weather

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,579
it's basically what I call classical

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:20,670
breeding making sure they have what you

28
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:24,420
do is stability and I can definitely

29
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,700
agree with everything she said enough to

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,320
add to that you know like God just

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,320
basically with practical breeding but

32
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,779
I'm trying to reach those goals you know

33
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:39,289
I might be a turkey profile

34
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:40,579
their profile but basically just trying

35
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,409
to get where you're going you know and

36
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:44,200
given us do whatever tricks you can you

37
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:46,930
know but like she said definitely

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,750
resistance to pests and pathogens

39
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:52,070
structure you know trying to take

40
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,500
something and fix it up a little bit

41
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:56,349
whether you're just trying to get all

42
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,909
those all that you have for everything

43
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:03,829
I'd say that's definitely the practical

44
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:06,259
side of it and thanks for all coming and

45
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:07,670
I would say thank you listen as he talks

46
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:12,469
and show you great you're tired hear me

47
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:14,870
speak when I look at practical Reid was

48
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:18,139
a functional breeding and it's really

49
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,759
just what's your objective and that's

50
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,289
ultimately what you choose and so you

51
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,870
can look at the Holy Grail where all

52
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:25,310
things match and work is perfect but for

53
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,950
a lot of people it's just really trying

54
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:31,420
to steer something in a realm of they

55
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:33,259
desire and that when it does it allows

56
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:34,729
individuals to be able to make these

57
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:36,349
choices without judgment

58
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:39,139
and a lot of it becomes I think like a

59
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:40,849
competitive inbreeding where you're all

60
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:42,229
trying to do something unbelievable for

61
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:43,699
for a lot of people as they go forward

62
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:45,530
it's really the first soft the first

63
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:47,268
problem and like Alan was saying they'll

64
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,250
intersects trade stability and gene

65
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:51,819
saying pathogenic

66
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:54,669
resistance those are crucial and those

67
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:56,620
are both separate directions and the

68
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:58,750
idea would practically for me in this in

69
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,730
this context is to decide what is it

70
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,650
that you're seeking and then to go chase

71
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:04,239
that first and then you systematically

72
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,460
work through all these other problems

73
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:11,920
until you get to ultimately a stable

74
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:14,080
package so with that in mind I think

75
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,489
like a glue I have a kind of disgusting

76
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,200
the practical gradient let's just say

77
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,140
that it's almost a credit line there on

78
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:23,229
maybe spit into there bondic wanna throw

79
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:24,549
device the first thing I'll ask is do

80
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:26,109
you think we should take the kind of

81
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,610
Luther Burbank approach that you just

82
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,680
described where selecting one

83
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,780
characteristic and just trying out that

84
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,750
or is it possible to now multiple teams

85
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,849
of each generation I personally think

86
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,800
it's possible I mean honestly the

87
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,419
genetics that are here today is the best

88
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,500
that I've seen it's almost hard to get

89
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:43,599
better than we're seeing the sides

90
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,789
making it you know having sequential

91
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,039
terpenes are against it I said pathogens

92
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:50,109
and bugs and are so party at least

93
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:51,459
Elliot's of all that doesn't in the

94
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,840
direction I think it's still important

95
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,569
but I think you put everything together

96
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,569
from taste from the hardness to heal I

97
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,699
mean we have plenty of course

98
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,858
that I believe have none at all because

99
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:04,888
it's hard to do that but almost there

100
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:06,810
you know just I truly believe not just

101
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:09,150
one direction or you know unless you

102
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,128
have one specific thing you're going for

103
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,810
that said just sticking with it but I

104
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:15,268
can't go there you know I think you

105
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,459
actually truly please it's like as a

106
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,410
rower you look for structure that you

107
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,329
like you look for smells that you like

108
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,560
after so many years you're like you can

109
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,780
look at something imagine like you wanna

110
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,348
have like that Chuck that you're like oh

111
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:26,579
wow

112
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,439
my girlfriend look at me I was thrown

113
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:29,879
out male clam sauce what are you doing

114
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,610
they're so beautiful Mike it's not what

115
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:35,370
I'm looking for okay so I truly believe

116
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:45,720
you can you can search for everything

117
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:49,228
and agree to that for sure the thing is

118
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,400
that you know if you can take a take a

119
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:53,279
look at stuff and go ahead and make a

120
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,679
list of your head and go okay here you

121
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,199
know here's the end goal and that's

122
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,560
based on these little chat

123
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,360
along the way and then something that's

124
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,339
really cool now is that we're all being

125
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,009
able to work with a lot more plants and

126
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:10,519
when you have a list if you okay I need

127
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:14,060
to hit all of these things so if you

128
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:15,139
only have a few plants there's not how

129
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,879
to like the other thing you're actually

130
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,800
gonna hit all those marks with a few

131
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,089
plants but if you have a whole lot of

132
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,620
plants then all of a sudden you might

133
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:24,829
say okay now going through in this

134
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,060
generation we have you know you might

135
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:28,459
have there when you really think about

136
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,620
there might be 50 things that you that

137
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:33,019
you really want it to do

138
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,889
if you have enough plants you could look

139
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:35,750
through you know a lot of this

140
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:38,199
generation you just got to you know we

141
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,370
only had eight of these things really

142
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,680
working for us and now you go through

143
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,959
one generation find these right parents

144
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,850
and all of a sudden you might go from a

145
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,769
traits you want and all the sudden here

146
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:52,280
at thirty five traits walk in one

147
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:57,859
breeding you know and you know that

148
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:59,719
being like you like we're talking about

149
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,900
resistance to things that might be like

150
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,360
oh this one's really resistant to

151
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:07,129
caterpillars but you know spider mites

152
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,930
have come out of the trees to find it

153
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:12,230
you know and then you might go opening

154
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,699
we got this one and look it actually it

155
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,180
doesn't get either these pests looking

156
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:19,129
for it and so then all of a sudden you

157
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,720
know in there with that what a smaller

158
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,379
population

159
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,870
with big populations and a clear goal

160
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:29,689
trying to narrow it down where you're

161
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:35,139
hitting all your marks it really can be

162
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:38,209
done fast but you have to have the idea

163
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:40,849
of what you look like you what goals you

164
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:43,089
do want to accomplish and then as you go

165
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:46,070
through sometimes you're finding more

166
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:47,599
things that you didn't even realize you

167
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:49,399
wanted but you see the moon that's

168
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,530
desirable all right that's a lot lock

169
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,539
that in to your list micro is you know

170
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:54,709
you okay we want these 50 things and

171
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,970
then all of a sudden you see if you go a

172
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:58,009
little bit there okay that's locking

173
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,080
these other three or four and you keep

174
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,699
moving about it's definitely possible to

175
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:06,259
make a lot of progress really fast with

176
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:09,170
it I think I think now we're down to

177
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,889
focuses you direction meaning I want to

178
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:14,069
go with

179
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:15,899
I think a lot of people use pollination

180
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,819
methodologies where they cover a

181
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,769
tremendous amount a different Prentice

182
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,329
top with similar pollen and then chase

183
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:23,129
it out in these four other patterns and

184
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:24,479
promise you can't really find what's

185
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:26,339
coming out of your lines because these

186
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,230
populations you need to look at that are

187
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:29,669
big enough when you start to spread it

188
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,020
out into many different direction just

189
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,759
kind of hard to figure out what's coming

190
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:35,039
out of the line so we scientifically we

191
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,349
can look at traits to find out levels of

192
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,240
heterozygosity so is it is it going to

193
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:42,180
be dissimilar as a homozygous and went

194
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,340
to my fixed and science helps but like

195
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,379
Gino and they they know their lines well

196
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,849
so when they throw this pollen on

197
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,189
something they say hey that's something

198
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,629
that I know I don't want her I want but

199
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:53,040
a lot of that is because they're working

200
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:54,779
their Lauren's heavily with the

201
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,730
knowledgebase I think a lot of people

202
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:58,889
when they're throwing pollen they're

203
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,600
spread themselves out too far too quick

204
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,459
and it doesn't allow it we really go

205
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,410
into the plant to find out what are the

206
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:06,209
traits I really see that are coming out

207
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,620
of this because you're gonna have to see

208
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:10,079
a population take it up to find the

209
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,610
recessives and those are the outliers

210
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,289
that you're trying to find like you know

211
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,240
we're talking you know Caterpillar

212
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,530
resistance white resistance I don't know

213
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,060
any plans you got to go through to find

214
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,159
it where you find the outliers you know

215
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,389
okay in this line this is what I'm seek

216
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,460
and then you'll start to find other

217
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,529
traits that you can recognize visually

218
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:27,329
that seem to go along because genes

219
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:29,369
appeared they're not just individual

220
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:31,278
like switches that's a problem Christmas

221
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,929
technology Christmas technologies

222
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:35,088
things in and out when we wipe something

223
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,218
out we also wipe other things out that

224
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:38,589
were not aware of and so conventional

225
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:41,449
reading practices are really this

226
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:43,909
swirling of genes to find concentrations

227
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:45,799
that work in directions and I think that

228
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:48,588
if you work a similar line you try to

229
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:50,389
stay constant you o'neil even if it may

230
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:52,189
not be the end result you want at the

231
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:53,839
end what you did is you developed an

232
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:56,809
ability to start understanding the

233
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,399
pattern of repeatability and I think

234
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:00,588
that you would have to go through that I

235
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,019
think the breeders are misunderstood or

236
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:05,120
their forward vision of what they really

237
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:07,339
want to see they have a very clear

238
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,578
vision down the road and they chased

239
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:12,439
that and sometimes they don't hit it but

240
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:14,359
it's okay because the process is chasing

241
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:16,458
it is what really refines the skill set

242
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,068
in chasing begun are you gonna practice

243
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:20,539
it's not just papers Mendelian squares a

244
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:23,328
great book that doesn't work with poly

245
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:26,269
hybrids there's too many options and so

246
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:28,188
it's looking and choosing and finding a

247
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:29,600
generation that works and realizing you

248
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:31,399
went the wrong direction we're all

249
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,230
parental stock you go the other

250
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,409
direction you find the right parental

251
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:38,089
stock that that's a huge huge skill set

252
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,919
that has to be developed and I think

253
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:42,800
patience is the part that you have to

254
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,750
have more than anything so I mean on

255
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,269
that topic of going through the stalking

256
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,899
created and fear hunting what do you

257
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:52,139
guys think about it

258
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:54,419
a lot of people saying it might have

259
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,629
growing numbers and astronomy's under

260
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:59,338
time bigger is always better do agree

261
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,689
with that and what number do you think

262
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,130
it was that I need to do if they wanna

263
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,339
you know have some of their own work to

264
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:07,528
truly find out what it's like decided

265
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:09,330
well I mean I think people buy a 12-pack

266
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:10,799
and find you know well it's full winners

267
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,430
and then I've seen people tough you know

268
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:16,079
top 100 200 season find a winner so it's

269
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:18,809
truly academics your source at their to

270
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,600
me but I've popped you know a few scum

271
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:22,829
seats from old old old old bro and I

272
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,550
think it was from older than I was

273
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:30,028
waiting for United States and first they

274
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:32,338
didn't talk next to the pot but nothing

275
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:36,210
came out too special and it was just you

276
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:39,150
know 150 seat so sometimes it's all

277
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,460
about the actual genetics and the

278
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:42,600
parents that you're getting not just the

279
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,850
larger you don't hunt that you're doing

280
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,920
but if like I say something like my dogs

281
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,300
those for instance I caught five minutes

282
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:49,979
it's about it's hard you're cold you

283
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:51,659
know anyone you mean every single one

284
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,009
has amazing terpene profiles after sex

285
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:54,569
do I want the skills that's got the

286
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:56,970
lemon in the line of the citrus or do I

287
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,040
want more of like the ogk be dominant or

288
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,750
anything so it's truly amazing to go

289
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,458
through any each feed on like see if how

290
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,278
homogenous things truly are and how you

291
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,719
know sometimes things are early on like

292
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,610
the answer sir sighs do different

293
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,600
programs it's it's it's truly amazing if

294
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:15,990
you don't want to get something that I

295
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:18,209
think everybody should do so yeah

296
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,350
depends kind on on what you're trying to

297
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,939
do like she said if you already have

298
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,080
something in tutoring them take into a

299
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,779
place where there's not much variation

300
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,190
then you know you're just trying to find

301
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:28,320
a slight improvement like maybe

302
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,700
everything's there but you want to do a

303
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,709
little better you might you might get

304
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,180
there you might only need ten planets so

305
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,159
you might even get there without a five

306
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:36,750
five good girls to go and well this was

307
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:38,579
just a lot bigger okay cool over there

308
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,159
for a while your goal that's your goal

309
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,620
menu simple but then like if like to say

310
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,329
there's kind of two different aspects to

311
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,470
pleading there's like preservation award

312
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:50,639
or invention work and then there's like

313
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,120
trying to get right to that goal which

314
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,730
is number four

315
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,328
like a commercial here so that it's like

316
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:01,659
okay this is that reacting so if you're

317
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:04,088
gonna do preservation work ideally you

318
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:07,269
want to have no less than 200 planets

319
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:10,660
all in basically what would be almost

320
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:13,499
like a open field situation you know if

321
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:16,889
it's a room or whatever but that

322
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:20,319
preserves the full of genetic diversity

323
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:22,419
but that's different than just trying to

324
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:24,998
go okay we really want this big fat butt

325
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:27,039
full of truth because the THC or CBD or

326
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:29,409
whatever you're going for so it

327
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,938
definitely the numbers is different and

328
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:33,429
then like I said like invention where

329
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:34,929
it's like you know you some people are

330
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:36,729
going to take like really cool things

331
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:38,438
and just plug them together and then

332
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,028
that can go to other people and then

333
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:43,599
they run with that and then they try to

334
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:45,188
dial it in - so that's all different

335
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,649
numbers games it's totally different

336
00:12:45,188 --> 00:12:52,480
goals and you have to look at it like

337
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:54,938
going through a program but um you know

338
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,119
the numbers are great for me I'm not

339
00:12:54,938 --> 00:13:00,009
trying to read a thousand plants on one

340
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:02,589
thing because how am I going to smuggle

341
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:05,169
thousands of plants and see which one is

342
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:07,720
really the best so you really can't be

343
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:10,088
hands on a giant population that's good

344
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,059
for once you have it to where you like

345
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:14,709
it but you have one issue and that's all

346
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,118
you're trying to fix that applause on is

347
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,708
great because you know here's the one

348
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:19,629
the caterpillars didn't need out of a

349
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:22,178
thousand because you couldn't find that

350
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:25,659
it would be in fifty seeds if that's how

351
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:26,948
it worked but uh you know it's

352
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:29,049
definitely if you really want to know

353
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:30,998
what's the best slow what people really

354
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:33,128
like you're gonna be better off only

355
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:35,519
having 10 or 20 females so we can all

356
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:38,350
sit here and really call it over because

357
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,509
otherwise it's impossible to analyze all

358
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,428
that it's it has to be analyzed by

359
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:43,778
humans it can't just be all laboratories

360
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:45,818
because a laboratory can tell you oh

361
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:48,009
this house so many turf this so many

362
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:52,149
turkeys and so much of these desirable

363
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:54,009
ones and what a human smells Ithaca and

364
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:56,589
then something might look like it's not

365
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:58,850
even special and all of a sudden it's

366
00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:00,649
like wow everybody loves

367
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,678
you know so you have to have the hands

368
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:05,328
all of you can't be hands-on with a

369
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:07,338
hundred thousand plants in a big old

370
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:10,308
field it's just not going to happen you

371
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:12,169
have to be in touch with the plant and

372
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:14,749
actually feel like what it does to you

373
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:17,119
how other people experience it so you

374
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:19,069
have to keep it limited to a certain

375
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:21,139
point but that's the difference if

376
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:23,088
you're just trying to fix one thing and

377
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:24,739
it's like agriculture problem like we

378
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:26,720
need one that's easy to harvest with

379
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,979
machines or whatever it is yeah you

380
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,239
might want to run out of thousands and

381
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:30,679
thousands here you know everything else

382
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:32,839
is there and you need to fix that one

383
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:36,649
thing but if you're just looking for the

384
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:38,119
magic you're gonna have to really get in

385
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:40,278
there you're not doing that with a

386
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:43,069
million a million plants we're not going

387
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:45,259
to know what's there you know so it just

388
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:49,788
depends on the bonus really four numbers

389
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:51,259
I think a lot of people exaggerate the

390
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:53,239
numbers that look into me because it

391
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:56,119
sounds better than there's a number 842

392
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:58,850
after the plants name you know special

393
00:14:56,119 --> 00:15:00,979
skunk 842 and I'm like come on just

394
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,528
smoke 842 these things and actually keep

395
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:05,179
track of it it's an it's hard and and

396
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,158
I'm somebody that hunts plants in

397
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:10,188
different directions too because I done

398
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:12,139
stuff for but by others and when you're

399
00:15:10,188 --> 00:15:13,969
talking about extraction it is numbers

400
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:15,678
because we're gonna pull it off and so

401
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,928
we can infuse dirty one of these things

402
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:19,788
and so when you talk in large

403
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:22,999
populations I'm looking for outliers and

404
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:24,439
numerically and for specific reasons but

405
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:26,360
you know what gene saying is

406
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,759
you're gonna smoke this stuff then

407
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,919
ultimately that has to be the test and

408
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:32,629
it's really hard to smoke that many

409
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:34,429
different varieties and really start to

410
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:37,039
compare them back and forth and so it's

411
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:38,599
a process and so populations that are

412
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,730
you know 50 plants are actually oh

413
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,470
that's a lot of smoke you got to take

414
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,180
and go through them and consume one

415
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,639
after the other log I mean you have to

416
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:48,229
standardize when you smoke them and what

417
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,019
was your mental state when you did

418
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,159
because otherwise you put your

419
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:55,188
perception on it

420
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,708
so you're not being objective and when

421
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,879
you're talking huge quantities a lot of

422
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,559
times you know that's because you're

423
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,269
working with stuff that's not as stable

424
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,500
and it's reproductive ability its

425
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:05,389
meaning you're gonna see a tremendous

426
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,850
amount of deviation from plant to plant

427
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:09,709
and so that helps you neck down to get a

428
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,870
direction and then from there you can

429
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:13,159
start to work on refinement which is

430
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,600
like a lot of said I've seen packs that

431
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:16,490
the open the pack up and there was five

432
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,250
killers so they was you know ten seats

433
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,079
five of girls all of them are beautiful

434
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,328
they just took on a little different

435
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:25,458
directions and you made the choice of

436
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:26,839
where you wanted then you crack oh you

437
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:30,500
know packs a look at 100

438
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:32,450
good and so a lot of it is you have to

439
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,950
actually crack some seeds and take a

440
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,210
look at what they what they do they're

441
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,009
doing and that kind of help you

442
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,810
understand how big a population you need

443
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:40,909
to look through there is no set number

444
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:42,139
but most of the time I see people tell

445
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:44,929
me they look through this many and I'm

446
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:49,159
like touch keep track and then then look

447
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:52,219
at me oh my god you didn't it's just

448
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,909
kind of fraud and that's not that's not

449
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,620
the point

450
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:56,419
you know sometimes been in smaller

451
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,820
populations I can't look I look for

452
00:16:56,419 --> 00:17:00,349
outliers over the course of years so

453
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,170
I'll go through a population a look at

454
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,180
50 and then of the ones that I believe

455
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:07,609
are best on that 50 and then I'll run

456
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,589
another 50 and I'll pull the outliers

457
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:12,049
out from that and then I can come here

458
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:14,659
the choices I've made from each one of

459
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:16,938
those selective groups and compare them

460
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,860
against each other and say hey is one a

461
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:21,170
clear winner or they have different

462
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:23,088
distinctions because a lot of it now is

463
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,829
is where you're selecting for so if

464
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:26,240
you're selecting your varieties rent or

465
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:27,438
operations that's what they don't get

466
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,490
selected but that doesn't mean it's

467
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,130
going to do well in greenhouse that

468
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:33,410
their outdoor and so you where this

469
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,990
selection process happens it dictates

470
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,700
the number you need what you want and

471
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,319
then you have to make sure you say this

472
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,480
deep well here under these circumstances

473
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:43,970
because it doesn't mean you can transfer

474
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,940
that selection so sometimes I'll do

475
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,589
multiple selections on the same stock so

476
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,480
that I have something that works indoor

477
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:52,039
something that works outdoor and they're

478
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,049
both pretty similar but they have

479
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:55,509
different resistances to pathogens in

480
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:57,519
yours a little easier

481
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:59,859
doesn't have to have the sensitivity

482
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,599
faculty moisture where outdoor a Scouter

483
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:04,929
natural resistance as you can't control

484
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,339
that environment and so all that goes

485
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,810
into place when you double this stuff

486
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:10,449
you just kind of have to be practical

487
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:13,029
about it yourself and and don't hold

488
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,350
yourself to a constant don't be afraid

489
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:15,700
to screw up at home you don't you're

490
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:16,689
gonna either make some mistakes while

491
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,430
you look and you're gonna throw some

492
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:21,220
good ones away and that should eat up

493
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,130
picking up good was someone say this

494
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,759
touched on the next question which is

495
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,100
basically the future

496
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:29,109
Canada's production worldwide is to be

497
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:31,359
booming it's like an outdoor Sun grown

498
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:34,149
steady yet receiving we see a lot of

499
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:36,159
ratings building none of those and index

500
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,350
management and things like the mold and

501
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,600
fungus have commonly not listed as part

502
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:42,730
of they are those are attributes of it

503
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,980
liberating for so with that in mind how

504
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,380
can people help to universe select for

505
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,940
these traits we reference the females

506
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,410
that you know you can see them

507
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,019
what about matters how do you find

508
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,850
matters that have got IPM resistance and

509
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:56,889
things like that they're on the outside

510
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:58,750
see how they do outside some nasty-ass

511
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,520
weather and if they can handle it they

512
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,559
don't look decrepit ready to die because

513
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,509
I mean something else don't even water

514
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,519
on they're good to go so hard he's so

515
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:08,619
strong the structures there even the

516
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,960
little stem rug they smell insane not

517
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:13,209
like the regular like it smells like

518
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,470
everything else you mean there's there's

519
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,900
always the ones that stand out

520
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,279
especially if I want to say you know the

521
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,440
torture chamber is always the best way

522
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:23,470
to do it and it sounds crazy but you

523
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:28,210
know stress up see how they how they

524
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:31,029
turn out that's the best way yeah it's a

525
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,130
trip actually males if you you know a

526
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:36,700
lot of times people in a green meadow

527
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:38,790
males go long enough to really see what

528
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:43,450
they're going to do

529
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:45,460
I've noticed that males that are from

530
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,410
stuff that's not being more resistant

531
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,000
the males themself if you let it run and

532
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,040
run and run the males will actually hold

533
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,299
himself like a female body a lot of

534
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,759
times a lot worse the little

535
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:59,889
distributable

536
00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:03,160
there's also a trick for selecting males

537
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:05,680
that's really cool that I kind of just

538
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,360
figured out on accident and I've never

539
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,370
heard anybody mention it before so it's

540
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,699
kind of a cool tip if you actually bud

541
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:15,039
your males all the way out the way a

542
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,990
plant grows everything closest to the

543
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,309
tips is going to go first

544
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,170
that's what really starts flowering

545
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:22,609
first you know things tough that with a

546
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:25,308
flower that's kind of how it goes

547
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:28,398
so what's lower down will be later on

548
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:30,079
males and if you take everything that's

549
00:20:28,398 --> 00:20:32,989
already flowered and you leave ones

550
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:35,389
lower and you let it regrow still in

551
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,120
flowery road it'll want to shoot and

552
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:40,070
those secondary shoots that come up I'll

553
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:43,069
actually show a country resident that

554
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:44,629
plant produces then they won't do it at

555
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:47,720
first most people don't know this this

556
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,940
is like top secret info you know yeah it

557
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,769
will grow it will grow back and it'll

558
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,350
almost be like you reversed it to be a

559
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:56,750
female then it can actually smell the

560
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:58,459
resin if you really wanted to get

561
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,288
nitty-gritty it actually harvest those

562
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,149
little leaves as they be trying to stick

563
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:03,980
them in a bomb you notice about the

564
00:21:02,148 --> 00:21:07,819
resin on your fingers it feel that you

565
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:10,700
can tell and so by taking man is not

566
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:12,259
only full term but longer than full trim

567
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,460
by cutting them and letting them grow

568
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:18,059
back again you'll get actually a whole

569
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:21,210
different look at a male

570
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:22,980
and I haven't seen people do it really

571
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,740
on purpose but I've started doing it on

572
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,299
purpose and now I'm able to just lock my

573
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,500
mails like their females and I don't

574
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:31,039
have to reverse it because you do

575
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,869
reverse mails and turn them to females

576
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,299
which if you do that you can actually

577
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:38,309
make instead of making feminized seeds

578
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:40,829
they'll make regular seeds with a male

579
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:45,779
and a female because the male has that

580
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:47,669
chromosome but it's definitely a huge

581
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:49,559
trick and it really helps you and then

582
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,029
by doing that too you see it's it's in

583
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,740
the late stages that most things get

584
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:55,079
attacked by things like mildew and best

585
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,120
they get tired their older plants they

586
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,579
start to break down on their health and

587
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,309
so by taking them all the way where they

588
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:03,839
but kind of them back and they grow

589
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:06,149
again and it's like they're really in

590
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,429
the latest stages so that the most resin

591
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,470
production that the least resistance to

592
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,549
pests and pathogens and the things that

593
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,620
you see get attacked

594
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:15,329
you're able to note that really easily

595
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:17,549
where you can't do that if you have a

596
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:18,149
bail and it drops the ball and you you

597
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:19,710
come

598
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,030
that you're gonna have to go through the

599
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,850
process of brought up the seasons too

600
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:25,769
even though what it did and what a male

601
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:27,869
does it doesn't necessarily pass that

602
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:29,519
but with a lot of the genetics that any

603
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:31,709
of us want to play with that are already

604
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,779
desirable at this point especially in

605
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:36,509
the marketplace these things are pretty

606
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:39,359
bottleneck down and that means that the

607
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:41,819
things that you see in a plan

608
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,189
they'll probably carry through in most

609
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:46,109
cases to a certain extent whereas if you

610
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,539
have a really open population that has

611
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:50,579
everything from like a land race you

612
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:53,129
might find this really cool player but

613
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:55,079
if the frequency of those genetics

614
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:59,460
actually popping up to the line are

615
00:22:55,079 --> 00:23:01,019
really rare so actually being able to

616
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,090
see that the males do and most of the

617
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:04,769
modern stuff we work with it actually

618
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:07,919
tells you most of what you need to know

619
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:09,809
and you'll you'll you'll know pretty

620
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,430
well but it's going to do so that I

621
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:15,200
think is the biggest trick to really

622
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,200
know about those what those males

623
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:22,210
what's that cool down is it you can

624
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,820
access lab tech that you couldn't access

625
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,740
prior and so it lets you copy

626
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:28,149
scientific read and if there's a lecture

627
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,400
after this or that things psychic

628
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,460
reading and but the point is that it's

629
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,620
accessible and so we leave more

630
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:39,309
interpretive intuitive readers where you

631
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:40,809
look and you feel and with science it

632
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:42,129
just helps speed up some of that you

633
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:43,569
still have to look and feel because

634
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,160
ultimately it's a human perception that

635
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:48,250
dictates the reality of the day

636
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,259
molecular do they not but you know with

637
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,269
populations now that you can be we bring

638
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:54,579
in stock into the laboratory and test

639
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:56,529
for fungal issues so I get it I can

640
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:59,019
bring us a leaf sample into a lab and

641
00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:01,450
test this with fungal propensity and it

642
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:03,519
lets me see does it it does not have so

643
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,990
it allows you to actually reading well

644
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,029
if the question once you've read into a

645
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,160
how to go outside and my thing is I

646
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:12,279
select in the environment that I want

647
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,380
the product to be grown in but now you

648
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:16,000
can use lab technology to help you like

649
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,650
really work with an indoor reading

650
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,509
operation with the plants then get

651
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,420
tested at the lab and they infected with

652
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:24,309
the fungus you and does it it does it

653
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,390
not take hold and if you have a high

654
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:28,450
resistance and you can say that

655
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:30,460
population is resistant and for a lot of

656
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,500
people as we go forward you know say I

657
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,340
like copy breeders because I think that

658
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,990
the beauty of working with your

659
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:37,699
cannabis genetics is something that goes

660
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,929
back to the dawn of time and I think

661
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,640
that's what allows people to have an

662
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:43,070
individual relationships with candidates

663
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,630
where they say hey look I did this this

664
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:47,629
is something I chose because I liked it

665
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:49,278
and that that that human connection to

666
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,809
the plant to me is the thing that made

667
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,259
all of us really go where we are now so

668
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:55,220
we're an industrial cannabis Society but

669
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:57,950
fundamentally all of us was we lovers

670
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,350
and we wanted to be able to dial in

671
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:03,380
stuff we may be dumb but now you can use

672
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:06,349
technological tools that just make it

673
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:09,110
really pretty fast and so you can figure

674
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:10,939
out what direction you're going and then

675
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:13,459
from there it goes back to use in here

676
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,110
you're into intuitive skills and I like

677
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,640
that I like being able to have the tools

678
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:21,949
because ultimately it takes time and a

679
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,140
process of working out what's going to

680
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,399
happen at predictability is something

681
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,038
that takes a lot of time and a lot of

682
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:29,808
resources and with the ability to have

683
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:32,179
more plants that were you know permits

684
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:33,740
it's nice but nonetheless it's still

685
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:35,690
time and energy and money you're having

686
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:39,589
to spend and it's going to compress that

687
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:42,769
for you I like and so endure work which

688
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:44,959
useful reproduction for this way I never

689
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:47,450
used as the selection but now I can take

690
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,269
that stock and have it lab infected and

691
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,590
then find out

692
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:51,599
then we can take it and put any kind of

693
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:53,490
pathogen on it and it aloud and find out

694
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:57,119
what's its resistance factor

695
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:58,950
they're just pizza yeah so they say

696
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,479
someone's got their line along the way

697
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,890
they're like what they've found have

698
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,210
even got a few properties they're

699
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,980
looking for within it

700
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:07,470
at what point should they be worried

701
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,940
about potential loss of the big guy if

702
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,470
they are trying to be brave each

703
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,029
generation would you recommend that

704
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,130
method to our Russell should you really

705
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:16,889
just stick with the one line and just

706
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,090
keep working it it depends how how much

707
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,860
it makes work we started off because

708
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:21,419
I've seen genetics get watered down even

709
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:22,709
mothers and you know people regenerate

710
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,970
their mothers and you know sometimes

711
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,259
they're not as Hardy as you know the

712
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,679
first one that you did maybe 10 years

713
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:30,179
ago you know so I believe that inline

714
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,740
grading is great for that as long as

715
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:34,140
it's a genomic so the parents are hardly

716
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,700
enough to you know you're not watering

717
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,140
it down as long as you're going in the

718
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,990
direction you're selecting things that

719
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:47,130
are improving it I think in line works

720
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:51,450
great so with with every device what

721
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:52,980
happens a lot of times is you get this

722
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,400
condition called inbreeding depression

723
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:59,640
and it's argued

724
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,800
we'll study genetics what it really

725
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,390
comes from and a lot of the people who

726
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:06,569
are a little more progressive with their

727
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:09,890
thinking on it think that it actually

728
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:12,029
comes from the fact that in inbred

729
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:15,270
thinking say anything whatever it is

730
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:17,519
dogs or whatever like people tell you

731
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:19,259
how German Shepherds Rottweilers they

732
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,109
get bad hips it's because they're inbred

733
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:24,569
it's actually because they're in red and

734
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:26,369
then they're selected wrong and then

735
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:28,169
they develop these things and you can't

736
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:29,759
get rid of them because the genetics of

737
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:32,070
bottlenecked meaning that they've gone

738
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:35,220
from being a broad scope of different

739
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:36,659
traits available to being only some

740
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,120
things that can actually express

741
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:42,180
themselves so the genetics so what

742
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,939
happens a lot of times is that people

743
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:46,200
say oh and I heard this when I was

744
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,140
learning for people you know there's a

745
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,569
oh we got the genetics is regretted and

746
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,370
we bred it but then it got tired out

747
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:55,500
cross-stitch and that was good again

748
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:58,529
because of how to read vigor which is

749
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,299
what happens when we mix together the

750
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:02,460
dominant things take over and you don't

751
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:06,450
see all the tricky recessive stuff

752
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:10,289
that's hanging out but the reality of it

753
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:12,930
is that if let's say you take like you

754
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:14,549
know two really different things to make

755
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:17,430
a really cool hybrid and you get this

756
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:19,859
really cool body this really Google

757
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:23,640
plants that come out that are basically

758
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:25,409
they started with now if you select

759
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,160
those plants and you try different

760
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:30,900
combinations with them some of those

761
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,420
that will actually read truth and will

762
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,940
stay in there and you can actually keep

763
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,500
that going that direction for what what

764
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,120
will happen is the submission of the

765
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,548
wrong selection of doesn't fit those

766
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,409
criteria stuff will start to come too

767
00:28:41,548 --> 00:28:45,359
it'll go the direction in what you

768
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:47,429
picked he was our imprint because of

769
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,899
that bottleneck II it's it's like you

770
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:49,530
didn't think of it like a trailer or a

771
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,570
road

772
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:54,089
you can't take turns anymore so you

773
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:56,039
can't you can't go back it's like you

774
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:57,808
can't get there from here like I say no

775
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:59,428
we're the weird neighborhood like this

776
00:28:57,808 --> 00:29:01,379
one over here I got lost in trying to

777
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:02,669
find them back road you can't get them

778
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,650
from here we have you got on the eight

779
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:07,140
blocks to get there it's not just not

780
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:09,269
doable no it's the same thing like I

781
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,910
just said you might be able to actually

782
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:14,308
get back there if you really you can

783
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,720
take that depressed loggin and go what

784
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:17,399
we're gonna grow that might be a time

785
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,289
once worth growing a million plants cuz

786
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,960
you look here's that one it's still back

787
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:24,240
genetics don't ever really go away but

788
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,720
you need huge numbers to find the things

789
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,069
that get in again that aren't in there

790
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,390
then the bottleneck people really hide

791
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:34,889
those so with the inbreeding the thing

792
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,660
is that once you're gonna impede

793
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,220
something you really need to make the

794
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,650
right choices which in a lot of cases

795
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,319
means you need to make yourself lots of

796
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:45,750
options so you can go back through those

797
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:47,759
again otherwise you're gonna get lost on

798
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,099
that trail you're going to go the wrong

799
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,048
way and you'll never

800
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:53,359
get back there but if you make lots of

801
00:29:51,048 --> 00:29:54,798
options it's like you know it's like

802
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,869
being in a corn maze and you'll just

803
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:01,038
walk through or we can get back to the

804
00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:05,750
right spot you know so that's really the

805
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:07,669
key and my point being on my belief is

806
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,980
that inbreeding depression is a myth

807
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:12,440
that's popularized by people making poor

808
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,269
selections just like with bad hips on

809
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,649
Bob's it's not because they're hip bread

810
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:19,069
it's because they're in bread with that

811
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:20,898
tricks you know in Sicily you know it's

812
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:24,378
in the selection process so that's my

813
00:30:20,898 --> 00:30:26,479
take on on that I think it's always an

814
00:30:24,378 --> 00:30:29,148
option to bring back vigor through

815
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,528
through hybridization and that's that's

816
00:30:29,148 --> 00:30:32,449
practical if you can find something

817
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:34,009
that's really similar to where it

818
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,528
doesn't really matter then you're like

819
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:37,849
okay well this is really tired and I

820
00:30:36,528 --> 00:30:39,710
have this other thing that has all the

821
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:40,969
same traits it'll be easy to fix it back

822
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,548
up and we'll be back there and

823
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:47,720
revitalize it but you don't just want to

824
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:50,480
bring something in just to try to fix

825
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,610
everything back up if possible you want

826
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,740
to you want to make the right choices

827
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:58,009
first and after a while what you'll have

828
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,500
that you know you won't look at anger

829
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:02,419
allow this is amazing pure line that

830
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,759
actually can outperform everything and

831
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:07,220
it's true reading and it's incredible

832
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:09,129
stuff but not so you get that horses

833
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,900
dogs plants that are prepped properly

834
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:13,700
nobody looks at it because of inbreeding

835
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,769
depression is strong it's no good

836
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,080
anymore we'll still have the maintain

837
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:19,519
that that proper line and then it will

838
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:23,869
be over now on line so that's though

839
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,308
that's my take on you know how the

840
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:27,409
problems that you face with you in

841
00:31:25,308 --> 00:31:29,480
reading stuff versus hike relaxation you

842
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:31,580
know hybridization is like that quick

843
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,410
shortcut to try to fix something back up

844
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:35,480
but in reality it's gonna create all

845
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:37,250
this work to try to get now we got to

846
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,990
get back to square one you know so you

847
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:43,849
want to make the right choices to start

848
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:46,308
and give yourself options there's a

849
00:31:43,849 --> 00:31:48,259
great scope of feel out aggression and

850
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:50,960
what it means is that over time while

851
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:53,480
things reach the average and so if

852
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,548
you're putting quality products together

853
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,079
and you're making the selections

854
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:58,700
correctly than what you'll have is

855
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:01,639
you'll have an overall higher average

856
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,500
over the course of time and when he was

857
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,790
talking about the in breed people

858
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,148
believe that inbred stuff is terrible

859
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:09,418
because we look at it reading

860
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:11,608
the Royals where you had no that's

861
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:12,869
really good example because that was

862
00:32:11,608 --> 00:32:15,088
something that was common and then you

863
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:18,028
seen in dogs and horses but they're in

864
00:32:15,088 --> 00:32:20,249
reading to fix trades and then a good

865
00:32:18,028 --> 00:32:21,959
reader is pulling out the outliers that

866
00:32:20,249 --> 00:32:23,429
have the qualities they want and they

867
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:25,769
put those back together but there's a

868
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:27,419
culling process and an animal breeding

869
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:29,219
they're calling them again Riddick and

870
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:31,139
plant breeding it's the same thing or

871
00:32:29,219 --> 00:32:34,229
calling out you being very discerning as

872
00:32:31,138 --> 00:32:36,058
to what you're using and if you're able

873
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:38,369
to take a look at the work that you're

874
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:39,989
doing you can see the direction in red

875
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:41,638
lines are crucial because really that's

876
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:43,709
the only way you can take a trait that

877
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:46,288
you want and put it on top of another

878
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:48,149
plan and so lines that you build and

879
00:32:46,288 --> 00:32:51,199
develop that have characteristics you

880
00:32:48,148 --> 00:32:52,948
hold and then you can use those as

881
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:54,778
material that you would want to out

882
00:32:52,949 --> 00:32:56,939
cross to bring in other traits and

883
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:59,278
qualities but you can take inbred lines

884
00:32:56,939 --> 00:33:02,308
that are similar so I can have plan a

885
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:05,128
plan B Plan C plan D and I can run these

886
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:07,648
two concurrent lines same genetic base

887
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:09,568
but we steered them differently and we

888
00:33:07,648 --> 00:33:12,568
can bounce them against each other down

889
00:33:09,568 --> 00:33:15,269
the road if we want to see these what we

890
00:33:12,568 --> 00:33:16,828
believe like vigor increases but it's

891
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:19,169
really about tightening up the groups

892
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,999
you working with initially and making

893
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:22,799
good selections and a lot of times

894
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,689
you're gonna make more selections you're

895
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,189
gonna find out you chose a plant that

896
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:28,469
when it breeds it doesn't read those

897
00:33:26,189 --> 00:33:29,849
traits back and that's why I think it's

898
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:31,828
hard for a lot of people because you

899
00:33:29,848 --> 00:33:33,808
have to hold this material you have to

900
00:33:31,828 --> 00:33:35,428
hold seed stock you have to hold the

901
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:38,219
garage mater's that you're using the

902
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:39,839
male or the female and then it gets to

903
00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:42,899
being tough it's hard to hold large

904
00:33:39,838 --> 00:33:45,239
libraries and that's why for me I like

905
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:47,458
working with people in conjunction where

906
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:48,778
you do something someone else does

907
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,729
something and then the two of you can

908
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:52,409
kind of work together to say hey let's

909
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:54,088
chase intellectually to chase the

910
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:55,499
direction and then together we'll be

911
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:57,538
able to solve the problem in a little

912
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:59,429
bit better fashion so that the plant

913
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:01,709
populations can be smaller for the

914
00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:04,439
individual the amount of material you

915
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:05,578
have to hold to be smaller and the

916
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:07,229
people that you work at what they're

917
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:08,998
going to see things you don't there's

918
00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:11,128
nobody's really all-knowing no matter

919
00:34:08,998 --> 00:34:13,199
what you do and sort of have an ability

920
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:15,929
to to chase it from different directions

921
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,689
to have other individuals working on

922
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:21,898
these projects is so like you smash it

923
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:24,028
really helps but it allows you a lot

924
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:28,288
better chance to find what you're trying

925
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:29,878
to do great answer so I think that

926
00:34:28,289 --> 00:34:32,220
there's a whole range of questions we

927
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:34,429
could ask so we left we love the 10

928
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:40,349
minutes being from the audience hasn't

929
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:43,099
microphones you left looks like Jesse's

930
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:43,099
gonna control up

931
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:49,780
start an idea

932
00:34:54,858 --> 00:35:02,598
in my on you are okay I'm really

933
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:05,719
impressed this panel is the most of the

934
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:10,509
president reading panel I've encountered

935
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:10,509
years and so thank you

936
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:23,539
being a troublemaker my question is why

937
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:26,299
haven't you mentioned epigenetics you

938
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:28,400
know the the advancing learning we have

939
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,500
about epigenetic gene expression is

940
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,750
totally transforming that the

941
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,429
evolutionary conversation the breeding

942
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:37,280
conversation the reproduction

943
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:39,500
conversation what's your guys take on

944
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,340
whatever genetics fits into your

945
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,340
conversation

946
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:55,848
I love that I think it's funny because

947
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:58,130
it where we learned so much about how

948
00:35:55,849 --> 00:36:00,740
information it's move down through genes

949
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:03,380
that I think really we're almost

950
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:04,909
ignorant so what I know is that every

951
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:08,300
time I think I know something I find out

952
00:36:04,909 --> 00:36:09,618
I don't know that much and and that's

953
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,269
how I feel about epigenetics you know

954
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:13,910
we're talking about genetic movement

955
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:15,608
through fourteen generations material

956
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:18,469
can be remembered you can have a

957
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:20,838
transfer of information that moves

958
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:22,819
through time and and how does the end

959
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:25,400
how does the environment influence that

960
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:28,280
how does the cultivators direction

961
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,139
influence that and I would think that we

962
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,210
really understand that well because we

963
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:35,179
worked off of these very simplified

964
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:36,920
reading with methodologies and then when

965
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:39,409
we start to get into scientific reading

966
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,000
it was basically from markers but the

967
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:43,940
understanding of how information moves

968
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,019
through time and what the impact is is

969
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,880
something I don't think we really

970
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:49,088
understand that

971
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,849
we don't honestly and I know that it's

972
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:54,509
it's a huge conversation that's coming

973
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:57,789
but it's one that has to happen with

974
00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:59,228
cultivators geneticists and readers so

975
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:00,969
we can take a look and figure out you

976
00:36:59,228 --> 00:37:03,218
know what through time and the problem

977
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:05,979
of cannabis is that a lot of the older

978
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:08,229
material is gone and a lot of the older

979
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:10,899
people that started the product project

980
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:12,639
is gone and so now what you're kind of

981
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,650
in the middle of the picture moving

982
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,199
forward so it's hard to really figure

983
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:19,389
out what moves from the past where were

984
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:20,739
we we kind of know where we are and we

985
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:22,318
know what we want to go about I don't

986
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:25,179
think we really know what we were and

987
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:27,728
we've cut back so much of the native

988
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:29,469
populations around the globe which can't

989
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:32,618
really go back and start the sources

990
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:35,409
material instruct to compare it on a DNA

991
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:38,400
level to see what what changed and what

992
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:41,858
didn't change and why so I think that

993
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,389
the question is brilliant it's just that

994
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:46,989
I don't think any of us at this point I

995
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:48,319
really qualified to steer it you know no

996
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:50,389
one knows

997
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,789
but it's fascinating to see that

998
00:37:50,389 --> 00:37:54,319
truthful information we discover that's

999
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:56,750
why healing is a no talent skip a

1000
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,780
generation but you'll see families in

1001
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:01,550
anything plant people animal where

1002
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,250
there's just unbelievable traits that

1003
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:05,930
move through time and I can capture it

1004
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:07,969
it's hard but for some reason it seems

1005
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:17,449
that the same to the traffic and then

1006
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:20,209
there's things that get lost in

1007
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:23,509
listening I've heard all three of you

1008
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:26,300
state things that it sounds to me would

1009
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:30,740
amalgamate really really well testing

1010
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:34,390
like torture for instance which is so

1011
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:40,000
that it gets easier and easier for some

1012
00:38:34,389 --> 00:38:42,759
reason given genetic if we do this your

1013
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,820
if you do that you're good to this is

1014
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:50,460
what you're asking

1015
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:54,330
but Kathleen Kennedy combined scientific

1016
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:57,539
rating what we're looking at pretty much

1017
00:38:54,329 --> 00:39:01,099
having to have a lab tech in the process

1018
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:04,949
on the vest in your reading and

1019
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:07,769
preserves hybrid vigor of like taking a

1020
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:09,960
parent line splitting off if you looking

1021
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:12,659
for different traits but with the same

1022
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,240
initial genetics and breeding for

1023
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:17,819
specific traits that are desirable there

1024
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:21,179
then bring those lines back and by doing

1025
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:24,870
that not be introducing alien evidence

1026
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:26,699
but regaining hybrid I think that's

1027
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:29,039
totally possible especially like I said

1028
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:32,219
the parents that you first chose from

1029
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:34,409
are both genetically stable and Hardy as

1030
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:36,779
long as you're picking the traits that

1031
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:38,519
are furthering the genetics I think that

1032
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,440
you know going for there even with

1033
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:42,389
violence you know it'd be great to use

1034
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,700
decisive scientific you know versa

1035
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:47,339
basically saying in all your Janek

1036
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:48,869
seeing what like even you know about a

1037
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,579
pathogens evil thing you know what can

1038
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,380
handle what without even having done you

1039
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:58,319
know torture your plants you know as I

1040
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:59,519
was saying honestly with in with in

1041
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,340
keeping with it genex that you

1042
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:07,440
personally keep with and stabilizing

1043
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:09,150
with just the choice of you know terpene

1044
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,380
profile the cannabinoid profile that's

1045
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,970
the best thing of scientists that we

1046
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,740
have is that we can test our candidates

1047
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:16,019
now we couldn't do that you know just

1048
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:19,379
years ago you know that we're fighting

1049
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:20,880
new cameras I've th TV you know I didn't

1050
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,789
even realize there was cannabinoids that

1051
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,079
we there's 130 something wasn't our

1052
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:30,869
third plus right so it's crazy I mean

1053
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:33,029
canvas has more of a genetic background

1054
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:36,030
than humans they have like I think it's

1055
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:39,540
maybe 48 don't quote me and humans

1056
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:41,460
haven't we 32 so with canvas it's so

1057
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:43,588
much more complex than even humans it's

1058
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:49,289
it's we're still learning with it and

1059
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:50,670
it's amazing yeah in any thing that we

1060
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:53,159
consider pure there's still those

1061
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:55,680
variations and you might discover like

1062
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:57,659
okay well we have these ones that this

1063
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,579
one really has the trophies we want but

1064
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:01,920
this will really ask the resistance and

1065
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:03,900
you can go ahead and breathe those water

1066
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,579
and even if they were originally the

1067
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,710
same if you breed them apart for long

1068
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:09,539
enough and do what you're saying

1069
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,769
this is you know it's lion greeting so

1070
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:12,690
you make these different lines of the

1071
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:14,820
same thing when you come and you put

1072
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:18,150
them back together you'll actually get

1073
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:20,250
some hybrid vigor again even though it's

1074
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,639
the same thing and when you do that then

1075
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,798
all of a sudden you're going to have

1076
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:25,568
both of those lines so it's really worth

1077
00:41:23,798 --> 00:41:28,119
like what I like to do with anything

1078
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:30,068
even if I considered all one thing I

1079
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:32,019
have all these different lines that go

1080
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:33,909
in different directions and after a

1081
00:41:32,018 --> 00:41:35,618
while different ones prove to do

1082
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:38,409
different things and you can really use

1083
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:40,329
them to come back together to the trivia

1084
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:42,518
bingo so that it is really valuable and

1085
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:44,410
I mean it's really common you look at it

1086
00:41:42,518 --> 00:41:45,759
with like the dog where you go visit

1087
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:48,190
these Rottweilers they've been in

1088
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,309
California for 85 years and they've been

1089
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:53,440
pregnant really really well and you know

1090
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm you know you go ahead and read of

1091
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,690
what something that somebody still has

1092
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,190
and Germany and make these new dogs and

1093
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,809
it's like you know that you might not

1094
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:04,088
descend up with this dog breath it's

1095
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:05,920
just Dockery that's incredible and it's

1096
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:07,420
really the same breed that's just raw

1097
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,159
Beiler's but they're really not the same

1098
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:12,250
because there there are different lines

1099
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:13,568
and so by doing that that would be a way

1100
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,548
like we were talking about with like bad

1101
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:17,288
hips with dogs you could go all of a

1102
00:42:15,548 --> 00:42:20,048
sudden okay well we just brought it the

1103
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:23,619
same thing but they're prepared what was

1104
00:42:20,048 --> 00:42:25,179
messed up by by the inbreeding and so

1105
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:26,559
you doing the different lines is really

1106
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:28,868
good and I like to do that I don't like

1107
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,210
to just run one direction really fast

1108
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:33,849
get it all there I like to take it in a

1109
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:35,470
few different directions of go okay this

1110
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:37,630
is the one this is going to be the one

1111
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:38,539
that's that's great with the smell a

1112
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,340
taste it's

1113
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:42,050
and this one over here has all the

1114
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,940
resistance and it's purple they were

1115
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:45,650
originally the same thing then you have

1116
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:48,710
these two versions and then when you put

1117
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:50,750
it back together it's like you you you

1118
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,639
remade it and when you remade it it

1119
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,650
actually made it better than it was when

1120
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,779
you started but it's still the same

1121
00:42:54,650 --> 00:43:00,110
thing so you really can't do it and it's

1122
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:02,630
worthwhile and it is one of the more

1123
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:07,970
practical things you could do in a

1124
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:09,980
program for sure in any major crop and

1125
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:13,609
major crop just means commoditizing and

1126
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:16,309
globally right scorn me it's ten years

1127
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:19,130
on a development cycle so three years of

1128
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:21,289
locating markers and of the three years

1129
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:23,510
of putting together your reading lines

1130
00:43:21,289 --> 00:43:25,820
and then four years of running out those

1131
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,990
lines and you're running thousands of

1132
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,600
lines and you're looking through

1133
00:43:26,989 --> 00:43:31,489
millions of plants to find what you're

1134
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,849
really looking for as these parental

1135
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:36,500
lines that that lets you get that type

1136
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:38,299
of stability that people believe will

1137
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,679
you buy pakka seeds for vegetables you

1138
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,100
see a stability that you don't quite

1139
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,219
understand how much

1140
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:46,829
type one into it and the problem that we

1141
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:48,869
have is that in cannabis because it is

1142
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:50,159
in a better but tech drives cannabis

1143
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:52,650
it's where the most of the investment is

1144
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,839
coming from so tech expectations' are

1145
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:57,599
insolent Amiens to them 18 months I

1146
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,400
forget a lifetime but in cannabis that's

1147
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,920
just--that's that's a season and a half

1148
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,869
outdoor and that's maybe you know five

1149
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,059
or six runs inside way they really did

1150
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:08,279
some huntin and looking it's not a big

1151
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:11,039
deal and I think that most people just

1152
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:13,980
lack the funding and so there is no

1153
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:16,170
heavily funded reading operations where

1154
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,570
people can go and really chase this

1155
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:20,639
stuff down the road like these things

1156
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,950
that you want but without having to make

1157
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:26,159
concessions financially can't you can't

1158
00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:29,339
play Frankenstein without a castle

1159
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:31,079
filled with goodies to do that and I

1160
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:33,470
don't know how many people have it and I

1161
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:35,900
don't I don't think that

1162
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:37,609
tech industry is pushing cannabis that

1163
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,559
the understanding that you might be in

1164
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:43,070
business in ten years because to me Tech

1165
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:45,289
has just unbelievably problem and it's

1166
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:49,100
changed the way we approach cannabis and

1167
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:51,230
so to me you can get a longer view and

1168
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:53,029
realize that it's going to take a longer

1169
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,980
amount of time to stabilize and get

1170
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:56,900
those things that you'll have them but

1171
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,280
if it takes major agricultural

1172
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,730
corporations that have unlimited

1173
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:04,670
resources and technology he can't touch

1174
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:07,219
and it takes them ten years and a

1175
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:08,930
million a selection to get there it's

1176
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:10,969
not hard for us to do it the way we do

1177
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:13,609
it and we get lucky people outliers out

1178
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:15,739
the work but the stability that people

1179
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:18,410
believe you should have in cannabis

1180
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:20,869
based off of what they purchased from

1181
00:45:18,409 --> 00:45:24,139
other agricultural commodities in any

1182
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:26,389
form is so different is so skewed

1183
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:28,329
between those two groups and I think you

1184
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:30,949
have to rein your expectations in and

1185
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:32,929
and that's what the population start to

1186
00:45:30,949 --> 00:45:34,699
work and you start to say hey I have

1187
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:36,409
stuff that works in this direction I got

1188
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:37,759
something nasty Gina I want you to check

1189
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:40,489
it out and see if you can work with it

1190
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,990
and a lot of quality material she said

1191
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:44,059
Gina I've got some nasty stuff I want to

1192
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,529
play with you on this and all the sudden

1193
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:47,900
aerator the team up like I talked

1194
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:49,880
earlier but this help way one individual

1195
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:52,039
is gonna fund that level of reading

1196
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:55,099
project with over the course of time

1197
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:57,730
because nobody can really make decisions

1198
00:45:55,099 --> 00:46:00,619
on what the public's taste about of me

1199
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:02,690
it's a stranger's your kind of market

1200
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:04,460
and so the problem is that whatever is

1201
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,260
hot is what's hot so anything that's hot

1202
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,449
this year everything's crossed into it I

1203
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,890
don't give you [ __ ] every year show me

1204
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:12,469
what's hot and I'll show you single

1205
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:14,690
pollen in 240 of the hot cuts next year

1206
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:16,879
forty of the hot rocks or any that hot

1207
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:19,750
goes and it's I called strange ashore

1208
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,519
and the problem with that is it doesn't

1209
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:25,599
build anything of any stability which is

1210
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:27,190
what you're seeking all righty so I

1211
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,349
think that might bring us to noon to

1212
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:32,820
have time then when I tell you guys are

1213
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:32,819
lovely people join me give me a hand

1214
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,309
