00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,888
one thing that the Internet has not been

3
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,589
very good at yet is providing quality

4
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:15,509
information there's a lot of information

5
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,609
and if you dig through it read it all

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,618
and educate yourself you can eventually

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,320
become a good judge of informations

8
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:24,629
quality too but if any topic is new to

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,429
you good luck getting good clean

10
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:27,989
information without reading all of the

11
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:30,268
information available in becoming an

12
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:33,269
expert yourself this applies especially

13
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:36,629
to cannabis and that aspect of cannabis

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,489
legalization is such a drag patients are

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,440
literally dying while trying to learn

16
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:42,570
about accurate cannabis dosing and

17
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,670
watching videos on how to make feek Oh

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,378
other patients are trying to figure out

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,689
how to make full plant tinctures and

20
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:51,030
every tincture recipe is different and

21
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:54,119
most of them are poorly written and some

22
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,370
are straight-up ineffective fake new

00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,589
sites and other media sources that are

24
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:01,649
not really fake but rather just repeat

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,170
dumb analysis are everywhere people with

26

no expertise write about cannabis policy

today welcome to the show max thanks

66
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:32,459
Shengo i'm glad to be here with you my

67
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,650
friend i'm glad you could make the time

68
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,719
so so let's start by giving folks a

69
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,460
little context about where you're coming

70
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,530
from because you know i understand that

71
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,530
you helped Deepak Chopra develop his

72
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,640
video outreach program but tell us a

73
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,710
little bit about that and how it

74
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,889
informed your vision for what green

75
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:52,950
flower media was to become yeah it's

76
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:56,189
it's hard to even embrace this now but

77
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:58,019
over a decade ago I was the director of

78
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:00,990
consumer products for the Chopra Center

79
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:05,090
which is Deepak Chopra's Wellness Center

80
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:09,230
and just to paint a picture if you will

81
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:12,479
at that time this was way before

82
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:15,959
meditation yoga Ayurveda mind-body

83
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:19,739
medicine was deemed acceptable and

84
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,560
popular and in fact it was it has an

85
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:26,810
eerie coincidence or an eerie similarity

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,840
to the cannabis space because in that

87
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,909
world people saw meditation and yoga as

88
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,819
something that people only on the fringe

89
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:37,859
did that there was no science to it that

90
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,930
it was going to kind of disrupt your

91
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,750
life you know there was all these

92
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,060
stigmas attached to it and over the

93
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,889
course of you know was the seven years

94
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,129
that that I was there and the team that

95
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:53,549
we built we really did some unbelievable

96
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:56,250
things two distinct eyes meditation in

97
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:59,010
my body medicine in yoga and to really

98
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,349
get the message out to tens of millions

99
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:04,109
of people through you know online

100
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:07,079
campaigns and the meditation challenge

101
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,959
that now is I just heard has been taken

102
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,930
by a half a million people this year at

103
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,780
the Chopra Center and it was a really

104
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,540
fascinating experience to take something

105
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,180
that was so fringe and really integrated

106
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,939
into mainstream and so you know in

107
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,120
cannabis it feels just like this unusual

108
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:29,449
path that I've already walked

109
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,430
for but this time it's with something I

110
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:33,169
have an even deeper relationship with

111
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,780
because I've been a cannabis user for

112
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:38,870
decades and I also you know in a funny

113
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:40,698
way I think that it's cannabis is even

114
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,120
bigger than mind-body medicine because I

115
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:45,800
always say you know I I taught some of

116
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,439
the biggest stars and celebrities in the

117
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,810
world how to meditate and when you would

118
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:53,660
teach these people you would always say

119
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,720
to them look you have to do this every

120
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,820
day for 21 days for it you to really

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,990
start to notice some benefit because you

122
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:01,399
know if anybody's ever meditated before

123
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,780
you know like the first time you stood

124
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,978
under meditate you feel like oh so I'm

125
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:05,649
just going to sit here for 20 minutes

126
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:08,478
and let my mind drive me freaking nuts

127
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:10,579
and and it takes a little bit to like

128
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,918
get the hang of it and you know use the

129
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:15,529
tools and work through it and with

130
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:17,478
cannabis it's like you know I put an

131
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:19,819
arthritis arthritis cream on my

132
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:21,709
grandfather's hands and in 30 minutes

133
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:24,379
all of a sudden he could move his

134
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:27,168
fingers again you know I gave my mother

135
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:30,560
who hadn't slept in three decades a

136
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:32,180
little bit of a you know a chew and she

137
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,209
slept through the night that same night

138
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,978
and so you know when you combine the

139
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,589
fact that I think this plant has the

140
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:41,418
capacity to impact hundreds of millions

141
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,369
of people in so many different ways and

142
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:44,750
that it's so quickly effective I just

143
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,879
feel really excited about the path that

144
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,098
we're on so yeah I have this kind of

145
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,959
funny background of taking things that

146
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:53,029
have been highly stigmatized and yet

147
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,698
also highly effective and helping them

148
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:57,769
come to come into the mainstream it's

149
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:00,050
kind of funny how all the puzzle pieces

150
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:01,909
fit together so elegantly when you look

151
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,680
backwards isn't it because it's like you

152
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,180
know looking back we can see you know

153
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,180
the kind of programs you put together at

154
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,038
the Chopra also then with the marriage

155
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,050
of the technology that you were learning

156
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,478
and managing their it pretty much gave

157
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,418
you a full skill set to do exactly what

158
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,098
you're doing now in the cannabis space I

159
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:21,049
mean I think you know on some level the

160
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:23,509
universe is always conspiring in our

161
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,788
favor if we're paying attention it just

162
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:29,449
takes people being willing to take some

163
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:32,000
risks and for me you know I see cannabis

164
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:35,080
as a health and wellness movement and so

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,908
that have that background but I also see

166
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,500
cannabis as something that needs really

167
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:43,039
good education to

168
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,959
change the stigma and for what we've you

169
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,960
know really done at green flower it's

170
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:51,319
about changing stigma to me is about to

171
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:53,779
core things one it's about knowledge

172
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,779
because people are just misinformed and

173
00:06:53,779 --> 00:07:00,409
once you start to learn about anything

174
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:02,689
you quickly realize the truth right so

175
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,220
that happened with meditation and I

176
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,259
think that's happening with cannabis now

177
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,250
and and in cannabis it's just such a

178
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:11,779
diverse rich topic full of so much

179
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,970
fascinating knowledge so that's one part

180
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:16,250
to changing stigma is just doing a

181
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,200
better and better job of education and

182
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,110
then the second part of that is people

183
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,629
is the the more credible the more

184
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:27,410
high-level the more authoritative the

185
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:29,750
more celebrity you bring into something

186
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,570
the more it starts to change public

187
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,000
persona and change the perception of

188
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:36,469
what this thing is and so you know when

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,259
I was at Chopra I had this just

190
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,390
unusually long list of people that I

191
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:45,110
dealt with of celebrities that were sick

192
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:48,139
you know celebrities business moguls you

193
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,720
know high level people and you realize

194
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:52,668
that people are just people no matter

195
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,710
how big of a star they are no matter

196
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:56,719
where they come from they're just people

197
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:59,389
and and when you treat people like

198
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,300
regular people then it gets better and

199
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:03,978
better and you can kind of allow that

200
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,660
relationship to become more and more

201
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:07,909
comfortable and I think with cannabis

202
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,070
it's again it's the same darn thing

203
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,950
where people might be highly stigmatized

204
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:14,769
but I'm getting into bigger and bigger

205
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:17,269
circles right now more and more

206
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:20,449
celebrity-driven affluent driven people

207
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:22,519
that are using cannabis because they're

208
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:24,649
not sleeping or because they got cancer

209
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,939
or because they have pain or whatever

210
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:27,799
else it is and so you know I'm very

211
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:30,439
proud to have people like Eugene Monroe

212
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,288
who's become such an industry advocate

213
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,479
who is a major part of green flower and

214
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:37,218
people like Steve DeAngelo who's you

215
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,780
know been an activist for so long to be

216
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:40,610
a part of green flower and I feel like

217
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,468
we can just keep doing those two things

218
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,169
education and people education and

219
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,310
people then I'm convinced that within 10

220
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:47,990
years it'll be the same thing that

221
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:50,059
happened to Chopra will have cannabis

222
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,500
shops on every corner and tens of

223
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:52,159
millions of people will be benefiting

224
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,049
from the plant

225
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,919
in a more public way and you know i

226
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:59,179
think it's a it's a really interesting

227
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:01,490
interesting thing to be doing now with

228
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:04,309
the background that i have it really is

229
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:07,278
amazing the reach that green flower

230
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:08,778
media has put together in such a well

231
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,000
feels like to me a short period of time

232
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:13,879
the first time i heard about your

233
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,679
company was kung going into the cannabis

234
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:17,329
health summit that you had I don't know

235
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,309
maybe maybe was year and a half two

236
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:20,958
years ago now and the funny thing was is

237
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:23,149
you know I'm knee-deep in the cannabis

238
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,099
industry but i didn't i didn't get

239
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:27,889
contacted directly i actually heard

240
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,009
about it from a non cannabis aunt who

241
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:32,778
sent me a newsletter that you all put

242
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:34,159
out and said oh look at this great

243
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:35,179
Canada's health summit it might be

244
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,679
something that you would be interested

245
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:39,169
in Shango and you know what she was

246
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:41,528
totally right and so and I was stoked

247
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:45,588
that you had all these you know amazing

248
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:47,149
cannabis health experts that were all

249
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:48,290
going to be streaming for free and I'm

250
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:50,208
like oh man I'm gonna sign up for this

251
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:52,159
so I sign up for it and over the course

252
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:54,049
of the weekend I probably caught heck I

253
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,448
probably caught eight speakers or so and

254
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:57,948
then and then you know and then after

255
00:09:56,448 --> 00:10:00,109
that you did the cannabis entrepreneur

256
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:03,019
summit which I was very grateful to have

257
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,759
been invited to so so my question for

258
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,409
you is that you know when you put

259
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,480
together one of these summits it's like

260
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:10,669
two days it's all the top minds in

261
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,069
cannabis and these are really busy

262
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:15,740
people I can imagine getting all these

263
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:17,688
folks together over one weekend was like

264
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,879
herding cats did you find it challenging

265
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:24,549
to pull everybody together at the same

266
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:27,409
place well here's the thing about

267
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:29,719
experts and this is something I've

268
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:31,698
learned after being in the kind of

269
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,129
experts business for a decade because

270
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:36,500
after I left Chopra I started a company

271
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:39,230
that trained over 8,000 thought leaders

272
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,639
on how to build digital marketing

273
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,100
systems to get their knowledge and their

274
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,769
wisdom out into the world and so I have

275
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,860
this kind of deep vast experience with

276
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:52,639
network with experts and what I've

277
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:55,818
learned is that when somebody acquires

278
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:59,240
enough knowledge to feel like they have

279
00:10:55,818 --> 00:11:02,240
something of value to share what people

280
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,549
are really looking for most is two

281
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,659
things they're looking for a platform

282
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:07,099
right we want

283
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:09,759
be able to reach more people and

284
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,740
secondly we're looking for ways to

285
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:16,340
enhance our visibility and credibility

286
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:18,080
in greater ways and so it actually

287
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,470
wasn't terribly difficult to get people

288
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,440
together because we knew that with our

289
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,180
marketing channels and the strategies

290
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,800
that we put in place in the background

291
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:30,259
that my team has I have been a

292
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,799
remarkable team or 13 people deep now of

293
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:36,200
you know true experts in kind of digital

294
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:38,839
publishing that our reach was going to

295
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,610
be huge and then with the other part of

296
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,860
my team that works with people on

297
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,680
content we knew that we could help

298
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,019
people become better speakers better

299
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,459
presenters and that the production

300
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:51,889
quality of what we were going to do

301
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,920
because my for example my executive

302
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:57,470
producer was 30 years at Marvel and

303
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:59,569
Disney and Fox and spotlight

304
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,810
entertainment and so between our

305
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,700
production and our marketing we could

306
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:06,979
invite people into something that was of

307
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,320
true value and true benefit to them and

308
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,909
do it in a way that that really lifted

309
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,740
up their credibility and helped him get

310
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:14,389
their message out and so actually the

311
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,490
hardest thing was not getting people

312
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:18,789
together the hardest thing was deciding

313
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:21,680
who we want it because we are

314
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:23,779
perpetually being contacted by so many

315
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,939
people around the world that think

316
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:27,740
they're experts or or or maybe our

317
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,680
experts but not at the level we

318
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,740
necessarily want them to be at and so

319
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:34,609
the hardest parts actually the filtering

320
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,409
right because everybody wants to

321
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,000
participate because they they can smell

322
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:40,219
a good thing well especially with how

323
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,649
big your reach was you know I didn't

324
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,139
actually hear the follow up what was the

325
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:48,139
public response to this sort of large

326
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:49,490
free online event because you know I had

327
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:51,350
never heard of anything like this

328
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,299
happening in Canada this before did

329
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:57,200
people respond to it other than you know

330
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:59,779
my aunt and I so we had 28,000 people

331
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,009
tuned in to the first cannabis health

332
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,850
summit which by the way was just in

333
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:06,409
January of 2016 so no my gosh I said it

334
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,170
was two years ago I'll tell you guys

335
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:10,669
right right right we had twenty eight

336
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:13,039
thousand twenty one thousand three

337
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:14,689
hundred people from I don't remember

338
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,629
exactly but I think goes from like 55

339
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:19,250
countries or some some unbelievable

340
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,990
diversity of people and

341
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,080
and the cannabis entrepreneur summit had

342
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:28,129
ten thousand eight hundred people attend

343
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,500
that particular event and it really did

344
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:32,179
help put us on the map if you will in

345
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,250
terms of people seeing what we could do

346
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:36,919
and it was cool again I don't know the

347
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:39,769
exact numbers but I want to say that

348
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:42,829
between those two events people watch

349
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:45,919
something like 2.5 million minutes of

350
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:48,259
content over those two days or over

351
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,549
those two events I mean and it's been

352
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:52,220
very exciting you know speaking of

353
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:55,129
retweet we also have started live

354
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,990
streaming just individual classes every

355
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:59,600
week on green flower people can go and

356
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,610
they can sign up to watch any live class

357
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,700
basically we're doing multiple live

358
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:07,970
streams a week and we also just recently

359
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,610
pulled those stats and have had 3.9

360
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:14,210
million minutes of livestream class

361
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:16,700
content watch this year as well so it's

362
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,560
been it's been phenomenal to see the

363
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,140
level of engagement in reach and I think

364
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,089
it comes back to the fact that there's

365
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:24,740
very few places where people can go to

366
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,019
learn about the plant right now and

367
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,419
especially learn from the most credible

368
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:31,009
experts and so we've just built a really

369
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:32,870
nice ecosystem we also built our own

370
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:34,700
technology platform to run the whole

371
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,799
thing so that it's got a nice user

372
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,050
experience so it's a it's a cool thing

373
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,579
we're doing and I think it's really

374
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:42,649
providing a service that people are

375
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,170
really grateful for you know especially

376
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:47,480
as we get bigger and bigger yeah that's

377
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:50,149
a lot of minutes I can imagine that it's

378
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,960
probably the most dense cannabis

379
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,370
education event that there's ever been I

380
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,440
mean that many people learning about

381
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,149
cannabis cannabis medicine and cannabis

382
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,270
business all at the same time it's

383
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:03,470
actually pretty astonishing so thanks

384
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:05,689

are that you will like audio books too

390
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:21,019
pretty much audio books are like

391
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,909
podcasts except with less stuttering

392
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:26,149
better production quality and more

393
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:28,458
targeted topics yeah I know I make audio

394
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:31,129
books sound better than a podcast and

395
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:32,839

396

449
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,710
founder and CEO of green

450
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,440
our media so before the break we were

451
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,569
talking about you know just how many

452
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,970
people that you're reaching now with

453
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:55,549
green flower and how behind it is the

454
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,589
structure of technology and experienced

455
00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:00,049
people and you know one of the things

456
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:02,029
that occurs to me is that you know over

457
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:04,609
the time that that I've been following

458
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:06,559
green flower it does feel like you have

459
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:09,319
changed the direction or the business

460
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,450
model at least once and you know so many

461
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:13,099
entrepreneurs they're either they're

462
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,590
either you know poo-pooed by their

463
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:17,179
friends for changing or they themselves

464
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:19,220
a more changing the direction of their

465
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,259
company but I've always thought that you

466
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,769
know it's important to be sensitive to

467
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:26,089
what your audience wants would you share

468
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:28,309
for a little bit you know what your

469
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:30,949
experience has been over the the Ark of

470
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:33,440
green flower so far and and how the

471
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,990
business model has evolved yeah

472
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,480
absolutely um so I should start by

473
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:43,490
saying that I'm a huge subscriber and

474
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,190
student of what's called the Lean

475
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,819
Startup model by a guy named Eric Ries

476
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:52,070
and the Lean Startup model basically has

477
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:55,750
a philosophy which says that when you're

478
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:59,629
building a new business you should be

479
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:02,539
testing everything and you know instead

480
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,190
of being concerned about it quite

481
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:06,289
frankly even what your customers think

482
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,600
or what your team things or what your

483
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:10,789
investors think or whatever it is that

484
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:12,199
that everything is an experiment and

485
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:15,769
that in the beginning you should

486
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,130
experiment as much as possible and so I

487
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:20,539
say that because our first experiment

488
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:24,020
was more of what I would call a

489
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:25,909
traditional media company and and the

490
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:28,279
reason I even entered the cannabis space

491
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:32,120
as an entrepreneur if you will is

492
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:35,599
because I saw huge massive void and that

493
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:40,339
void was no high-quality cannabis

494
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:42,709
content that demonstrated the other side

495
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:44,599
of the stigma right and that that

496
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,720
basically the way I looked at it is the

497
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:50,480
vast majority of material that was out

498
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,360
there wasn't portraying cannabis

499
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,769
properly and so when you start thinking

500
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,019
about businesses we thought well we

501
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:58,879
could reach you know zillions of people

502
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:01,190
and the business model would be based

503
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,200
upon a media company that reaches a lot

504
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,180
of people which is ie an advertising

505
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,980
model right there there's there's

506
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:10,100
different business models for media

507
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:13,370
companies and so we started going down

508
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:15,769
that path and the premise behind a media

509
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:17,329
company like that is you produce as much

510
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:18,920
content as you can you get as many

511
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:21,619
eyeballs as you can and then you sell

512
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,900
advertisements well while we were

513
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:26,839
getting a lot of eyeballs and we were

514
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:29,240
getting a lot of traction with the tribe

515
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:31,429
if you will we were barely selling any

516
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,980
advertisements and it was starting to

517
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:36,799
get pretty scary because we just were

518
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:40,339
not couldn't see a path in sight to be

519
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:43,639
able to sustain the kind of impact that

520
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:46,069
I am here on this planet to make for

521
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,590
better or worse and the kind of person

522
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:52,129
that is a hundred percent driven by

523
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:54,529
global impact and and by big massive

524
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,020
global impact and so you know when I

525
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:58,700
looked at green flower originally I was

526
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:00,619
thinking well for that to get to that

527
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,700
level you know it takes basically we

528
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:06,829
take a lot of money yeah and so when the

529
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,480
business model was quite frankly failing

530
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:09,710
I mean I that's how one could say like

531
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,130
we were generating a little bit of

532
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:15,200
income but but nowhere near the kind of

533
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:17,510
numbers that I knew was necessary to

534
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,180
create a business that would sustain

535
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:22,789
itself we had to really look deep in

536
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,710
hard and this is where you know the

537
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:27,829
funny thing about my past re converges

538
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:29,990
because in media there's there's really

539
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:32,119
only two models when it comes down to it

540
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:34,220
there's there's an ad model which is

541
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:35,629
based upon publishing free content and

542
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,730
then there's a premium model which is

543
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,910
based upon producing content that people

544
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:43,339
are willing to buy and I actually have

545
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:46,070
had a much deeper background in premium

546
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:48,019
but I just didn't start there and so we

547
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:50,269
just pivoted we pivoted to being a

548
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:52,579
premium content business if you will

549
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:54,289
that was based upon creating content

550
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:56,869
people were willing to pay for and

551
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:59,659
that's a different kind of content it's

552
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:02,809
more educational it's more how-to it's

553
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:06,350
much deeper it's its content that's

554
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:08,599
designed to provide specific value to

555
00:22:06,349 --> 00:22:09,509
somebody based upon a problem or a

556
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:11,939
desire that they

557
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:13,440
have and it was the greatest decision we

558
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,840
could have made because one there was

559
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,880
very few people doing this and if they

560
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,829
were they weren't doing it well but also

561
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,890
it was Twite friend quite frankly just

562
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:25,379
much more in our sweet spot as well from

563
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,880
our experience and our depth and really

564
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,190
were able to carve out this kind of

565
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,710
beautiful niche that is working very

566
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:34,049
well both in the financial side but also

567
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:36,210
in terms of you know where we feel most

568
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:37,619
comfortable playing yeah I believe that

569
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,509
about the place where you feel most

570
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:41,879
comfortable playing too because one of

571
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:44,460
the challenges with advertising as a

572
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,560
model for media companies is you know

573
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:50,009
you're always aware of what your

574
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,750
advertisers want and yet I know you to

575
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:55,140
be somebody who's very service oriented

576
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:57,990
to humans I can imagine that a premium

577
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,570
model where the audience is helping pay

578
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:03,120
for the content is way more you know

579
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:06,480
emotionally effective for you because

580
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:08,969
that way your loyalties are not split

581
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,890
between advertisers and the audience

582
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,509
it's everything you that you can do for

583
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,090
the audience to create value for them is

584
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:16,230
is what you you know was what you're

585
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:18,779
supposed to be doing i can see that

586
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,870
fitting a lot better and the nice thing

587
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:26,250
about it for for us as well is that it

588
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:29,039
really does allow us to use our tribe as

589
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:31,769
i call it or our audience if you will to

590
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,470
guide the direction of where we go right

591
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:36,569
because a premium content model if i was

592
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,490
to get really granular for a moment it's

593
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:41,159
really actually just about solving

594
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:44,190
problems for people that they believe

595
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,170
are valuable enough to pay for and and

596
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,809
so when you start moving into premium

597
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:51,509
content it's just saying how do we

598
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:54,179
create increasingly more valuable

599
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:56,789
content and we do that by asking people

600
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:59,220
you know we at this point we've got tens

601
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:01,349
of thousands of data points because of

602
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,630
our technology about what are the issues

603
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:06,809
people are struggling with so you know

604
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:09,360
for example one of our most popular

605
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:11,909
classes was about cannabis and

606
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:14,519
creativity and that was because people

607
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:16,740
were really struggling to find a way to

608
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,529
use cannabis to enhance their creativity

609
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,450
without making them anxious and and I

610
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:22,440
wouldn't have thought that right that

611
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,610
was a that

612
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,820
something that I wouldn't have known

613
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:28,319
unless our audience told us like hey

614
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:30,619
here's a problem I'm having a lot of

615
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:33,148
people that are creative we're either

616
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:35,008
getting really anxious or they weren't

617
00:24:33,148 --> 00:24:36,898
finding the right way of doing it to

618
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:38,669
enhance the the way they think about

619
00:24:36,898 --> 00:24:40,949
stuff and it just kind of was a

620
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:44,909
surprising data point for us but because

621
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:47,220
our model is based upon creating more

622
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:49,139
and more valuable content for the people

623
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,730
that are paying for it you know it's

624
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:52,648
become a nice kind of self-perpetuating

625
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,929
loop to design stuff that's really

626
00:24:52,648 --> 00:24:57,000
valuable to them I think that makes a

627
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:59,490
really good case to for listening to

628
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,648
your customer base for everybody who's

629
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:04,109
listening who's an entrepreneur that you

630
00:25:01,648 --> 00:25:05,849
can get really great insight if you're

631
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:07,829
making sure you read the emails that are

632
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:09,839
coming in your email box from your

633
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:11,730
customers they they can show you roads

634
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,558
that you had not considered yourself and

635
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:16,288
you have to ask I mean it's really

636
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:19,740
uncomfortable to ask people for what

637
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:21,658
what to do not even went to two but what

638
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,638
what to do better you know I mean really

639
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,200
that's at the end of the day that's what

640
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:26,908
it is it's like how do we serve you

641
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,340
better what are we not what are we not

642
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:31,470
doing that you'd like us to do what are

643
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:33,928
we doing wrong and it's it's a very

644
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,308
uncomfortable experience because you

645
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:36,840
know everybody wants to have all the

646
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:40,319
answers but again that's also very much

647
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:42,349
a Lean Startup principle is you want to

648
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,720
be constantly trying stuff and then

649
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:48,869
reviewing how people responded to it so

650
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,610
yeah it's it's necessary i think quite

651
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:52,469
frankly well while we're talking about

652
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:54,479
uncomfortable things about being an

653
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,100
entrepreneur and running a start-up

654
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,960
let's talk about raising money real

655
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:59,759
quick you know entrepreneurs are often

656
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,590
really shy to the fact that they have to

657
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,509
raise money and I know that you've

658
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:05,579
raised money successfully for a few

659
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:08,159
businesses what advice do you have for

660
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:11,250
cannabis entrepreneurs who are raising

661
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,830
their own capital so actually just to

662
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,558
clarify this is the first business that

663
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:18,808
I had I've had to raise real money for

664
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,009
em you know I've raised you know a few

665
00:26:18,808 --> 00:26:22,200
hundred thousand dollars here and there

666
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:23,669
for other stuff but but you know friends

667
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,319
and family and my network wasn't that

668
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:27,450
difficult this was the first business

669
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:29,638
where I had to fully go out and hit the

670
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:32,850
road and go pitch and do that whole

671
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:34,769
thing and holy smokes I tell everybody i

672
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:36,000
know these days that it's them it was

673
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:37,769
the deepest

674
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,289
and still continues to be the deepest

675
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:42,180
and most profound learning curve I've

676
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:46,109
ever gone on in my professional career

677
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:47,460
so i'll start by saying raising money is

678
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:51,539
definitely not for the faint at heart

679
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,789
and I've I failed more times than I've

680
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:56,789
ever failed at anything in my entire

681
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:59,849
career so far at raising money and

682
00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:02,129
that's been really humbling so that's

683
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:05,369
the first thing I would say is is it you

684
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:09,000
have to be really prepared to deal with

685
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:11,189
rejection in a way that um I just I just

686
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,170
wasn't I mean I wasn't thinking it was

687
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,330
going to be this hard so that's the

688
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:18,480
first thing I'm saying the second thing

689
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:20,359
I would say is that I've learned some

690
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,880
really fascinating things about

691
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:26,909
investors in this last period we've now

692
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,330
raised a few million dollars and one of

693
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:32,340
the things that I've learned is that

694
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:34,589
people always think that you need to go

695
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:37,230
and pitch an investor and that you know

696
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:38,849
they're basically they're the prize in

697
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,309
some level psychologically what's

698
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:43,919
happening for people is I need your

699
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:46,169
money you know I need to impress you

700
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,539
you're the person that that that's the

701
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:50,279
prize here and you know the greatest

702
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,409
thing I've learned in this process is

703
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:55,289
that if you have that attitude you're

704
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:57,360
done it's just not going to work that

705
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:58,829
you have to come up with the ways of

706
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,899
thinking about yourself and your

707
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:03,599
business and what you're doing and the

708
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,870
energy that you cultivate and the story

709
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:09,389
you tell and the way you approach people

710
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:12,569
so that you're the prize and that that

711
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:16,350
you're giving them an opportunity to get

712
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:19,139
into playing with you because if they

713
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:21,269
feel like you're chasing them you're

714
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,190
never going to close a deal but if they

715
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:26,700
feel like they're going to miss

716
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:28,350
something by not chasing you that's when

717
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,690
people start to actually write checks

718
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:32,399
and so I mean I could talk to you for

719
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,440
literally days on the investment thing

720
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,710
but that's the single most important

721
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,730
lesson that I've learned is you have to

722
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,370
psychologically turn the tables to

723
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:43,650
making you the prize even if you're just

724
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:45,059
starting out that makes a lot of sense

725
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:47,730
because you're removing that duality

726
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:48,750
that that I'm negotiating with you and

727
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,849
your the other and

728
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,640
dead your you're stepping across a line

729
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:55,439
and you know embracing what it is they

730
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,080
want for themselves so now you're on the

731
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,840
same side and I'm sure that the the

732
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:04,259
capital conversation becomes way way

733
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:07,529
easier at that point uh-huh I'd like to

734
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:10,640
say any part of its easy it's I think

735
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:13,980
that raising money is arguably the most

736
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,200
difficult business task on the planet

737
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:19,349
but you know speaking to the startup

738
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,240
side of things the reason why I love

739
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:23,909
business actually has nothing to do with

740
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,920
money I'm not a very money driven person

741
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:29,009
even though I think it's very important

742
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:31,230
to focus on money I'm driven buying

743
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:33,390
business by two things primarily one is

744
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,640
impact as I said many times before I

745
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,710
think that's my number one motivation as

746
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,940
I feel like before here on this earth

747
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,890
we're here to do something that

748
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:44,250
contributes so that's my number one

749
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:46,920
drive but the second is the leadership

750
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:50,160
opportunity or you could say it is a

751
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,620
leadership challenge and raising money

752
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,480
is is so far been the single greatest

753
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:56,879
leadership challenge I've had to take on

754
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,740
in business thus far and if you can

755
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,020
frame it that way I hear most people I

756
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:04,529
hate raising money that's the worst and

757
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:06,690
it could be really hard but it's an

758
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:10,349
amazing leadership challenge to step

759
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:13,650
into and I have learned more about the

760
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:16,889
psychology of desire and persuasion and

761
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:18,870
urgency by becoming better and better

762
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,420
raising money than any single activity

763
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:22,859
I've done in the history of my career

764
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:24,090
thank you for that max we're going to

765
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:26,729
take another short break and be right

766
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:28,619

shaping fire businesses everywhere are

769
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,630
constantly striving to reach out to

770
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,580
people through advertising we all know

771
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,470
though that trying to reach a cannabis

772
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:42,359
audience with a quality message is

773
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,279
actually pretty difficult that's why

774
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,639
many people choose to advertise on the

775
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:49,769
shaping fire podcast advertising on this

776
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,230
show allows us time to talk about your

777
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:54,240
product service or brand in a way that

778
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,910
really lets people know what sets your

779
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,039
company apart from the others bold

780
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,570
people who own companies know that

781
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,778
getting in a relationship with their

782
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:04,928
customers is

783
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:07,089
essential and that is what we offer we

784
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:09,940

785
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:11,829
what sets it apart as desirable and will

786
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,979
help our audience get in contact with

787
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:15,939
you it's really pretty simple

788
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:18,940
advertising does not have to be all

789
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,979
whiz-bang smoke and mirrors nowadays I

790
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,288
find that people prefer just to be

791
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:25,869
spoken to calmly accurately and with

792
00:31:23,288 --> 00:31:27,608
good intentions if you want to make your

793
00:31:25,868 --> 00:31:30,608
own commercial spot you can totally do

794
00:31:27,608 --> 00:31:32,710

795
00:31:30,608 --> 00:31:35,319

lowes and our guest this week is max

814
00:32:16,148 --> 00:32:21,008
Simon founder and CEO of green flower

815
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:23,858
media so so far we've been talking a

816
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:26,019
whole lot about the nature of a cannabis

817
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:29,199
start up and running a business with

818
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:31,778
integrity and you know just trying to

819
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,058
build a company in this very unusual

820
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:35,919
cannabis industry but I want to talk

821
00:32:34,058 --> 00:32:37,538
more specifically now about the content

822
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,028
because at the heart of it you are a

823
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:42,128
publishing company and and you are

824
00:32:40,028 --> 00:32:43,690
trying to find content that people want

825
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:45,878
to hear as you as you mentioned in the

826
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:48,548
last set you know your goal is to find

827
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:50,738
out problems that people have and try to

828
00:32:48,548 --> 00:32:52,538
solve it for them so so let's talk about

829
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:54,729
some of your free events that are coming

830
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:57,278
up in the new year so that folks can get

831
00:32:54,729 --> 00:32:59,169
an idea of the kind of content you are

832
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:04,898
producing what's coming up for green

833
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:09,190
flower media so we have learned that

834
00:33:04,898 --> 00:33:11,768
there's basically four areas in this

835
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:15,110
cannabis movement where people have a

836
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:18,950
strong desire to learn so one area

837
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:22,189
is the health vertical and that camp

838
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:25,190
encapsulate everything from how do I use

839
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:27,980
this for my specific ailment how do I

840
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,900
treat other people or recommend this to

841
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,279
other people you know what's the

842
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,110
difference between cannabinoids and

843
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,629
terpenes or how do I use them to my

844
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:38,479
benefit you know that there's about a

845
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:41,390
zillion things that people want and need

846
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,269
to know about cannabis and health so we

847
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:46,880
have a tremendous diversity of classes

848
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:48,798
in those places I would say so far

849
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,830
that's probably been our strongest place

850
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:53,298
because well because it look and a lot

851
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,529
of our health background a lot of people

852
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:57,379
on the team of a very strong health

853
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:59,089
background including myself um so

854
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,220
classes like cannabis and pregnancy

855
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:03,730
coming up you know about whether it's

856
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,319
safe or not and we have cannabis and

857
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,789
Alzheimer's in cannabis and opiate pain

858
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,769
and all you know just some really

859
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:12,949
interesting classes there with with

860
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:14,780
famous doctors and mind-body medicine

861
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:17,230
practitioners and all sorts of

862
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,600
interesting people the second vertical

863
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:23,389
is the industry vertical and that's all

864
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:24,949
about starting or building or succeeding

865
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:26,750
in this cannabis industry you know we

866
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:29,210
have classes with you coming out Shango

867
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,010
and we have classes around investing we

868
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:33,260
have classes around compliance in

869
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:35,899
classes around protecting your cannabis

870
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,850
brand and classes around building a

871
00:34:35,898 --> 00:34:40,128
cannabis brand you know those there's a

872
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:42,279
pretty diverse range of really

873
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:44,750
fascinating topics coming out there

874
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,100
steno Steve D'Angelo's doing a whole

875
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,739
thing about what he's learned from

876
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:52,519
building the world's largest cannabis

877
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:55,309
brand essentially and we have that whole

878
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:57,710
sector vertical then we have the science

879
00:34:55,309 --> 00:35:00,858
vertical which is all about the biology

880
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:03,289
and chemistry and ways to work with the

881
00:35:00,858 --> 00:35:05,059
plant so I'm really thrilled that we've

882
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:06,409
developed some amazing partnerships in

883
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:09,650
that area like the cannabis science

884
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:11,449
conference where that entire conference

885
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,519
will actually be made available to our

886
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:15,980
insiders which is our membership program

887
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:17,300
and the Emerald scientific conference as

888
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,789
well as another one that we've partnered

889
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,200
with where their entire three-day

890
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:22,829
conference will be included to our

891
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,199
insider portal and

892
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:28,229
includes everything from extraction to

893
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:30,328
the ways of working with the plant and

894
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:33,409
growing the plant and genetics and and

895
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:36,420
that whole kind of amazingly rich

896
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:38,578
category of content and then finally we

897
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:42,239
have what we call our DIY vertical which

898
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:44,609
is all about basically cooking growing

899
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:46,228
making your own products and tinctures

900
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:49,228
and that kind of thing it's working with

901
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:51,208
the plant and we have a whole slew of

902
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:53,098
really interesting classes and that one

903
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:55,139
as well growing indoor and outdoor and

904
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,088
working with some of the real legends in

905
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:59,219
the cultivation space we won't name them

906
00:35:57,088 --> 00:36:01,409
for now until it comes out but but

907
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:03,289
really you know the legends in the space

908
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:07,228
that have been doing this for decades so

909
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:09,809
all of that content is really we have a

910
00:36:07,228 --> 00:36:13,078
really interesting model where because

911
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:16,019
our number one desire is impact we

912
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:19,318
always live stream these classes first

913
00:36:16,018 --> 00:36:22,558
for free so every week multiple times a

914
00:36:19,318 --> 00:36:24,449
week people can tune in to the website

915
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,969
and they can register for these classes

916
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:28,978
for free and they can watch in real time

917
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:31,170
and if that's all that happens then

918
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:32,848
that's amazing and we have right now you

919
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,159
know thousands and thousands of people

920
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:36,989
every week that are tuning in but then

921
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:40,199
we also have this ability for people to

922
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:42,079
basically unlock the entire library for

923
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:45,329
you know it's just 18 bucks a month and

924
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:48,180
and so you know we have a lot of cool

925
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:50,430
stuff coming up cool and since we're

926
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:52,919
tantalizing folks I want to give you the

927
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:55,139
URL right now and we'll say us again at

928
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,079
the end of the show but you know if you

929
00:36:55,139 --> 00:37:01,889
want to attend some of these free online

930
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:05,910
events you can go to shaping fire calm

931
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:07,588
forward slash green flower to sign up

932
00:37:05,909 --> 00:37:09,629
for those and you know because of the

933
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:12,778
nature of podcasts that they that their

934
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,579
online forever if you are listening to

935
00:37:12,778 --> 00:37:16,708
the show in the future you can still go

936
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:20,339
to shaping fire calm green flower and

937
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:22,858
it'll be a constantly refreshed list so

938
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:24,929
it's always going to be evergreen so max

939
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:26,639
you know as far as finding these topics

940
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:29,219
you know you professed earlier that you

941
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:31,018
paid a lot of attention to your audience

942
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:34,230
so that you knew what the kind of

943
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:35,608
problems you can solve for them

944
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,889
what is your what do you find us your

945
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:40,079
best way to get feedback from your

946
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:43,019
audience which is you know tens and tens

947
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:47,299
of thousands of people deep now yeah

948
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:50,219
we're over 75,000 now actually um and

949
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:53,730
you know I think it goes back to just

950
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:56,339
the idea of making it a muscle so for us

951
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:58,349
at least you'll find once you register

952
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,600
for any of these classes the moment you

953
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:02,460
register we say hey tell us what you

954
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:04,920
want to know and and so in our

955
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,409
technology it's now built in every class

956
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,480
we're gathering people's questions and

957
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:11,579
in many cases we're actually answering

958
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,030
them live like right on the spot during

959
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:18,500
the class and so that's one way that we

960
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:21,869
do it what we're also you know we have a

961
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:24,119
certain set of values of how we operate

962
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:27,630
here at green flower and one of those

963
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:29,940
values is to be open and curious and for

964
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,650
us what that means is that you know

965
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,240
we're human and people often times

966
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,670
forget companies are like made up of

967
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:37,139
actual just real people and and as a

968
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:40,530
team of people we make mistakes

969
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:43,409
sometimes or we do something wrong or we

970
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:44,940
you know find ourselves having made a

971
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:48,029
decision that wasn't the right thing and

972
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:50,309
we're just always trying to be to

973
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:53,100
communicate that we're very open and

974
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:54,960
curious with everybody to tell us you

975
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:56,969
know if they have feedback or if they

976
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,280
have some kind of guidance that will

977
00:38:56,969 --> 00:39:02,129
help us so I think one of its just kind

978
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,170
of tactical you know ask ask more ask

979
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,269
more frequently asked in every way that

980
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:09,030
you can but then the other way is is a

981
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:11,190
value set that's really served served us

982
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:13,109
and certainly served me in my life many

983
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,420
times is just being kind of humble

984
00:39:13,108 --> 00:39:16,769
enough to say you know to tell us if

985
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,108
there's something else we can do to make

986
00:39:16,769 --> 00:39:20,909
this better for you how did how did that

987
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:22,500
play into the development of the

988
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:25,079
cannabis health challenge I've been

989
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,050
seeing new advertising for that all over

990
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:29,940
the place right now that's so that's a

991
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,560
funny thing where I'll just say first

992
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,019
we're really excited about this cannabis

993
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:36,029
health challenge which basically what

994
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:38,789
we're doing is it's an online challenge

995
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:41,670
that for ten days we're going to release

996
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:43,590
a daily video that will teach and

997
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:46,710
educate people about how to use cannabis

998
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:48,390
responsibly and perform three

999
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,608
health enhancing activities so there's

1000
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:53,549
cannabis and fitness cannabis and food

1001
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:54,719
and cannabis and reflection and we're

1002
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:58,920
going to be kind of guiding people

1003
00:39:54,719 --> 00:40:00,659
through it as a community and it's gonna

1004
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,430
be so cool well there's a lot of really

1005
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:05,730
you know amazing people taking part in

1006
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:07,259
it you was one of them but that that's

1007
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,940
one of those things while speaking of

1008
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,480
our values so we have other value that

1009
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:15,358
says break new ground and for us this

1010
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,900
was actually just a very strong gut

1011
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:22,889
decision of my mind particularly because

1012
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:24,329
I'm a I'm a very very active healthy

1013
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:26,519
person and cannabis has become a

1014
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:28,559
substantial part of that and so you know

1015
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,719
I have I live out here in Ojai

1016
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,309
California this beautiful mountain town

1017
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,129
and we have these gorgeous outdoor

1018
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:37,230
trails and about three days a week I'll

1019
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:39,720
go for a pretty long trail run with

1020
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:41,250
cannabis and I had go on these trail

1021
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:43,348
runs and I just kept getting this

1022
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,630
message over and over again I'm running

1023
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:47,430
on this trail and puffing away you gotta

1024
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:48,358
do a health pounds you've got to do it

1025
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:49,769
because I used to do stuff like this

1026
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:50,730
with Chopra and I did stuff like some

1027
00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:53,639
other companies these beats online

1028
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:56,460
challenges and so it was just a gut

1029
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:58,440
instinct to say let's let's do this as a

1030
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:01,769
community and see if we can really

1031
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,838
inspire our cannabis community to come

1032
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:07,530
together and really prove to ourselves

1033
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:10,170
and others that can if it can be a true

1034
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:12,119
life enhancing activity so um it's been

1035
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:14,400
really exciting to see the response so

1036
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,750
far and you know I'm excited for

1037
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,940
everybody to take part of that and again

1038
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,800
they can find that through that URL that

1039
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,440
you mentioned before in terms of how

1040
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,900
they can register for that so max before

1041
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,838
we go you know I wanted to talk about

1042
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:30,358
this this tagline that I'm hearing about

1043
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,099
green flower media in the press I'm

1044
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:34,440
reading folks refer to your new

1045
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:36,930
subscription service as the netflix of

1046
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,210
cannabis and those are some pretty big

1047
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:41,279
boots to fill do you think the tagline

1048
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:45,088
fits for what green flower media has

1049
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,070
become well so yes and no i mean the the

1050
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:49,380
thing that that the reason why they're

1051
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:51,330
calling us that is because we have this

1052
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:54,630
program called green flower insider and

1053
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:57,869
as an insider what it means is that

1054
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:59,759
every single live class that we do which

1055
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:01,979
is multiple times a week

1056
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:05,329
gets added to this ever growing library

1057
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:08,638
and for you know it's 18 bucks a month

1058
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:10,829
people can watch unlimited cannabis

1059
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:14,579
classes including every new one that

1060
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:16,499
comes in and so in that way we're just

1061
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:18,778
like Netflix because we have this you

1062
00:42:16,498 --> 00:42:20,578
know ever growing library of really

1063
00:42:18,778 --> 00:42:22,708
credible cannabis education in cannabis

1064
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,539
classes and cannabis material that

1065
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:26,668
people can can enjoy anytime they want

1066
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:30,059
and you know can binge watch as much as

1067
00:42:26,668 --> 00:42:33,148
they want um where it where we differ is

1068
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:36,419
that are our content is really more like

1069
00:42:33,148 --> 00:42:37,888
classes you know and in that regard we

1070
00:42:36,418 --> 00:42:40,528
have a different model which is more

1071
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:43,229
like a Linda calm or au Domini or a

1072
00:42:40,528 --> 00:42:46,108
creative live because we're actually

1073
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:48,058
teaching people and so for for most of

1074
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:51,318
the cases you know if you were to go to

1075
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:53,489
a cannabis seminar or a cannabis event

1076
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,719
you know you'd have to spend hundreds

1077
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:56,099
and hundreds of dollars or sometimes

1078
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,318
thousands of dollars to go and listen to

1079
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:00,179
these people speak to learn and we have

1080
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:02,788
those same thousands and thousands of

1081
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:05,398
dollars of education but it's just 18

1082
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:07,649
bucks a month and so we love that that

1083
00:43:05,398 --> 00:43:09,898
people are seeing how big what it is

1084
00:43:07,648 --> 00:43:12,208
that we're doing but because we're so

1085
00:43:09,898 --> 00:43:14,009
education focused and value driven and

1086
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:17,719
Netflix is more of an entertainment

1087
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:20,159
platform it kind of works but it also it

1088
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:21,630
doesn't you know and we kind of see

1089
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,639
ourselves more as we would compare

1090
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:25,278
ourselves more like a Linda calm of

1091
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:27,419
cannabis more than a Netflix but

1092
00:43:25,278 --> 00:43:29,809
certainly the fact that that we unlock

1093
00:43:27,418 --> 00:43:31,978
every class in our library keeping both

1094
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:33,359
less than the price of a pizza is

1095
00:43:31,978 --> 00:43:35,578
something that people have been really

1096
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:37,409
excited about yeah well i certainly get

1097
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:39,059
the excitement I feel it too it's you

1098
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:41,729
know even though I spend most of my time

1099
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:43,349
interviewing folks and getting to learn

1100
00:43:41,728 --> 00:43:45,538
about exactly what I want to learn in

1101
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:47,579
cannabis it's always nice to see what

1102
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,319
the new addition is to the library so

1103
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:50,909
that you know in the evening when I mean

1104
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:52,259
dinner or something I can watch and

1105
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:54,898
learn something that I didn't already

1106
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:56,248
know well max thank you so much for all

1107
