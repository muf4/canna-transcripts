1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,569
welcome take a look thank you all for

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,219
having me here I but I hadn't been to

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,888
one of your meetings before so I wasn't

4
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:16,919
sure how formal it was and now that I

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:19,500
see how warm and Kathleen everyone's

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,920
gonna have a seat instead of standing up

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:32,250
and try and pontificating and um and now

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:36,679
I also regret not wearing shorts so I

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:40,920
plan for today is to just go through a a

10
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:45,058
topical understanding of how cannabis

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,100
relates to Parkinson's and to tell you a

12
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:50,280
little bit about how people here on

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,698
Vashon are already getting relief from

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,629
symptoms using very specific types of

15
00:00:53,698 --> 00:01:01,439
cannabis so I want to be clear at the

16
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:05,759
outset that I am NOT a doctor I do not

17
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:09,239
have formal medical training however I

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,728
have been working with patients across

19
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:15,919
the board including Parkinson's patients

20
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:19,890
for the last five years on my podcast

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,609
called shaping fire I interview the top

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,868
doctors in the world on a range of

23
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:29,519
health issues including Parkinson's and

24
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:31,978
and I have been working one-on-one with

25
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,750
patients for several years now so that I

26
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,539
get to see and experience their

27
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,989
individual experiences because as we all

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:45,180
know Parkinson's manifests differently

29
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:47,589
for different folks so with that said if

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,409
you feel inspired by anything that

31
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:53,530
sure with you today please be sure to

32
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:55,990
not drastically change your medicine or

33
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,718
do anything drastic like that without

34
00:01:55,989 --> 00:02:00,728
checking in with your primary doctor

35
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:04,000
don't don't make any big change just

36
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:05,828
based on what I'm saying here today the

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,169
information I'm hoping to share with you

38
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:10,359
today is to supplement the research that

39
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:14,048
you're probably already doing on your

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:17,340
own so that so that you have access to

41
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:20,379
nice clean information about Parkinson's

42
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,569
because as we all know if you look up

43
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:27,180
any information on the Internet your

44
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:30,810
your mileage may vary on its quality so

45
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:35,920
in addition to being an educator of

46
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:38,739
patients and doctors how to use cannabis

47
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:42,219
or also known as marijuana in the clinic

48
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:45,539
I also have a weekly podcast and I'm

49
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:49,590
also the founder of the Vashon Island

50
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:51,489
marijuana enthusiasts Alliance and

51
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,859
originally when we started the

52
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:56,799
organization the organization was going

53
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:59,019
to be a training organization for all of

54
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,510
the medical marijuana companies that had

55
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:03,879
started on Vashon and there were over a

56
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:09,669
hundred of them small cottage businesses

57
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:12,789
that were supplying cannabis and edibles

58
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:15,208
and oils and various products to the

59
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:19,750
Medical dispensaries across the state

60
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:22,719
but unfortunately Washington has changed

61
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,579
gears and dismantled the medical

62
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:28,989
marijuana program in the state and

63
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:30,760
because of that the companies that the

64
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:33,819
cottage industries that have started on

65
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:35,679
the island were no longer legal and most

66
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:38,078
of them didn't have the

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,909
it took to become a licensed company in

68
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:42,879
the state which you know most people put

69
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:45,310
between 250 and 500 thousand dollars and

70
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,959
so with that the organization of the

71
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,688
island transitioned to be primarily

72
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,639
patient outreach and education and we

73
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:56,858
get together about every six weeks at

74
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,200
the Grange Hall and we have a guest

75
00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:02,260
speaker come in really world-class

76
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,658
speakers and then they'll come in and

77
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:07,229
teach about either cannabis medicine or

78
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:09,840
about the botany of the cannabis plant

79
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:14,590
so that's what's happening here on

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:20,048
Vashon and and who I am so before I get

81
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:22,509
into the specifics of both the

82
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:25,448
precursors to Parkinson's and how

83
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:28,240
cannabis can help a lot jump to the end

84
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:31,449
first so that you kind of know where

85
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,978
we're going what we're seeing on mash on

86
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:41,169
is very significant reduction in the

87
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:45,120
symptoms of Parkinson's patients and as

88
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:47,560
you know the most obvious health is in

89
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,668
symptoms that are involved with motor

90
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:54,610
skills so so tremors and and stooping

91
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:58,629
and muscle clenching you know all

92
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:00,430
different muscle sets and and people

93
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:02,439
started Parkinson's patients started

94
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,530
coming to the meetings at the Grange

95
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:07,000
Hall and asking questions and then one

96
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:09,038
way or another they were getting their

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,478
hands on the appropriate cannabis

98
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,689
medicine which I'll talk about a little

99
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:17,110
more later and the results have been

100
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:18,969
astounding much to my surprise none of

101
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,970
the Parkinson's patients I work with on

102
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,560
the island are actually here but maybe

103
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,500
it's because they're already familiar

104
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,269
with what I'm going to say today but let

105
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,569
me tell you about one particular patient

106
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:35,318
which I think really really

107
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:39,218
stands out so I was working with this

108
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:41,619
fella he's in his early 60s and his

109
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:46,778
Parkinson's had progressed to motor

110
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:48,849
skills issues and and he had he had

111
00:05:46,778 --> 00:05:52,269
tremors in his right arm

112
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:54,759
he had muscle muscle clenching that was

113
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:56,740
causing his hand to stay closed most of

114
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,649
the time and the two that he really

115
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,629
hated he had muscle clenching in his

116
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:04,598
back which was causing him to stoop and

117
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:07,119
then caused him to shovel and he really

118
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:09,038
disliked the shuffling because he felt

119
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:12,909
that that telegraphed to other people

120
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:14,740
that he wasn't feeling 100% and and that

121
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:16,180
changed the nature of the conversation

122
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,369
people wanted to have with him they want

123
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,528
to talk to him about just stuff they

124
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:24,009
wanted to talk to him about his stooping

125
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:26,528
and that annoyed him and so his wife

126
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:28,749
came to one of the meetings and she got

127
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:31,088
some more information and then she was

128
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:34,449
able to get a t-shirt for him and took

129
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:36,189
it home and and you know sometimes I

130
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,999
hear back from patients and sometimes I

131
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:45,009
don't but I heard from her not three

132
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:47,649
days later and she came by my house and

133
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:49,209
she she started with giving me a big hug

134
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:51,348
and I'm like all right at least I know

135
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:55,038
this is a good meeting

136
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:57,468
and after giving me a big hug she said

137
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:01,068
I've got to tell you what happened this

138
00:06:57,468 --> 00:07:02,509
morning and she said you know my husband

139
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:05,749
has just been getting worse and worse

140
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:07,038
over the last few years and you know and

141
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:08,869
with all the things that I don't already

142
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:12,558
told you about and she said this morning

143
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:15,229
while I was preparing breakfast she said

144
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:18,110
I heard the lawnmower at first time in

145
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:21,740
years and she stopped what she was doing

146
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:24,499
and she went outside and her husband was

147
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:28,819
mowing the lawn with a big smile on his

148
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:30,588
face and she went over and hugged him he

149
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:32,689
turned off the mower for a moment they

150
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:37,038
talked and and he said it was the first

151
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:40,490
time in years that he was able to stand

152
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:43,579
up straight and felt loose that his his

153
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:46,788
his tremors had entirely disappeared at

154
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:48,918
least for that moment and he was not

155
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:53,269
shuffling and he was able to actually

156
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:55,848
exert force through his human without

157
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:58,370
losing balance and was able to mow the

158
00:07:55,848 --> 00:08:02,418
lawn and so even though they have a

159
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:04,968
conservative sized passive lon it was

160
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:08,120
obviously a big breakthrough for him and

161
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:12,079
and now we're almost a year and a half

162
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:15,620
after that day and except on the rare

163
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:19,519
occasion when he forgets to take his

164
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:24,079
canvas medication he is merely without

165
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:26,119
any visual symptoms that you can maybe

166
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,028
point him and say oh he must have

167
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:31,009
Parkinson's um except for sometimes at

168
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:32,599
the end of the day when he's tired I'll

169
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:34,430
be there at their house visiting and

170
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,069
he'll have a slight tremor in his hand

171
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:40,338
just from being maybe you know exhausted

172
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:46,578
from the day but for them it's been a

173
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:49,080
wild success and on Vashon I would say

174
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:54,659
that is a fair general as

175
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:58,230
of what of people's success the the the

176
00:08:54,659 --> 00:09:01,740
two things that I have found that most

177
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:04,289
impede people from having a positive

178
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:08,940
experience with cannabis and their

179
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:12,179
Parkinson's is number one just like with

180
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,190
pharmaceuticals each person is built a

181
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,769
little differently and it takes a little

182
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:20,760
bit of time at the beginning of taking

183
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:22,679
cannabis to find the right dosage and

184
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,569
combination so there's a little

185
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,149
experimentation at the beginning and

186
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,190
some folks don't have the temperament or

187
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,929
just patience for that they want they

188
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,899
want it all right now and they don't

189
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:36,028
want to have to experiment and and gosh

190
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,950
when I rep you miss journaling sometimes

191
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:40,950
people just rip out right eternally at

192
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,899
all but so some people they get

193
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:46,079
frustrated at the very beginning say

194
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:49,049
just like a week to you know dial in the

195
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:51,870
appropriate dosage and then second of

196
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:54,000
you know as as as we all know there's

197
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,730
still a lot of peer pressure against

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,649
cannabis from people who know it more as

199
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:03,509
a as a taboo drug from the early years

200
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:05,549
before we realized that that actually

201
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:07,828
it's an ancient herbal medicine that's

202
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:10,319
been used for by humans for over thirty

203
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:13,259
thousand years and it's only been in the

204
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,950
last 50 years that we haven't been using

205
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:19,289
it and that is the extraordinary anodd

206
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,000
part of our experience with it we

207
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:23,549
actually have a lot more of a history of

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,339
using it everyday for a wide range of

209
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:28,588
health issues instead of seeing

210
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,420
as as a negative thing in our culture so

211
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:33,930
those are the two main reasons trying to

212
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:37,049
dial in the dosage and also just you

213
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:39,419
know people succumbing to peer pressure

214
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:42,299
from people around them to not use it or

215
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:44,039
occasionally people just they just don't

216
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,979
feel good about it themselves because of

217
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,899
what I've been taught you know to each

218
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,850
their own but I am here to offer you

219
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:54,208
some information in case your mind is

220
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,860
open to using cannabis medicine how you

221
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:58,919
might want to think about that and how

222
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:05,188
you could approach it for your best

223
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:08,578
results so about 25 years ago we

224
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:11,129
discovered a new system in our bodies

225
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:14,838
that up to then had not been discovered

226
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:18,438
called the endocannabinoid system and

227
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:22,100
the endocannabinoid system is

228
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:25,139
fascinating because it produces

229
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,909
cannabinoids very similar to the ones

230
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:32,490
that are in marijuana in cannabis

231
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:37,049
correct when our bodies produce them

232
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:40,428
they are called endogenous cannabinoids

233
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:42,748
meaning produced inside of the body and

234
00:11:40,428 --> 00:11:43,799
when they're produced by the plant

235
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:46,110
they're called

236
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,948
phyto cannabinoids because they're made

237
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:52,470
by biosynthesis and I in a plant but

238
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:53,120
they're incredibly Simula similar to

239
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,269
each other

240
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,549
well our endocannabinoid system which up

241
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:02,490
to 25 years ago we were totally

242
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:06,419
unfamiliar with we now understand it to

243
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:09,928
be the master regulator for some two

244
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:11,490
dozen of our body's systems and it's

245
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:14,308
amazing that something that we believe a

246
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:19,529
master regulator was was unheard of for

247
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:22,319
so long the it regulates including

248
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:25,409
in the two dozen systems are your

249
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,330
likelihood for fight or flight your you

250
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:30,919
know your response to things that might

251
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:34,820
scare you or end you need to respond to

252
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:38,789
appetite and digestion your GI tract

253
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:41,520
sexual arousal the mix of chemicals in

254
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:44,219
your brain which also makes sense that

255
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,049
then it would also moderate anxiety and

256
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:50,399
depression your brain protection

257
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:51,599
maintenance systems that we'll be

258
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,039
talking about a lot today

259
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:59,009
and finally signaling issues for example

260
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:03,659
your toe reporting to your brain that

261
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:07,019
you stubbed it now you know when when

262
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:11,750
your endocannabinoids system gets

263
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:16,250
weakened there is now a scientifically

264
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:19,980
determined name for this called

265
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,559
endocannabinoid deficiency and what this

266
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,409
means is that you've got your

267
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:28,409
endocannabinoid system but your body is

268
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:32,399
not producing enough cannabinoids in

269
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:37,279
order to stay robust and run all of

270
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:40,829
these different vital body's systems and

271
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:46,740
you know what makes your endocannabinoid

272
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:49,620
system meat is pretty much definition of

273
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,049
living in the United States things that

274
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:56,629
can weaken your endocannabinoid system

275
00:13:52,049 --> 00:14:00,509
include stress questionable nutrition

276
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:08,669
using pharmaceuticals not getting enough

277
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:11,100
exercise and and long term anxiety or

278
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:15,990
depression so the idea is the more the

279
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,730
more that your body gets taxed the more

280
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,389
likely it is that your body is not

281
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,659
producing enough

282
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:27,939
the noise inside itself to take care of

283
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:29,879
all these systems also but not part of

284
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,380
the conversation today but also

285
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:36,700
associated with cannabinoid deficiency

286
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:42,059
our is fibromyalgia irritable bowel

287
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:46,000
syndrome and increased migraines so

288
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:48,819
cannabis by itself is a neuro protectant

289
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,919
and you know for years it was says that

290
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,709
said that you know cannabis makes you

291
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:56,799
dumb and people who pots to focus smoke

292
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:59,289
pot are are dumb and they get more more

293
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,719
dumb as they smoke more and even though

294
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:04,328
we may all have you know some life

295
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,070
experiences that may support that

296
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:08,278
evidence because we all know someone

297
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:11,050
who's lazy and also smokes marijuana

298
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:13,958
there's also a lot of brilliant people

299
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:18,370
who are very active and productive that

300
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:21,069
smoke cannabis and the way that cannabis

301
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:24,028
is a neuro protected is because of two

302
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:27,100
two two two things number one it causes

303
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:29,559
neurogenesis when you have enough

304
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:33,550
cannabinoids in your system your brain

305
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:35,169
actually produces more brain cells when

306
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:37,059
I was a kid I was told that once you

307
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:39,099
killed a brain cell that wasn't you

308
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:41,229
didn't get a chance to replace them but

309
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,360
modern science is showing us that that's

310
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:46,269
actually not the case we had just never

311
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,339
done the studies on cannabis which is

312
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:52,990
one of the few things that caused the

313
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:56,740
creation of new brain cells additionally

314
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:59,919
of cannabis working with the

315
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:03,329
endocannabinoid system helps moderate

316
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:06,399
which what is essentially the brain's

317
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:09,639
self-cleaning and ability to take out

318
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,339
the trash and so what happens and this

319
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:13,080
is one of the things that gets a lot of

320
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:16,470
interest from

321
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,810
Alzheimer's patients is that when your

322
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:22,590
brains doesn't take out the trash

323
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:26,879
regularly plaque starts to make a

324
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:30,170
buildup on the end of the neural endings

325
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,450
in the neural pathway and impedes

326
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:36,870
communication between different neurons

327
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:39,990
in the brain and this is eventually what

328
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:43,049
leads to Alzheimers well when you're

329
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:45,269
using cannabis of the correct way it

330
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:47,519
kick-starts your endocannabinoid system

331
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:51,449
and then and no cannabinoid system

332
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,519
starts cleaning your brain and warehouse

333
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:56,100
hi MERS patients I get all this rough

334
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,649
response up I'm feeling brighter I'm

335
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:03,570
feeling lighter I'm remembering more

336
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:05,250
things and and similarly we'll talk

337
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,320
about more of this in a moment but with

338
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,490
Parkinson's patients you're getting a

339
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:15,799
lot of the same benefit because

340
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:19,440
Parkinson's disease is associated with

341
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:23,099
compromised motor function after about

342
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:26,880
60 to 80 percent of the

343
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:31,439
dopamine-producing neurons are damaged

344
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:34,700
and so without the dopamine that's

345
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,710
produced by these particular neurons

346
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,750
this leads to the physical attributes

347
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,970
that come without that we're familiar

348
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,849
with with Parkinson's so what we want to

349
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:49,829
do is we want to protect those

350
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:53,490
dopamine-producing neurons as much as we

351
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:56,220
can and the fact that the

352
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:58,859
endocannabinoid system is causing our

353
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,819
brain to clean itself it can start to

354
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:11,639
clean and repair many of these dopamine

355
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:13,470
creating cells alright so so the last

356
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,900
thing I want to talk about on this

357
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,480
aspect is that you know I've talked a

358
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,220
little bit about the classic motor

359
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,440
symptoms so far which is usually how you

360
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,500
can identify someone third persons that

361
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,970
they may have Parkinson's but the some

362
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,308
of the other symptoms that are

363
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,610
associated with Parkinson's which might

364
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:36,558
not be as visual also can be remedied

365
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:40,069
with low doses of cannabis as well

366
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:44,029
including decreased facial expressions

367
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:47,428
dementia fatigue sleep disturbances

368
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:51,149
depression constipation cognitive

369
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:53,610
changes fear anxiety and urinary

370
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:57,230
problems and what's interesting is if

371
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:59,599
you look at this list these are all

372
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,220
mechanisms within the body that are

373
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:06,990
moderated by the endocannabinoid system

374
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:09,929
and so so cannabis can help you on two

375
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:13,140
levels on the first level it can be a

376
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:15,720
preventative and it can also help

377
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:19,110
decrease the symptoms that a patient is

378
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:22,200
experiencing but also it can decrease

379
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:24,750
the symptoms by strengthening the

380
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,620
endocannabinoid system so even if you

381
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:34,140
still have Parkinson's you won't have a

382
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:36,829
degradation of your life quality so

383
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:39,360
everything I've told you so far is

384
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:41,788
strongly supported with scientific

385
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:44,119
evidence of studies that are taking

386
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:47,069
place in Europe right now because

387
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:49,379
cannabis is still a Schedule one drug in

388
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:53,490
the United States those studies are not

389
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:55,679
happening here there is a new group of

390
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,798
studies that are underway which are

391
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,620
showing a lot of hope and since you know

392
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:03,720
you all have probably you know

393
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:05,668
researched Parkinson's much more than I

394
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,250
have it by familiar with people starting

395
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:10,730
to tie Parkinson's

396
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:14,890
systems to what's going on in the gut in

397
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:19,339
the microbiome of your stomach and so

398
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:27,160
this new this new science of suggesting

399
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:31,849
that when you're when your gut flora is

400
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:36,529
overly acidic and your endocannabinoid

401
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:39,439
system is deficient poor signals are

402
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:43,369
sent between the gut and the brain which

403
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,950
can make Parkinson's even worse and so

404
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:47,629
one of the great things about using

405
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:51,110
cannabis is that your endocannabinoid

406
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:53,540
system moderates your gut the mix of

407
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:56,599
chemicals the cleaning the cleaning of

408
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:59,869
the cilia that moves your food along and

409
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:04,189
your ability to take extract nutrition

410
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:06,139
from the food and so while this is newer

411
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,880
science and the other aspects I've

412
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,880
talked about so far I wanted to mention

413
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,820
it because if you've been doing some

414
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,610
work trying to you know eat more raw

415
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:18,799
foods you know if you get rid of your

416
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:21,740
GERD or heartburn or just you know work

417
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:24,139
with the the chemistry of your gut

418
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:27,670
cannabis is a good option for you as

419
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:34,580
well because the endocannabinoid system

420
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:38,750
moderates the tummy so so at this point

421
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:41,119
what we're looking at is is the systems

422
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:44,029
that moderate the symptom the symptoms

423
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,889
that you're experiencing are are all

424
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:49,789
moderated by your endocannabinoid system

425
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:54,520
and so if we're if we're if most

426
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:56,480
Americans are deficient in their

427
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:59,960
internal cannabinoid

428
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,548
making what can we do to help and and

429
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:07,100
that is with supplementation by by

430
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:09,849
taking the final cannabinoids that are

431
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:13,428
produced within the cannabis plant and

432
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:16,039
then taking them ourselves to make up

433
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:19,720
for the fact that we're not producing as

434
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:25,149
many cannabinoids ourselves so let's

435
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:27,350
talk about typical methods of dosing so

436
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:29,870
one of the things that I get a lot of

437
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:31,759
pushback from patients upon it on

438
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:34,699
especially when they're just learning

439
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,259
about cannabis is that they don't want

440
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,890
to get high and they don't want to be

441
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:43,669
smoking weed and I and I get that right

442
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:46,190
we all spend a lot of our lives cracking

443
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:49,940
jokes about stoners and about what that

444
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:51,860
does to your life and and you know those

445
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,058
folks get judged a lot and none of us

446
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:57,168
like to get judged

447
00:22:53,058 --> 00:23:00,230
well except for a very small group of

448
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:02,570
people who actually prefer the smoking

449
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,910
or the enjoyment factor of it and they

450
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:07,970
like to get high while they're getting

451
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:14,570
their medicine I don't recommend smoking

452
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:17,210
cannabis for nearly any of the symptoms

453
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:19,099
that we're looking for a relief from I

454
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:22,548
recommend that you take it orally

455
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:24,048
because when you smoke marijuana you are

456
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:27,798
inhaling it it's going into your lungs

457
00:23:24,048 --> 00:23:30,558
and the cannabinoids immediately jump

458
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:32,960
from the lungs to your blood and then

459
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:37,579
goes to your brain and so you're getting

460
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,630
all of the medicine fast at once and the

461
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:41,720
tea

462
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:43,550
see part of the cannabis is what makes

463
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,579
you high and so all of that reaches your

464
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:48,470
brain at the same time and at that point

465
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:51,079
you're feeling some level of

466
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,250
disorientation and soon after we'll

467
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:57,799
probably want to eat everything

468
00:23:52,250 --> 00:24:00,109
different and so the process is

469
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:04,579
different when you eat something though

470
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:06,229
because it goes into your body and if

471
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:08,569
you're taking a teacher some of it will

472
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,329
be will soak in through your mouth but

473
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:13,399
if you're eating an edible it's got to

474
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:16,399
go all the way through your GI tract and

475
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:20,180
gets filtered by your liver and then

476
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:23,269
finds its way to your blood there so any

477
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:25,610
way that you take it orally is you're

478
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:28,430
likely going to get better experience

479
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:30,649
then if your were to smoke it now I'm

480
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:33,529
not saying that smoking doesn't work

481
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,509
smoking can work but it's just not for

482
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:37,730
everybody and so we're going to focus on

483
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:42,200
the solution that seems to be more for

484
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:44,059
more patients so so if you're going to

485
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,420
take it orally then lick what are your

486
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:50,269
options well we all know the classic pot

487
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:53,120
brownie right and and a lot of people

488
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:56,240
find very good results with taking a

489
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:58,879
regular diet of brownies now I don't

490
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:04,299
usually recommend that to patients that

491
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:06,350
I work with because number one you know

492
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:08,480
they're a little better if you buy them

493
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:10,789
at the store but but if you tend to make

494
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,670
your own brownies at home brownie one

495
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:16,099
and six and twelve are all going to have

496
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,050
different strengths because it's really

497
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:20,480
hard to homogenize the medicine

498
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:22,730
throughout the baked goods and while

499
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,799
they're much better at this you know we

500
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,539
have the commercial element stories it's

501
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,299
still not perfect but it's certainly

502
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:32,329
much better than you know grandma mary's

503
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:35,839
brownies who used to make them in San

504
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:38,029
Francisco also you know most of the

505
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:41,298
patients that I talk to are trying to

506
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:43,460
avoid extra calories let alone

507
00:25:41,298 --> 00:25:44,808
taken as often as they would need to

508
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,759
take something to help with their

509
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:49,700
Parkinson's so they're all like you know

510
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:51,710
I mean three brownies a day seven days a

511
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,409
week you know I'm going to have to start

512
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:56,569
a whole new exercise regime Justin just

513
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:59,419
to help mitigate the weight gain from

514
00:25:56,569 --> 00:26:01,398
trying to deal with my Parkinson's so so

515
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:04,580
you know cookies and brownies and

516
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:06,709
candies are not always the best solution

517
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:10,668
for some people they find that they

518
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:12,470
really like lozenges because you know

519
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:16,609
there's not as much to it there's no

520
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:17,480
flour there's less sugar involved so

521
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,548
there's that with some of the

522
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,749
enlargement options so those are the

523
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:23,720
things that I would put into kind of

524
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:27,409
like a food category then the second

525
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:30,278
category are capsules so there are an

526
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:33,649
increasing number of companies that make

527
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:38,659
cannabis capsules that can be purchased

528
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:41,268
in the recreational market and I wish I

529
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:44,389
could make a generalization and say you

530
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:47,778
can't go wrong or even the say that

531
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:51,648
they're all bad but it's neither the

532
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:57,409
recipes that that are put into the

533
00:26:51,648 --> 00:27:02,748
capsules vary from maker to maker which

534
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:07,039
is ass so so I'll talk more about where

535
00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:09,679
to purchase capsules and the like later

536
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:12,739
but at this point I just want to say

537
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,889
that the the the person behind the

538
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:18,739
counter at a reputable cannabis store

539
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:22,069
should be able to guide you to their

540
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:25,069
products that are more medical than

541
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:26,720
other than others at its base all

542
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:28,608
cannabis is medicine

543
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,499
it's just that different people are

544
00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:32,960
using different kinds of cannabis for

545
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:33,860
different conditions so if you tell them

546
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,679
that listen

547
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:38,808
for a capsule with you know very little

548
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,080
sugar that's reliable for Parkinson's

549
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:43,730
you know with a little luck the the

550
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:48,829
store clerk will guide you in the right

551
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:52,339
place so that's food capsules and then

552
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:54,619
my favorite which is tincture and we're

553
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:57,319
all familiar with teachers you know a

554
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:59,178
kadesha or marshmallow root for the

555
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:01,428
stomach there's a there's a whole range

556
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:03,919
of teachers that we can use that are

557
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:06,679
made from taking the plant and soaking

558
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,840
in an alcohol and then straining on the

559
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,909
plant what's left in the alcohol already

560
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:13,819
is the essential constituents of the

561
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:17,028
plant its oil is that same thing works

562
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:18,648
for cannabis and you know in a very

563
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:22,579
simple way that's essentially how we

564
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:24,829
make it you take the dried flowers you

565
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:27,349
so given alcohol you strain them and

566
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:29,990
then you hopefully laughs test it and

567
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:31,819
then you've got a teacher and people

568
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,419
have been taking teachers for hundreds

569
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:37,099
of years as a matter of fact before

570
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:41,600
cannabis was banned in the United States

571
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:44,928
it was the primary used teacher for a

572
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:48,079
whole host of human ailments and it took

573
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:50,480
up 70% of the pharmacopoeia which is

574
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,189
essentially the pharmacists guide to

575
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:57,548
what to give people from everything from

576
00:28:52,190 --> 00:29:01,669
from migraines and hot flashes to

577
00:28:57,548 --> 00:29:04,398
menstrual cramps and and a general pain

578
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:06,590
which to cross the war it was because it

579
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:10,638
helped the endocannabinoid system even

580
00:29:06,589 --> 00:29:13,178
though we didn't know that then so what

581
00:29:10,638 --> 00:29:16,069
I also like about the tincture is that

582
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:19,190
when you buy a tincture over-the-counter

583
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:22,038
and sometimes from neighbors they'll be

584
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:24,019
lab tested and so you know that every

585
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:26,869
time you take it it's going to be

586
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:27,960
exactly the same once you find what your

587
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:30,719
correct dose

588
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,930
for this for you you'll be like okay I

589
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,970
take 1/3 of a drama and so every time

590
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:38,519
you take that third of a dropper you

591
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,049
know that the dosing is always the same

592
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,170
the other thing that I like about

593
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:45,389
teacher is that it's variable you've got

594
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:47,789
a lot of control as the patient when

595
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:51,240
you're getting capsules it's got a set

596
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:54,210
amount of cannabinoids from from

597
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,549
cannabis in it but every time you take

598
00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:00,210
it you have to take the same amount well

599
00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:02,309
as we all know with which with lots of

600
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,690
times you might want less of medicine on

601
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:05,429
some days or maybe you're feeling

602
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:08,279
especially bad and you want to take some

603
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:11,820
more on other days and so teacher gives

604
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:15,660
you that kind of flexibility where once

605
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:18,029
you find out what your baseline is you

606
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:22,620
can change it a little bit based on what

607
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:26,629
you think your needs are for your day so

608
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:30,929
it just so happens that arguably the top

609
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:34,590
neurologists in the country for cannabis

610
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:37,560
and Parkinson's lives on Vashon dr.

611
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:40,109
Ethan Russo lives just above KVI beach

612
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:42,869
here and he's a friend and he's been on

613
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:45,659
my podcast a few times and he's spoken

614
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:47,219
at the Grange Hall a few times and he's

615
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,970
a very active member of the fruit Club

616
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:55,440
good

617
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:58,230
so dr. Russo sets dosages at after

618
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,529
speaking with the patient but generally

619
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:04,440
hears me this is a rule of thumb he says

620
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:09,049
that the threshold to start getting some

621
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:13,710
sort of benefit isn't is that about 2.5

622
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:16,740
milligrams of THC and that THC is the

623
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:20,850
part of cannabis which can make you feel

624
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:25,140
high if you take enough of it two point

625
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:28,049
five milligrams though is pretty much

626
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:31,259
not going to get anybody high there are

627
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:33,839
outliers say maybe one in 2,000 people

628
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:37,440
that might feel two point five

629
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:39,528
milligrams but in all of my years

630
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,419
with patience I've only met one person

631
00:31:39,528 --> 00:31:47,069
and that is why I now have to say 2.5

632
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:48,840
because up to that point I had said that

633
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:51,599
no one will in it but then I met someone

634
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:55,259
so so two point five milligrams of THC

635
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:58,648
is where you just start to potentially

636
00:31:55,259 --> 00:32:00,569
get some medicinal benefit

637
00:31:58,648 --> 00:32:04,648
he also says though and this is my

638
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:07,950
experience that the sweet spot of really

639
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:09,599
starting to have a decrease in the the

640
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:13,889
motor skills symptoms is that five

641
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:16,918
milligrams now at five milligrams some

642
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:19,378
people may feel a little bit of

643
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,320
something some people experience it as

644
00:32:19,378 --> 00:32:26,519
maybe a little bit of cloudiness some

645
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:29,099
people experience it as just feel a

646
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,558
little more relaxed for those of you who

647
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:33,750
have had alcohol you know a lot of

648
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:36,058
people that have that that that cocktail

649
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,429
at the end of their business day which

650
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:39,960
when it hits their blood they're like

651
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:42,778
alright the workday is over and now my

652
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,210
time is my own that feeling of relief is

653
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:49,819
how a lot of people experience five

654
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:52,740
milligrams and then other people just

655
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:54,928
experience five milligrams as oh the

656
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,538
shaking has decreased in my arm and I'm

657
00:32:54,929 --> 00:33:00,210
not clenching as much and so they don't

658
00:32:57,538 --> 00:33:03,179
experience five milligrams as something

659
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:09,120
added but more something that's taken

660
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:11,220
away in their symptoms right there are

661
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:15,028
many Parkinson's patients who will take

662
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:18,629
ten milligrams and at ten milligrams

663
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:23,278
just about everybody will feel some kind

664
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:25,199
of response to the THC more often than

665
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:26,009
not though folks will like that

666
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,250
experience

667
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:31,679
you're not full-on stoned and difficult

668
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,919
to talk to and giggling and things like

669
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,200
that but you're definitely feeling some

670
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:41,159
sort of sense of relief from your

671
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:47,220
symptoms and probably a release of your

672
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:49,549
days stress and and occasionally just

673
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,548
occasionally

674
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,750
what you might want to be a little more

675
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:57,910
careful going to slap off the light

676
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:00,069
switch on the wall because it might take

677
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:03,370
a little more effort to Zone into the

678
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:07,419
target but for the patients that I've

679
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:09,639
worked with the slight feelings of

680
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:13,510
different this that they get with that

681
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,639
low dose of cannabis is well worth

682
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:19,240
getting rid of the other symptoms that

683
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:21,849
are causing them discomfort some of you

684
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:25,119
may have looked on YouTube for videos of

685
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:27,099
Parkinson's patients trying cannabis and

686
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,069
if you haven't I recommend that you give

687
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:33,400
it a try because it's really remarkable

688
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:35,800
one of the most popular videos is of

689
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:39,039
this this fella sitting on his couch at

690
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:43,030
home and he has got of advanced

691
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:45,400
Parkinson's with with a range of severe

692
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:49,510
motor or symptoms that that he's

693
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:53,400
suffering through and his buddy gives

694
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:58,540
him a small amount of cannabis oil and

695
00:34:53,400 --> 00:35:00,789
puts it underneath his tongue and the

696
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:02,920
patient is you know playing with it in

697
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:05,440
his mouth so it's soaking in through his

698
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:09,039
mucosal membranes in his mouth that's

699
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,960
tongue and it's cheeks and and they're

700
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:13,509
running a timer at the bottom of the

701
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,400
video and you know for the first you

702
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,740
know minute or so you don't notice any

703
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,210
difference and you're you know you're

704
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:21,759
tempted to turn off the video if you

705
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:23,039
like it nothing's happening right but by

706
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,650
the time you've hit

707
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:29,159
two minutes you can see him instead of

708
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:32,430
being over to the side he started to set

709
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:36,179
up more and then by three minutes

710
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:38,789
his spasticity is decreased his hand

711
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:41,639
hasn't clenched anymore and he's sitting

712
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:42,269
up and I think it's by about the four

713
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,609
minutes

714
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:47,340
you cannot visually tell that this

715
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:50,700
gentleman has got Parkinson's four

716
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,890
minutes and you know this is a best case

717
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:57,509
scenario for certain because he had the

718
00:35:52,889 --> 00:36:00,869
right medicine taken sublingually with

719
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:02,730
that was easily taken up by the body

720
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:05,219
so everything was optimized in that

721
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,809
situation but it shows the potential in

722
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:10,469
the medicine of being able to work so

723
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:14,009
chemists a teacher is similar when you

724
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:17,009
take the teacher it's in a vehicle 190

725
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:18,360
proof grain alcohol usually and because

726
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,680
it's in that you don't really want to

727
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,050
take a teacher right into your mouth

728
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:24,089
those little bird but you take a little

729
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,740
bit of water you know get a juice glass

730
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,660
or a shot glass and you stick a little

731
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:30,529
bit out of the faucet and put your

732
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:32,699
squirt in there and you drink it and

733
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,290
patients tell me that they are

734
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:36,179
experiencing a lessening of their

735
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:39,329
symptoms within about ten minutes and

736
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:41,849
they're feeling pretty great by 15 and

737
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:44,849
when they take it regularly as a

738
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:46,559
preventive the symptoms just don't come

739
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:48,599
back throughout their day which is of

740
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,610
course the goal right the goal is not

741
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:52,589
say like you know let the symptoms get

742
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:54,570
really bad and then taking it over for

743
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:57,800
the best the goal is to get yourself on

744
00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:00,380
a schedule that you know about how long

745
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,200
laughs in their system which is usually

746
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,510
about four to six hours and then and

747
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,329
then scheduled yourself to take small

748
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:11,570
doses during the day so it keeps your

749
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:14,539
symptoms at bay it helps your brain

750
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:17,120
clean itself so that the signaling in

751
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:22,779
your body starts to be better and so

752
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,779
that you can avoid the symptoms entirely

753
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:32,920
so um with cannabis one of the important

754
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,470
aspects of it is to take what we call

755
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:39,220
the whole plant or a whole plant

756
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:43,089
medicine there are some people who are

757
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:45,549
selling CBD extracts and you may have

758
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,600
heard about this from friends or seen

759
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:52,090
them on the Internet

760
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:55,089
CBD stands for cannabidiol which is one

761
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:58,510
of the cannabinoids that's in the

762
00:37:55,090 --> 00:38:01,780
cannabis plant and it's easily the

763
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,640
second most popular after THC and it's

764
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,590
the one that's had probably the most

765
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:10,839
research done at this point

766
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:13,150
besides teams and because of the you

767
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,880
know the laws don't allow marijuana in

768
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:20,619
some state still some people are

769
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:23,349
purchasing just CBD on its own over the

770
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:26,769
internet and hoping that that will help

771
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:29,949
them with their symptoms I want to

772
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:32,860
caution you from that because for the

773
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:35,199
medicine to work you need all of the

774
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:39,309
different constituents of the plant you

775
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:41,829
need the THC as part of it you need the

776
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:46,119
CBD that can have a dial as part of it

777
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:48,039
you need the minor cannabinoids which we

778
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,839
don't even have them all identify

779
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:52,239
there's over a hundred of them in the

780
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,910
plant and then you also need the

781
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:57,369
terpenes which is the aromatherapy of

782
00:38:54,909 --> 00:38:59,559
the plant over these thousands of years

783
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:01,900
that can't know that human

784
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:04,779
have been taking the planet with us

785
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:07,570
everywhere that we expand and travel

786
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:10,510
over the world we've gotten into a

787
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:13,269
synergistic relationship with it and so

788
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:15,220
the plant you know how corn has followed

789
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:18,400
humans because we take corn everywhere

790
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:20,769
we go and as we go we're selecting the

791
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,650
seeds for the corn that we most like so

792
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:25,509
that's the plant that we've come to know

793
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,910
and love especially now during the

794
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:31,000
summer same thing happens with cannabis

795
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:33,099
every time humans moved on they took the

796
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,199
seeds of the planets that made them feel

797
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:37,569
the most healthy and this happening

798
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:39,759
again again over tens of thousands of

799
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:43,990
years means that the plant that exists

800
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:46,540
right now is more uniquely refined to

801
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:47,699
help our endocannabinoid system than it

802
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:51,400
ever has before

803
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:54,069
so I tell you this to kind of inoculate

804
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,289
you against suggestions from your

805
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:58,809
friends of oh if you need canvas

806
00:39:56,289 --> 00:40:01,960
medicine just get this CBD extract

807
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:03,549
online you know it's easy to do and it's

808
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,039
you can buy the line it's just easy than

809
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:08,530
going over town resist that temptation

810
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:10,539
because it's not the true cannabis

811
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:12,720
medicine that's made of the whole plant

812
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:12,719
yes

813
00:40:22,108 --> 00:40:25,659
she said you want that it feel

814
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:27,579
guys you know I said I don't want to

815
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:29,559
feel but I just wanted to feel I mean

816
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:34,829
I've been what be hi correctly to feel

817
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:38,349
their but so so if you go to a store and

818
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:40,060
you and you buy something that you don't

819
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:42,220
deem is appropriate for you and so if

820
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:45,130
it's got THC in it and it makes you feel

821
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:48,098
high unfortunately in Washington you

822
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:51,730
can't return it and so you're kind of

823
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:53,920
stuck your best bet would just be to try

824
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:57,250
to create value in someone else by

825
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:00,490
giving it to them but you can't return

826
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:04,289
it and and my best suggestion would be

827
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:06,818
to certainly not work with that

828
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:08,739
budtender again at that shop and try to

829
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:16,449
find somebody who's more of an extra

830
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:19,568
sure yeah and unfortunately incredibly

831
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:21,039
common there are a lot of unfortunately

832
00:41:19,568 --> 00:41:24,579
they've got a very coordinated

833
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:26,529
they're known as blood tenders who help

834
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:30,430
you when you go to their retail stores

835
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:33,099
and you know certainly there are bud

836
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:35,618
tenders that do their homework

837
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:38,170
they've got medically certified with the

838
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:40,420
state they work with patients on their

839
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:43,210
free time and they know what they're

840
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:46,809
doing but unfortunately the ratio is

841
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,639
very small to overall because you know a

842
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:50,619
lot of folks they're new to cannabis

843
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,088
they just wanted they just want a job in

844
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:56,769
cannabis and that's an entry-level

845
00:41:52,088 --> 00:41:58,989
position and so they get the job or they

846
00:41:56,769 --> 00:42:01,329
may be familiar with how to help certain

847
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:04,539
kinds of patients but not Parkinson's

848
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:07,359
patients so I recommend that you get as

849
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:10,539
much of your information in advance and

850
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:13,559
then go active asking for a specific

851
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:16,900
product for example I like to recommend

852
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:18,788
the capsules made by a company called

853
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:24,939
the sea

854
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:27,309
see and thus the CPC has been making

855
00:42:24,938 --> 00:42:30,188
medicine all the way back years and

856
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:33,039
years during the Washington medical

857
00:42:30,188 --> 00:42:34,719
industry days and so they are one of the

858
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:37,269
more reputable companies that

859
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:41,469
transitioned to the recreational market

860
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:44,139
and so I know the formulator for the

861
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:46,150
company Ben and he is an incredibly

862
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:50,618
knowledgeable person who puts patients

863
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:53,559
first and so when you hear that kind of

864
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:55,028
recommendation from somebody in the

865
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:59,289
field who works with patients all the

866
00:42:55,028 --> 00:43:01,630
time I recommend that you you know talk

867
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:03,999
with me and others to find out what

868
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:06,999
they're using that works for them for

869
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:10,808
their Parkinson's and and then go pick

870
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:13,868
up the same product because if you go

871
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:17,589
into a store and just you know blindly

872
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:18,429
ask for something with low THC and high

873
00:43:17,588 --> 00:43:21,159
CBE

874
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:23,889
for your parking sins if you get the

875
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:26,498
wrong bud tender you you you may not

876
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:29,650
have you know a good experience right

877
00:43:26,498 --> 00:43:31,738
off the bat that said I encourage you

878
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:35,918
would not give up if that happens to you

879
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:40,028
because you know the medicine does exist

880
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:41,708
both in Washington and on Vashon you

881
00:43:40,028 --> 00:43:49,568
just have to find the right source for

882
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:54,158
for you well if I had Parkinson's I

883
00:43:49,568 --> 00:43:58,358
would actually buy locally here on the

884
00:43:54,159 --> 00:44:01,749
island from an herbalist that's local

885
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:03,038
here now this is where I also need to

886
00:44:01,748 --> 00:44:09,188
point out that that's technically

887
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:10,520
illegal and so since they got rid of the

888
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:14,329
medical

889
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:17,000
industry it has taken a lot of

890
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:20,480
herbalists who used to make custom

891
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:25,519
medicine for patients and put them into

892
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:28,570
the informal market and so and there's

893
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:31,880
challenges with the recreational market

894
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:33,890
which is getting better but again just

895
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,920
by its name it's called the recreational

896
00:44:33,889 --> 00:44:40,089
market you know we're about 18 months

897
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:44,630
into having a recreational market and

898
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:47,300
mostly it's it's it's the kind of

899
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:50,180
medicine that can be used for medicine

900
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:53,330
for some people but also a lot of people

901
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:56,960
use it to party right and so the

902
00:44:53,329 --> 00:45:02,000
availability of medicine that is not

903
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:06,559
made to also party on is still lacking

904
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,679
in the market that said I bet you that

905
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:13,820
18 months from now the market will be

906
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:17,169
flush with it because companies they

907
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:19,789
respond to market demand right and and

908
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:22,340
unfortunately the state when they with

909
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:24,949
the medical market was taking care of

910
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:27,559
tens of thousands of people enough that

911
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:30,500
we had you know over a thousand stores

912
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:32,719
just here in Washington and not only did

913
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,510
they get rid of they went from over a

914
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:38,389
thousand stores down to you know a

915
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:41,690
little more than three hundred but the

916
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:45,829
people in this market were were trained

917
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:48,349
and driven to help patients and some

918
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:51,319
people who were partying but patients

919
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:54,019
first and the new market has got that in

920
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:57,080
reverse where because they wanted to

921
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:59,449
establish some revenue first they went

922
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:02,750
below hanging cruge for them who has

923
00:45:59,449 --> 00:46:04,289
people who party and now after they've

924
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:06,269
got that market establish

925
00:46:04,289 --> 00:46:09,029
they've got some income now they're kind

926
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:11,880
of circling around the patients which

927
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:14,280
are more difficult to design products

928
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:18,450
for it takes more effort it takes more

929
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:22,560
experience and so so to circle back to

930
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:25,109
your question if you can find an

931
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:29,670
herbalist who has experience in the

932
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:32,550
medical market I would say go with

933
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:37,170
somebody that you trust locally and shop

934
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:41,190
locally right legally know that exchange

935
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:45,230
is not legal in Washington and so if

936
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:48,269
it's important to you to remain legal

937
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:50,849
then I recommend then you go to a

938
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:55,199
recreational store that has a reputation

939
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:58,289
for being more medical and luckily for

940
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:01,199
us we have one that's nearby just here

941
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:05,579
in West Seattle there's a shop called

942
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:09,960
Canada West Seattle so that's see a and

943
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:14,369
and a channel West Seattle and they are

944
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:17,190
on California Avenue and they have most

945
00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:21,329
of their staff is actually has got the

946
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:25,170
state medical certification and the

947
00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:27,929
owner Mary Ann Mary Ann actually used to

948
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:31,079
own a reputable medical dispensary

949
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:34,469
before they all got close so she's got

950
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:37,949
her heart in the right place and as the

951
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:42,509
medical products come out and are

952
00:47:37,949 --> 00:47:44,759
released she stops them so if you want

953
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:50,010
to go somewhere close that understands

954
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:52,500
patients I can recommend Mary Ann's shop

955
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:55,290
canna West Seattle as being a place

956
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,559
where you're more likely to get

957
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:59,139
something a pro

958
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,420
than just walking in anywhere you can

959
00:47:59,139 --> 00:48:06,129
also go on the state of Washington

960
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:07,809
website and find out the stores that

961
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:13,539
have received their medical

962
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:17,940
certification from the state no no

963
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:22,259
actually you don't so you can go into

964
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:25,809
stores and buy products that are deemed

965
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:28,930
medical without having a prescription

966
00:48:25,809 --> 00:48:33,369
for it because cannabis is now legal in

967
00:48:28,929 --> 00:48:35,980
the state and so you know because really

968
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:40,750
all cannabis is medicine it's just that

969
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:44,590
some products are really made directly

970
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:49,449
for patients versus for patients and the

971
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:54,010
partying and for example the the the the

972
00:48:49,449 --> 00:48:58,569
most common of recommended dosage for

973
00:48:54,010 --> 00:49:04,210
Parkinson's patients is 10 milligrams of

974
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:07,330
CBD and 5 milligrams of THC take it at

975
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:09,880
the same time and because it's whole

976
00:49:07,329 --> 00:49:11,650
plant you're also getting a sprinkling

977
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,390
of all the other cannabinoids that are

978
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:15,910
in there as well you're getting some

979
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:19,509
terpenes and some flavonoids and some

980
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:22,629
CBN and CBG and all these lesser-known

981
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:24,190
cannabinoids but the two that that your

982
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:28,150
that would likely be written on the

983
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:32,170
package is 10 milligrams of CBD and 5

984
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:34,599
milligrams of THC now one of the reasons

985
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:37,269
why I recommend tinctures is because I

986
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:41,259
like to tell patients to buy one teacher

987
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:45,159
that's all THC and one teacher that's

988
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:48,580
all CBD that way you can play with the

989
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:51,399
ratio yourself so that you find out what

990
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:54,009
is the best ratio for you for many

991
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:58,900
Parkinson's patients 10 ratio is 2 to 1

992
00:49:54,010 --> 00:50:01,170
2 parts CBD to every one part THC the

993
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:03,269
combination

994
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:05,278
sorted by studies and by a lot of

995
00:50:03,268 --> 00:50:08,308
first-hand experience that I just seen

996
00:50:05,278 --> 00:50:11,489
with patients but you may find that

997
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:13,859
you're more sensitive to THC and you

998
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:15,808
don't want five milligrams at once so

999
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:19,588
maybe you'd rather take it more often

1000
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:21,930
during the day and and have less THC so

1001
00:50:19,588 --> 00:50:24,088
for you the ten milligrams of CPD might

1002
00:50:21,929 --> 00:50:26,159
be great but instead of taking five

1003
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:31,230
milligrams you'd actually prefer to have

1004
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:35,879
2.5 so getting buying two teachers one

1005
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:38,059
that's THC and one that CBD you might

1006
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,769
find out has more flexibility to you

1007
00:50:38,059 --> 00:50:43,220
you're definitely going to find over

1008
00:50:40,768 --> 00:50:47,578
time that you become more sophisticated

1009
00:50:43,219 --> 00:50:50,098
with how you want to dose yourself this

1010
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:52,289
takes some education even though we've

1011
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:54,990
been using the cannabis plant for tens

1012
00:50:52,289 --> 00:50:57,599
of thousands of years it's just coming

1013
00:50:54,989 --> 00:51:00,058
back right and so the people who are

1014
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:03,630
making the medicine are relearning what

1015
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:07,048
was essentially a lost craft the the

1016
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:08,700
store employees are relearning not only

1017
00:51:07,048 --> 00:51:11,639
how to talk to patients but what to

1018
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:14,460
recommend patients ourselves which I am

1019
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:16,409
I had a brain injury that's how that I

1020
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:18,210
got into medical cannabis

1021
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:19,889
I had a brain injury and so I hadn't

1022
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:22,679
learned about medical cannabis to help

1023
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:24,719
with my brain injury and I had to learn

1024
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:30,659
the appropriate kind of cannabis and the

1025
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:33,929
dosing so if you if you can do you know

1026
00:51:30,659 --> 00:51:35,460
how people say about like AB and O you

1027
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:37,409
know they're they were an instant

1028
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,449
success they were instantly popular but

1029
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:40,159
they don't know the band

1030
00:51:38,449 --> 00:51:43,480
had been gigging and traveling for ten

1031
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:46,940
years it's like that it's like you know

1032
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:49,400
cannabis is a pretty reliable solution

1033
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:52,329
for Parkinson's symptoms and with

1034
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:55,369
long-term use decreasing even the cause

1035
00:51:52,329 --> 00:51:58,519
but you got to go through some legwork

1036
00:51:55,369 --> 00:52:02,240
at the beginning to find the right

1037
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:04,759
dosage of the right product but lets you

1038
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:09,649
find the right dosage of the right

1039
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:11,540
product it's actually quite to say it's

1040
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:17,539
quite simple to moderate your your

1041
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:20,179
symptoms it's one exam I'm not supposed

1042
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:23,088
to say it's gonna help everybody right

1043
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:25,699
because it doesn't but as far as the

1044
00:52:23,088 --> 00:52:28,338
people that worked on on Vashon were 11

1045
00:52:25,699 --> 00:52:31,069
for 12 that's pretty good results and

1046
00:52:28,338 --> 00:52:33,259
the one person who told me that they

1047
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:34,670
didn't care for it I don't think that

1048
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:38,210
they were patient with learning their

1049
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:40,369
way through the dosing process and so so

1050
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:44,059
yeah it's not a solution for everybody

1051
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:46,039
but but you know based on the people

1052
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:47,269
that I've talked with nationally and the

1053
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:50,480
people that I've talked with right here

1054
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:52,400
on Vashon you know some people call it

1055
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,849
Parkinson's low-hanging fruit for

1056
00:52:52,400 --> 00:53:00,380
cannabis because Parkinson's is so

1057
00:52:55,849 --> 00:53:02,410
directly tied to the endocannabinoid

1058
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,410
system

1059
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:14,630
are they using other Parkinson's

1060
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:16,429
medications also everybody I spoke to is

1061
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:19,880
using other Parkinson's medicines as

1062
00:53:16,429 --> 00:53:22,339
well like I said at the beginning I

1063
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:24,380
don't recommend that you you know get on

1064
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:27,680
the cannabis and then immediately get

1065
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:30,079
off of your your scripts but I know

1066
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:32,690
several patients that have they have

1067
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,579
either decreased their dosage or gotten

1068
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:37,970
off them totally if they're very anti

1069
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:40,400
pharmaceuticals so so at the beginning

1070
00:53:37,969 --> 00:53:44,059
they take both because there's no

1071
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,920
negative interplay that we've seen the

1072
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:50,449
only negative interplay that we've seen

1073
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:53,269
is that with just a couple epilepsy

1074
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:56,089
drugs there seems to be some interaction

1075
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:59,449
with high doses of CBD but in the

1076
00:53:56,090 --> 00:54:01,700
Parkinson's realm I come across no kind

1077
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:03,469
of negative interaction yes sir I don't

1078
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:05,868
like any resident it's better than their

1079
00:54:03,469 --> 00:54:09,049
quick answer I have defense Ferguson I

1080
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:12,710
have this building a business there's

1081
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:14,359
gonna be help with that I am not as

1082
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:15,800
familiar with dystonia

1083
00:54:14,358 --> 00:54:17,599
would you tell would you just tell me a

1084
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,940
little bit about it so that I understand

1085
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:24,019
what biological what human system it

1086
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:25,490
works with appropriate messages from the

1087
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:28,619
brain to the muscles

1088
00:54:25,489 --> 00:54:30,568
stay there okay that's a yes so the

1089
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:32,730
short answer is without having read

1090
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:34,259
their research much my immediate

1091
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,490
conclusion would be yes and I'll tell

1092
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,260
you why I actually glad that you

1093
00:54:35,489 --> 00:54:41,750
mentioned this because I I missed this

1094
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:45,270
earlier in my notes the thickness so so

1095
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:46,889
the main components of cannabis that

1096
00:54:45,269 --> 00:54:49,409
we've been talking about today are THC

1097
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:53,818
and CBD and one of the reasons that

1098
00:54:49,409 --> 00:54:55,618
people love CBD and why it's used for a

1099
00:54:53,818 --> 00:54:59,608
variety of patients is because it

1100
00:54:55,619 --> 00:55:03,358
supports the body's signaling system and

1101
00:54:59,608 --> 00:55:05,848
our signaling system has to do with a

1102
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:07,739
lot of different problems so so I'll use

1103
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:11,130
pain is as an example first

1104
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:14,548
so CBD is often used for pain patients

1105
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:17,940
because while teeing a see is an

1106
00:55:14,548 --> 00:55:23,068
analgesic and so it kind of it kind of

1107
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:25,588
dumbs down the pain when someone has got

1108
00:55:23,068 --> 00:55:28,588
endocannabinoid deficiency let's say

1109
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:31,108
that you that you injure your leg when

1110
00:55:28,588 --> 00:55:33,690
the lay communicates to the brain that

1111
00:55:31,108 --> 00:55:36,119
there's a problem it sends it for the

1112
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:38,909
first time full force hey god we've got

1113
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:41,970
pain you should be alert to the lane and

1114
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:44,548
and then after you recognize that it's

1115
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:46,858
supposed to turn down the volume so that

1116
00:55:44,548 --> 00:55:49,858
you you continue to tell get medical

1117
00:55:46,858 --> 00:55:53,219
care but it shouldn't be giving you that

1118
00:55:49,858 --> 00:55:55,230
initial signal constantly well with pain

1119
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:57,298
patients we run into all the time that

1120
00:55:55,230 --> 00:56:00,510
because they've got a weakened and no

1121
00:55:57,298 --> 00:56:02,460
cannabinoid system the leg keeps up

1122
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:05,180
reporting back we're in trouble

1123
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:07,429
we're in trouble very loud every

1124
00:56:05,179 --> 00:56:11,449
single time and so the experience of

1125
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:16,940
their pain is is is severe when they

1126
00:56:11,449 --> 00:56:19,699
start taking CBD it turns down the the

1127
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:21,289
experience of pain because the

1128
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:23,509
signalling system is working more

1129
00:56:21,289 --> 00:56:26,000
properly belay is calling up the brain

1130
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:27,770
hey we got a problem the brain says okay

1131
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,469
we've made a note of it you can turn

1132
00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:32,210
down your signal and sends back and so

1133
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:36,189
now while you still might feel the pain

1134
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:43,490
you don't feel it as intensely similarly

1135
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:45,829
with muscle sets so when when when you

1136
00:56:43,489 --> 00:56:48,409
when you're experiencing muscle set

1137
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:51,079
clenching say say you know maybe the

1138
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:53,299
hand is clenching or or the forearm is

1139
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:54,380
clenching which then may be causing some

1140
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,109
tremors

1141
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:59,240
what you're experiencing is the brain

1142
00:56:57,108 --> 00:57:02,929
sending a signal to the muscle set to

1143
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:05,149
clench and in you know he needs to be

1144
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:08,328
turned off because you don't want it to

1145
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:11,210
clench and and you're part of what you

1146
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:14,089
relieve this experience is having a

1147
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:17,780
healthy and no cannabinoid system where

1148
00:57:14,088 --> 00:57:21,039
the signaling between the brain and the

1149
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:24,440
muscle sets becomes optimized and

1150
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:28,789
rebalanced and with that causes they're

1151
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:30,798
relaxing and then this is why the the

1152
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:33,108
gentleman who I started my talk talking

1153
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:36,349
about who who was cutting the lawn

1154
00:57:33,108 --> 00:57:38,150
that's what his experiences Keith Keith

1155
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:40,250
Keith was he'd be all clenched up

1156
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:43,250
because there's this constant signal to

1157
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:44,780
to to tighten these muscles sets and you

1158
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:46,280
know he would get sore from it and then

1159
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,190
he gets on this other side of his body

1160
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,470
instead

1161
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:52,019
that side but then after he started

1162
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:56,239
taking this this CVD whole plant

1163
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:59,489
medicine that signaling system

1164
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:03,750
rebalanced itself and so now the signal

1165
00:57:59,489 --> 00:58:06,209
is no longer stuck yes you're talking

1166
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:07,980
now about an isolated Canada better wait

1167
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:13,949
are you saying you're still saying take

1168
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:16,469
it with the PRC correct because so the

1169
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:19,710
long the short of it is is that there is

1170
00:58:16,469 --> 00:58:22,829
not as much research done on the entire

1171
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:27,059
family of cannabinoids yet for us to

1172
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:29,369
know what role the minor ones play what

1173
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:31,769
we do know is if you give someone just

1174
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:34,190
CBD they don't have the same response

1175
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:37,650
and so we know that it's not the

1176
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:40,170
isolated molecule and the studies that

1177
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:43,170
have been done have been done with CBD

1178
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:46,200
in the presence of whole plant

1179
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:50,159
cannabinoids and and so it's the

1180
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:51,839
interplay between them so without having

1181
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,699
read the specific research on your

1182
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:55,590
question I would say that that sounds

1183
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:58,919
like a signaling disorder that would be

1184
00:58:55,590 --> 00:59:00,760
certainly helped by whole plan yes so in

1185
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,858
your research

1186
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,859
[Music]

1187
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:15,599
doesn't also identify your strengths so

1188
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:18,740
that the research does not focus on

1189
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:22,619
particular strains it focuses on

1190
00:59:18,739 --> 00:59:28,469
molecular components of the plant and so

1191
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:30,480
different strains will have more will

1192
00:59:28,469 --> 00:59:36,739
have better effects for different

1193
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:39,358
patients so but knowing this strain

1194
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:42,019
mostly only helps patients who are

1195
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:44,880
smoking it right because people smoke a

1196
00:59:42,019 --> 00:59:47,280
particular strain but when people buy

1197
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,349
products in the store they're not

1198
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,420
usually identified by the strain so if

1199
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:55,579
you were to go and buy a two to one

1200
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:59,338
capsule 10 cup 10 milligrams of CBD and

1201
00:59:55,579 --> 01:00:01,798
5 milligrams of THC it won't say the

1202
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:04,380
strain name it will identify the

1203
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:08,730
ingredients as molecules it's got this

1204
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:12,769
much CBD this much THC and other minor

1205
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:17,909
cannabinoids right with that being said

1206
01:00:12,769 --> 01:00:19,588
i you were looking to source a strain

1207
01:00:17,909 --> 01:00:21,118
say for example you're a patient who

1208
01:00:19,588 --> 01:00:24,088
wanted to grow their own medicine which

1209
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:27,180
is very common on fashion i would

1210
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:32,358
recommend that you find a strain that is

1211
01:00:27,179 --> 01:00:36,769
high in the CBD and very low in THC and

1212
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:38,699
then also find one and give that a try

1213
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:41,608
but you're probably going to need

1214
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:45,088
additional THC so then also grow another

1215
01:00:41,608 --> 01:00:47,219
one that's just a THC strain and then

1216
01:00:45,088 --> 01:00:49,619
when you mix those together that would

1217
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:51,059
be the right strain there certainly are

1218
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:53,789
strains that

1219
01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:56,659
truly come out at 2 1 for example the

1220
01:00:53,789 --> 01:00:59,340
Harlequins strain is a very popular

1221
01:00:56,659 --> 01:01:03,239
strain with Parkinson's patients that is

1222
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:06,570
comes out naturally being two parts CBD

1223
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:07,979
to every one part THC but I don't want

1224
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:10,590
to give you the impression that you need

1225
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:13,320
to go find the Harlequin strain right if

1226
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:15,930
you want to grow it we can talk about

1227
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:18,630
where you might be able to get plants

1228
01:01:15,929 --> 01:01:22,409
that naturally occur at to the one but

1229
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:24,150
really as far as getting medicine goes

1230
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:26,089
you're just gonna you're gonna buy it

1231
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:27,240
based on what the ingredients are

1232
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:36,090
molecularly

1233
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:37,919
in the package versus by a strain well

1234
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:39,960
the only the only negative that I have

1235
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:43,019
come across for Parkinson's patients in

1236
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:46,769
cannabis is if you accidentally take

1237
01:01:43,019 --> 01:01:49,380
more THC than you want and you can have

1238
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:50,880
an over medicated experience right which

1239
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:54,780
also is also known as just getting

1240
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,849
stoked right so and that that is there's

1241
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:59,760
a there's a big wide spectrum on that

1242
01:01:56,849 --> 01:02:01,679
right there's there's medicinal doses

1243
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,660
for Parkinson's that youth Network and

1244
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:05,429
you don't won't feel it at all some

1245
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:07,049
people need a little bit more and you

1246
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:11,339
might get some of the cloudy headedness

1247
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:12,900
and appetite and many people just feel

1248
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:15,269
like relief from stress and that's

1249
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:17,880
actually a good thing but then you know

1250
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:21,150
if you let's say that you're not on a

1251
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:23,430
schedule and it will let's say they mess

1252
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:26,430
up your schedule you normally take it

1253
01:02:23,429 --> 01:02:29,519
three times a day and and because you

1254
01:02:26,429 --> 01:02:32,000
have forgotten you take it now then you

1255
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:34,619
take it again in a half-hour and

1256
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,230
suddenly you're doubling up on your THC

1257
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:38,079
and at these low doses you're probably

1258
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:40,389
not going to have

1259
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:43,299
overmedication experience but some

1260
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:45,639
patients need to take 20 30 40

1261
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:48,250
milligrams of THC which is you know

1262
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:49,449
eight times what I'm recommending for

1263
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:51,130
that kind of a patient if they

1264
01:02:49,449 --> 01:02:54,399
accidentally take it and then take it

1265
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:57,880
again and a half hour they they could

1266
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,470
have what's at the far end when you're

1267
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:02,110
having an over medicated experience

1268
01:02:59,469 --> 01:03:05,019
which is not pleasant you may experience

1269
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:07,030
paranoia you'll probably experience a

1270
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:09,789
rapid heartbeat because it can lower

1271
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:11,590
your blood pressure a little bit that

1272
01:03:09,789 --> 01:03:15,369
might cause you to have some clammy

1273
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:18,160
sweats and luckily I've only had that

1274
01:03:15,369 --> 01:03:21,309
happened three times in my life but the

1275
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:22,569
first two times I totally felt like I

1276
01:03:21,309 --> 01:03:24,940
maybe I should call the paramedics

1277
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:28,300
because my body was doing weird things

1278
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:32,440
but as I got more educated I realized

1279
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:36,039
that no one has ever died from cannabis

1280
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:38,679
and your mind might be telling you that

1281
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:42,250
these are unfamiliar feelings and I need

1282
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:45,279
medical help but if you just stick with

1283
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:49,300
it you know go for a calm walk in your

1284
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:52,930
yard you lay down in your bed to try to

1285
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:55,210
take a nap or there's some other good

1286
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:58,089
things you're doing you'd smell black

1287
01:03:55,210 --> 01:04:00,490
pepper black pepper tends to reduce the

1288
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:02,890
experience of cannabis as well as

1289
01:04:00,489 --> 01:04:05,649
drinking lemonade because the citrine in

1290
01:04:02,889 --> 01:04:09,759
the lemonade decreases your high as well

1291
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:12,070
all things that you can do and but if

1292
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,590
you get that if you get that high and

1293
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:16,930
you don't want to be and it's negative

1294
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:18,730
it's a drag but it won't kill you and

1295
01:04:16,929 --> 01:04:19,730
you just got to wait it out for 45

1296
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:23,329
minutes and then

1297
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:32,440
anyway okay I need to be more careful

1298
01:04:23,329 --> 01:04:38,690
with my dose English saying everyone's

1299
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:40,789
in our experience if you take a really

1300
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:43,400
high encourage yeah if you take a really

1301
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:46,789
high dosage of edibles you can if you

1302
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:50,050
can have a whole day thing now if you

1303
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:53,739
were to go in and ask for an edible as

1304
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:56,480
it as a new patient for Parkinson's

1305
01:04:53,739 --> 01:05:00,379
there is no way that they should sell

1306
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:05,088
you a strong enough animal to get that

1307
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:07,700
high right that said if you get an

1308
01:05:05,088 --> 01:05:10,670
edible and let's let's say let's call it

1309
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:14,199
a it's a chocolate bar right and each of

1310
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:16,849
the little squares is ten milligrams and

1311
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:19,460
you're only supposed to take one square

1312
01:05:16,849 --> 01:05:21,950
right and you eat it all right that's

1313
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:24,530
good chocolate and so that maybe you're

1314
01:05:21,949 --> 01:05:26,509
tempted to take the second one and then

1315
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:27,880
you start to get the munchies

1316
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:30,730
you want to make sure you have something

1317
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,108
else to take write more or as the

1318
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:34,298
classic thing to happen I forget the

1319
01:05:32,108 --> 01:05:37,630
name of this senator but early in canvas

1320
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:40,838
legalization she flew from some East

1321
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:43,119
Coast state to Colorado and she bought a

1322
01:05:40,838 --> 01:05:46,358
chocolate bar that was supposed to be

1323
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:48,430
eight doses and and she didn't read the

1324
01:05:46,358 --> 01:05:50,768
packaging she didn't do her homework as

1325
01:05:48,429 --> 01:05:52,838
a responsible patient and when she got

1326
01:05:50,768 --> 01:05:55,479
back to the van and they drove on she

1327
01:05:52,838 --> 01:05:57,250
aimed the chocolate bar just enjoying

1328
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:59,588
the chocolate bar but she didn't realize

1329
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:01,719
it was eight doses when she had an

1330
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:05,018
intense experience it was a very

1331
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:06,899
unpleasant she went to the hospital you

1332
01:06:05,018 --> 01:06:10,828
know she and and it became national news

1333
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:13,960
and and one group of people are like see

1334
01:06:10,829 --> 01:06:16,109
marijuana medicine is dangerous and then

1335
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:18,278
present marijuana patients raw like

1336
01:06:16,108 --> 01:06:20,409
she's being irresponsible with her

1337
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:21,759
medicine you know we wouldn't say that

1338
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:24,068
she was responsible she didn't read the

1339
01:06:21,759 --> 01:06:26,019
label in an eight-hour oxycontin either

1340
01:06:24,068 --> 01:06:29,170
right we would say that's a patient

1341
01:06:26,018 --> 01:06:31,598
error well same thing with if you're if

1342
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:34,900
you're you know taking more than you're

1343
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:36,548
supposed to a THC as well so so yeah if

1344
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:38,588
you're if you're talking about you know

1345
01:06:36,548 --> 01:06:40,449
the difference between five and ten

1346
01:06:38,588 --> 01:06:42,699
milligrams or ten and twenty milligrams

1347
01:06:40,449 --> 01:06:45,308
we're talking about 45 minutes before

1348
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:46,719
you're feeling you know it's at least a

1349
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:49,000
little more like yourself and not

1350
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:51,278
concerned but but in these type of cases

1351
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,900
when you're trying to take five or ten

1352
01:06:51,278 --> 01:06:55,599
milligrams and you're taking a hundred

1353
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:57,250
milligrams that's that's it that's a

1354
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:02,830
difficult day you're not gonna

1355
01:06:57,250 --> 01:07:06,579
enjoy or maybe enjoy a whole line yes

1356
01:07:02,829 --> 01:07:09,909
sir yeah awesome thank you appreciate

1357
01:07:06,579 --> 01:07:11,590
your energy they could have glad to be

1358
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:16,179
here and I love teaching about cannabis

1359
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:18,340
medicine so I get enthusiastic these

1360
01:07:16,179 --> 01:07:21,039
financial this kind of things how much

1361
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:24,760
does this teacher cost and what some

1362
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,480
insurance companies do sure that's a

1363
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,030
really good question

1364
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:30,789
unfortunately insurance companies will

1365
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:34,260
not come anywhere near this until it's

1366
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:36,639
federally legal and so unfortunately

1367
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:41,400
that means that we got to all pay for it

1368
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:44,650
out of pocket which is a drag the the

1369
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:46,360
recreational stores are presently more

1370
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:48,400
expensive than they were in the old

1371
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:50,559
medical days because they've got a lot

1372
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,389
more overhead and you know they've got

1373
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,949
to pay for advertising and things like

1374
01:07:52,389 --> 01:07:57,759
that that didn't really happen very much

1375
01:07:53,949 --> 01:08:02,529
in the medical industry so I would say

1376
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:05,230
that you know a bottle of teacher in the

1377
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:09,100
recreational market will probably run

1378
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:11,349
you you know between 55 and 75 dollars

1379
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:17,380
depending on the strength and who you

1380
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:19,088
buy it from and at what store how do you

1381
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:21,869
mean to let this test can you get a

1382
01:08:19,088 --> 01:08:26,109
picture and tell them you have a picture

1383
01:08:21,869 --> 01:08:28,149
no but they're all required to be tested

1384
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:33,180
by the state ahead of time and so you

1385
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:33,179
can rely on how much is in each one

1386
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:39,079
yep even though you're not getting the

1387
01:08:37,338 --> 01:08:41,059
same thing for a brownie if you're

1388
01:08:39,079 --> 01:08:43,220
really good over a course and you're

1389
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:44,900
still getting the same thing you would

1390
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:48,079
but if you happen to get the brownie

1391
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:50,119
that's especially high in THC and mint

1392
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:53,479
and that this one's lower in THC this

1393
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:56,000
one way you might feel more more high

1394
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:57,349
from than you want to be because if

1395
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,710
you're if you're trying to give yourself

1396
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:03,079
10 milligrams of or 5 milligrams of THC

1397
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:05,509
and for some reason when you were

1398
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:08,420
started the THC ended up in this corner

1399
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:14,920
you can end up with a higher amount when

1400
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:17,659
you're doing it at home so the capsules

1401
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:20,838
depending again on on who the producer

1402
01:09:17,659 --> 01:09:23,750
is and what store you're buying an app

1403
01:09:20,838 --> 01:09:26,359
will float between five and ten dollars

1404
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:28,338
capsule which unfortunately capsules are

1405
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:30,079
still pretty high priced especially if

1406
01:09:28,338 --> 01:09:34,489
you want to be taking 3 a day right so

1407
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:37,369
that's unfortunate but but there's hope

1408
01:09:34,489 --> 01:09:40,880
because prices are continually coming

1409
01:09:37,369 --> 01:09:43,068
down in the recreational market because

1410
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,380
there's more producers and more

1411
01:09:43,069 --> 01:09:47,779
competition and more people are making

1412
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:50,509
capsules plus the companies are learning

1413
01:09:47,779 --> 01:09:55,670
to be more efficient and to save their

1414
01:09:50,509 --> 01:09:58,460
costs as well in contrast you know I

1415
01:09:55,670 --> 01:10:01,520
mentioned earlier that you know you can

1416
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:04,270
also buy locally because we happen to

1417
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:07,010
live on Vashon where there are you know

1418
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:10,610
cannabis is historically our number one

1419
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:13,699
cash problem and and it's been that way

1420
01:10:10,609 --> 01:10:14,750
since the 70s and love it or hate it

1421
01:10:13,699 --> 01:10:16,970
it's been the truth of

1422
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:20,659
matter and we also have got a lot of

1423
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:22,460
good herbalists on the island and you

1424
01:10:20,659 --> 01:10:24,619
know there are places on the island that

1425
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:27,980
you can get teachers for as little as

1426
01:10:24,619 --> 01:10:30,470
forty dollars of all and the important

1427
01:10:27,979 --> 01:10:32,509
thing though is if you buy from family

1428
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:36,320
or friends or even make your home

1429
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:39,010
I implore you to make sure that it's

1430
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:41,420
laboratory tested for its strength

1431
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:44,270
because you don't want em to have an

1432
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:46,310
experience where either you're making

1433
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:47,990
your own tincture and the first time you

1434
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:49,910
make it it's weak and then you make it

1435
01:10:47,989 --> 01:10:52,159
again and it's super potent and there's

1436
01:10:49,909 --> 01:10:58,789
this disparity and so you give yourself

1437
01:10:52,159 --> 01:11:00,889
a negative experience for and you want

1438
01:10:58,789 --> 01:11:04,159
to you know the part of Medicine is

1439
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:06,289
where the repeatable results and if you

1440
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:10,369
want repeatable results you need to know

1441
01:11:06,289 --> 01:11:12,140
what your variable a is and so if you

1442
01:11:10,369 --> 01:11:14,960
make your own or if you buy it and

1443
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:18,170
formally on the island or from anywhere

1444
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:20,029
in the country you know make sure that

1445
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:23,119
the that the person who's producing it

1446
01:11:20,029 --> 01:11:24,649
the herbalist has had it tested and if

1447
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:26,840
you're gonna make your own it's really

1448
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:28,699
easy to have your products tested just

1449
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:33,020
right over here on the other side of the

1450
01:11:28,699 --> 01:11:35,659
ferry from at analytical 360 is a lab

1451
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:37,040
that will do testing for you know any

1452
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:39,529
patient you don't need an authorization

1453
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:41,449
just go in and give them yourself and

1454
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:45,469
say you know tell me how strong it is /

1455
01:11:41,449 --> 01:11:49,059
/ dropper squirt right and anybody who

1456
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:52,030
is any herbalist who's informally and

1457
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:55,880
illegally producing it on the island

1458
01:11:52,029 --> 01:11:57,649
would be getting it lab tested as well

1459
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:00,579
because that person cares about their

1460
01:11:57,649 --> 01:12:00,579
patients yes

1461
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:03,879
[Music]

1462
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:12,170
so it is legal to grow your own in

1463
01:12:09,529 --> 01:12:15,649
Washington if you have a patient

1464
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:17,868
authorization card from your doctor if

1465
01:12:15,649 --> 01:12:20,059
your doctor fills out a form that says

1466
01:12:17,868 --> 01:12:23,809
that you have one of the corresponding

1467
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:27,079
illnesses they check the box and they

1468
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:30,849
sign it and that piece of paper gives

1469
01:12:27,078 --> 01:12:34,698
you the right to grow four plants

1470
01:12:30,849 --> 01:12:38,300
if you then choose to sign up to the

1471
01:12:34,698 --> 01:12:42,319
state's registry of patients that four

1472
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:47,300
plants become six and if you have your

1473
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:50,118
doctor right on the authorization that

1474
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:54,050
you need more plants than what's allowed

1475
01:12:50,118 --> 01:13:10,250
and you get on the registry you can get

1476
01:12:54,050 --> 01:13:12,739
up to 15 plants your private your

1477
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:15,800
primary care doctor may well as a matter

1478
01:13:12,738 --> 01:13:17,839
of fact there are I can't say all but

1479
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:21,139
several of the doctors at the Batchelor

1480
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:23,010
clinic give authorizations and also

1481
01:13:21,139 --> 01:13:24,960
there is a naturopath that I

1482
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:26,730
for folks to regularly who's very

1483
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,789
familiar with cannabis medicine and

1484
01:13:26,729 --> 01:13:34,739
patients who I can I can give out his

1485
01:13:29,789 --> 01:13:37,260
number to anybody who wants it I must I

1486
01:13:34,739 --> 01:13:39,929
must caution you from getting on the

1487
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:42,210
state's registry though if you want to

1488
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:45,300
preserve your privacy because as we know

1489
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:49,829
the state is not very good with keeping

1490
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:51,869
things secret and you know all the tens

1491
01:13:49,829 --> 01:13:55,619
of thousands of patients there are in

1492
01:13:51,869 --> 01:13:57,329
Washington I think we're only at 14,000

1493
01:13:55,619 --> 01:14:01,109
in the entire state that have signed up

1494
01:13:57,329 --> 01:14:04,590
for it and those are mostly people who

1495
01:14:01,109 --> 01:14:07,139
are doing it because they want to pay

1496
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:08,550
less tax and when you buy because if you

1497
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:19,860
become a patient's you don't have to pay

1498
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:22,829
the sales tax no you're technically not

1499
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:25,469
supposed to smoke marijuana in the sight

1500
01:14:22,829 --> 01:14:28,619
of other people so you're so you're

1501
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:31,020
supposed to be able to enjoy it at home

1502
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:33,809
or if you're out by yourself

1503
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:35,370
the wilderness or you know but you're

1504
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:37,350
but that's right right now you're not

1505
01:14:35,369 --> 01:14:41,099
even allowed to do cannabis social clubs

1506
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:43,289
in Seattle where you're in a you know

1507
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:45,810
because there's other people there right

1508
01:14:43,289 --> 01:14:49,470
now do people do it all the time sure

1509
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:50,850
but but it's not legal technically

1510
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:53,930
technically you're not supposed to do it

1511
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:53,930
in eyesight of other folks

1512
01:14:58,029 --> 01:15:04,939
so so so so the information that I'm

1513
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:07,430
giving you is from years of experience

1514
01:15:04,939 --> 01:15:09,229
and so there probably isn't a particular

1515
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:11,750
place you're going to go online that's

1516
01:15:09,229 --> 01:15:13,669
going to have synthesized at all like I

1517
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:16,340
am you can certainly find out

1518
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:20,180
information you can google Tarkin sins

1519
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:23,119
and cannabis and you'll get us a slew of

1520
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:26,470
information a good part of it will be

1521
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:32,840
accurate I like to recommend the website

1522
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:35,090
project CVD org and as a matter of fact

1523
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:38,480
right now now their homepage they've got

1524
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:41,060
a big thing on Parkinson's in CBD for

1525
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:45,289
beginners which is an excellent article

1526
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:47,930
setting in is a project CBD for the

1527
01:15:45,289 --> 01:15:50,029
information there is the best of the

1528
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:54,770
best their articles are written by

1529
01:15:50,029 --> 01:15:56,899
people who know about cannabis and also

1530
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:58,700
if you go to their they've got a section

1531
01:15:56,899 --> 01:16:02,000
on the website that says conditions and

1532
01:15:58,699 --> 01:16:04,189
it lists 50 conditions that cannabis can

1533
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,350
be used for if you click on Parkinson's

1534
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:12,949
it will take you to a page of all of the

1535
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:14,600
medical science that has been done into

1536
01:16:12,949 --> 01:16:17,300
cannabis and Parkinson's and you can

1537
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:19,579
actually read the study that not someone

1538
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:22,130
filtering the information for you which

1539
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:24,800
is that's where I go to learn about

1540
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:26,300
dosage for patients because I don't I

1541
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,430
don't want to read it filtered through

1542
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:30,350
somebody's article I want to I want to

1543
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:32,990
be the actual scientific study that was

1544
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:35,930
done in the UK right and so they have

1545
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:37,699
both on projects TV news website they

1546
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:38,880
have quality articles that are

1547
01:16:37,699 --> 01:16:41,189
synthesizing this

1548
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,199
raishin and they also have the original

1549
01:16:41,189 --> 01:16:48,179

01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:12,960
this sort canna West sea I'll go in

1557
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:14,849
there and ask for specialized well they

1558
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,130
can't compound

1559
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:18,720
like they're like a pharmacy would but

1560
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:22,020
they will know which of their products

1561
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:23,340
is more most appropriate for you and I

1562
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:24,720
was going to get them out at the end but

1563
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:30,390
since you're leaving let me give you one

1564
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:33,900
of my cars in case you want to ask a

1565
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:36,900
follow-up question and also in case

1566
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:39,739
you're interested in being introduced to

1567
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:39,739
somebody on the island

1568
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:45,369
[Music]

1569
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:54,409
and I I do this all volunteer work I

1570
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:58,130
make my money through my podcast and

1571
01:17:54,409 --> 01:18:00,739
through paid speaking engagements and I

1572
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:05,859
teach patients because I think it's

1573
01:18:00,739 --> 01:18:08,269
important so the name of the Islander

1574
01:18:05,859 --> 01:18:10,579
sure out after the beating when it's a

1575
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:12,890
little more one-to-one I would be happy

1576
01:18:10,579 --> 01:18:14,449
to tell you more about where you can get

1577
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:14,869
another island and movement and who to

1578
01:18:14,449 --> 01:18:20,210
talk to

1579
01:18:14,869 --> 01:18:21,680
yeah I know I don't mind those questions

1580
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:24,350
in an email just just nothing to be a

1581
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,670
facebook because it's that's that's not

1582
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:29,660
secure for any kind of healthy

1583
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:32,449
discussion yeah totally so another yes

1584
01:18:29,659 --> 01:18:35,000
right so before the whole thing with the

1585
01:18:32,449 --> 01:18:37,880
whole licensing all that came I thought

1586
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:41,210
I had my papers and I would buy bits of

1587
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:47,869
things and so no I wanted that never got

1588
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:51,140
used how is that so if if it's uh if

1589
01:18:47,869 --> 01:18:54,949
it's flour itself like the buds like

1590
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:58,910
first money that slowly degrades over

1591
01:18:54,949 --> 01:19:00,859
time because you Roma therapy about the

1592
01:18:58,909 --> 01:19:03,619
smell of it is part of the medicine and

1593
01:19:00,859 --> 01:19:06,739
it degrades over time so maybe if

1594
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:09,109
flowers will will stay really met

1595
01:19:06,739 --> 01:19:11,119
medicinal for a year oh this is more

1596
01:19:09,109 --> 01:19:14,719
like teachers and so things like that

1597
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:17,869
teachers will be self shelf-stable you

1598
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:20,060
know easily a year sometimes they add

1599
01:19:17,869 --> 01:19:21,439
additives that make it less shelf-stable

1600
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:23,870
like like it

1601
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:25,879
like raspberry flavorings or something

1602
01:19:23,869 --> 01:19:29,559
like that but the but it's been a very

1603
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:33,050
clean medicine let's say for example a a

1604
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:35,900
full can avid cannabis extract in

1605
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:39,860
alcohol which what the in a dark

1606
01:19:35,899 --> 01:19:41,929
container kept in a dark area your home

1607
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:43,729
not on the shelf that could stay good

1608
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:46,310
for two or three years because it

1609
01:19:43,729 --> 01:19:49,219
stopped degrading things like edibles

1610
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:51,620
and and capsules it depends on what

1611
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:53,659
they're made out of it but but but once

1612
01:19:51,619 --> 01:19:58,119
the cannabis is taken out of the plant

1613
01:19:53,659 --> 01:19:58,119
and put an alcohol becomes very stops -

1614
01:20:07,239 --> 01:20:17,289
thank you so any other questions before

1615
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:22,250
we wrap up it amazes me how much money

1616
01:20:17,289 --> 01:20:26,930
could be collected by the government if

1617
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:29,750
they made marijuana not you know you'd

1618
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:31,909
have to have a prescription and you have

1619
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:34,340
to pay for it and you're paying an awful

1620
01:20:31,909 --> 01:20:36,380
lot of it even if you're making it

1621
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:43,610
yourself yeah you're right about that me

1622
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:48,130
then just just in our own state they tax

1623
01:20:43,609 --> 01:20:51,679
it 37 percent before the sales tax and

1624
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:54,409
so that's a lot of money being raised at

1625
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:57,890
the same time at 37 percent tax is

1626
01:20:54,409 --> 01:21:00,109
coming out of our pockets as patients so

1627
01:20:57,890 --> 01:21:02,990
that's kind of a drag too because if

1628
01:21:00,109 --> 01:21:04,199
they if they decrease the taxes patients

1629
01:21:02,989 --> 01:21:05,760
wouldn't have to pay so much

1630
01:21:04,199 --> 01:21:12,449
but you're right there's a lot of money

1631
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:16,380
to be raised in taxes that's a festive

1632
01:21:12,449 --> 01:21:17,670
night they're right on well then I'll be

1633
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:20,010
around for a few minutes for questions

1634
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:21,840
if anybody has been kind of informally

1635
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:25,190
on the side thank you very much for

1636
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,190
