1
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:50,129
thank you so much using technology and

2
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:54,289
tools to go into new levels of

3
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,290
expression this ancient relationship

4
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,270
ultimately in each one of these people

5
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,380
is this monstrous force of innovation

6
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,270
and it's an honor to get business

7
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,308
moderate this panel my name's Jeremy

8
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,320
mama I'm from Portland Oregon and the

9
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:08,099
director of production science at Perth

10
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,898
coal tomorrow

11
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,149
it's a high-tech controlled environment

12
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:13,890
facility and the working cannabis metal

13
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:15,959
like found in the dispensary called

14
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,519
Pharma co-founded Logan cannabis

15
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,520
projects and founded

16
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:32,549
with handles over a year so they feel

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,590
like a way I know how to quite say this

18
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,989
year things are really going to a new

19
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,299
level and and really I want to make sure

20
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:40,859
they've allocate any of time to hearing

21
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,259
where those levels are so I'd like to

22
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:46,099
start with a basic question analytical

23
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,570
reading implies that there is technology

24
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:50,609
facilitating outcomes in the genomic

25
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:53,008
space and then ultimately that results

26
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:55,200
in a key matific outcome what I would

27
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,209
like to talk about the first of these to

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,609
have them and introduce themselves and

29
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:02,549
then you into what is your experience

30
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:04,799
with using analytics and reading to

31
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:11,400
actually get into this space of creating

32
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:14,669
plants that are more useful my name is

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,239
Josh Porter I'm the president of SC labs

34
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:20,729
and based in Santa Cruz

35
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,680
I've been testing cannabis now for

36
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:25,619
almost 10 years I started on actually

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,540
working and ready shops Depot weren't

38
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,620
there for a year and I don't have

39
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:30,419
experience with reading I have

40
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,539
experience with analytical siphoning and

41
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:35,250
supporting breeders and it's just been

42
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:37,259
exciting to see people kind of take

43
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,750
reading to the next level and kind of

44
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,000
the you know garage reading that we had

45
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,840
early on where we're just crossing

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,759
hybrids and hoping for something

47
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,349
interesting to you know kind of what

48
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:49,199
we're seeing today which is a really

49
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:52,680
interesting key motivic expression that

50
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:54,810
was kind of finally tapping into tension

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,360
of what cannabis can do I mean you have

52
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,579
this plant that is always very unique

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,530
interesting bioactive cannabinoids and

54
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,599
really we're only playing with a couple

55
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,688
of them and a plant that can also

56
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,128
produce all this unique chirpy profile

57
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:11,310
that can potentiate those effects

58
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:12,899
potentially and give unique flavors and

59
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,420
aroma to cannabis and we're really only

60
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,310
working with you know you know maybe

61
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:20,429
seven eight nine ten of those

62
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,319
cannabinoids so that's that's been

63
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,329
exciting to see these people really kind

64
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,539
of starting to to challenge that in a

65
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,909
challenge that what the plant can do and

66
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:34,348
it produce interesting to me you mean

67
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:36,929
got trains I'm rigid you know I'm the

68
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:40,798
president of Steven I'm also the

69
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,659
director of R&amp;D for me this has been a

70
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,200
really exciting night because I come out

71
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:49,560
of plant biotech and and so this has

72
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:52,048
been interesting to see an industry that

73
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,900
should have as much information about

74
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,750
their plan as any other cash crop

75
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,189
because we are as a big akattak prop as

76
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,650
any other crop united states

77
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:02,729
but you know it was interesting for me

78
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,430
to be able to come into this industry

79
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:07,619
and say oh wow we know nothing and then

80
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,329
to start to compile the data from the

81
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,879
tens of thousands of tests that we've

82
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:13,439
done and to start to see trends and

83
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,789
those trends are what Josh is talking

84
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,699
about right where we can start the co

85
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:19,620
these plants obviously CBD THC were the

86
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,359
first ones right but we have a plant

87
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,459
that makes over 500 active compounds

88
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,259
right by active compounds I mean by they

89
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,959
have biological activity that we know of

90
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,908
because we know of their corresponding

91
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,560
or exactly the same compounds and other

92
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:36,168
plants right so we know that they have

93
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:38,459
functionality and so you know what we

94
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:39,668
what we can do at the analytical

95
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,758
chemistry level is

96
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:44,198
use some of those tests as markers for

97
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:45,788
greeting without even going into

98
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,590
genetics right so as long as you've an

99
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:49,180
outcome you can follow it right so

100
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,978
that's the beauty of analytical

101
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,468
chemistry in the in the early days of

102
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:55,628
the industry because there were markers

103
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:57,699
you could see the results of a breeding

104
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,960
program and now we've taken to the next

105
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,819
level where we now have marker-assisted

106
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,128
breeding we start to do the same things

107
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:05,650
that the Monsanto so the Dow eggs can do

108
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:07,900
and and those things will help improve

109
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:10,508
the proper products that we make on our

110
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:14,489
site as well before waiting for Big Mac

111
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:16,569
to get into its own Seth preferred

112
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,728
co-founder of Oregon's CBD where

113
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:41,588
industrial hemp seed research an

114
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:44,050
development company based in my

115
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:47,639
background is actually PhD in sociology

116
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:51,278
and my my analytical training was in

117
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:54,158
analyzing large multi causal datasets

118
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:56,379
looking at world energy problems I also

119
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:59,528
had a killer breeding facility in my

120
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:01,088
garage but about 10 years ago so I was

121
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:02,860
teaching at a carriage policy class at

122
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:04,279
Oregon State where it's up for 13 years

123
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,410
and it

124
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,419
to coincide with legalization in Oregon

125
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:11,000
and that was a recreational adult use

126
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,520
THC legalization and industrial hemp and

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,418
industrial hemp was legalized in Oregon

128
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,918
one month before the 2014 farm bill pass

129
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:21,740
read the farm bill read the Oregon law

130
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:24,199
and said oh man we've got plans to fit

131
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,319
that bill I think we can make this work

132
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,800
and the main driver of this for me and

133
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,379
was moving from plant counts and canopy

134
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,900
size limits to unlimited numbers of

135
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:37,519
plants because you know as soon as you

136
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:39,019
have access to very large populations

137
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,279
and you have those analytical

138
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:42,469
capabilities you can start to tease

139
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,809
apart some of the most incredible things

140
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:47,060
for this planet they manifest themselves

141
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,060
consistently as long as you are looking

142
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,189
today we are going into our fifth year

143
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,470
of productions we had over 4,000 acres

144
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:57,800
of industrial hemp grown in the United

145
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:00,530
States using our high CBD high terpene

146
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,509
content feminized industrial hemp seed

147
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:04,309
and we're looking at about a hundred

148
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,959
million seed capacity for this upcoming

149
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,030
year with the expansion of the farm bill

150
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:12,370
in addition to a number of different

151
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:12,369
novel compounds as successfully isolated

152
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:21,770
this also develop a very impressive

153
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:23,659
American high CDG cultivars which is

154
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:26,509
quite a feat that than we ever seen I

155
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,970
think the marketplace the big props to

156
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:32,269
you for that my name is Riley I'm a

157
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:34,280
plant breeder founder of chimeric

158
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:37,459
genetics which is a seed company around

159
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,589
the Europe and also same company called

160
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:41,079
Kiel American salt

161
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:44,319
and we do like I said Connecticut ports

162
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:46,240
for Caden lp's plant-breeding also

163
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,250
worked with NATO research mark Louis for

164
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,389
a few years down here between 2013 and

165
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:54,310
2016 and being so pretty interesting

166
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:58,629
keema Baris on which you saw on the

167
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:01,420
screen in the previous presentation so

168
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:03,939
on you know on athletics you know how do

169
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:07,120
we have how do we talk about how it

170
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:10,149
impacts us as cultivators and selectors

171
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,620
of breeders and you know I think the

172
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:13,029
truth is that we following we've all

173
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,350
been doing this all along you know

174
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:16,299
anybody that's selecting plants you're

175
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:19,810
going plants and selecting using our

176
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:24,610
nose or our long as nerve you know our

177
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:27,759
brain by saying these things analytics

178
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,830
really gives us a sixth or seventh sense

179
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,139
right a way to look at these plants that

180
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:33,460
we can you know we can't you can't pick

181
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:35,379
up a flower and smell it and say oh

182
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,080
there's seven milligrams and limonene a

183
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:39,549
minute right so we rely on technology to

184
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,710
do that since we started relying on

185
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:43,269
technology we've seen some pretty

186
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,670
interesting things you know I mean for

187
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:46,779
example

188
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:49,569
molecular farms last year one of our

189
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:52,899
clients turn a pro they won first place

190
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:55,090
in a couple of different categories one

191
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:57,250
of them was the THC category with their

192
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,509
lemon crush and I was you know one of

193
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,139
the first varieties that was really

194
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:03,819
created through directed analysis you

195
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:05,470
know chasee compounds using a laboratory

196
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,670
and there is some people in the

197
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,009
community that didn't like that they

198
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:11,409
said that they cheated right well to me

199
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:13,509
it's not cheating to use analytical

200
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:15,370
method it's like we're we're in this

201
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:16,470
developing industry we want to use all

202
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,269
the technology

203
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,279
to further our goal because our goal is

204
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:21,750
to further the plant right to making

205
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,970
better plants for consumers better

206
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:35,580
plants for hours and the laboratory is

207
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:37,500
just a tool to help us do that using the

208
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,840
analytical technology which clearly in

209
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,730
cold culminates in a chemo tipic an

210
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,680
alice will validate that the

211
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:47,100
phytochemical inventory will plan

212
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,959
accurately as these compounds ultimately

213
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:54,149
there's other analytical tools they're

214
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:55,920
being used to optimize I'm wondering

215
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:58,139
every set maybe you could describe it a

216
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:01,649
little bit about other tools you have

217
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:03,000
used prior to the chemo type to optimize

218
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:05,009
the plants and to get to these

219
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,960
outrageous outcomes like by the way not

220
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:09,330
just what we're calling a tight floor

221
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,970
plan which is CPU knockouts that have

222
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,220
high CBG so like the the most I've heard

223
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,950
actually from available lab results over

224
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:21,710
anywhere but also I'm hearing a typed by

225
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,710
plant cannabinoid Knoll so rich and

226
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:42,870
besides lots and lots of testing we

227
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:45,689
spend literally years in using every

228
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:48,360
single testing the analytical tool that

229
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,700
we can there's a orange photonics it's a

230
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,090
good example they're a vendor here it

231
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:57,210
says it's sort of a rough HPLC system we

232
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:59,080
use for screening but it allows us to it

233
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:01,900
doesn't work right actually for

234
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:09,250
we're looking for but it messes up in a

235
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:11,169
way that's predictable if you run if

236
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,789
you've run five thousand tests with the

237
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:14,259
machine if you've got all the data to

238
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:15,399
back it up you look at it go okay if

239
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:18,250
you've said it offer third-party

240
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,049
analysis with a competent lab you can

241
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,210
start to see the pattern emerge right

242
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:23,979
and this is this is really what we're

243
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,240
what we're looking at the main thing

244
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,190
that we do outside the analytical

245
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,159
testing is actually field trials for our

246
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:32,500
cultivars that we released to farmers

247
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:34,750
which is something that is it's a mice

248
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,279
number in the THC industry for the most

249
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,440
part because of the small sample size

250
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,879
that most farmers are working with as

251
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,010
Mark said earlier that previous

252
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,379
presentation you know 10 phenotypes of

253
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:46,750
10 seeds that's a good thing right

254
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:48,970
when you're doing something that is

255
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:52,029
literally thousands of acres at a time

256
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:55,330
you cannot have that type of phenotypic

257
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:58,209
variation we say that our plants are

258
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,460
homozygous for very particular traits we

259
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,410
know that because we've done large-scale

260
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,360
field trials a year before where we

261
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:06,100
evaluated 20 different mothers that were

262
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,690
separated out from thousands of

263
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,269
different planets to get to that point

264
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:13,090
to see which one actually recombines and

265
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:16,539
creates a good field plant that farmers

266
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,830
could succeed with it's almost like when

267
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:21,039
you're seeing thousands and acres of

268
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,840
your seeds out there the plants are

269
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,149
naked if there was any error in your

270
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,160
breeding it's going to show up and

271
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:28,840
people are not going to be happy which

272
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:32,079
was evidences here in Oregon with

273
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:36,100
memory sale essence Avery industrial

274
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,379
hemp seeds providers Thank You Ryan I'm

275
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,210
wondering with your experience not just

276
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:42,639
with me prove it especially with maple

277
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,650
in the survey of the chemo scape it took

278
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,659
place in California actually I'm not

279
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,549
sure if anybody is aware of it if you

280
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:50,829
miss this last talk that dr. mark Lewis

281
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:52,990
Ned they provide an effort it was a very

282
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,690
sophisticated effort to look at what is

283
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,460
out there let's be on th CDC media and

284
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,990
what's the inventory that this market

285
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,580
and most mentally was the most mature

286
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,899
work I've seen I know how deeply

287
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,720
involved with that can you talk about

288
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:07,419
some of the analytical work outside of

289
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,028
the chemo type data or the analytical

290
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:12,490
tools rather that were used to be

291
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:14,559
productive in creating a really mature

292
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,299
body of work well we really looked at

293
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,219
chemistry so you know Mark said marks

294
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:22,179
chemist and obviously that kind of

295
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:26,889
drives the mission but you know

296
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:29,019
marketing says it's very true the the

297
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:31,269
metabolomic Emmis tree that is produced

298
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:33,759
by the plant is really a reflection of

299
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,169
the genome and so like like Reggie was

300
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,179
saying earlier we don't necessarily have

301
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:39,159
to go and use all these tools to start

302
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:41,139
poking around the genome when just by

303
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,519
using the chemistry assay we can

304
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,720
actually get a whole bunch of

305
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:46,689
information about what the plant

306
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,600
produces so that was really our focus

307
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:53,290
was you know HPLC for cannabinoids and

308
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,800
the GCF ID for for for terpenoids

309
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:59,529
and you know we had the like like I see

310
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,669
an SD bell we did intake for

311
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:05,500
dispensaries you know in the process of

312
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:07,779
these many tens of thousands of samples

313
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,399
that came to the laboratory for the

314
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:11,439
flower destined to end up on the shelves

315
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,799
of a dispensary we will take this

316
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,529
analytical data

317
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,469
and you plot what we saw in the market

318
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:20,149
and I think SC labs and steeple apps

319
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,410
probably have very similar data as well

320
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:23,178
right you get as you're running

321
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:25,129
thousands and thousands tests to start

322
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:27,499
to group things and see that there's

323
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:28,999
different types and you see what exists

324
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,709
in the market they also see the holes

325
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:32,540
and what doesn't exist in the market

326
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:35,359
right like what we know if theoretically

327
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:37,219
exists in the space and and then how do

328
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,048
we fill those those needs it's like Mark

329
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,660
said earlier it's like that's innovation

330
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:43,730
you see you see where what's what's a

331
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:46,969
missing SKU and that they can use that

332
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,860
information to go and develop them one

333
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,660
of the qualities I know that I hear

334
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,789
advanced readers speaking to as an

335
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:55,879
outcome of analytically assisted reading

336
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:57,860
is really hitting stabilization I think

337
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,019
there's been some potentially like abuse

338
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,249
of that idea in that we don't know what

339
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:04,879
we're talking about when we talk about

340
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:06,320
stability and a broad and general sense

341
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,659
I think it's important to think about

342
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,550
what sort of traits we're trying to

343
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:13,069
stabilize and see consistent and almost

344
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:15,319
like its expression and curious if you

345
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:18,110
could describe some of the traits that

346
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,390
you would prioritize in terms of

347
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,580
stabilizing for consumer relevance and

348
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:24,470
other elements it totally depends on

349
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,820
what your goal is and any good reading

350
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,769
project starts with thing that

351
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:33,650
originated us what is your goal are you

352
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:37,579
trying to make are you trying to have a

353
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:39,709
fuel flavoured dense tall short

354
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,660
flowering plant or are you looking for

355
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:44,509
something that has other characteristics

356
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:46,669
so it's it's that is everything and then

357
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:48,950
you don't build out from there and you

358
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:50,750
make it personal what is your goal where

359
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:53,300
are you going my goal is to make sure

360
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,070
that we have access to all of these

361
00:15:53,299 --> 00:16:03,889
different compounds for people and

362
00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:06,890
animals rice there's there's been

363
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:08,750
fantastic fantastic research has been

364
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:11,600
done by GW Pharmaceuticals they had a

365
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,039
15-year monopoly a huge head start in

366
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,019
this industry and they have these

367
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,750
wonderful plants that just sit in a

368
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:20,059
building like they're not doing any good

369
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,389
right now and while there's great

370
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:24,649
information that can be derived from

371
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:26,149
pharmaceutical trials like encourage

372
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:29,509
companies to continue doing that type of

373
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:31,789
work just getting the compounds out into

374
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:34,100
the public sphere for people to use and

375
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:35,839
try and say well this works for this or

376
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,940
this works for that I had no idea that

377
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,009
CBD V is just like nicotine and coffee

378
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,960
that's great let's find out if that's

379
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:43,370
true for the entire population or if

380
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,629
it's just a subset of the population

381
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:51,169
with a very specific very specific

382
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:52,669
genetic makeup right it's we need to

383
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:55,179
look at what our goals are before we

384
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:59,689
head down those paths

385
00:16:55,179 --> 00:17:01,309
yeah yeah I mean having a goal thing is

386
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,590
really important I think the way the

387
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:05,000
canvas community currently works is you

388
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,699
know people will finally do these

389
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,289
phenotypes elections and save 100,000

390
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,529
plants you find a tricky special plant

391
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:15,440
and then they want to breed that on the

392
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:17,539
cross doji right and and that kind of oh

393
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,250
gee if eyes everything in the market and

394
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:21,500
it brings back this uniformity and its

395
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,180
kind of its like I said these breeding

396
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,609
programs don't have a goal other than

397
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,740
I've got something special that I need

398
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:29,000
to do something with it right but when

399
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,680
you have something special again you

400
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,299
have to think about what your goal is am

401
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,269
I trying to replicate this thing that I

402
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:36,950
found into a seed line but it's like I

403
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:38,779
said you have to start with the goal

404
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,610
right and every breeding program really

405
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:41,899
has to have a goal it's not just about

406
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:45,199
throwing a ball around and trying to

407
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:47,720
find something paying your mortgage is

408
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,509
not an acceptable I want to ask others

409
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,539
either

410
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:55,900
and I can add just a different spin on

411
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:57,460
stability right so stability what you

412
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,600
when you're talking about the way Seth

413
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:03,190
talks about it either

414
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:05,379
the goal is established and you're going

415
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,779
after the specific trait or traits and

416
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,760
then the breeding program accentuates

417
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:12,759
that right but there's a whole other

418
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:15,308
level of stability and AG that we kind

419
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:19,179
of ignore right and that's why we are

420
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:21,428
stuck with clones right so the future of

421
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:25,960
this industry cannot be cloned based I

422
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:28,179
just want everybody but the only way to

423
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,009
make it not on base is to understand

424
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:32,259
basic breeding techniques into then to

425
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:35,769
breed for what is true stability so that

426
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:38,048
you can have a unique donor the donor

427
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:40,058
unique you know flower donor and then

428
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:41,589
every time you breed them you get the

429
00:18:40,058 --> 00:18:44,139
same genetics out right and so that

430
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:47,339
requires a lot of inbreeding back

431
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,140
crossing traditional you know

432
00:18:47,339 --> 00:19:03,548
agricultural breeding that we do not do

433
00:18:50,140 --> 00:19:05,590
yet in this industry so other than which

434
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:08,379
you're saying absolutely and as well as

435
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:12,579
stability you know I think when you're

436
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:15,070
reading for for you know traits outside

437
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:17,259
of the chemo typic traits you know that

438
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:20,019
that's a whole thing that achieving

439
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:24,009
stability with your chemo Tiffa Canales

440
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:26,859
is important too and I think early on

441
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:29,529
the laboratories didn't necessarily even

442
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:31,629
have a state you know the the right cut

443
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:32,259
tools to give these guys all the

444
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,360
information

445
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:36,308
I don't think it's necessarily on the

446
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:37,389
greeting community's fault it's I think

447
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:40,928
they didn't necessarily have the tools

448
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:42,759
until really recently um to to take to

449
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,960
go in and in action rework or some of

450
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:45,579
these key much other traits that that

451
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,950
now we start to see kind of exploded as

452
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:49,178
as the laboratory anybody nap analytical

453
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,340
standards for a lot of the compounds you

454
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:54,669
guys are are actually expressing in the

455
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:57,159
plant now when we know that chemical

456
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:59,559
analytical testing services have really

457
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,540
raised a trail by which producers could

458
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:03,519
derive insight and really understand

459
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:05,740
sort of what the inventory of your

460
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,240
plants were I felt very fortunate and

461
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,919
Oregon to have met a man named Pat

462
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,470
Marshall who was actually doing testing

463
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,660
from the mid 90s and really was an

464
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:16,000
activist chemical analyst who was

465
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,710
looking at 64 compounds I know that

466
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,019
there was a grower ecosystem that

467
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,880
started a circle around that chemist who

468
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:23,980
were the people who actually understood

469
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,140
what the inventory and the state was and

470
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,120
that it was game-changing in Oregon to

471
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,130
have just a single lab it was available

472
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:32,558
in offering the service and now we of

473
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,540
course have really many at scale mature

474
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,089
labs as sea levels people to you to

475
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:39,279
really prominent industry leaders I'm

476
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:41,558
wondering if you can talk about a bit of

477
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:44,220
like this trend where you started and it

478
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:46,440
was a steep hill over it was you know

479
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,509
as initial effort that was very

480
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,308
challenging so even when you deal with

481
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:52,169
like producers coming into a very low

482
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:54,178
margin scenario and expecting to get

483
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:56,220
basically unlimited services for nearly

484
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:58,080
nothing and you have capital intensive

485
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,400
equipment and high paid scientists in

486
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,490
this I mean this is unbelievable

487
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,850
complexity just a little bit about your

488
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:07,259
messy Birds well yeah early on actually

489
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:07,740
there early on it was absolutely boring

490
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:09,779
job

491
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,279
I mean we're analyzing for three

492
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:13,048
cannabinoids that we could get

493
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,099
referenced and it's four on the GC so we

494
00:21:13,048 --> 00:21:15,629
weren't even looking at acidic in

495
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:17,969
evidence we're looking at THC CBD and

496
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,500
CBN and all day long you kind of look at

497
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,788
the same time a de Graaff over and over

498
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,829
and over sometimes it can be a little

499
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:24,990
higher sometimes a little bit lower but

500
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:31,439
you know we're just analyzing see the

501
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:33,900
same report and and I remember the very

502
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,288
first CBD strain that came to do as I go

503
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,250
along

504
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:41,099
something different blueberry from from

505
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:42,690
it was the first first CBD strain that I

506
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,939
know that was being so kind of in

507
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,200
California is kind of a verified city

508
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,890
street not anyone who'd just want to

509
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,360
talk to a trader obviously but but on

510
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,409
the drug market it was the first one was

511
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,418
commercially available in a you should

512
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:57,809
changed everything and an anomaly

513
00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:00,509
shipping yep 14:15 cannabinoids that

514
00:21:57,808 --> 00:22:02,970
most of the labs are testing for dozens

515
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:04,710
of terpenes and so um you know it's it's

516
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,048
come a long way and it's become a much

517
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,000
more interesting job but still for so

518
00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:11,009
long we're seeing kind of a scene

519
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,538
commander grammars a lot and now this

520
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:13,710
has been really excited to watch the

521
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:15,119
work these guys have done because it

522
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,798
makes I've got more interesting it in

523
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,538
and we're actually all these types of

524
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,429
compounds were testing for not make

525
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:22,288
sense I mean again like I said really

526
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:25,009
you know up until the last few years

527
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:27,470
we've had you know high THC I

528
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:29,480
CBD maybe a little bit of CVG one or two

529
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,910
or percent between crack or something

530
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,319
like that and you know six or seven

531
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,150
turkey that's really expressed in

532
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,740
hitting and it's been just excited to

533
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,450
see kind of this company sometimes it's

534
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,359
by accident sometimes you see someone

535
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,069
does even know what they have and you

536
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,619
can only go so far in that in Indian and

537
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:47,119
so it's really been really really

538
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:52,339
changed you know even just in the last

539
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:57,589
few years so the so many messy births so

540
00:22:52,339 --> 00:23:01,220
I mean I think he when he started he

541
00:22:57,589 --> 00:23:02,929
would so well and so the messy birther

542
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,970
was just describing I think describes

543
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:07,370
exactly what I would say anyway but I

544
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,740
would like to add to that that the other

545
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:11,689
part of your statement where people come

546
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,720
in and expect all this free testing for

547
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,940
the margins I cannot tell you I have

548
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,750
heard me hey you should let us test for

549
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,590
free because will make your lab better

550
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,470
okay no problem

551
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:25,609
so let me Amy first and then if it's

552
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,549
different I'll give you your money back

553
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:31,549
because exactly what Josh said they all

554
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:34,129
kind of look the same right and it's

555
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:38,419
only more recently that the job really

556
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:40,370
has expanded you know and one of the

557
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,289
things that we are noticing from this

558
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:44,359
expansion is that we've really done a

559
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:46,549
lot of damage to this plan right so a

560
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:48,679
recent paper came out where there are

561
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:50,659
some compounds that you can only find in

562
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,810
CBD lineages because we've broken the

563
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,400
THC pathway so badly right so so one of

564
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:56,809
the things that has to come out of I

565
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,000
think all of this is our understanding

566
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:07,549
of what we left behind

567
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:08,690
I try to get it back so the the people

568
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:11,720
who are out on the forefront of the

569
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,250
analytical chemistry side what worse is

570
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,410
great because there's analytical

571
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,990
chemistry available to growers now but I

572
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:21,170
can tell you that one lab is not the

573
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:23,779
same as another if anybody has submitted

574
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:26,240
flour samples to a lab for testing you

575
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:29,690
know this we could take one flour submit

576
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,000
it to a lab and I say a CPG flour will

577
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:34,460
get a 20% result back we send it to lab

578
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,519
that we trust and we get a 16% back

579
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,200
that's four percent but four percent in

580
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,819
that situation is 25% of the total

581
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,819
cannabinoids it's a big deal it's a huge

582
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:47,029
margin dare you send it to another lab

583
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:49,460
and they tell you it's CBN right I mean

584
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:51,500
there's if this is an Oregon with

585
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:55,190
accredited Labs labs that are accredited

586
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,509
by national organization so they have to

587
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,680
go through potency standards they have

588
00:24:56,509 --> 00:24:59,420
they've been screened they've been

589
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,840
tested over and over but there's still a

590
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:05,509
huge disparity between good labs and not

591
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:07,639
so collapses way to preempt and the same

592
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:09,298
way this our internal have variability

593
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,090
conversation I think

594
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:13,618
because here we have the ability for the

595
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:15,798
first time in history to really

596
00:25:13,618 --> 00:25:17,908
understand the inventory of this class

597
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:20,099
simultaneously we have consumers who do

598
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:22,528
not trust the output of the analytical

599
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:24,538
testing facilities due to this inter lab

600
00:25:22,528 --> 00:25:26,878
barriers and realities as a producer I

601
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:29,249
can affirm that I can find such an

602
00:25:26,878 --> 00:25:30,839
unbelievably gross range testing between

603
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:33,058
different analytical testing services

604
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:34,378
that as the dispensary comes are one of

605
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:36,538
the things I had to do would simply

606
00:25:34,378 --> 00:25:38,939
require everybody to test her in one lab

607
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:40,679
because I wanted to have a patient

608
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,798
resource that actually started to

609
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:46,080
provision accurately curated cultivars

610
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:49,200
of kima Morrison in reality is I think

611
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:51,599
even in 2018 and now into 2019 we expect

612
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,788
to continue to continue to see inter lab

613
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,769
variability can you speak to any of the

614
00:25:53,788 --> 00:25:57,808
efforts that were put to ultimately

615
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:59,368
resolve some of this challenge to

616
00:25:57,808 --> 00:26:01,558
provide consumers and patients with

617
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:03,959
reliable information so in early a

618
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:05,668
variability starts at the grower I just

619
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,999
want to say that makes oh yes labs

620
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:10,288
actually have their own issues I'd be

621
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:12,058
lying if I said different we make

622
00:26:10,288 --> 00:26:15,089
mistakes machines go out of calibration

623
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:16,079
they break etc etc right but at the same

624
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:18,058
time we're dealing with a very

625
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,398
heterogeneous plant where you can have

626
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:23,220
from one bud to another on the same

627
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:25,918
planet 10% variance in THC right so the

628
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,409
question then becomes is how is the

629
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:32,038
sample coming into the lab first you

630
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:34,590
know how consistently are the samples

631
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:37,108
that are being bashed together to make

632
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:39,599
it a regulatory batch how consistent is

633
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:41,368
it in the grow and then what is the lab

634
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,529
then doing to make sure that they

635
00:26:41,368 --> 00:26:46,949
minimize that homogeneity

636
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:48,599
virginity by the proper lab technique in

637
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:52,259
the lab right so I would like to say

638
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:55,859
that labs like SC and us and you know if

639
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:58,440
you see a 10% difference between SC nos

640
00:26:55,859 --> 00:27:00,359
a 10% 10% of science is actually an

641
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,340
acceptable number it may not may not

642
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:03,629
make you happy as a client but it's an

643
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:05,009
acceptable number in science if your

644
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,060
plus or minus never said you're pretty

645
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:08,640
good you want to be plus or minus five

646
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:11,309
percent but realistically in a very

647
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,910
heterogeneous matrix that's a good

648
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:17,039
number but at the same time I will also

649
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,140
say that because of this stuff that's

650
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,839
going on and labs now have to be an ISO

651
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,400
certified and and as ISO certification

652
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,919
comes along you actually have to do a

653
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,980
lot more jumping through hoops it was

654
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,539
okay to get your CRM Azure certified

655
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,700
reference materials from one one

656
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:34,529
provider before well now that your ISO

657
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,730
credit if your ISO accredited you can't

658
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:37,829
do that you have to have multiple

659
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,720
sources for your CRN's so that you can

660
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:41,579
cross-check them before you even use

661
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,950
them in your analytical batch right so

662
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:46,949
so because of that what we're seeing is

663
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:49,140
we I was just in another like cross lab

664
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:52,380
comparison for an Rd sample thing for

665
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,420
somebody out of state and they test it

666
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,880
with three labs and all three labs came

667
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,039
in within one or two percent most of the

668
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,980
time right so a lot of the interlab

669
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,559
variability is going away and I want to

670
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,930
add to that that was with Turkey will

671
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,240
tell you getting terpenes right because

672
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,820
they're so volatile is really hard so we

673
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,910
had three labs in this cross comparison

674
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:16,649
that ball came in within like interprets

675
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,480
of no higher than the five or six

676
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,930
percent difference right so the labs

677
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:25,380
were getting better right but we all had

678
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,980
the same exact single batch oil when

679
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,650
your work

680
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:32,759
right so the oil that we started with

681
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:34,890
was very homogeneous so you have to add

682
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:38,609
those things together and understand the

683
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:40,380
whole process I think so I'll start with

684
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:42,750
California because I think I think the

685
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,549
two states and we have a lot of outside

686
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,960
Portland as well and I think the two

687
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:48,750
states have very different regulatory

688
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,590
regimes and I think they I think I think

689
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,140
different challenges so now that

690
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:54,720
California's regulated labs are forced

691
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,330
to do a lot more quality control have

692
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,190
run ELQ uses quality control samples

693
00:28:57,329 --> 00:29:00,990
with every batch that check that

694
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,029
calibration so your machine can't drift

695
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,470
out of calibration so you you know you

696
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:06,240
can catch it and carry over you can

697
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,289
catch all these issues that pop up and a

698
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,849
lot of labs aren't doing that before

699
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:10,289
there's a lot of reasons price pressure

700
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:12,269
you know when you're in a voluntary

701
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:14,279
market and you can only get you know 50

702
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:17,369
60 bucks for a test that should be 150

703
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:20,250
you know quality is going to suffer and

704
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:21,839
in people corners now in California you

705
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,058
have a lot of new labs in the market

706
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,439
because you know they saw billions of

707
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:28,349
dollars in the testing market which is

708
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,610
silly but if you jumped in and bought a

709
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,319
bunch of equipment and didn't

710
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:32,729
necessarily have the wherewithal or have

711
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:33,869
had the time to get up to speed since

712
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,669
we're all you know developing our own

713
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:37,619
methods and so you're gonna see a little

714
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:39,360
bit of that in California as well but at

715
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:40,469
least in California what we've seen as

716
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,579
the regulators are gonna come down on

717
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,169
you and shut you down if you're not

718
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:46,168
doing a good job and that's been proven

719
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:48,179
up so so that's that's the key thing is

720
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:49,350
he's good oversight from the people who

721
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:51,030
are regulating the laps if you're not

722
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:52,529
gonna have a good oversight on people

723
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:54,349
regulating the labs and why we do it any

724
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:56,339
of this now you know mandatory testing

725
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:58,918
because otherwise we do have what

726
00:29:56,339 --> 00:30:00,959
happens in Oregon where you have several

727
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,370
labs that are just openly you know kind

728
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,470
of I don't know how they're doing it but

729
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:07,079
getting getting their customers an extra

730
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:10,500
five six percentage points not relative

731
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:12,038
absolute on their THC test and you know

732
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,720
we have customers that come to us and

733
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:15,398
you even say well sure we'll do some

734
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,749
pesticide Testament you vote sorry we

735
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:18,758
can't do can happen our testing with you

736
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:20,409
it's a it's a comfortable competition

737
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,538
thing and we've had so much downward

738
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:23,859
pressure in Oregon and Oregon market

739
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:25,509
that they need those extra few points to

740
00:30:23,858 --> 00:30:27,220
sell the product and they know that

741
00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:28,509
everyone knows what's going on and the

742
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,690
state's not doing a damn thing about it

743
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:34,419
and so you know I would you know or let

744
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,940
you know it's not a good oversight

745
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:38,409
system and so it's long as to happen

746
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,590
what it does is it drives the labs that

747
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:43,028
are not cheating how to visit us and so

748
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,858
that's the thing that's gonna happen in

749
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:46,538
California if the regulator's ever kind

750
00:30:44,858 --> 00:30:48,668
of get lacks on the labs I mean it's

751
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:50,440
it's it's a pain in the ass and you know

752
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:52,570
just scared every time I get a call from

753
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,460
the BCC but really that's what's gonna

754
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:56,710
keep the labs that are doing it right in

755
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,090
business it's a strong oversight of the

756
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:00,098
testers - they put us in the kind of

757
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:02,108
hall monitor position someone has to

758
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:03,729
keep it a really good eye on the fact

759
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:04,928
that that we're doing what we need to do

760
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:06,369
because we serve a very critical

761
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:09,190
functioning than this you know there's

762
00:31:06,368 --> 00:31:11,888
there's a lot of um I guess incentive or

763
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:19,090
you know bad actors or lateness and both

764
00:31:11,888 --> 00:31:21,488
of them can be equally as damaging as an

765
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:23,439
example Josh just said that drives the

766
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:24,879
good actors out of business I just shot

767
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:31,690
my new mix of a lap down roads after

768
00:31:24,878 --> 00:31:34,719
that reason so yeah and I think part of

769
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:37,538
that you get remembers we as an industry

770
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,848
and as a consumer base are actually

771
00:31:37,538 --> 00:31:41,279
responsible for this - right like you

772
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:43,409
don't go into a

773
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,329
wine store liquor store and ask you know

774
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,769
what's the highest alcohol content beer

775
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:49,079
what's the highest alcohol alcohol

776
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:51,119
content list or wine right it's just

777
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:54,539
it's not the way because humans products

778
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:57,779
on and when we put such a pressure on

779
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:59,190
these on labs really because even want

780
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:01,379
to get these high dollars for high THC

781
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:04,620
content it's just nonsense it's that's

782
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,960
that's not a good metric of quality and

783
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:08,759
I think that we you know we really need

784
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,049
to do a better job of teaching consumers

785
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:12,480
that it's not you know that's not the

786
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:13,950
way to find a good product for your fear

787
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,720
ailment you don't go into a dispensary

788
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,630
and say hey it was the highest or people

789
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,430
do but they shouldn't right so so the

790
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,200
Greeks have this word called a shot dose

791
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,480
which is like the final thing that

792
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,059
really it's also the beginning of a new

793
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,890
thing but rather than metaphoric for

794
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,419
this you throw the stone into the pond

795
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,370
and the ripples are happening at the

796
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,140
tiny is actually the ripples that have

797
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:36,719
already occurred after the event and

798
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,450
then the central events there's this

799
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,339
notion of chemical analytical testing

800
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:43,049
came in the cannabis it funnily

801
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:44,970
disrupted the long term consumer

802
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:46,319
relationship that fomented in the

803
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:49,019
underground and the Prohibition era

804
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,460
especially and my sense is that what

805
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:52,319
we're living through is actually a lot

806
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,480
of ripples we've already now have the

807
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,189
ability to actually get out of sort of

808
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,860
inter loud variability and have really

809
00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:01,259
reliable testing data but that means now

810
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:02,729
we have to update everything else and I

811
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:04,019
think a lot of the frustration and I've

812
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,058
heard some of it expressed here and I

813
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:07,009
certainly feel

814
00:33:05,058 --> 00:33:09,648
of it is that we have a consumer trend

815
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:12,019
pursuing high THC over any other quality

816
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:13,518
we have growers who are just talking to

817
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:15,798
brilliant like some of the best horrors

818
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,808
we have having been so much worse our

819
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:19,908
they're testing really high or testing

820
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:22,128
out labs that are unscrupulous we have

821
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:24,649
indica and sativa frameworks which are

822
00:33:22,128 --> 00:33:26,748
certain cultural and attributes that we

823
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:28,248
can't actually define by science good we

824
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:29,870
just have so much catching up to do and

825
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:31,669
I guess I'm just wondering if there's

826
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:33,829
any sort of like here we've got and the

827
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:36,019
little reading at scale we have a future

828
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:37,849
to look forward to of moderately dosed

829
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:39,679
products are incredibly chemo diverse

830
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,839
and very sophisticated and evil it means

831
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,840
these people's needs but we really have

832
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:47,480
anyway is education and sort of popular

833
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:49,308
education platform issue with how do we

834
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,579
get the consumers and the patients and

835
00:33:49,308 --> 00:33:53,960
the market to actually serve acknowledge

836
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:56,269
this event which is a curve which is

837
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:03,649
that we must reframe how we view

838
00:33:56,269 --> 00:34:04,999
cannabis I do a small start I'd say that

839
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,319
those ripple it's a great metaphor the

840
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:09,710
ripples are definitely out there but

841
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:11,179
most of them are not from THC I think

842
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,260
most of the ripples in the pond around

843
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,030
us right now are non-psychoactive

844
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:17,179
cannabinoid so that's your grandmother

845
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:21,230
who is responsible for a lot of the

846
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:24,010
shift in public perception THC is an

847
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:26,059
itchy drug I love it

848
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:29,359
but only about 20% of the population

849
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:32,179
consumes it and even then only a small

850
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:35,659
portion is about 20% of that 20% drives

851
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:37,010
the actual consumption patterns those

852
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:38,510
are the people that you need to target

853
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,280
in terms of Education and making sure

854
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,399
that they're on board with new knowledge

855
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,929
about turfing diversity or flavor

856
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:47,299
profiles and the different effects

857
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:48,980
effect that those will have on you but

858
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,859
it's those other markets with different

859
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,588
compounds that is the other 80% of the

860
00:34:51,858 --> 00:34:54,268
population

861
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:56,548
animals and that sort of stuff I think

862
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:58,169
we're the popular consciousness actually

863
00:34:56,548 --> 00:35:01,318
gets ahold of this planet where you can

864
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:04,139
see that it's not just for recreational

865
00:35:01,318 --> 00:35:05,568
use or for certain aspects of pain that

866
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:07,558
come along with psychoactive

867
00:35:05,568 --> 00:35:09,268
implications there's there's a whole lot

868
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:10,229
more out there including the replacement

869
00:35:09,268 --> 00:35:13,199
pods

870
00:35:10,228 --> 00:35:15,899
we don't need hops anymore pops I love

871
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,098
them they're their cousin right but they

872
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,930
take a huge amount of agricultural

873
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:21,568
infrastructure that take five years to

874
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:22,259
get to maturity and every five years 20%

875
00:35:21,568 --> 00:35:24,268
of the hoplites

876
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:26,849
Oregon and Washington get ripped out

877
00:35:24,268 --> 00:35:28,618
because of disease with cannabis you can

878
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:30,298
have a single you can have a crop that

879
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:32,759
grows once every year it gets replaced

880
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:36,389
by seed and produces exactly the same

881
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:38,338
compounds and hops do so this is popular

882
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:40,440
consciousness is already changing and I

883
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:42,239
think it's being carried out by a lot of

884
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:53,789
different people it's not just Arbor in

885
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:55,259
a place like this it's society they've

886
00:35:53,789 --> 00:35:57,390
got this variety will have a tram that

887
00:35:55,259 --> 00:35:59,880
you know like I said one I guess was a

888
00:35:57,389 --> 00:36:01,078
CBD last year but if you haven't tried

889
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,150
it and you're interested in these plants

890
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,528
with different compounds I suggest you

891
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:07,318
let me get yourself a pretty rose and

892
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:10,139
stuff and trying it out it's a CBD CBD B

893
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:13,108
plant with like one milligram of THC per

894
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:15,298
gram it's AK extremely low THC content

895
00:36:13,108 --> 00:36:16,588
but when you smoke this and you know

896
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,849
about five ten minutes later I don't

897
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:19,619
know if I would describe it as nicotine

898
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:21,838
caffeine but you definitely feel it

899
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:23,880
effect right and when you can you smoke

900
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,380
this stuff and you realize and I'm high

901
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,989
and then you think in the context of

902
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,059
weight there was no THC in that plant

903
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:31,920
right and I think it kind of

904
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:33,569
recalibrates our expectations because

905
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,369
really it's about experience it's not

906
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:36,820
about it's pretty user experience it's

907
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:39,190
not about again this

908
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:44,950
like TFC number so check it out if you

909
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:46,750
haven't tried those things okay well

910
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:48,849
yeah I've got a few things I think I

911
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,219
mean one of the big reasons I think THC

912
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:54,099
is kind of such a has become what it is

913
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:55,899
as far as is is kind of selection of

914
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:58,719
purchasing decisions is it's the cost of

915
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,550
cannabis and we cost $50 for innately

916
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,079
cannabis and get a couple joints out of

917
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,780
it I mean I would want the biggest bang

918
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,940
for my buck - it's expensive you know

919
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,730
and so as we see kind of canvas kind of

920
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:12,070
come down to kind of earth in any price

921
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,300
maybe maybe people just kind of start to

922
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:15,400
drift away from that and start looking

923
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,440
back at I want canvas that tastes good I

924
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,389
want get on a quality cannabis and so I

925
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,829
mean if you if you if you really have

926
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:22,869
the need to measure something the lab

927
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:25,000
should be TV ETV cheating on a total

928
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:25,989
turkey contract because I would say that

929
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,670
that's here here

930
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:31,569
quantitative quality indicator much more

931
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:34,809
so than THC of these in it so I just

932
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:36,460
think I think naturally over time this

933
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:38,739
is chemistry becomes more available it's

934
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,300
more reasonably priced and consumers

935
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:41,979
will start looking looking to other

936
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,670
things just your honor how can I get

937
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:47,380
offered you know a couple hits and so on

938
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,849
hopefully it'll sort itself out a little

939
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,490
bit to an Indian I agree the other

940
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:54,940
cannabinoids in our part of the future

941
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:59,919
in a much wider wider market than than

942
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:02,050
just use you so the the idea that THC

943
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:07,090
drives everything the reality is that

944
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:09,130
you know if we were to use the proper

945
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:10,570
terminology we get high well the CBD

946
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,390
gets you higher than a different

947
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:15,309
I mean so the term is psycho

948
00:38:13,389 --> 00:38:19,920
psychotropic versus you know psycho

949
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:23,980
active but it's still psycho right so so

950
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,530
okay they came out wrong however but

951
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,420
still meaning that no matter how you

952
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:30,850
look at it you're still having an effect

953
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:34,030
on the brain right so so one of the

954
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:37,599
effects gets you high but I would like

955
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:40,750
everybody to who has not yet about CBD

956
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,400
by itself to go smoke CBD and tell me if

957
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,440
you don't feel more relaxed afterwards

958
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,780
right and if you were feeling more

959
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,510
relaxed I'm sorry but you got high you

960
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,040
know I mean so you know so that's one

961
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:55,440
aspect as well and I think the other

962
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:58,869
aspect is you know if we if we start to

963
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,090
think back to old school be like

964
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:02,650
Acapulco gold man I read right so those

965
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,820
things only make it four six eight

966
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,740
percent but they made a tremendous

967
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:07,900
amount of terpenes if you look at the

968
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:10,000
end raises in general right you see a

969
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,860
much broader turfing content where you

970
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,289
have a much higher expression on more

971
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,970
turbulence well back in the day we got

972
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:17,619
really high off of that stuff because of

973
00:39:15,969 --> 00:39:19,929
the terminal entourage in fact right

974
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:23,079
what we see now is that as you go and

975
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:24,909
drive up the THC content the turkey

976
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:26,380
profile gets narrower and the number of

977
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:30,190
things that express at a high level go

978
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:33,690
down so the chase for TAC may not be

979
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,690
getting us where we really want though

980
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,280
about five minutes I want to make sure

981
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:45,160
you get access to these geniuses does

982
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,140
anybody have questions and by the way if

983
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:49,089
you have not heard Shango says interview

984
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:50,650
with Seth proffer and talking about some

985
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,809
of the analytical reading methodology

986
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,579
hit on the shaping fire podcast Berg

987
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:57,009
some of the best content I've heard in

988
00:39:54,579 --> 00:40:05,889
the last couple of lectures highly

989
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:08,590
recommend checking so so similarly the

990
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:10,839
brain trust on the stage has got me so

991
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:14,470
jacked and excited this is it I wish I

992
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:16,289
could enjoy this all the time so my

993
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:17,829
questions for you as all

994
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:20,529
technology-assisted

995
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:22,599
breeder of folk who I respect you know

996
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,970
there is this continuum we've got we've

997
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:26,529
got you know males and females to make

998
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:31,299
new progeny we've been doing that for

999
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:34,330
ages now we've got analytical abilities

1000
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,640
to you know really look at what we're

1001
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:39,549
doing and helps speed up processes right

1002
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,960
and then we've got the part that you

1003
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,760
know people are talking about things

1004
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,869
like invasive breeding right when you're

1005
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,490
starting to like get involved with

1006
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:51,819
crisper and you know editing the genome

1007
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:54,879
right so as people who I everybody here

1008
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:59,010
I respect where did you personally put

1009
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:02,590
that fresh old on where long the line is

1010
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:05,020
reasonable and worthwhile to press to

1011
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:08,079
reach these goals that we have before

1012
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:09,880
you're all like okay that's where I'm

1013
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,509
gonna draw my line for whatever reason

1014
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:16,599
you don't have much but I would say

1015
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:19,600
there's so much left to do before we hit

1016
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:21,369
that line that you know let's let's

1017
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,659
exhaust those options first and then we

1018
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:24,900
can start talking about CRISPR and

1019
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:28,269
things like that but I think I mean

1020
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,980
things that's doing market in Brian I

1021
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:31,719
mean there's there's they're doing

1022
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,510
amazing things and they're not you know

1023
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:36,279
not that I mean anything so you know I

1024
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:40,960
think I think it is this guy can do a

1025
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:43,019
lot once we start pushing it so for

1026
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,449
thousands of years we didn't have

1027
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:47,340
or anything right so and we did a good

1028
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:49,409
job in all our plans so you know

1029
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,780
traditional traditional genetic breeding

1030
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:54,659
is a very powerful tool the most

1031
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:56,820
powerful tool set in that tool is the

1032
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:58,230
breeder himself you have to be able to

1033
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,910
observe you have to be able to take

1034
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,219
notes you have to be able to record and

1035
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:04,349
follow over trends if you can do that

1036
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:06,839
you you you've got the game beat pretty

1037
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:09,269
much right so yes you can do better if

1038
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,980
you have analytical tools and ultimately

1039
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:12,750
the the ultimate expression of that is

1040
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,639
to take those analytical tools find out

1041
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,170
what the chemical compounds are because

1042
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,259
that they are your metrics by what you

1043
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:21,599
measure and then dive into the genome so

1044
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:24,060
that now you can you can do it faster

1045
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,339
and and increase generational cycles

1046
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:27,929
right so if you can look at the sea this

1047
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,730
is it's cracked you have your seedlings

1048
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:31,169
and you can do a genetic test and you

1049
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,550
find you have all the alleles you want

1050
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,230
then you're off to the races you get rid

1051
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,030
of the rest you force over those guys

1052
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:38,070
into your next round right so you can

1053
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:41,040
really do generational cycling as many

1054
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:43,380
as 4 to 68 a year if you have the right

1055
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,639
tools right so so that's ultimately

1056
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,460
where we need to go

1057
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,409
but CRISPR is one of those things where

1058
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,780
when you maxed out everything you could

1059
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:54,179
possibly do you do anything right so we

1060
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,190
are nowhere near you nowhere near that

1061
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:57,719
right not to mention the fact that what

1062
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,190
we're finding out is that CRISPR make

1063
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:04,349
some other mistakes other places that we

1064
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:07,800
don't know about so CRISPR for cannabis

1065
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:09,539
is like someone who can't quiet the

1066
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,690
attention long enough to get through a

1067
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:15,529
sentence honest honest honest to god

1068
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:18,539
it's at this point I feel the same way

1069
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:19,710
as these two gentlemen there's so much

1070
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:21,960
that hasn't been discovered at this

1071
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:23,519
point why why go down a path that could

1072
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,039
potentially introduce all kinds of

1073
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,139
problems for at least with our trading

1074
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,739
program there's so many everytime we

1075
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:31,809
submit samples we get something

1076
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:33,459
back that says you know there's this

1077
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,480
there's a spike under chromatogram and

1078
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,789
we don't know what it is

1079
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:44,699
I don't either so you know here goes

1080
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:44,699
another two or three years yeah

1081
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:51,369
there is when you look at the history of

1082
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,380
planned reading the traditional plant

1083
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:55,900
breeding with other crops it's gone

1084
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,490
through phases and the the first major

1085
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:00,670
phase in the Green Revolution was the

1086
00:43:57,489 --> 00:44:02,500
advent of creation the bath ones which

1087
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:04,450
require light breeding of two separate

1088
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,860
lines and then recombination once you

1089
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:07,779
fix the specific traits that you want

1090
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,430
followed by with field trials to

1091
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,820
establish which of the spread lines are

1092
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:11,618
the best

1093
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,840
that's an awesome it's an awesome

1094
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:15,910
program the next stage after that was

1095
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:20,050
mutagenesis and so this is involving

1096
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:21,399
either plenty increases or decreases so

1097
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:24,070
we're talking in cannabis now about

1098
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,750
creating haploid lines which basically

1099
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:28,090
have half the chromosomes of the plant

1100
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:30,429
but those chromosomes when you double it

1101
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:33,480
again lead to true breeding stock with

1102
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:35,949
one generation it's a it's a huge

1103
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,289
generational beeping tool for cannabis

1104
00:44:35,949 --> 00:44:39,759
breeders it doesn't require this is

1105
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:42,550
something that happens naturally in

1106
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,440
nature I wouldn't say it on a regular

1107
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,269
basis but it does happen all we're doing

1108
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,720
is inducing that quicker in the lab

1109
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:52,150
CRISPR is different Chris Berry is is a

1110
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:55,239
very different animal and I think we're

1111
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,619
not there yet in my opinion yeah I think

1112
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:58,750
kind of a different approach I mean I'm

1113
00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:01,150
not opposed to CRISPR CRISPR is just a

1114
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:02,650
tool to to edit the genome right and

1115
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:04,869
there's all these other tools like talen

1116
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:06,130
or you know zinc finger nucleases it's

1117
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,680
not these things that we can use to do

1118
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:11,470
that the canvas is a special plant and

1119
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:13,358
that it breeds very similar to the way

1120
00:45:11,469 --> 00:45:15,399
that humans breed I mean if you think

1121
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:16,900
about the tomato for example it's made

1122
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,389
its you know grown in the greenhouse and

1123
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:22,030
the becomes long and pollinates itself

1124
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:24,608
pollinates and it produces a seed in the

1125
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:25,960
tomato where that if that tomato didn't

1126
00:45:24,608 --> 00:45:27,549
come from a high perceived it came from

1127
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,380
an heirloom tomato see you

1128
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:31,180
take that sienna the tomato and plant it

1129
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,769
and grow it into a new plant and the

1130
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:34,989
fruit on that plant would be identical

1131
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:36,309
to the planet that it came from and so

1132
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:37,929
on and so forth for twenty generations

1133
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:40,029
well we all know that when we grow

1134
00:45:37,929 --> 00:45:41,949
cannabis and you cross two plants

1135
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,300
together that the plants that come out

1136
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:44,739
at the end they don't look like that

1137
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,600
that's because we're what we call

1138
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:48,969
obligated prosper so you need to have

1139
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:51,549
another individual of the same species

1140
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:54,519
to procreate and that brings in a

1141
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:56,560
separate genome into the mix which

1142
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:57,759
creates this huge level of diversity so

1143
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:59,710
what's seconds talking about in

1144
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,570
mutagenesis it's like you said when you

1145
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:02,650
have your goal the second thing that you

1146
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:05,650
want to look for in a breeding program

1147
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:07,480
is finding the variability upon which

1148
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,430
you should select a cannabis is a really

1149
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,769
remarkable clap being an Emma krauser

1150
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:13,750
because it has all this inherent

1151
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:15,840
variability so we can go through the

1152
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:19,210
genome and look for special things and

1153
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:21,789
and you know every trait essentially

1154
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:23,349
exists on the continuum we have low can

1155
00:46:21,789 --> 00:46:24,789
have like proofs and plants but if I can

1156
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:27,130
a plant producing class today with tall

1157
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:28,509
plants and shorter plants high yielding

1158
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:29,769
plants and low yielding plants and

1159
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,870
essentially any trait that you can

1160
00:46:29,769 --> 00:46:35,230
characterize has this variability right

1161
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:36,609
so I'm the CRISPR now though CRISPR

1162
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:37,659
allows us to do these special things I

1163
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:41,140
mean a couple of days ago they just

1164
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:43,509
published a method in in a rice variety

1165
00:46:41,139 --> 00:46:45,609
for producing a polemic to see so now

1166
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:48,940
anyone knows what makes this is but it's

1167
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:51,070
essentially an ability of a plant to

1168
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:54,369
produce a seed without sexual

1169
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:57,670
combinations sexual recombination so you

1170
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:59,889
might imagine that if we had a a

1171
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:01,750
convicted cannabis line it would produce

1172
00:46:59,889 --> 00:47:03,909
seeds without pollination from an

1173
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:05,860
external plant and all of the seeds

1174
00:47:03,909 --> 00:47:08,710
would be identical with a parent plant

1175
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:09,849
that's really valuable for for mass

1176
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,759
planting on field

1177
00:47:09,849 --> 00:47:14,380
so there there definitely is a use for

1178
00:47:12,759 --> 00:47:21,248
these technologies I think that we will

1179
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:24,640
see them shortly so lots of its talked

1180
00:47:21,248 --> 00:47:27,429
about how he made specific strains with

1181
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:30,068
a single cannabinoid more for the

1182
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:31,778
pharmacological aspect how relevant is

1183
00:47:30,068 --> 00:47:33,909
that reading program these days with

1184
00:47:31,778 --> 00:47:36,429
fractional distillation as a viable

1185
00:47:33,909 --> 00:47:38,978
option as a plant actually have to be a

1186
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:42,989
single cannabinoid for the FDA music

1187
00:47:38,978 --> 00:47:45,278
when we use distillation techniques -

1188
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:46,958
you can't as long as they're present in

1189
00:47:45,278 --> 00:47:48,969
the plant and a lot of these compounds

1190
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:50,558
are not present in certain plant lines

1191
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:52,380
and you can't make him express enough to

1192
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,329
get economically viable

1193
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:57,729
total total oil content it's it's a it's

1194
00:47:55,329 --> 00:47:59,589
an excellent point part of this as well

1195
00:47:57,728 --> 00:48:02,468
is making your plants more economically

1196
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:04,298
efficient if you have a pure CPG line it

1197
00:48:02,469 --> 00:48:06,579
gives you the opportunity to to magnify

1198
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:09,068
that total compound based on how much

1199
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:10,509
people need but you're completely right

1200
00:48:09,068 --> 00:48:13,478
I think the chemistry and the

1201
00:48:10,509 --> 00:48:14,858
technological side of our industry is

1202
00:48:13,478 --> 00:48:16,208
starting to catch up with with that

1203
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:19,380
stuff I think the combination of those

1204
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:21,368
two things plant breeding and technology

1205
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:26,588
continues to make us more efficient in

1206
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:28,358
yeast I want to point out to you know

1207
00:48:26,588 --> 00:48:30,518
again we can do all those things through

1208
00:48:28,358 --> 00:48:32,259
chemistry and you know specific

1209
00:48:30,518 --> 00:48:34,478
extraction this was accede to it or

1210
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:36,159
whatever but it's it's always more

1211
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:38,528
efficient if you have a plant that

1212
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,608
already almost approve approaches your

1213
00:48:38,528 --> 00:48:42,969
goal so if you have a plant that

1214
00:48:39,608 --> 00:48:43,969
produces 99% CBG a for example of the

1215
00:48:42,969 --> 00:48:46,639
cannabinoid fracture

1216
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:49,399
and the other 1% THC or CBD there's less

1217
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:51,829
work to go to do by chemists Raymond

1218
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,030
saves labeling saves costs so in terms

1219
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:56,000
of delivering your product to market

1220
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:58,519
efficiently and a cost-efficient basis

1221
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,440
it's better to have a plant that does

1222
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:02,179
most of the work in that rather than

1223
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,289
have to go in through technology and

1224
00:49:02,179 --> 00:49:04,608
change it after the fact

1225
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:08,239
do you happen to know the timeframe

1226
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:09,858
there yeah well Dave she good friend of

1227
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:11,539
mine so you know I know all about that

1228
00:49:09,858 --> 00:49:12,949
pretty program it was done through they

1229
00:49:11,539 --> 00:49:15,619
were I was actually the really the first

1230
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:17,319
program first sitter's of breeding

1231
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:20,660
programs that was conducted through

1232
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:22,820
selfing technology and ideas guide which

1233
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:24,170
is free things and it really only took a

1234
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:26,570
couple of months it once you identify

1235
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:28,130
your targets you'd be surprised with god

1236
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:33,410
you're just meetings but you can do it a

1237
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:35,690
couple of generations so i would like to

1238
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:38,629
caution the the whole distillation that

1239
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:41,030
is process only because from the

1240
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:45,500
analytical lab site what we see is

1241
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:47,570
people are when you combine regulatory

1242
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:50,059
testing with distillation you end up

1243
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:52,670
with a situation where a lot of what you

1244
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:55,279
expect to see delta-9 is gone right so

1245
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:57,440
it turns into Delta and Delta ten or

1246
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,740
whatever else and suddenly now you're

1247
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,539
not dealing with the same compound so

1248
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:05,829
distillation does not necessarily also

1249
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:05,829
get you what you want

1250
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:14,690
thankfully we're on the panel and not

1251
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:17,420
the synthetic cannabinoids panel and

1252
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:20,250
ultimately there really is a scaling of

1253
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,840
producing cannabinoids it was wild

1254
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:23,400
as here and meet the teams from India

1255
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,620
and who can produce and he's very

1256
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,240
efficiently and cost-effectively and to

1257
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:29,130
see the Cronus partnership with ginkgo

1258
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:30,959
by our works and to start to watch them

1259
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,190
the Bowman you know these big swirling

1260
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,449
energies around since that it

1261
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:35,400
commemorates and I promise

1262
00:50:33,449 --> 00:50:37,199
there are really you know it's very easy

1263
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,630
to produce that scale very pristine

1264
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,429
individual compounds and the reality is

1265
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:44,039
I think all of us Sharon and this

1266
00:50:41,429 --> 00:50:45,419
movement really is sharing a passion for

1267
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:47,820
the plans a passion for the way the

1268
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:49,889
plants through using technology and all

1269
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:52,200
the tools that they're available to us

1270
00:50:49,889 --> 00:50:54,359
to ultimately facilitate your the best

1271
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:55,889
possible use and relationship of it and

1272
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,260
I just really want to appreciate and

1273
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:59,609
celebrate that there's so many new tools

1274
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,230
that have arrived there are so many

1275
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:03,120
brilliant people in this conversation

1276
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:04,949
and now there's a lot of clinical

1277
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,019
research and other things that need to

1278
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:09,449
substantiate what these new plants and

1279
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:11,250
narrations and compounds can produce and

1280
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:12,869
quality of life and I believe we're

1281
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,219
really going to change the world I have

1282
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:16,199
a faith in this every morning when I

1283
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:19,579
wake up and it's mainly because they get

1284
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:19,579
to hear all of you

1285
00:51:33,518 --> 00:51:35,578
you
