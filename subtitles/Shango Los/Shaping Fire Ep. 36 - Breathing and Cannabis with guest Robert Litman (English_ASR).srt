2
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:09,839
breathing is at the heart of what it

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,069
means to be a living human we don't

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,048
usually think about it much because

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,548
breathing is an autonomic function and

6
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:15,269
happens without us even really thinking

7
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,579
about it at all

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,109
similarly when we inhale cannabis we

9
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:20,909
spend a lot more time choosing our

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,710
favorite strain and smoking or vaping

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,500
device than we do thinking about the

12
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,118
role our lungs play in this process

13
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,890
because cannabis is a bronchial dilator

14
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,140
many who use cannabis think that means

15
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,789
that cannabis cannot injure or impact

16
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,130
our lungs and that's simply not true

17
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:36,988
it's wishful thinking for us to think

18
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,120
that whatever we inhale will be fine so

19
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:40,229
long as it's cannabis the reality is far

20
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,539
more complex than that

21
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,669
inhaling cannabis can help lungs in many

22
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,259
ways for sure but there's also methods

23
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,719
that negatively impact the lungs as well

24
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,488
not only that if you are talking on a

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,780
budget there are definitely ways to

26
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:55,468
smoke that are more effective at getting

27
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,270
you high with less flour or oil common

28
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,710
myths about cannabis and the lungs are

29
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,600
easily spread while hanging out with

30
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,308
friends smoking bowls or even easier

31
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,170
over the internet but that does not make

32
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,819
them true there are proven and

33
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,469

welcome to the show Robert well thank

100
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,669
you good morning to you so before we get

101
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:25,590
into the mechanics of breathing I want

102
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:27,329
to set the tone correctly for this show

103
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,400
because you know it's important for

104
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,469
folks to get that you are very

105
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,879
integrative and holistic in your

106
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:34,469
practice and you know I've already

107
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,568
described your practice in the

108
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:38,400
introduction but would you set the

109
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:41,399
context for us by explaining how

110
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,250
cannabis inhalation can increase our

111
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,609
awareness of breathing and the body as a

112
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,739
whole

113
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:50,069
towards the general betterment of

114
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,259
everybody who talks cannabis yeah one of

115
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:54,030
the things that I played with and

116
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:56,908
discovered for myself as well as for my

117
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,280
clients is that cannabis increases body

118
00:03:56,908 --> 00:04:01,798
awareness when I say body awareness is

119
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,348
our ability to be able to sense what is

120
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,969
going on inside of our bodies sort of

121
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:08,729
like an animal does you know it is

122
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:10,500
operating from their senses and when we

123
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,750
operate from our senses we're more in

124
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,780
touch with how breathing is actually

125
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,449
moving inside of our organism and by

126
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,930
able then being able to sense that and

127
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:24,658
feel into how our lungs open how our

128
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:27,840
body spreads out when we breathe in and

129
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:30,029
how it comes back into its normal shape

130
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,909
when we breed out we'd be able to then

131
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:35,369
have better access to using our breath

132
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:38,040
to soothe our nervous system and to let

133
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:42,030
the cannabis in its Bronco dilating

134
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,740
effects open up our Airways and so I

135
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:46,649
like that particular piece of the

136
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,829
awareness that gets included in smoking

137
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:52,500
cannabis or taking it in other forms and

138
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:54,870
so that when we learn that about

139
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,779
ourselves even when we are not using

140
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,660
cannabis we're able to implement what

141
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:03,209
we've learned just throughout the day to

142
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,979
help soothe our nervous system and any

143
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:09,209
kind of breathing disorders that we may

144
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:10,259
have that cannabis can support so I know

145
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:13,279
we're going to be talking a lot about

146
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,279
the relationship between

147
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:19,649
cannabis breathing and anxiety today can

148
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,110
you break out just a little bit how

149
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:25,469
breathing is interacts with the nervous

150
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:28,199
system and so the mechanism by way it

151
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,150
even has the ability to soothe us well

152
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,460
when we relax when we're you know if

153
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:35,250
cannabis can have any effect of relaxing

154
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:37,168
you you tend to breathe from a deeper

155
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,660
place with inside of your body it's more

156
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:41,699
down in the lower belly your diaphragm

157
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,160
and it's more active in breathing which

158
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,839
sets the tone for the nervous system to

159
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,460
recognize that we're not on fight or

160
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,739
flight that it's a time for the body to

161
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,649
be in a more parasympathetic moment of

162
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,840
relaxation when we're anxious we tend to

163
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:57,388
breathe up high in our chest which is a

164
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,009
much smaller space and so that's sending

165
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,168
a message to our nervous system that

166
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:03,538
we're in something is threatening us and

167
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:04,799
so that we're in fight or flight and

168
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:07,259
when we're in fight-or-flight we're

169
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,020
bringing way too fast and usually in the

170
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,689
case of people who are anxious and not

171
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,219
moving quickly fight-or-flight there's a

172
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,569
mismatch and so there's a lot of

173
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,330
adrenaline running through the system

174
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:20,129
but we're not moving so the body gets

175
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:21,839
anxious thinks what's happening where's

176
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,250
the threat and what am I supposed to do

177
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,199
about it right in this particular moment

178
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,120
so the mind gets really active in that

179
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,560
regard if we were really in

180
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,500
fight-or-flight and running for a life

181
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,379
there would be no mind involved so if

182
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,870
cannabis has this ability to if it can

183
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:38,550
for you soften and their surface soften

184
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,098
the nervous system soften your breathing

185
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,699
relax the body so that you're breathing

186
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:44,610
more

187
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,649
your diaphragm and more with ease and at

188
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,110
a slower pace that's the biggest issue

189
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:50,909
too is breathing at a slower pace when

190
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,730
we're really anxious or for having an

191
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:56,189
asthma attack will tend to breathe 20 to

192
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:59,759
30 times per minute normal breathing

193
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:02,850
rate is about 12 to 14 times maybe even

194
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,519
8 to 12 breathing breaths per minute and

195
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,650
when we're really in Paris of authority

196
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,930
sympathetic mode and really relaxed

197
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:11,969
we're breathing around six breaths per

198
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,530
minute and so that's the dets the

199
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,260
learning that we're looking for is to

200
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:18,500
how to establish both the pace and the

201
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,480
rhythm of breathing and also the volume

202
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,529
we're breathing less per minute than we

203
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,030
are that in freedom we're in

204
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:25,559
fight-or-flight and that's a big issue

205
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:27,179
right there which we can talk about in a

206
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,209
few more minutes why that's so important

207
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,250
that's really interesting and you know

208
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:34,229
even though I I didn't just toke the

209
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,899
fact that you and I are talking about

210
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:39,390
breathing is increasing the awareness of

211
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:41,669
my breath which which now I'm doing it

212
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,289
with more awareness and I notice it's

213
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,509
slowing down and you know I'm excited

214
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,939
because we're doing the recording but

215
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:50,579
I've just calmed myself down just by

216
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:53,579
listening to you talk about healthy

217
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:55,859
breathing so so you know awareness is

218
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:58,199
everything so so let's talk about now

219
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:03,360
the actual mechanics right we all take

220
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:05,099
breathing for for granted but but there

221
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,740
are right ways and wrong ways to do it

222
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,290
and and and our body actually has to do

223
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,030
several things for us to successfully

224
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:15,180
breathe thank goodness that it's on

225
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:17,009
autopilot so so so we can unpack this

226
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,959
later on when we're talking about some

227
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:25,560
of the challenges would you explain the

228
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:27,659
mechanics of inhalation inhalation thank

229
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,860
you that's a really clear question well

230
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,660
when we breathe in the inhalation the

231
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,810
diaphragm is descending that's that

232
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:38,969
that's the major breathing muscle that

233
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:42,000
is right down at the lower ribs and when

234
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:45,029
the diaphragm moves properly and lowers

235
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,710
down towards your pelvis it's increasing

236
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,259
the size of your lungs it's stretching

237
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:52,139
the bottom of the lungs that's the first

238
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:53,759
stage the second stage is the ribs on

239
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:55,319
the side if you had your hands on the

240
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,269
side of your ribs they

241
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,030
we'll start to elevate and that begins

242
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:02,850
to take the lungs you know with its

243
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:04,889
opening up the lungs to be wider in a

244
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,720
really full and big breath when you need

245
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:08,519
a lot more air then the front of the

246
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,460
chest will move which will increase the

247
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,500
dimension of the lung front to back so

248
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,350
the function of that is to change the

249
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,629
internal pressure of the lungs so when

250
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,610
the lungs are fully closed and we're at

251
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:24,269
the end of the exhale the pressure

252
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:27,240
inside the lung is less than the

253
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:29,759
pressure outside in the atmosphere which

254
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,620
is surprising but it's true and so when

255
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,720
the lungs begin to open up at the pull

256
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,750
of the diaphragm and the ribs the

257
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,910
pressure outside to the body is greater

258
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,549
than the pressure inside this little

259
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:44,490
space is expanding and so what happens

260
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:46,319
automatically is air is drawn into the

261
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,090
lungs it's almost like you say we don't

262
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,790
even have to think about it but because

263
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,350
of the pressure changes in physics it

264
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:54,929
wants to move from a higher pressure

265
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,480
gradient to a lower pressure gradient so

266
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:59,519
lung the air is coming into the lungs to

267
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,009
equalize the pressure both outside and

268
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,480
inside and so our lungs fill

269
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,860
automatically which is what happened

270
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,720
when we're sleeping we're not thinking

271
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,190
about it which is one of the amazing

272
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,110
things about breathing that it's both

273
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,480
under our control and it happens

274
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:16,050
automatically that's probably a really

275
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,350
healthy failsafe for our human that as

276
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:23,669
as we exhale there's like an automatic

277
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:25,649
bounce back to inhaling again that that

278
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:28,829
makes evolutionary sense to me

279
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:31,100
yeah well there is like people who faint

280
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:34,379
you know a lot of people have

281
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,659
experiences like getting up to speak say

282
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:38,490
or being on a radio show where they get

283
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:40,740
anxious and start to breathe too fast

284
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,620
and they begin to hyperventilate and

285
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,299
they get dizzy and they pass out well

286
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,090
that's the failsafe right there you

287
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:50,549
can't kill yourself by breathing too

288
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:52,379
much you'll end up fainting and the

289
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,819
mechanism of fainting of course is that

290
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:56,159
when you're fainted your body will go

291
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,840
back to breeding at a rate that has

292
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:02,189
actually commensurate for what the body

293
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,139
needs and so you're back coming back to

294
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,410
normal that way right on that makes

295
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,220
sense yeah so as somebody with lifelong

296
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:09,659
asthma

297
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,930
I've always thought that inhaling

298
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:15,539
cannabis would be bad for the lungs

299
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:19,139
because of the resin collecting on the

300
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:22,079
lungs cilia inside and gooping those up

301
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:24,840
and also I always expected the throat

302
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:28,530
and the lung to be irritated from the

303
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,899
heat but you know I got laughed at I had

304
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:33,600
a lot of social media threads about that

305
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,699
belief and so I I read more and more

306
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,159
about it and it does seem that I'm wrong

307
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,759
and the more studies that I read about

308
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,230
you know tobacco inhalation marijuana

309
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,509
inhalation you know whether it's dabbing

310
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:48,810
or joints they all seem to suggest that

311
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:51,980
overall inhaling cannabis is good for

312
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:56,549
the lungs how can that be so why isn't

313
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:58,889
inhaling cannabis smoke coating our

314
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:02,849
lungs with additional resin and making

315
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:05,669
things worse well one of the things you

316
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,740
have to speak about first is is how much

317
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:09,599
even is smoke at one time how much

318
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,899
you're taking in what kind of volume and

319
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,950
what kind of heat it's at so in terms of

320
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:18,899
asthma there are strains and that are

321
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:20,790
bronchodilators is many this actually

322
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,189
I'm in my own reading too there are six

323
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:24,870
ways that cannabis actually helps helps

324
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,420
the lungs but if you have to be careful

325
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,000
about how much you smoke and how much

326
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,319
how much heat is in the smoke because

327
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,240
when you know there's too much heat in

328
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,700
the smoke your coughing which is

329
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,409
actually a reaction to kind of push out

330
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,629
what got in there that doesn't need to

331
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:42,089
be in there so we're looking at other

332
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:43,820
effects of it in terms of microdose in

333
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,980
cannabis we're looking at

334
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:49,140
anti-inflammatories antibacterial

335
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,120
bronchial dilation and anti somatic and

336
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:56,279
it's an allergy sick it helps with the

337
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,990
pain so if the the Bronco dilating

338
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,419
effect is the most important because

339
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,740
with asthma that's what happens when

340
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:04,409
you're starting to have an asthma attack

341
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,839
the smooth muscle in the Airways is

342
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,819
contracting in a way that doesn't allow

343
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,370
the air to be released so cannabis

344
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,560
offers that effect where it's the smooth

345
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,529
muscle and it relaxes it to let the

346
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,449
airflow begin again so I think in terms

347
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:20,789
of what you're talking about in terms of

348
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,840
the resins it just really depends on how

349
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:23,370
much you smoke there's

350
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,200
to the readings and most of the studies

351
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,080
have been done with cannabis or about

352
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,060
small doses yeah that makes sense

353
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,250
so so that's interesting that that

354
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,769
really there's a threshold point where

355
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:38,700
the the regularity of smoking cannabis

356
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:40,769
switches over from being necessarily

357
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,200
healthy for the lungs to actually being

358
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:44,819
potentially detrimental and and of

359
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,680
course you know I'm sure that everybody

360
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,320
like me is wondering how do we know

361
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,849
where that point is and I'm assuming

362
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,350
that it's different for every person but

363
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,139
do we really only know where our

364
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:58,290
threshold is when we reach it and we

365
00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:01,110
start experiencing negative side effects

366
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:03,299
from too much smoke inhalation yeah

367
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,930
that's my experience my experience is

368
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:09,629
the fact that the smoke and the resin so

369
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:12,419
let's talk about mucus so the lungs have

370
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:14,100
this ability to make mucus and so you

371
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:15,809
could you know you start to expect your

372
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,310
rate you start to notice that you have a

373
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:19,709
little bit more mucus and it you're

374
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:22,019
coughing up so why is that mucus being

375
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:25,170
produced in the first place it's being

376
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:27,360
produced to protect the lungs something

377
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:29,939
is irritating the lungs beyond what they

378
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,730
normally need and the body's making more

379
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,620
mucus to cover it up and to help it move

380
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,840
out because the mucus is meant to either

381
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,580
be swallowed or coughed up so my

382
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,320
experience is when I start to feel like

383
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,259
I've got more mucus in my body I know

384
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,129
that I'm smoking too much and that I'm

385
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:48,750
putting too many irritants into my lungs

386
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:52,110
that actually makes a lot of sense to

387
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:54,419
because you know people in cannabis you

388
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,149
know often will joke about you know the

389
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:59,729
the mucus or feeling chunky after you

390
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:01,799
know after a big session and and and I

391
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:05,250
myself you know when I go to full

392
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:08,009
weekend you know cannabis events that

393
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:10,230
are more party than convention like like

394
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:11,759
emerald cup down in Sonoma County at the

395
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,970
end of Emerald cup by the time I'm

396
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:17,580
driving home you know I feel like I feel

397
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,350
like there's been a warzone in my lungs

398
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,920
or something you know they feel they

399
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:25,710
feel sore and tired and and and in and

400
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:28,289
that is from you know successive joints

401
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:30,780
with friends and colleagues at the event

402
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:32,939
because you know certainly my usage goes

403
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:35,579
up at something like that so that makes

404
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,170
sense um you know you know you

405
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,759
excuse me for happening but you said

406
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:42,000
something really important there it's

407
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:46,230
like the sore and then overused you know

408
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,970
there's a that we're so see what's the

409
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,590
word I want to use here you know so

410
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,450
unaware is the best word I can come up

411
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,190
with at the moment about how our lungs

412
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,900
are really taking care of us I mean they

413
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:57,090
are the most essential thing we do yes

414
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,250
we could talk about our heart being very

415
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,840
essential but the way the heart runs of

416
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,360
course is that it has to receive the

417
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,310
oxygen that the lungs bring in so it's a

418
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,710
rule of three go three minutes without

419
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:09,449
breath three days without water three

420
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,310
weeks without food it is the most

421
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,320
essential process that our body goes

422
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:15,149
through and we take it for granted most

423
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,910
of the time so that when our lungs are

424
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:19,350
feeling sore and feeling tired it's a

425
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:21,449
time that we can say to ourselves you

426
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,860
know you know your lungs you our lungs

427
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:25,170
they've been taking care of us for a

428
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,779
really long time here how about I slowed

429
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:29,849
down relax let my body breathe in a

430
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:33,569
quiet way let me take care of my lungs

431
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:35,129
for a while right on so before we go to

432
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,290
the break and in our second set we're

433
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:38,700
gonna talk a lot about vaporizers and

434
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:41,480
the difference between that and smoke

435
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,490
but I want to hit one more moment on

436
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,320
different warning signs or at least like

437
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,649
little yellow flags that people can look

438
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,440
for you mentioned mucus which I'm sure

439
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:55,860
is maybe even the most prevalent one but

440
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,500
but when somebody is you know new to

441
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,379
cannabis and they don't have the

442
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,619
experience of years and years of it like

443
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:06,509
like many folks do you know what what

444
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:12,000
things can they look for to let them

445
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:14,940
know that they may be reaching their

446
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,829
outside threshold of inhalation and so

447
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,110
maybe need to start considering you know

448
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:21,990
tinctures and other other less inhale a

449
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:24,799
inhaled cannabis well it's interesting

450
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:27,209
about what the other thing that drives

451
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,789
the other thing that drugs breathing is

452
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:32,430
the ratio between carbon dioxide and

453
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:34,950
oxygen in that system and most of the

454
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,840
time we think about the top oxygen is

455
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,690
the nutrient and carbon dioxide is the

456
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:41,759
waste gas and actually the truth of that

457
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,820
is that carbon dioxide regulates the

458
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,529
distribution of oxygen in our bodies so

459
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:47,659
when I talked about hyperventilating the

460
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:49,879
reason we

461
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,650
is because the carbon dioxide levels get

462
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,500
so low before blowing it out all the

463
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:57,769
time that the oxygen distributions in

464
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,119
the brain slows down and we faint so

465
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:01,490
it's the same thing with smoking too

466
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,979
much cannabis your if you especially if

467
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,900
your exhaling be exhales you're

468
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,029
disrupting the blood gases in your body

469
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,620
so you can start to get headaches you

470
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:11,509
can start to get tingling in your hands

471
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:13,399
and feet you can start to feel your

472
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:15,440
blood pressure rise your heart rate

473
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,009
increase and those are signs that

474
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,019
perhaps you're exhaling too much and so

475
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:22,849
and it may be exhaling a lot through

476
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:25,099
your mouth so you could think about

477
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:26,929
exhaling through your nose but those

478
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:29,329
would be some of the signs that your

479
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:31,940
you're overdoing dehydration would be

480
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:34,129
another one so those are some of the

481
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,720
sons because you're disrupting the blood

482
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:39,410
gases wow that's that's really

483
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:42,200
interesting so so based on that would it

484
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:46,279
be a safe to say rule of thumb that

485
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:49,580
taking more smaller hits is going to be

486
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:53,539
better for our lungs than taking monster

487
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:55,669
bravado hits yes and you know it's also

488
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:57,589
changed we used to think we had to hold

489
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:00,140
the air they smoke in our lungs and

490
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:01,909
that's that's been proven inaccurate now

491
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,380
we don't need to do that holding up her

492
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,570
breath which does cause the breathing

493
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,610
rate to get disturbed now we can breathe

494
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:09,589
in small small amounts let it come in

495
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:11,419
and then put it right out as well as

496
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:12,859
taking it into your mouth first and then

497
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,390
let me get cool there and then going

498
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:16,519
into the lungs rather than taking it

499
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,990
right into the lung so yes smaller hits

500
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:20,629
are much more preferable than really big

501
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,460
hits I'm glad you brought up that that

502
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,710
myth because you know there's a lot of

503
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,990
people I mean even even I I believed

504
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,420
that for you know 20-some years that

505
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,220
that you take the hit and I want to hold

506
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,710
it as long as I can because I'm thinking

507
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,779
that it's it's soaking into my lungs and

508
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,000
I want all the cannabinoids to soak into

509
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:39,980
my lungs and then and then if I could I

510
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,109
just want to you know exhale clear

511
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,660
because I've got it all now you know and

512
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:47,059
and and I know that that's wrong but I

513
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:50,390
don't know why that's wrong what what is

514
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:52,009
wrong with that understanding of how the

515
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,470
cannabinoids are taken in in the lungs

516
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:56,089
that I don't have to hold my breath yeah

517
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,640
so the one thing is the fact of what

518
00:19:56,089 --> 00:20:00,859
happens to the breathing rate and the

519
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,170
the rhythm of the breath gets disrupted

520
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:04,759
by holding your breath in that that

521
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:06,680
pattern can carry over into real life

522
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:08,839
but it's also keeping the smoke in the

523
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,430
lungs too long that's where the that's

524
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:13,129
where the damage can be done by the

525
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,779
smoke is having it be circulating inside

526
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,210
the lungs for too long a length of time

527
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:21,289
it just needs to come in absorb what it

528
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:23,809
needs to absorb and and release it I see

529
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:28,299
so the the fallacy in the thinking is

530
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:32,509
that an infinite amount of cannabinoids

531
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:35,059
can be absorbed through the lungs and

532
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:38,779
any particular breath when the reality

533
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:42,710
is is that if you just take a you know a

534
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:46,129
small to medium sized hit breathe it in

535
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:48,019
the the capacity for the lungs to intake

536
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,030
cannabinoids is going to be hit its

537
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:52,549
limits and then you exhale and that's

538
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:55,099
great but if you take a bigger hit and

539
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:57,619
you hold it for longer you're actually

540
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:59,869
causing damage without actually any

541
00:20:57,619 --> 00:21:02,419
increase to benefit because your lungs

542
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:04,009
can fill themselves up with all the you

543
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:08,330
know cannabinoids that a can take in

544
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:10,549
just with a simple small hit yes yes a

545
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:12,619
couple of things one is that a red blood

546
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:14,389
cells line up singularly as they travel

547
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:16,250
through the lungs and it takes

548
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,020
three-quarters of a second for a red

549
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,490
blood cell to pick up the oxygen and

550
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:20,900
whatever else it's gonna pick up from

551
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,059
alone so it's on its way in

552
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,980
three-quarters of a second the other

553
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:27,500
piece of so you can imagine that the

554
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,329
parades going it's the blood stream is

555
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,880
very available to pick up what's ever in

556
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:33,619
there the other piece of that is that if

557
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,570
you start holding your holding your

558
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:37,459
breath with little air in there you're

559
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:39,169
over stretching like a rubber band

560
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,029
that's getting used too much in its

561
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,220
stretched position and so eventually

562
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:45,170
it's a possibility if you're smoking and

563
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,850
holding it for a long period of time you

564
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,220
could be done doing damage to the

565
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:51,619
elasticity of the lungs wow that's

566
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,299
really interesting all right cool so

567
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:56,449
after the break we're gonna start

568
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:57,799
talking about vaporizers so we're gonna

569
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,720
take that short break and be right back

570

628
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:20,089
fire I get emails from folks asking me

629
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,290
what vaporizers I recommend now

630
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:22,789
certainly there's a wide range of

631
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:23,990
interesting vapes on the market but

632
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:25,579
since this episode is all about

633
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,059
breathing today I'm going to take a

634
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:27,500
moment

635
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:29,240
tell you about the two vapes and one

636
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,119
filter that I use pretty much every day

637
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,339
the most luxurious vaporizer I have is

638
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:36,619
the vape exhale it's considered a

639
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:38,899
desktop vaporizer but it's also easy to

640
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:40,429
travel with in a padded case it plugs

641
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,920
into the wall and because of that it

642
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,480
gets up to temperature very fast not

643
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,340
only is that great for just not waiting

644
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,880
around but it packs enough power to give

645
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:52,549
a really solid satisfactory dab hit the

646
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,100
vape exhale can use either flower or DAB

647
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:56,659
oil for flower you grind up the material

648
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:59,089
and drop it in a basket and you place

649
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,640
that basket in the base for dab oil you

650
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:03,740
place your dab in a borosilicate or

651
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,230
quartz tube and then you drop that into

652
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,450
the base because it's a wall plugged

653
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,279
home appliance you'll get hits of flower

654
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,759
and dab unlike any of you've ever had

655
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:13,609
before

656
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:16,339
especially from a vaporizer in fact I

657
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:18,649
sold my email after my first month

658
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:21,230
having a vape exhale I just knew I was

659
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,790
never gonna use it again so I let the

660
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,289
folks at vape exhaled know ahead of time

661
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:25,849
that I was gonna mention their device on

662
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,889

666
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:37,040

00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,880
like this so make sure to use it

668
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:42,470
the website is vape exhale the EON the

669
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,820
front of exhale is drop so it's just

670
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:49,309
vape exhale calm and you know even in a

671
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:50,779
padded travel case though sometimes the

672
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:52,819
vape exhale is bigger than I want

673
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:54,170
sometimes when I'm like hiking or going

674
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:56,720
to a show or whatever I need something

675
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:59,240
for my pocket for that I use my air vape

676
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,200
X this is the latest model from air vape

677
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,240
usa.com

678
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,670
you know I had their last version too

679
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,099
and I liked it but the new X version is

680
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:08,810
really just fabulous it's more refined

681
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:11,359
than the last version and clearly is

682
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:13,369
more user friendly the air vape also

683
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,349
gets up to temp very fast for vaping on

684
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:17,029
the go and I like it that you can set

685
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:19,219
the temperature that you want it to hit

686
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:20,779
and also that it vibrates when it's

687
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,610
ready to vape in case like I get

688
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,139
distracted by chatting or something you

689
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:25,939
know it's all I hey you know ready to

690
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,640
smoke that's especially great because

691
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,769
you can vape both flour and oil in these

692
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,230
you just slide the little concentrates

693
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:35,629
cup for oil and slide that in and you're

694
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,789
good to go I also dig the travel case

695
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,080
that comes with it it's super sleek and

696
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:40,639
discreet and more

697
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:42,678
importantly it protects my air vape ex

698
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,169
from getting beaten up or damaged in my

699
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:46,820
pocket or luggage this is the same

700
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:48,919
vaporizer you heard about in the

701
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:50,569
introduction to the show today air vape

702
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:52,730
has given us a few of these to give away

703
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:54,379

704

706

your chance to win one of these vapes

707
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,548
this month you'll also hear more about

708
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,620
air vape a bit later on the show because

709
00:27:01,548 --> 00:27:05,089
they bought a commercial spot today now

710
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:06,589
I know you could be thinking that I'm

711
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:08,449
recommending the air of eight because

712
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:10,788
they sponsor the show but let me say

713
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:13,159
this I have five different travel

714
00:27:10,788 --> 00:27:15,259
vaporizers at home but the other four

715
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:17,330
all stay at home when I go to

716
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:19,129
conventions or to the beach it's the air

717
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:19,609
vape that I grab to take it's as simple

718
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,799
as that

719
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:24,918
the last product I want to mention is

720
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:27,200
the filter 420 comm filter for pre-rolls

721
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,090
because of my asthma I really got to be

722
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,130
careful with pre-rolls ever since

723
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:33,470
finding the filter 420 I've been able to

724
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:35,450
enjoy pre-rolls a whole lot more when

725
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:37,308
you attach the recycled plastic filter

726
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,769
on the end of the joint it filters out

727
00:27:37,308 --> 00:27:42,319
the tar and gives a much nicer tastier

728
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:43,669
smoking experience it is astonishing and

729
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,048
actually kind of gross to see all the

730
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:46,970
tar that builds up in one of these

731
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:48,769
filters and I'm glad it isn't going into

732
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,669
my lungs and it certainly doesn't impede

733
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:53,149
my high at all

734
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:54,620
that's filter 420 comm again not a paid

735
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:56,388
ad so there you are

736
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:59,359
for today's episode on breathing I

737
00:27:56,388 --> 00:28:02,509
recommend the vape exhale desktop vape

738
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,819

739

filter 420 pre-roll filter check them

740
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:08,028
out your lungs will be happy you did

741
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:10,250
welcome back you are listening to

742
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:11,898
shaping fire I'm your host Shango lohse

743
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,819
and our guest this week is breathing

744
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:16,129
specialist Robert Lippmann of the

745
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:18,129
breathable body so before the break we

746
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:23,090
were talking a lot about combustion

747
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:26,240
basics you know how to breathe in smoke

748
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:28,459
what's going on and and why we enjoy it

749
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,220
so much with cannabis and before we talk

750
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,048
vaporizers I want to talk about what it

751
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,319
was essentially the old-school vaporizer

752
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:38,388
right if we were using a bong and we

753
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:41,480
didn't want it to hurt as much we added

754
00:28:38,388 --> 00:28:44,778
ice man and for me that's that's a good

755
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,389
part of college so so were we kidding

756
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:50,900
ourselves that that adding ice to the

757
00:28:47,388 --> 00:28:54,109
bong what made it easier on our lungs

758
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,720
or did it just make it feel easier

759
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:58,549
because it makes the that makes the

760
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,039
experience of the smoke a little less

761
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:03,829
harsh well is there a difference between

762
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,899
feeling and and the truth of that

763
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:07,970
experience it is all based on feeling

764
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,530
and it does cool the smoke I mean how

765
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:12,860
many times have you burned your throat

766
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:14,450
and it's and when you're burning your

767
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:16,909
throat it's the same Airways that are

768
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,440
inside the lungs and so anything that

769
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,000
helps cool it down so that there's not

770
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,549
that burn that has to be rehabilitated

771
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,460
by the throat and the lungs it's going

772
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:27,769
to be advantageous right on so so all of

773
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,329
you who put ice in your bongs thumbs up

774
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:31,789
and for those of you who live near the

775
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:35,029
snow your snow bongs are still good to

776
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:37,490
go as well right so think of the thing

777
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:41,299
about it for using it for for asthma and

778
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:44,179
learning how to use your breath properly

779
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:48,649
with the smoke it's you know you got to

780
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:50,390
stay somewhat conscious this is true so

781
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:53,000
is so while we're still talking about

782
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:54,740
asthma you know um you know people who

783
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,509
listen to this show regularly know that

784
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,460
I'm a big fan of vaporizers I mean I

785
00:29:56,509 --> 00:30:01,069
love smoking you know joints and bongs

786
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,808
as well when but but for daily use I'm

787
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:05,359
really much more about the vaporizer

788
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:07,490
because because it makes my whole life a

789
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:10,549
little bit better and the vaporizers

790
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:12,170
that are out now are infinitely better

791
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:14,839
than the ones that we had just a few

792
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:16,670
years ago but you know since you are

793
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:18,740
looking at this as more of a you know a

794
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:21,370
science and dr. lead direction how much

795
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,480
truth is there actually to the idea that

796
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:26,058
vaporizers are healthier for people

797
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,549
generally but especially for people with

798
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:30,950
breathing issues like asthmatics and CP

799
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:32,899
of COPD and things like that well you

800
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:35,860
certainly don't get any of the tars and

801
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:38,750
any of any of the burn from the paper

802
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:41,479
and it is a it is definitely a cooler

803
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:44,179
smoke you're not even going up over you

804
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,769
know 170 180 degrees well when you're

805
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:48,019
combusting through a pipe or through

806
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:49,369
paper you can be up to a thousand degree

807
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:52,190
temperature so there's quite a bit of

808
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:54,079
difference right there alone as well as

809
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,370
like I said with especially with papers

810
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,549
you're getting a little league

811
00:30:55,369 --> 00:31:00,079
particulate sore in the papers

812
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:02,240
vaporizers you don't get any of that you

813
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,889
don't get any ash you're just getting

814
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,259
the vapor and the vapor is carrying at

815
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,710
your

816
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:10,289
carrying the THC certainly

817
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:12,809
experientially it's much nicer to the

818
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:17,609
point that when when I turn people on to

819
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:21,000
my my luxurious vape Xcel water pipe

820
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:23,490
vaporizer at first they're not even

821
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,130
certain if they got a hit because

822
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:28,799
because they're expecting the the

823
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:31,680
irritation and the and the choking and

824
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,210
all of that and and and and and and what

825
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,250
they normally just say is oh that tastes

826
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,750
good which is of course a great response

827
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,539
but then by the time they've had their

828
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:41,910
second or third hit and they they've

829
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:44,730
gotten used to the idea that they exhale

830
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:47,670
and it's more of a of a light tasty

831
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:51,120
vapor than it is smoke you know people

832
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:55,140
start to get into it at that point

833
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:58,169
so what's going on differently in the

834
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:01,800
body is it just simply that the body is

835
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:03,990
not clenching because I'm not smoking in

836
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,829
all those extra tars and particulates

837
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,049
that you mentioned

838
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:08,519
yes it's very true I like the way you

839
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:11,399
say that because the lungs are very

840
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,990
responsive to atmosphere and so if

841
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,890
there's things in the atmosphere like

842
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:18,930
Tarzan - they are going to contract to

843
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:21,660
make sure that they do not absorb those

844
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:24,870
things and so with vaporize invisibie

845
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:29,220
it's not going on alert the body's not

846
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:31,049
going on alerts around um so the other

847
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,700
go ahead yeah the other piece that I was

848
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,889
going to say about it is that you know

849
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,900
when you're vaporizing and you you don't

850
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,130
think there's much smoke coming out you

851
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,920
kind of have to wait to see what the

852
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,570
effects are yeah that's actually a good

853
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:47,340
point you know historically I would

854
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:49,559
judge how you know how high I was going

855
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:51,119
to get based on my exhale like so you

856
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:52,529
know somebody has a big exhale and it's

857
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,109
a big cloud of smoke and everybody in

858
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:57,769
the smoking circle goes oh you know

859
00:32:55,109 --> 00:33:00,569
because that person's in for a fun ride

860
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:02,940
but with with a vaporizer

861
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:06,629
I really have to judge it in how much I

862
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:09,090
pack into the vaporizer because there's

863
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,920
there's not that visual cue anymore and

864
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:12,869
and certainly when I was learning how it

865
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:16,230
first using how to use a vaporizer I

866
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:18,569
would you know hat you know both over

867
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,950
and under pack until I learned

868
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:22,528
you know how to use this new tool that

869
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,298
makes sense mm-hmm and remember too that

870
00:33:22,528 --> 00:33:25,589
we're talking about this from additional

871
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:27,750
use from you know started this

872
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:29,879
conversation around asthma and about

873
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:32,220
body awareness so slowing it down

874
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,690
cooling the tempers down gives a chance

875
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,089
for the consciousness and the awareness

876
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,370
to actually pay attention to the process

877
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:40,619
without the happy to be so reactive so

878
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:42,959
there's an engagement you breathe in

879
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:44,908
breathe out you're kind of sitting with

880
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,769
what how's this how's this acting in my

881
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:49,289
body and what kind of medicinal effects

882
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:51,750
is it having right now especially if I'm

883
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:53,429
using it at a time that my lungs are

884
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,579
contracting and having a bit of an

885
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:59,490
asthmatic attack I want to feel that

886
00:33:55,579 --> 00:34:02,038
instantaneous dilation that's possible

887
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:04,679
and for folks who don't have asthma or

888
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:07,019
COPD I would think that this would be a

889
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,329
winning strategy for them as well simply

890
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:11,699
because you know for a lot of people if

891
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:15,510
you take you know a monster hit and it

892
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:18,239
has a lot of particulate smoke in it and

893
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:20,010
you start coughing you know perhaps your

894
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,168
adrenals kick off a little bit maybe you

895
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:24,300
get a little anxious maybe you do get

896
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:28,199
that soreness of a lung going forward so

897
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:30,300
even if you're just toking for fun using

898
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,908
a vaporizer may be to your benefit just

899
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,519
because it's an easier experience yeah

900
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:37,588
and one of the things that's speaking to

901
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:40,139
about chalking excuse me

902
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:41,639
choking and coughing again when we go

903
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,539
back to what we said earlier in the day

904
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,030
about breathing from the diaphragm

905
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:47,250
everyday from the chest coughing and

906
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,409
choking are all energies that come up

907
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,599
word and it doesn't take the body long

908
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:53,128
to get pattered into a different

909
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,899
breathing mat and so if you call from

910
00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:56,730
choke for a little bit you'll probably

911
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:58,980
notice right away the next couple of

912
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,449
breaths you're up in your chest so then

913
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,010
you have to be conscious about bringing

914
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:03,960
your breathing back down to the lower

915
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:07,170
part of the body so if you're brave

916
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,420
vaporizing easily and taking small hits

917
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:11,369
on it you can kind of stay with that

918
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:14,039
experiences you've been begin to deepen

919
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:15,900
into your breathing so so this next

920
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:17,639
question I I don't know if you're gonna

921
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,619
have an answer for this Robert it's it's

922
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:20,940
definitely non-sequitur and I haven't

923
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:23,010
seen any Studies on it but I'm gonna ask

924
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,250
you anyway because you've already

925
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:28,319
surprised me a couple times um so you

926
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:31,760
know when some people when they first

927
00:35:28,318 --> 00:35:34,219
start vaporizing they say that the

928
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,910
is different than when they're smoking

929
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:40,279
joints and and you know after doing a

930
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:42,009
lot of both and having a lot it using a

931
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,410
lot of different kinds of vaporizers I

932
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:49,579
have to agree with that to a certain

933
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:54,558
extent certainly I can get just as high

934
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:57,440
from a vaporizer as I can from a joint

935
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,809
but somehow the the tenor of it is

936
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,220
different it's it's a little it's a

937
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:05,349
little cleaner it's a little less

938
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:08,929
violent but but I don't really know why

939
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:12,769
it's that there's a difference I suspect

940
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:15,048
it's because there are attributes to the

941
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:18,380
experience of the high that people feel

942
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:21,679
after smoking a joint that that they

943
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,640
don't feel after a vaporizer so I don't

944
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,899
know if that was a very well worded

945
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,449
question but if you understand where I'm

946
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,190
going what are your thoughts well I do I

947
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:30,949
do understand you going that's my

948
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:33,318
experience as well but I'm really about

949
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:36,078
engagement and participation with an

950
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:39,139
experience and I find that I can be more

951
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,670
I do notice that I'd you know it is a

952
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:42,679
different kind of hi I would said I

953
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:45,200
don't feel as high but I'm not sure

954
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:48,318
that's exactly accurate but I do feel

955
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:51,199
like I'm not engaged my body is not

956
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:53,690
engaged with having to filter out the

957
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,789
negative attributes of smoking so I can

958
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:58,010
stay more connected to the experience

959
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:59,630
that's my best answer for that and

960
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:02,260
that's the part that I like I like it

961
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:04,519
being engaged with the process that I'm

962
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:06,829
participating in and I like being

963
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:08,960
engaged with my awareness that I stay

964
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:11,269
present in my body and in my experience

965
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,389
I don't like getting so far out that I

966
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:15,889
have to manage too many different

967
00:37:13,389 --> 00:37:18,558
experiences at one time being kind

968
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:20,298
clearing my throat all those different

969
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,190
pieces I think the body what we're not

970
00:37:20,298 --> 00:37:24,108
aware of is that the body is on alert in

971
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:26,599
some way that takes us out of me and we

972
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:28,670
need enjoyment of the experience I like

973
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:32,930
that answer good I'm glad I asked

974
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:34,490
thank you so um you know a lot of these

975
00:37:32,929 --> 00:37:37,279
folks who are listening a lot of folks

976
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:40,338
that listen to the show work with COPD

977
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,920
patients like I do and a lot of folks

978
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:45,269
talk about COPD patients but I have a

979
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,639
feeling that people don't really get

980
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:49,829
what's up with that condition as much as

981
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:55,109
they do with asthma so will you just

982
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:58,259
describe what COPD is and just so for

983
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:59,730
everyone's understanding well it stands

984
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,470
first of all first of all the initials

985
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,829
stand for chronic obstructive pulmonary

986
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:07,439
disease so something's happening in the

987
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:09,150
Airways so obstruction so over time from

988
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,820
asthmatics that's what usually develops

989
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:15,930
from it's a crime it's an order of the

990
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:20,400
allergies asthma COPD emphysema where

991
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:23,099
the Airways are so occluded or tightened

992
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,410
and twisted that it's hard to get the

993
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:27,029
air move air in and out as well as

994
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:30,210
what's beginning to happen is that the

995
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:32,490
little air sacs in the lungs there's 300

996
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:36,570
million of those little air sacs that

997
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:37,859
get move air back and forth I just like

998
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:40,019
this little statistic if you cut them

999
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,789
open and later side by side it's like at

1000
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:43,949
the surface the area of a tennis court

1001
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:47,849
to move air back and forth so those

1002
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:50,699
little alveoli start to distend and they

1003
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:53,309
lose their elasticity and the blood

1004
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:55,589
vessels that are picking up oxygen

1005
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:57,539
around those alveoli start to separate a

1006
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:59,730
little bit so the movement of air and

1007
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:02,429
oxygen is that is hindered we can't get

1008
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:06,929
as much oxygen we're not as saturated as

1009
00:39:02,429 --> 00:39:09,449
much so the where we go with this with

1010
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:11,489
COPD it is really important that

1011
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:13,529
breathing rhythms and breathing volumes

1012
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:15,599
and the balancing of the blood gases

1013
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:17,760
that are available all right they're

1014
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,099
optimal so even if we're getting less

1015
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,410
oxygen than normal we are able to move

1016
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:24,389
it to ourselves that's the issue it's

1017
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:26,368
not just that what we can take in what's

1018
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:28,559
in our blood but how does it get from

1019
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:30,840
our blood into our cells where does the

1020
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:34,730
most good making the energy that runs

1021
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:37,200
our body so COPD is a very debilitating

1022
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:39,090
energy-wise we bodies don't have enough

1023
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,789
energy to operate fully unless they get

1024
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:44,190
something mental oxygen or learn how to

1025
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:47,550
breathe really in the most effective way

1026
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:49,559
to minimize the reduction of not moving

1027
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:51,960
that's too many negatives of not moving

1028
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:56,340
the oxygen from the blood to the cells

1029
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,559
but maximizing that potential so I run

1030
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,099
into patients all the time asking me

1031
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,190
about

1032
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:04,739
cannabis as a bronchial dilator and they

1033
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:06,329
want to vape it but when I originally

1034
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:07,679
started hearing this from people I

1035
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:10,170
thought that was crazy right because

1036
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:13,440
with COPD why would you want to inhale

1037
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:15,690
anything and then I went ahead and I

1038
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,700
started looking at the studies and and

1039
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:21,108
and and there's there seem to be a mix

1040
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:24,929
some - some suggest that you want to

1041
00:40:21,108 --> 00:40:28,739
inhale cannabis vapor so that you are

1042
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:31,228
directly applying it to the lungs for

1043
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:33,960
the bronchial dilation and general

1044
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:36,659
relaxation effects but then but then

1045
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,630
some talk about the potential use of

1046
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:43,199
oral tinctures - which would be more

1047
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:46,440
systemic and and and not targeted

1048
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,659
towards the lungs so so what are your

1049
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,389
thoughts about the the benefits of

1050
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:54,210
taking a cannabis tincture and their

1051
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:57,960
ability to bronchial dilator the lungs

1052
00:40:54,210 --> 00:41:00,599
without actually inhaling the vapor for

1053
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,568
this is for more severe COPD folks who

1054
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:06,450
are looking for relief yeah I'm a big

1055
00:41:03,568 --> 00:41:08,009
fan of the tinctures I can say a couple

1056
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:10,379
two things that I'm thinking about right

1057
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:12,630
now it depends what's going on COPD wise

1058
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,278
whether there's something some kind of

1059
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,989
obstruction that's going on in the lungs

1060
00:41:14,278 --> 00:41:18,179
themselves or whether it's in the

1061
00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:19,318
Airways going towards the lungs so we

1062
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:21,629
have to kind of take a look at what's

1063
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:25,170
going on at this more if the damage is

1064
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:27,059
more systemic in the lungs and I like

1065
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:29,460
teachers and so a lot of the studies

1066
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:31,798
that have been done are tinctures are a

1067
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,318
good way to go that is the oldest form

1068
00:41:31,798 --> 00:41:36,150
of taking cannabis even in Egypt in

1069
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:38,219
ancient times they used tinctures in

1070
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:40,858
India and China when you're thinking

1071
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:45,420
about bronchial dilating for asthma for

1072
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:48,869
COPD it would be more effective to do

1073
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:52,019
that when you are having a moment when

1074
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:54,028
you really are bronchial constricted the

1075
00:41:52,018 --> 00:41:55,768
VAP we'll get to it much sooner if

1076
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:58,889
you're just trying to keep the Airways

1077
00:41:55,768 --> 00:42:01,169
open and relaxed then pinches will do

1078
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:02,969
the job but if you want if you're having

1079
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:05,039
an attack and really can't catch your

1080
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:07,259
breath and there's a you're not able to

1081
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,150
move any air the teachers are too slow

1082
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:12,028
so you need to bathe in that particular

1083
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,690
time I get it so so taking a tincture is

1084
00:42:12,028 --> 00:42:15,719
more of a

1085
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:18,900
and and and vaping is more like crisis

1086
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:21,509
management exactly that makes a lot of

1087
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,619
sense so so before we go to our second

1088
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:26,400
commercial I want to create this

1089
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:28,710
opportunity because when I met with you

1090
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,619
you went through this wonderful little

1091
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:33,599
breathing exercise and I think that

1092
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:35,760
everybody would would appreciate having

1093
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,650
this experience so so we're talking

1094
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,530
about asthma we're talking about COPD

1095
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:41,970
we're talking about taking too big of

1096
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:45,510
hits and we're talking about crisis

1097
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:48,379
management and and all of these can be

1098
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:52,500
answered by creating a soothing

1099
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:55,318
breathing pattern and and and this

1100
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,599
example is is you teach this on your on

1101
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:59,880
your youtube channel as well so if if

1102
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,318
people hear this you know once in your

1103
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,630
car with the podcast and you want to

1104
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:05,788
hear a longer version of it you can you

1105
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:07,890
can get that on the breathable body

1106
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:10,380
website and on this YouTube page but but

1107
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:12,598
would you this is this is a short thing

1108
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,519
it's only about 90 seconds but but

1109
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:17,700
Robert would you go ahead and do the

1110
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:19,170
soothing breathing pattern exercise for

1111
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:20,548
folks and then and then after

1112
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,710
everybody's all chill we'll go to

1113
00:43:20,548 --> 00:43:24,298
commercial okay have a little time for a

1114
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,720
little backstory on this yeah yeah go

1115
00:43:24,298 --> 00:43:26,940
right ahead

1116
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,500
okay so we've been talking about in

1117
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,940
those breathing a little bit so let me

1118
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,639
just say a couple of things that nose

1119
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,318
breathing is the way the body uses air

1120
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:35,879
most effectively you breathe through

1121
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:37,528
your mouth as often as you eat through

1122
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,539
your nose as always like to say in class

1123
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:40,230
and that you pace yourself you can

1124
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:42,660
breathe through your nose

1125
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,460
almost all the time why is that is

1126
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:47,670
because it's the best utilization of

1127
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:49,380
carbon dioxide the body retains more to

1128
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:51,000
help the oxygen move when you breathe

1129
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,650
through your mouth you give up way too

1130
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,630
much covered outside as I said in

1131
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:56,160
hyperventilating and we've seen this

1132
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,180
experience when somebody's about to

1133
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,639
faint and they breathe in through a

1134
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:01,440
paper bag that breathing back their own

1135
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:03,808
carbon dioxide and they reduce the

1136
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,639
ability to faint they lose the they

1137
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:07,710
won't think let's put it that way so

1138
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:09,838
this exercise is designed when you're

1139
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:11,548
feeling anxious or when you're feeling

1140
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:14,429
like you're breathing too fast in 81

1141
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:16,559
seconds I don't bring the body back to a

1142
00:44:14,429 --> 00:44:18,538
little slower breathing rate as well as

1143
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,670
to maximize the use of your carbon

1144
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:22,589
dioxide to help oxygen get distributed

1145
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,838
more quickly which will bring the system

1146
00:44:22,588 --> 00:44:25,440
back into relaxing so I'm going to do

1147
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:28,949
this in a

1148
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,409
1981 second exercise and it's up to the

1149
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:32,969
count of six and then back from the

1150
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:34,889
count of six so you'll understand when I

1151
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:36,929
do it if you're having an asthma attack

1152
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:39,598
you would do it up to the count of ten

1153
00:44:36,929 --> 00:44:41,368
and then come back from ten so sit

1154
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,019
comfortably I'm going to say it this way

1155
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:45,750
I'm going to tell you to breathe in I'm

1156
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:47,519
gonna tell you to breathe out and I'm

1157
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:50,760
gonna tell you to suspend your breathing

1158
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:53,039
so I'm having you breathe in to the rate

1159
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,420
of two seconds out for the rate of three

1160
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:57,150
seconds and then we'll be holding

1161
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:59,730
periodically moving from two seconds up

1162
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,750
to six seconds and back again so don't

1163
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,608
over breathe

1164
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:05,010
don't try to breathe harder be in a

1165
00:45:02,608 --> 00:45:06,750
relaxed place just let the air come in

1166
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:08,069
as naturally as it can in this

1167
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,170
particular time or whatever your

1168
00:45:08,068 --> 00:45:12,358
breathing rate is and rhythm is let it

1169
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,690
be that don't overdo it all right here

1170
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:16,699
we go

1171
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:21,059
so when I say ready take a breath in

1172
00:45:16,699 --> 00:45:25,710
take a breath out and suspend your

1173
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:31,429
breathing one two take a breath in take

1174
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:37,730

1175
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:45,259

1187
00:46:55,849 --> 00:47:04,250
oh yeah Robert I am really calm

1188
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,949
I am very chill now

1189
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:08,869
yeah so this feeling that I have right

1190
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:11,599
now is why I wanted to include it in

1191
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:14,960
today's show because when we did this in

1192
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:17,900
person it actually makes me feel like

1193
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:21,320
I'm gently high and it's just working

1194
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:23,840
with my body's natural rhythms and not

1195
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:27,260
only is this great for folks with asthma

1196
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:31,760
and COPD and related you know blockage

1197
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:34,220
type things but but also as more and

1198
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,619
more people are experimenting with

1199
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:39,858
cannabis and and people introduce

1200
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:42,500
themselves to dabbing and and cannabis

1201
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:44,509
is getting stronger sometimes we can

1202
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:49,159
feel anxious when we're using cannabis

1203
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:50,960
and so this this breathing exercise you

1204
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:53,358
know so far it has been a hundred

1205
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,250
percent effective in me when I get a

1206
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:57,349
little off my game and get anxious when

1207
00:47:55,250 --> 00:48:00,019
I'm talking this brings me right back to

1208
00:47:57,349 --> 00:48:02,839
where I want to be and for something

1209
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:04,699
like that to be so effective and only

1210
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:07,190
take a minute and a half of

1211
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:10,189
concentration I would call that some

1212
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:11,929
pretty powerful tech it is what's

1213
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:13,909
happening with the feeling of is you

1214
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:16,368
know all that breath holding in between

1215
00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:19,250
is increasing the co2 which is really

1216
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:21,140
allowing the body to flood with oxygen

1217
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:22,909
and so that's what you're feeling when

1218
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:25,250
you feel a little high you're getting so

1219
00:48:22,909 --> 00:48:26,989
much more oxygen to your brain and once

1220
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:29,059
the brain has more oxygen it's as well

1221
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:31,099
okay we can chill no there's nothing

1222
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:35,320
there's no threat going lower we're

1223
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:38,659
fully fed we're nourished fantastic so

1224
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:41,570
let's go ahead I'm so calm now let's go

1225
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:44,358
ahead and then and take our our second

1226
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:46,519
break and we'll be right back you're

1227
00:48:44,358 --> 00:48:48,619
listening to shaping fire and my guest

1228
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:49,940
today is breathing specialist Robert

1229
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:52,369
linman

1230
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:55,130
while I certainly still enjoy smoking

1231
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:57,140
joints I moved over to using vaporizers

1232
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:58,460
about three years ago the high was a

1233
00:48:57,139 --> 00:49:00,588
little different than burning the flower

1234
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,990
and in the end I decided I preferred it

1235
00:49:00,588 --> 00:49:05,358
for daily use especially because I have

1236
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:08,149
asthma more importantly though I could

1237
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:09,739
taste my flower so much more it's hard

1238
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:11,720
to express to you how significantly

1239
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:14,358
different cannabis with a good terpene

1240
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:16,699
profile tastes when vaped instead of

1241
00:49:14,358 --> 00:49:18,348
burned I have brought my vape with me to

1242
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:20,179
visit growers and they are astonished by

1243
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:21,349
the clarity of taste and they say they

1244
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:24,108
feel like they're tasting their flower

1245
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:26,599
for the very first time the air vape

1246
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:29,088
vaporizer from air vape usa.com

1247
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:30,890
is a great device to use on the go or at

1248
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:32,599
home when you pick it up and feel

1249
00:49:30,889 --> 00:49:34,730
satisfying like a medical device

1250
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:36,829
it isn't flimsy like many vape Tsar I

1251
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:39,050
like how the flower is inserted in the

1252
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:41,000
top instead of the bottom so travels are

1253
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:42,619
shorter path to my mouth with the

1254
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,389
cannabis at the top I get a hit that

1255
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:46,338
feels more substantial even though I'm

1256
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:48,949
just inhaling vapor and not full-bodied

1257
00:49:46,338 --> 00:49:51,259
smoke since I used this vape for flower

1258
00:49:48,949 --> 00:49:52,818
hash and concentrates I really like that

1259
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,980
that digital control for the temperature

1260
00:49:52,818 --> 00:49:56,389
is right there on the front three clicks

1261
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,338
of the button and it fires up to the

1262
00:49:56,389 --> 00:50:00,949
temperature I specify really quickly and

1263
00:49:58,338 --> 00:50:03,380
discreetly you know vape concentrates

1264
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:04,879
are a milder experience than dabbing but

1265
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,410
you still get the potency in your hit

1266
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,480
also the taste is great

1267
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:11,179
as would be expected with a low temp tab

1268
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,740
I love that this vape gives quick little

1269
00:50:11,179 --> 00:50:14,809
vibrations when it gets to the right

1270
00:50:12,739 --> 00:50:16,699
temperature that way if I'm chatting or

1271
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:19,068
distracted while it's heating up it lets

1272
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:21,169
me know when it's ready if you are ready

1273
00:50:19,068 --> 00:50:23,690

1317
00:51:55,789 --> 00:52:00,559
guest this week is breathing specialist

1318
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,118
Robert Wittman of the breathable body so

1319
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,000
I gotta tell you that was one of the

1320
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:06,798
calmest breaks I have ever had in fact I

1321
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,210
needed to do a couple jumping jacks to

1322
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:10,730
get my head back in the game for this

1323
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:13,760
last section so during this last section

1324
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:16,730
we're gonna talk a bit about dabbing and

1325
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,170
then a bit about a ceremonial plant

1326
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:19,969
medicine so that'll be fun

1327
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:21,858
um but let's let's talk we'll talk a

1328
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:24,288
little bit about what we know so far

1329
00:52:21,858 --> 00:52:26,659
about breathing and dabbing because

1330
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:29,119
because you know most of these studies

1331
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:32,000
around the impacts that dabbing has on

1332
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:34,760
the human just haven't been done yet

1333
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,829
there's a lot of opportunity there but

1334
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,880
they just haven't been done yet so so

1335
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:40,640
let's start with something really basic

1336
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:43,519
so the heat coming off of dab rigs is

1337
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:45,769
extraordinarily hot especially if

1338
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:48,500
someone's using a torch and if they hit

1339
00:52:45,769 --> 00:52:51,349
it at full temp you know you know Robert

1340
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:53,980
is is is dabbing especially abusive to

1341
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:56,750
the lungs compared to other types of

1342
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:58,548
inhalation of cannabis yeah it feels

1343
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:00,048
that way to me I mean it's the burn if

1344
00:52:58,548 --> 00:53:01,940
we're doing again I go back to the

1345
00:53:00,048 --> 00:53:04,038
burning issue the burning issue is is

1346
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:09,349
going to cause the the lungs in the

1347
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:11,329
airways to to scar so over time the

1348
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:13,640
repetitive tearing apart of the

1349
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:15,140
epithelial lining rebuilding the

1350
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:16,440
epithelial lining tear it down

1351
00:53:15,139 --> 00:53:17,940
rebuilding it

1352
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,889
it's gonna count do you know the bodies

1353
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,940
are very adaptable in terms of

1354
00:53:19,889 --> 00:53:22,739
strengthening what it needs to

1355
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:26,010
strengthen and it will just solidify

1356
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:29,189
some of those more malleable teachers

1357
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:31,589
that are meant to be malleable and so

1358
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:33,720
you know over time period that's a

1359
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:36,690
stiffening of the Airways not what's

1360
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:37,348
meant to happen yeah that doesn't that

1361
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,269
doesn't sound good

1362
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:41,670
certainly it doesn't feel good is it is

1363
00:53:39,269 --> 00:53:43,559
an odd part of cannabis culture right

1364
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:46,730
now and and you know and I should say

1365
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:49,769
upfront that I dab you know I'll using

1366
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:53,400
butane torches when I'm out but really I

1367
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:57,509
prefer dabbing at home on my on my vape

1368
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:59,730
XL device but you know I dab so I'm into

1369
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:03,930
concentrates but what I'm not into is

1370
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:07,318
that burning feeling and and you know it

1371
00:54:03,929 --> 00:54:10,769
seems to me that that it so it's an odd

1372
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:13,349
aspect of our cannabis culture that the

1373
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:15,980
burning and even sometimes people

1374
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:18,630
Keeling over from the from the amount of

1375
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:20,550
you know things that they inhaled

1376
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:23,338
calling husband that keeled over there's

1377
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:25,890
a certain amount of you know here onus

1378
00:54:23,338 --> 00:54:28,259
to having that big hot dab and III think

1379
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:30,900
that we're gonna we're gonna evolve away

1380
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,010
from that as a scene and and for me the

1381
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,960
the sooner the better

1382
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:36,510
how about the inhalation of terpenes

1383
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,639
though you know smoking a joint is one

1384
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:42,540
thing because there's only so many

1385
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:45,088
terpenes to inhale in the joint but with

1386
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:48,150
a concentrate you know those are could

1387
00:54:45,088 --> 00:54:50,400
theoretically reach a level of terpene

1388
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:52,530
toxicity you know and I and I have yet

1389
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,510
to see any Studies on this so so it's

1390
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:57,269
it's mostly just opinion but like what's

1391
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:59,069
your hunch as somebody who does this all

1392
00:54:57,269 --> 00:55:00,690
day every day what do you think that the

1393
00:54:59,068 --> 00:55:01,949
studies are gonna look like when when

1394
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:04,650
they're eventually completed

1395
00:55:01,949 --> 00:55:06,059
I do think there'll be toxicity I think

1396
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:08,250
you think of it the terpenes is

1397
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:09,568
aromatherapy you know and you're doing

1398
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:12,420
this from aromatherapy you're always

1399
00:55:09,568 --> 00:55:16,039
looking for the light of the light smell

1400
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:19,858
and you know you're gonna eventually

1401
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:21,509
become more immune to the terpenes and

1402
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:23,608
stuff the body's going to develop a a

1403
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:26,160
protection device so there won't be as

1404
00:55:23,608 --> 00:55:27,809
effective what's my edge yeah that makes

1405
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:29,460
sense and you know it also makes me

1406
00:55:27,809 --> 00:55:32,400
concerned about the

1407
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:34,260
these custom sauces that people are

1408
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,760
putting into vape pens I mean anybody

1409
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:39,720
listens to the note and into the show

1410
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,940
knows that I'm a big fan of whole plant

1411
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:44,429
medicine anyway but some of these you

1412
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:48,480
know these custom terpene sauces people

1413
00:55:44,429 --> 00:55:51,179
are making they are being blended based

1414
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,599
on taste more than they're being blended

1415
00:55:51,179 --> 00:55:57,269
based on science and it concerns me that

1416
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:59,430
some of these especially tasty carts

1417
00:55:57,269 --> 00:56:02,130
that are jam-packed with aftermarket

1418
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:03,899
terpenes that don't come you know that

1419
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:06,300
are not in the original makeup of the

1420
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:09,240
plant the percentage of them are so high

1421
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,310
so they taste good I'm just concerned

1422
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:12,989
about their long-term effects of the

1423
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:15,690
lungs and I know that that could make me

1424
00:56:12,989 --> 00:56:17,399
sound like a like a negative Nelly or

1425
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:19,679
whatever but you know as somebody who

1426
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,358
works with patients every day this is

1427
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:23,639
this is where my head's at

1428
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:25,440
no you're answering your own question I

1429
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:27,329
mean it's an artificial stimulation it

1430
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,000
says it can't human body doesn't like

1431
00:56:27,329 --> 00:56:32,579
that kind of stuff just doesn't right on

1432
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,858
so um so so let's let's up the scales

1433
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:38,009
right so so when someone takes a huge

1434
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:40,098
dab they are inhaling heavy amounts of

1435
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:43,349
you know THC and other cannabinoids

1436
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:45,030
intense terpenes and I've seen plenty of

1437
00:56:43,349 --> 00:56:46,830
videos and you know people even joke

1438
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:49,260
about this online and memes where

1439
00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:51,239
someone takes a huge hit and keels over

1440
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:53,190
right there their eyes are rolling back

1441
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:55,889
a little bit maybe they shake and they

1442
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:57,720
fall over and you know in some circles

1443
00:56:55,889 --> 00:57:00,379
their friends laughs and you know that's

1444
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:04,199
that's just it's part of our scene here

1445
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:06,030
but but why right like what is happening

1446
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:08,639
with the delivery of that hit to the

1447
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:10,980
lungs that somehow shuts their human

1448
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:12,509
down how come it doesn't happen to other

1449
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:15,480
people you know doing entertainment

1450
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:17,820
sighs dabs of several grams for a video

1451
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,338
it only seems to happen to some people

1452
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:22,260
sometimes when they take a monster hit

1453
00:57:20,338 --> 00:57:23,759
do you have any suggestions about what

1454
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:26,280
might be going on at the the

1455
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:30,359
mechanization level you know all each

1456
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:32,910
each one of us is sensitive in a

1457
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:35,420
different way and so some people can

1458
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:38,250
tolerate pain some people can tolerate

1459
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:40,320
loud noises and some people can so it

1460
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:42,659
depends on a person's nervous system the

1461
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:44,519
shutdown is an overload

1462
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:46,139
the nervous isms but I can't handle it

1463
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:50,039
so I gotta shut down it's too much it's

1464
00:57:46,139 --> 00:57:52,619
too much stimulus way too fast for this

1465
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:54,269
particular nervous system and so it

1466
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:56,039
shuts down well that would make sense

1467
00:57:54,269 --> 00:57:59,309
why it's different for for every people

1468
00:57:56,039 --> 00:58:02,639
and and probably even why it's probably

1469
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:04,590
also related to tolerance too if it you

1470
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:08,039
know over time you can probably handle

1471
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:09,630
more dab inhalation than you would a

1472
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:11,969
normal eyes but you know I'm thinking

1473
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:15,420
back to this the second set you know

1474
00:58:11,969 --> 00:58:17,309
it's actually a you know well said that

1475
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,320
if people are gonna dab because I'm

1476
00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:21,329
gonna continue to dab even though I know

1477
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:24,960
what we're talking about but but what I

1478
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:27,719
have found is that micro dabbing is the

1479
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:31,079
way to go because just like we were

1480
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:34,259
talking earlier about the the very clear

1481
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:38,429
reasons why it makes physiological sense

1482
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:42,120
to take more smaller hits because you

1483
00:58:38,429 --> 00:58:45,230
are you'll be gentler on the lungs plus

1484
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:47,339
honestly you're preserving your your

1485
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:50,519
cannabis as well because you're not

1486
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:54,030
wasting it on the exhale but but taking

1487
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:56,599
more like a higher number of micro dabs

1488
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:59,640
so you're taking more of a smaller

1489
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:02,190
inhalation really seems to be the way to

1490
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:03,629
go if if you're gonna if people are

1491
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:05,400
going to continue with concentrates

1492
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:07,860
which they're you know it's just getting

1493
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,480
more popular not less well when we come

1494
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:12,300
back to the topic of the show which was

1495
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:14,400
asthma and COPD so you had kind of have

1496
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:16,590
to evaluate when the micro death does

1497
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,050
its job for you for that particular

1498
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:21,630
person that particular reason if you're

1499
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:23,160
using it for other things like the party

1500
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:23,579
and have a good time that's a different

1501
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,799
story

1502
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:28,650
but otherwise the studies that have been

1503
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,450
done show about 200 micrograms of THC is

1504
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:34,440
all you need for the bronco for the

1505
00:59:30,449 --> 00:59:39,599
lungs to begin to expand so it's

1506
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:41,099
overkill in terms of that regard so yeah

1507
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,589
i think i think i think of it in terms

1508
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:45,869
of alpha me that we're experimenting in

1509
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:48,150
both ends from micro dosing to dabbing

1510
00:59:45,869 --> 00:59:49,859
to try to come to some middle middle

1511
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:52,019
ground that says this is what's really

1512
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:54,000
best for the body is we now it's

1513
00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:55,480
becoming you know so pervasive it's

1514
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,829
legal almost everywhere

1515
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,719
we didn't have that opportunities like

1516
00:59:56,829 --> 01:00:00,340
when we're in a candy store now trying

1517
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:03,189
to figure out what the what's the best

1518
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:04,720
candy to use yeah right and we want we

1519
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:06,490
want to experiment with all the candy

1520
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:09,879
without suddenly getting obese or having

1521
01:00:06,489 --> 01:00:12,459
a sugar fit right yeah totally so yeah

1522
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:14,349
interesting a lot of us are learning in

1523
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:16,809
the mix especially those of us in the

1524
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:19,449
industry who are developing these

1525
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:20,829
products at the same time as we're

1526
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,319
learning how to use these products I

1527
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:25,389
remember the early days of dabbing you

1528
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,070
know the same people who are dabbing

1529
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:28,779
were the ones who were doing the you

1530
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:31,720
know that were the first extractors and

1531
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:34,180
so they were their own guinea pigs which

1532
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:37,539
I see a lot in this industry meaning

1533
01:00:34,179 --> 01:00:39,549
heck i I I experiment myself with new

1534
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:41,380
techniques and I'm like well was that a

1535
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:43,630
pleasant experience you know did did

1536
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:46,930
this CVG tincture work to help with my

1537
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:48,760
back pain or not and and it's it's

1538
01:00:46,929 --> 01:00:52,269
interesting how many of us in the

1539
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,470
industry are our own guinea pigs well I

1540
01:00:52,269 --> 01:00:55,059
think the word you use there was

1541
01:00:53,469 --> 01:00:57,459
pleasure of all was this pleasurable or

1542
01:00:55,059 --> 01:01:00,159
not that's not something that we really

1543
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:03,340
is a culture of value is what's

1544
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:04,929
pleasurable and I think that's one of

1545
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:07,030
the things that we can do with cannabis

1546
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:09,250
especially in micro dosing or you know

1547
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,780
being gentle with ourselves is to really

1548
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:12,159
find out is it giving us the results

1549
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:13,720
that we want and does it feel pleasure

1550
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:15,009
well to me well I don't know once a

1551
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:16,239
thing that feels pleasurable whatever

1552
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:19,120
what's the thing that's gonna burn me

1553
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:22,029
well the the pleasure principle there is

1554
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:24,009
something that is a great transition for

1555
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:26,320
our last topic because you know one of

1556
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:28,540
the things that I've enjoyed hearing you

1557
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:31,630
speak and and and watching your your

1558
01:01:28,539 --> 01:01:35,309
videos is that you know you really blend

1559
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:38,500
science ceremonial plant medicine and

1560
01:01:35,309 --> 01:01:41,500
experienced based spirituality together

1561
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:43,389
when you're teaching people you know not

1562
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:45,070
only how to take care of their body with

1563
01:01:43,389 --> 01:01:47,980
breath but also people who are

1564
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:50,050
interested in you know ceremonial plant

1565
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:52,210
medicine as part of that health

1566
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:54,220
experience so you know tell us a little

1567
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:57,309
bit if you would why smoking cannabis

1568
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:58,889
can be so spiritual with the right set

1569
01:01:57,309 --> 01:02:03,190
and setting

1570
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:06,279
well I friend of mine kind of introduced

1571
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:09,220
me to this idea about speaking to the

1572
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:10,869
plant itself to Santa Maria

1573
01:02:09,219 --> 01:02:13,149
Jane however you want to call her and

1574
01:02:10,869 --> 01:02:15,640
recognizing that she's an ally that

1575
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:17,950
she's a teacher and in that teaching she

1576
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:20,500
will go through many stages when you

1577
01:02:17,949 --> 01:02:23,289
ingest cherry and it's the first rush of

1578
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:26,260
her and then there's a long period of

1579
01:02:23,289 --> 01:02:29,108
her enlivening you in some kind of

1580
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:30,849
spiritual body way and then the peace

1581
01:02:29,108 --> 01:02:32,170
that comes afterwards where you begin to

1582
01:02:30,849 --> 01:02:33,609
come down from it and you feel your

1583
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:36,010
tiredness and your end of your journey

1584
01:02:33,608 --> 01:02:39,789
so you're thinking of it as a journey as

1585
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:43,390
a time period of in ingesting an ally

1586
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:45,699
who is on board to wake up some part of

1587
01:02:43,389 --> 01:02:48,489
your consciousness for me it's mostly

1588
01:02:45,699 --> 01:02:51,039
body consciousness but I also like when

1589
01:02:48,489 --> 01:02:53,108
I am moving my body Howard enlightens my

1590
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:56,108
psyche and my spiritual consciousness so

1591
01:02:53,108 --> 01:02:57,880
being conscious that it is an allied

1592
01:02:56,108 --> 01:03:00,250
that's the big best way I can say it in

1593
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:04,320
so many plants like other plants or

1594
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:09,849
master teachers but cannabis has its own

1595
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:11,200
its own textures and personality so you

1596
01:03:09,849 --> 01:03:12,820
know really engaging with the

1597
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:15,189
personality of the plant that you're

1598
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:16,838
ingesting allows it to enhance what

1599
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:18,700
you're wanting to bring forward in that

1600
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:21,519
particular moment and different strains

1601
01:03:18,699 --> 01:03:23,409
will do different things so there again

1602
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:25,150
comes back to the engagement and being

1603
01:03:23,409 --> 01:03:26,829
intelligent about what am I using this

1604
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:28,720
for and what do I hope to get out of it

1605
01:03:26,829 --> 01:03:31,539
and let me use the plant in a way that

1606
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:34,029
will support that one of the things that

1607
01:03:31,539 --> 01:03:36,039
I find interesting is that you know we

1608
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:39,210
have an ability to look at our

1609
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:42,849
inhalation of the cannabis plant in very

1610
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:44,980
specific analytical techniques now

1611
01:03:42,849 --> 01:03:46,269
because we've got we've got laboratories

1612
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:49,659
and microscopes and things like that

1613
01:03:46,269 --> 01:03:52,599
whereas if you look back 10 or 20,000

1614
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:55,149
years you know early humans who were

1615
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:57,400
carrying this plant around with seeds

1616
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:59,470
around with them from from encampment to

1617
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:03,250
an encampment and selectively

1618
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:07,059
hybridizing just based on on what seeds

1619
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:10,420
they took with them they didn't know the

1620
01:04:07,059 --> 01:04:14,049
analytics like we do but they knew

1621
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:16,240
something moving and important was going

1622
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:18,130
on where where during the first set you

1623
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:20,618
were talking about how the the

1624
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:22,820
inhalation of cannabis makes us more

1625
01:04:20,619 --> 01:04:26,030
aware of our body and

1626
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:28,789
expands our connectedness to the world

1627
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:30,200
around us and for us you know we can we

1628
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:31,670
can actually explain that what's going

1629
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:34,219
on in the brain you know and and and

1630
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:37,630
what parts are being stimulated and we

1631
01:04:34,219 --> 01:04:39,769
can look at it with an MRI but

1632
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:42,920
anthropological egh looking back that

1633
01:04:39,769 --> 01:04:46,130
far it was much more filled with with

1634
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:48,769
mystery and myth and storytelling and

1635
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:50,240
you know engaging with you know gods and

1636
01:04:48,769 --> 01:04:52,070
angels you know what you know how

1637
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:54,919
whatever whatever the religion of that

1638
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:57,410
part of the world was right um do you

1639
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:01,840
think that there is still a place for

1640
01:04:57,409 --> 01:05:04,519
that kind of experienced based

1641
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:08,390
spirituality in a modern world where

1642
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:11,780
everything is so data and analytics

1643
01:05:08,389 --> 01:05:13,909
heavy yeah I absolutely do I think that

1644
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:16,460
one of the things that cultures have

1645
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:18,559
been doing since the beginning of time

1646
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:19,730
is altering consciousness and that's

1647
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:21,920
what you're doing when you're ingesting

1648
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:24,920
your ear and just in cannabis here

1649
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,740
you're inviting an alternative

1650
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:30,139
consciousness for perception what do I

1651
01:05:27,739 --> 01:05:33,409
not see in normal consciousness that I

1652
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:35,599
can see when I ingest cannabis that can

1653
01:05:33,409 --> 01:05:38,569
inform how I live in my normal world

1654
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:40,880
more in touch with my feeling part of my

1655
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:44,090
reality than my thinking part of the

1656
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:46,579
reality and what magic shows up not like

1657
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:49,400
magic as you know something that's just

1658
01:05:46,579 --> 01:05:51,440
a game but the magic of the mystery it's

1659
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,630
like wow I'm tuning in to something that

1660
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,990
I've never turned into before so people

1661
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:59,840
are doing ceremonial cannabis evenings

1662
01:05:56,989 --> 01:06:01,189
now where that is the focus what what

1663
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,079
can I bring forward that I normally

1664
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:05,510
don't talk about that I normally don't

1665
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:07,759
see then I need to process to help me

1666
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:09,020
feel more multi-dimensional we are

1667
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,020
living in a multi-dimensional reality

1668
01:06:09,019 --> 01:06:13,610
and that's what the fear of it in the

1669
01:06:12,019 --> 01:06:15,199
government is this thing they don't want

1670
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:17,180
us to feel what else might out should be

1671
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:22,279
out be out there that feels more human

1672
01:06:17,179 --> 01:06:24,319
than not well may we all tune in and get

1673
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:26,660
more attention to the natural world and
