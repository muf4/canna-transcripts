never missed a week in 40 years 44 44

33
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:31,530
that's right this isn't as well and

34
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:33,868
while you're clapping in 2005 he was

35

36
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:39,030
Fame the highest honor a garden writer

37
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,069
can attain sestri correct also with him

38
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,739
is John Pizzarelli he is founder of

39
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:46,258
cutting edge solutions as an early

40
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,819
adopter of the soil food web system his

41
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,099
business is rooted in sustainable

42
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,508
agriculture John helped developed the

43
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,000
cutting edge product line to support

44
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,759
natural soil ecology including their

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,819
flagship product humty and co-founded a

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,858
Mike brought microbiology lab in 2004 to

47
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,538
support their research efforts one of

48
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:05,368
John's current side projects I love is

49
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:07,349
growing milkweed and a variety of pollen

50
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:09,750
producing flowers for migrating monarch

51
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,189
butterflies so let's say let's assume

52
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,129
that Colin's going to join us and we'll

53
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:15,419
plug into Colin Bell is the co-founder

54
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:17,490
co-inventor and chief growth officer at

55
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,059
brossentia the parent company of mammoth

56
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,560
microbes

57
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,390
just by

58
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,098
where you've heard of him before Colin

59
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:24,649
completed his PhD in soil my crop

60
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:26,659
microbial ecology in 2009 as a

61
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,530
researcher and scientist at Colorado

62
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:29,419
State University

63
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,770
Colin polished dozens of peer-reviewed

64
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:32,659
publications that were focused on

65
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,670
microbial mediated processes that

66
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:37,159
enhance plant growth Khan left his

67
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:39,919
academic producer position in March of

68
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,629
2015 to launch gross Sencha their first

69
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,879
product mammoth pee is a beneficial

70
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:46,340
bacterial bloom stimulant that targets

71
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:49,159
phosphorus so the way that we're going

72
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,739
to do the panel today is we're gonna

73
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,799
present the panel a question and then

74
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,730
each panelist will have a chance to take

75
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,920
a swing at it

76
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:59,268
unfortunately the panel is only 45

77
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,849
minutes so we're gonna we're gonna be

78
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:03,349
moving around along pretty swiftly and

79
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,719
we may or may not have time for

80
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:06,768
questions at the end so Jeff lets us go

81
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:10,009
ahead and start with you since your

82
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:11,750
since you're closest so so Jeff in a

83
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:14,090
commercial growing operation

84
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,098
conservation of resources including time

85
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,930
and money is vital and changing from

86
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:19,909
traditional cannabis growing techniques

87
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,280
consistently consisting of bottled salt

88
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,629
nutrients too instead using holistic

89
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,359
growing techniques that bring the soil

90
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:28,819
alive can seem differently expensive and

91
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:30,980
time training and changes management

92
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,599
often resists making the switch to

93
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:33,919
living soil because they're afraid of

94
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,530
the risk involved with doing something

95
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,809
that they say differently that it's

96
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,150
different can focusing on building

97
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,789
thriving microbe communities in

98
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,620
commercial operations be financially

99
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:50,900
beneficial in addition to just being

100
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:58,849
natural yes because I think the biggest

101
00:03:50,900 --> 00:04:01,400
change are in a long time and grow stuff

102
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,989
and we know that they're going to grow

103
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,310
stuff the way they make cigarettes and

104
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:06,439
the way they make beer and the way they

105
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,930
may do everything else they do it will

106
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:10,219
not be a natural system and the way that

107
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,439
you're going to be able to distinguish

108
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:14,099
yourself from them I believe is because

109
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,189
you're going to be organic and that

110
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:20,100
we clean those early articles in

111
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:23,759
California that one out of five plants

112
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,230
didn't make it the testing etc etc you

113
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,909
know you're gonna you're going to be the

114
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,580
positive side of that story and so I

115
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,500
think definitely it is gonna be worth it

116
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:33,149
from an economic perspective regardless

117
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,579
of whether you believe in it or not are

118
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:37,500
not are your thoughts Jonathan well you

119
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,209
know that's a good point in that you

120
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,209
know sustainability means you can save

121
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:45,180
soil and so by reusing so I mean it's

122
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:48,930
one of the key factors in labor in you

123
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,519
know wasting time wasting money as far

124
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,769
as salt based fertilizers go I mean

125
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,180
that's that means pretty much everything

126
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:57,149
in a bottle is if you think about it

127
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,209
seaweed is a salt based fertilizer salt

128
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:02,839
based means that it's on the si or salt

129
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:05,639
index and the so Lennox is made out of

130
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:08,189
sodium nitrate and sodium nitrate

131
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,110
actually is an organic fertilizer so it

132
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:13,529
gets kind of confusing when you say salt

133
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,330
based but there's a lot of people that

134
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:18,869
are going back to amendments and going

135
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:21,509
back to compost teas and that's a good

136
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,360
thing and I think that a Jeff's point

137
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:25,949
that that by differentiating yourself as

138
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,420
somebody who's growing with living soil

139
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:29,909
probiotic Li I mean it's a huge

140
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,170
marketing win for you it's a product

141
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,290
differentiator that you're not gonna

142
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,240
find just anywhere and also I know what

143
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,730
Colin would have said to this question

144
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,670
as well Colin would have also said that

145
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,710
it is a misnomer that using living soils

146
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:46,350
and building healthy microbe communities

147
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:48,060
is less yielding rain historically

148
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,760
people think that oh you have to use

149
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,410
bottled nutrients in order to to get

150
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,439
these monster yields but what we're

151
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,810
finding is that we as we learn how to

152
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,819
take care of our soil yields are

153
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,980
increasing and are being as competitive

154
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,360
as with these traditional products so

155
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,750
John this isn't this next questions for

156
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,389
you so much of the market for flour is

157
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:12,240
based on bag appeal and many consider

158
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:13,860
frosty flowers and intense coloration to

159
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,960
be the result of intense

160
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,720
Thatta canoe treants what can

161
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:21,060
commercial-scale growers do to create

162
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,040
frosty flowers with great bag appeal

163
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,639
while also respecting the health of

164
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,610
substrate micro-communities

165
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:35,250
I caught like half of the issues it was

166
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:37,050
one space but you know I think if you

167
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,910
just work off what I think that question

168
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,129
is and you know when you say bag appeal

169
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,500
of course everyone is looking for you

170
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:46,050
know frosty flowers and the terpene

171
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,569
levels being boosted and you know as a

172
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,980
as a fertilizer manufacturer I mean

173
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:52,409
probably the most important thing is

174
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,900
manganese you know manganese is a key

175
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:57,270
micronutrient that all plants need and

176
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:59,429
they'll you know take it you turn into

177
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:01,349
an enzyme that acts as a catalyst and

178
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,389
moves nitrogen through the plant but and

179
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,610
the canopy see a family we're hot

180
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:09,360
there's hops in Canada and and pot

181
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:12,270
basically cannabis the you know the

182
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,990
manganese make is even more an important

183
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:18,299
role as the basis for the the terpenes

184
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:21,060
being made with the early blocks

185
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,800
building blocks so how do you get more

186
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,930
manganese in there when manganese is

187
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,600
only available in soil it like a pH of

188
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,840
four and you know the way to do that is

189
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,670
is microbial breakdown and you know I we

190
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,859
actually have a product that we use

191
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:38,100
microbes to break that down so microbes

192
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:41,370
play a key role in you know being able

193
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,800
to build a terpene profile and you know

194
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,810
mammoth pee has some good bacteria in it

195
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,939
that also make phosphorus more available

196
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,519
and you know you don't want to overload

197
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:53,160
your your soil with too much phosphorus

198
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,599
too much bone meal or you know even too

199
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,730
much you know using products that have

200
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,340
phosphoric acid in them because they'll

201
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,050
shut down mycorrhizal you know fungi

202
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:03,299
relationships and you know that's

203
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,400
another benefit of using microbes that

204
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,319
make like bacillus mega tyria our

205
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,379
Pseudomonas pooted

206
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,120
that may we'll make more of the

207
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:12,680
phosphorus available on phosphorus of

208
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,980
course you know adds to the flower

209
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,600
structure but you know there's a whole

210
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,379
different school of thought out there

211
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,840
now something I was already questioning

212
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:27,649
well let's hold questions the end of

213
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:30,649
things the you know as far as getting

214
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:33,500
the flower is more frosty you know

215
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:35,629
there's a there's a lot of different

216
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,299
fungi and bacteria that produce amino

217
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:40,429
acids and you know we have an amino acid

218
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:43,699
product that kind of mimics that and

219
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:46,969
it's organic in that and that boosts the

220
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,290
actual structure of the glands and

221
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:52,060
swells them up and they get more

222
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:56,929
crystals on them so you know as far as

223
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:59,709
building a good flower structure you're

224
00:08:56,929 --> 00:09:04,849
dealing with a lot of microbes as far as

225
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:06,710
building good overall look and terpenes

226
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,139
you know once again you're looking at my

227
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:11,930
microbes processing a little bit such as

228
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:14,289
manganese but then Foley or spraying

229
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:16,639
follow people do that with humty or

230
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:19,669
compost teas and they find that that

231
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:23,120
actually influences the plant and gives

232
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:25,490
it more flavor and more and more crystal

233
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,320
structure and you know I built a lab and

234
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,730
I've worked for over 20 years and trying

235
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:36,200
to figure that out but that's not like a

236
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:37,340
one-minute question so so the question

237
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,430
that we asked when you're running in is

238
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,860
can using microbe communities and living

239
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:44,689
soil create flowers that have got the

240
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,399
bag appeal and are sexy and will compete

241
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,110
with the kind of stuff we see from

242
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,579
synthetics and petroleum products yeah I

243
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,680
think you know there's interactions with

244
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,180
all that and so it's not just one thing

245
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,739
there's no one solution and there's a

246
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:57,349
lot of solutions that we have to bring

247
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,299
together to achieve our final goal and

248
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,730
the final goal is quality and we think

249
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:04,849
these quality metrics is back appeal is

250
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,920
one is not really my personal metric for

251
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,170
success it's the quality of the terpene

252
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:11,179
and maybe they came up with situates and

253
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:13,159
then that smell of that flavor that

254
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:15,949
translates from the smell I want that

255
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,259
terpene flavor or the terpene smell to

256
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,600
translate to that flavor and then

257
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:22,610
there's even a more sophisticated

258
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,949
interaction or sure there's THC and CBD

259
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,509
and other Kim annoyed but then we know

260
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:28,879
that there's these interactions with all

261
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:31,370
these terpenes which helps enhance the

262
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,860
effect how this flower makes us feel

263
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:36,019
I've you know tested and looked at a lot

264
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,289
of different strains for the CBD and THC

265
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:41,810
is the same but they have completely

266
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:44,509
different effects and there's all this

267
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:47,448
chemical interactions which contribute

268
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:50,019
to that and so how do we make that full

269
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:52,759
package it's by what John said

270
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:55,278
maximizing the plant's ability to take

271
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:57,948
up the resources it needs to maximize

272
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,110
its full phenotypic potential I think to

273
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,819
a large degree that's we have to make

274
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,778
sure the nutrients are there and then we

275
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,760
have to make sure the nutrients are

276
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:07,028
bioavailable and then they can be taken

277
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:10,129
up and so that's an interaction with

278
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:12,980
maximizing our plant genetics and our

279
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:15,500
environment and then what we're talking

280
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,690
about is the input and the availability

281
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,379
of these inputs in availability to a

282
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:23,240
large degree is a microbial function

283
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:29,360
maximize the plant's ability to open up

284
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:32,509
and I got out of breath writing strict

285
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,430
pass it to Jeff and uh and so just to

286
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:36,319
maximize your plant's ability to develop

287
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:37,669
through the nutrient uptake in there and

288
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,949
that's the microbes just like John

289
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:41,899
saying yeah I mean the microbes are what

290
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:44,958
would take the organic materials and

291
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,669
convert them into an available substrate

292
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,899
that the plant can take up and I think

293
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:51,620
it's important for everyone to

294
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:54,230
understand the plant uses 17 nutrients

295
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,720
you can't put a terpene down in the soil

296
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,970
and expect that terpene to go into the

297
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,139
plant and come up out and do you crystal

298
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,920
that's not how it works

299
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:07,350
each plant cell produces what it needs

300
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,839
those trichomes are producing the turkey

301
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:12,210
and then making the crystal and putting

302
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,460
it outside so it's happening inside the

303
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,320
plant what you have to do is give the

304
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,960
plant as both these gentlemen have said

305
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,940
everything they possibly need in order

306
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,570
to make that little factory operate

307
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,140
properly

308
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:27,629
you can't have a boycott with China over

309
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:29,490
the tariff for phosphorus because you're

310
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:32,490
not going to end up with you know the

311
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,779
right kind of beans you know it's you've

312
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,129
got to make sure that you've got

313
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,750
everything in the soil that you need

314
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,250
it's just that simple and the other

315
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,929
thing after two other things I think

316
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,450
have to worry about you have to worry

317
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:44,189
about genetics I guess you'd say three

318
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,600
things genetics you have to worry

319
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,980
because if you don't have great genetics

320
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,009
you're not going to get you know great

321
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,750
turkeys the genetics of the plant which

322
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:54,120
I think you said when you said phenotype

323
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,919
you've got to have great sunlight you

324
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,110
gotta have great light if you don't have

325
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,689
the very best possible light than the

326
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,120
factory is not operating at its optimum

327
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,980
you know a thing and and then I guess

328
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,919
the other thing you have to have is

329
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:12,720
gentleness this that's too many people

330
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,569
who are doing hydroponic come in and all

331
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,060
shake the plants and do this is that you

332
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,350
got to be careful and gentle and then

333
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:21,479
the last thing I'll say is I think we've

334
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:24,750
got to go to a lot more research not on

335
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,690
a microbial level but on a cellular

336
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,429
level Menomonee insect UV light level

337
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,790
because it's pretty clear that UV light

338
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:34,799
is one of the things that causes these

339
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:37,500
trichomes to grow so you know let's

340
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,539
let's figure out what spectrum where it

341
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,720
is can we alter it can we change it is

342
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:44,279
there a special time to have one kind of

343
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,480
UV light over another you know all that

344
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,750
kind of stuff I think this isn't as

345
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,820
important as the microscopes anyway so

346
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,850
Colin this next one is for you go first

347
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,770
so establishing a commercial operation

348
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,110
can seem like a long-term project and it

349
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:59,730
is but at some point cultivators who

350
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,500
want to make the switch to probe

351
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,870
probiotic growing techniques have to

352
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,269
make the jump and get up to high yields

353
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,860
and repeatable results fast what advice

354
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:10,019
would you give to a professional

355
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,909
cultivator ready to make the switch to

356
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,919
living soils so they quickly achieve a

357
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:15,149
baseline of production that they can

358
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,549
refine over time

359
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:18,899
hmm so we're gonna refer this to write

360
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:20,549
to living soils instead of just

361
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,679
solutions what I think I'm just gonna

362
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:25,439
kind of talk to about how I'd respond to

363
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:27,000
that question I jump from a hydroponic

364
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,610
grow or let's just have the full extreme

365
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,100
a hydroponic full hydra or to our living

366
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:34,169
soil grower that's a heck of a job and I

367
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,028
don't think that's a quick path I think

368
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:38,069
they're stair stepping so understanding

369
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:39,990
the steps of moving that direction

370
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,730
having this angle this is what we want

371
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,870
to look like and these are the kind of

372
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,659
things that we need to start adopting

373
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,639
and practicing in our grow and getting

374
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:50,819
those results and stair stepping over to

375
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:54,000
that full organic living soil

376
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,460
cultivation is is what we're gonna do

377
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,839
you know I think that I've been this has

378
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,490
been a really fun week and kind of

379
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,770
reflecting on the last two weeks I was a

380
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,659
bunch of huge grows in California and

381
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:06,809
like the Salinas area really really high

382
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:09,059
throughput acre size greenhouses full

383
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:10,859
bore and then the last week I spent with

384
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:13,528
a bunch of growers and farms have been

385
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,870
humbled or is a lot smaller scale living

386
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:17,909
soil the hubell growing in all this type

387
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,679
of stuff so it's very fascinating to

388
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:21,659
take all that information and kind of

389
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,958
synthesize it and understand how does

390
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:29,389
you know the humble you go living soil

391
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:32,250
type of the grove get scaled into a

392
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:34,708
high-throughput manufacturing or

393
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:38,240
cultivation facility and I think that

394
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:42,088
isn't I don't think speed or is

395
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,769
realistic I think consistency and having

396
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:46,980
clear benchmarks and a clear goal of how

397
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:48,870
to get there is is the answer I think

398
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,028
part of that is understanding the

399
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,200
different components that get us there

400
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:53,820
you know there's this substrate

401
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,019
component there's this input based

402
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,480
nutrient component and then there's my

403
00:15:56,019 --> 00:16:00,879
living soil components and we might not

404
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,778
get all the way there but I think I

405
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:07,420
would encourage facilities that are huge

406
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:09,879
in our commercial scale and are looking

407
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:12,488
at really high throughput I've talked to

408
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,199
him as we're getting from point A of

409
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:17,230
where they are right now cocoa and

410
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:18,729
synthetics to organics and microbials

411
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,920
and you know their inputs and living

412
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,149
soils they're gonna find the solutions

413
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:24,068
that work best for their current

414
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:26,169
practices and they can plug in and then

415
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:27,488
take the next step I think one of the

416
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:29,649
big steps I'll leave it up to the other

417
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:32,439
guys is this substrate one of the

418
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:34,928
facilities had that I visited big

419
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:36,849
facility had the synthetic cocoa the

420
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:40,778
normal stuff and then their biggest

421
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:42,610
challenge was organic substrate to grow

422
00:16:40,778 --> 00:16:44,289
in and you wouldn't think this they're

423
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,489
adding the microbes are doing the things

424
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:47,169
right but what they're getting

425
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:49,269
challenged with is you know it's it's

426
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:51,458
it's really to do if you just kind of

427
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:53,078
acknowledge it is the drainage you know

428
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:55,838
if you serve to get this organic living

429
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:57,308
soil in a pod or in a container compacts

430
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,389
and does something in the hydrology is

431
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:02,528
very different then then a cocoa and

432
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:05,409
that was one of their biggest challenges

433
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:07,298
so understanding how to scale every

434
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:09,370
aspect of those inputs to get to the

435
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:11,679
single whatever kind of skill things so

436
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:13,658
they can achieve within what their

437
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,730
infrastructure is the goal and I don't

438
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:17,860
think that green house is gonna grow

439
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,568
like the growers and humble but I think

440
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:21,638
that they can achieve to the best of

441
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:26,078
their ability natural inputs to get

442
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:27,969
organic higher quality in product using

443
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,490
natural solutions and a lot of those are

444
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:33,579
probably commercial you know at the farm

445
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:36,159
in Humble the the girls are trying to

446
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:37,928
get all their inputs from their land you

447
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:39,490
know that's not gonna happen at these

448
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:42,269
commercial facilities so finding the

449
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:46,750
other sources for those inputs is key

450
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:50,019
well next so you said Hubel so that

451
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:53,289
means the they're cutting down trees

452
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:55,779
putting them into work yeah I've seen

453
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:57,279
this I built these things before yeah

454
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:59,440
it's kind of interesting you know

455
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,450
because the it depends on the tree you

456
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,990
select I mean you can select cedar bad

457
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:08,200
choice and it does not break down black

458
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:10,029
locust forget black locust hey no that

459
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,160
does not break down either but fir

460
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:13,839
breaks down pretty well and some people

461
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,519
actually grow and red wood sawdust and

462
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,819
like this substrate sir you're talking

463
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:21,220
about there's a lot of different

464
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:25,089
companies that use redwood sawdust as as

465
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,529
their base and they kind of do that for

466
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:28,809
a number of reasons but one of them is

467
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:30,549
because if coco coir all comes from one

468
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:32,470
or two sources and it's all treated with

469
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:34,269
calcium nitrate so you can never get an

470
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,850
organic certification on coco coir

471
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:38,920
unless you know you deal with a specific

472
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:41,319
company like well gold I think has an

473
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,480
organic cocoa core but I mean they're

474
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:45,639
they're a large company but in the

475
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,849
scheme of things that are very small and

476
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,170
they're also in Humboldt but that Huebel

477
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:52,240
stuff is kind of interesting I don't

478
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,890
know if anyone here has seen this kind

479
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,299
of you've seen this before it has seen

480
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,230
this raise your hand if you know that oh

481
00:18:55,299 --> 00:19:00,909
wow that's way more people that caught

482
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,279
if you candy buddy wants to see these

483
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,290
drawn out I actually visited the same

484
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,899
farm that Colin went to at Moonlight

485
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:10,750
semi moon time medicinals and it's got

486
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:13,150
pictures of their 6500 square feet of

487
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,279
Google culture in Garberville and you

488
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:17,380
can see on the on the shaving fire

489
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,000
YouTube channel it's incredible yeah but

490
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,730
but back to you John so we're the

491
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,640
question we were working on was making

492
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,380
the switch from synthetics to probiotics

493
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,940
and what would you recommend for

494
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,710
somebody wanting to move in that

495
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,210
direction they're trying to take their

496
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,400
company in that direction oh because

497
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,079
there's they're straight well you know

498
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,850
you have to look at it as being indoor

499
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:38,199
greenhouse or outdoor you know you're

500
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:40,569
not going to do a huge ill structure

501
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,440
indoors you know some people might try

502
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:43,269
it I mean

503
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:48,308
you know I've seen investors buy

504
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:49,569
anything you know just say cannabis

505
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:51,849
enough times and you know they're

506
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:55,028
throwing money down Huebel even that

507
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:58,000
sounds great you know an organic oh I

508
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:59,589
gotta have this but you know in a

509
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,119
greenhouse it's it's more challenging

510
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:03,189
because you know you have to have the

511
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,408
height of course and then you have to

512
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,048
have the airflow too and they tend to

513
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:10,269
trap a lot these mounds to trap a lot of

514
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:12,579
humidity but outdoors you know you are

515
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:18,250
actually seeing it being used outdoors

516
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:19,569
more the to take the steps you know it's

517
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,460
kind of interesting this whole industry

518
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:27,000
is changing so fast I mean I was talking

519
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:29,288
to this chemical engineer and a PhD

520
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,569
chemist that we used to work for a

521
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:34,509
Novartis and they're there in Willets

522
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:37,058
and they clean oil for two to three

523
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:38,620
dollars a gram and you know these are

524
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:40,869
the first people that have actually seen

525
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:42,369
you know I I'm not going to talk about

526
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:45,668
their process because like I said I

527
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:47,199
would but they can do it and they can

528
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:49,000
end up with a clean product and now you

529
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,129
know that's a big issue because in

530
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,349
Salinas they're worried about all the

531
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:55,028
drift I don't know about you but when I

532
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:57,759
go down there I get a headache after two

533
00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:58,929
days because you know they spray so much

534
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,250
it's a real challenge with the

535
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:04,090
surrounding agriculture in particular

536
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:06,669
yeah it really is so you know you don't

537
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:10,778
almost have to have as you know wet

538
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:12,879
walls to trap a lot of vapors coming

539
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:15,069
through and then of course that builds

540
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:17,230
humidity and you know your your question

541
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:20,849
though was how do you step from some

542
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:23,889
pure Rockville hydroponic setup to

543
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:25,039
ultimately having living soil and like

544
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:26,659
Collins and

545
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,990
you know if you wrote have you read

546
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,759
Jeff's books we realized that you know

547
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:34,880
that's that's not easy that's like

548
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,529
either a complete commitment and you

549
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,240
pretty much have to own the property at

550
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:41,799
that point because the overhead will

551
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,509
kill you but it's certainly worth it to

552
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:47,299
make that make think those different

553
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:50,720
steps and microbiology is with you every

554
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:53,180
one of those steps you know it's in

555
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,549
liquid form you you have mammoth pee you

556
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,620
have you know Jeff talks a lot about

557
00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:00,019
compost teas I mean these are the things

558
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:02,599
that are going to help your plant along

559
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:04,359
and sustain your plant as you test out

560
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:07,759
these different substrates and

561
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:11,389
ultimately you know try to work with an

562
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:14,359
amended soil and you're gonna end up

563
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:17,540
foliar spraying quite a bit to to keep

564
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:19,429
the plant going so you know I I guess I

565
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:21,019
could probably lay out the answer by

566
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,370
describing a couple of different places

567
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:26,690
but I don't know how much time we have

568
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:28,969
this I mean I go on and on we're still

569
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,440
doing pretty well on time so okay you're

570
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:34,579
interesting dude so just you know let

571
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,620
arrive well you know so you weren't

572
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,609
humble and and humbled you know it's

573
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:38,629
always been a place of a lot of

574
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:40,819
experimentation

575
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,650
I haven't ranch there and Willow Creek

576
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:45,139
and you know I'm right in there with all

577
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:47,600
the experimenters and so I started

578
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,570
experimenting in 1978 when I was a kid

579
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,949
and my first cannabis crop so I've been

580
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:54,409
doing this for a minute you know it's

581
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:57,230
like it's makes 40 years and so I seen a

582
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:59,390
lot of growers succeed fail or just go

583
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,250
on and do other things and the

584
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,190
microbiology was always there and in

585
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,829
Humboldt in Mendocino you know they had

586
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,410
the advantage of being in there early

587
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:11,539
and then of course attracting all the

588
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:14,360
helicopters which pushed their

589
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:16,339
cultivation back into the edges of the

590
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,589
woods where all the microbiology was I

591
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:20,899
mean things coming like and you know

592
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:23,889
things coming off like in and you know

593
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,000
other plants interacting and

594
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:29,440
that's kind of where I got my education

595
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,450
was you know as a kid digging holes you

596
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,490
know using a flour sifter to add the

597
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,930
amendments and because I didn't want to

598
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,329
get you know hit over the head with the

599
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,710
shovel for doing the wrong thing and you

600
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:39,789
know gradually I got really good at it

601
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:43,150
and so I got to work in a lot of

602
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:44,889
different places and I realized I had to

603
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,210
go back to school to study microbiology

604
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:49,210
because there was more going on than

605
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:51,220
just fertilizers and and you know that

606
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,890
led me to actually looking at other

607
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,860
plants and other other plant compounds

608
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:59,740
and you know there's there are products

609
00:23:56,859 --> 00:24:03,039
out there now that are you know almost

610
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:05,049
like homeopathic products so just small

611
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,700
amounts of certain other plants I mean

612
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:08,259
you know we have a whole biostimulant

613
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,860
line available commercially

614
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:14,049
that's plants from Southeast Asia and

615
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:16,419
North America and if coal plants from

616
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:18,000
Africa and they're harvested at

617
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,980
different times and they have different

618
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,200
you know compounds in them that

619
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,789
influence the plant in making brutes

620
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,380
growing blooming and then of course

621
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:31,930
boosting terpenes and that comes from

622
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,940
john jebin's and the whole skin Chadwick

623
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:38,799
who you know brought double digging to

624
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:40,240
this country from France and you're

625
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,829
giving the thumbs down on Chadwick

626
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,599
double D Grayman

627
00:24:41,829 --> 00:24:48,970
oh let's go to Jeff now about double dig

628
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:59,919
I haven't heard this myself what do you

629
00:24:48,970 --> 00:25:03,400
think yeah when you know the

630
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,590
microbiology is Ryan d double D right no

631
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,290
I actually learned that from my

632
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:11,409
girlfriend forced me to farm with draft

633
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:20,109
horses for several years

634
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:22,570
anything right right right I was with

635
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:25,029
it's an intimate trust me

636
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:27,819
you know working with draught horses but

637
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:31,750
but that's where I learned about the

638
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:34,450
degradation of the ozone layer and the

639
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,549
fact that fungi was being destroyed by

640
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,650
flipping the soil too deep because you

641
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:41,379
know in like nineteen idea was growing

642
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:45,759
quinoa and I thought you know ripping

643
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:47,350
the soil with a d7 cat was a great I

644
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:48,789
well you know I'm learning from old

645
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:50,709
farmers right so I thought you know that

646
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:53,589
this is how you do it out here and uh

647
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,480
you know Lassen County but then I

648
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:57,459
started look at more soil samples than I

649
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,279
realized under my scope I'm like wow

650
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,799
there's less fungi than if I just go to

651
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:05,349
the outside of the field where it's

652
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,960
undisturbed and you know then I realized

653
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:10,740
I had to do more fertilizer inputs and I

654
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,090
was like wow this is gonna cost me money

655
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,559
deeply ripping and then I looked around

656
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:16,059
I realized why they were all going out

657
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,740
of business and why I could have an

658
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:20,230
organic farm there because they couldn't

659
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,720
afford their own fertilizer inputs so he

660
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:34,150
just proved that in fact you can't go

661
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:37,150
commercial from right around about where

662
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:38,650
we are today I'm just you know so I

663
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:41,890
would start with something like key to

664
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:44,590
life or I used by our natural I get a

665
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:46,540
system that's in place that's got four

666
00:26:44,589 --> 00:26:49,959
or five or six different inputs right

667
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:54,460
you've got a TV app five you how many do

668
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,470
you have I have and both of these can be

669
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,789
used and I don't mean to pick on these

670
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:00,400
companies there are other people out

671
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:02,019
here organic as well as inorganic so you

672
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,000
can use them in a hydro system and a

673
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:06,519
soil system so you're you're you're

674
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,349
starting to make that conversion you can

675
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:09,700
understand what's going on what's

676
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:11,589
working what's not working

677
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,659
and then you work on the substrate which

678
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:16,089
is what you mentioned and you convert it

679
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:17,830
into a soil substrate it can be done and

680
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:19,480
it's not that difficult if you've got

681
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:23,558
enough money you are a consultant they

682
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:26,200
do this all the time but you start with

683
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:28,298
a base somebody's system that you know

684
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,340
works and that's got some scientific

685
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:31,480
background as you can read on it and be

686
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:32,949
able to tweet and think about it and

687
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,589
then you say okay now I've got this

688
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,090
system and it's working now let's fool

689
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:39,038
around a little bit with mammoth pea

690
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:41,500
let's see if it makes a difference you

691
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,210
add that into the system and in every

692
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,950
one up frankly and I think you guys will

693
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,538
all agree they don't really even need to

694
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,038
add the stuff in anymore once you once

695
00:27:46,538 --> 00:27:49,778
you get your system working and it's

696
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:51,879
alive that you've made the conversion so

697
00:27:49,778 --> 00:27:54,460
yeah it does work it can be done and

698
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,940
it's easy to do for individual small

699
00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:00,909
people less easy for bigger people but

700
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:04,778
if you use a system is based on you know

701
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:06,850
no worse either hydro which I consider

702
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:14,648
to be synthetic obviously and we're soil

703
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:17,109
grain then you can start anyway as far

704
00:28:14,648 --> 00:28:18,879
as the inputs are concerned while you're

705
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:20,079
making that conversion you start looking

706
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,970
around for where there are good

707
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,980
endpoints of work who's not using what

708
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:26,079
ways perfect you can use that they don't

709
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,579
know that they're not using where's the

710
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,648
where's or grow or somebody's

711
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:34,480
inadvertently or stupidly throwing away

712
00:28:29,648 --> 00:28:45,609
their soil after every grow there's ways

713
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:47,259
to do all this stuff and so that sets us

714
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:49,148
up for the graph for this next question

715
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,679
great so this time we'll go about

716
00:28:49,148 --> 00:28:53,469
college on and then we'll finish up with

717
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:57,399
you Jeff so so this applies for both

718
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:59,048
home growers and patients and also for

719
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:01,329
commercial folks because we as we all

720
00:28:59,048 --> 00:29:03,638
know you know you need to be choosy

721
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:05,859
about which products you you purchase

722
00:29:03,638 --> 00:29:08,379
because some of these probiotic products

723
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:12,579
can be expensive what would you

724
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:15,580
recommend as being a few inputs that can

725
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:16,919
be grown either simply at home or you

726
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:20,789
know larger and

727
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:23,490
commercial-scale that can be grown and

728
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:28,759
had high quality inputs to a probiotic

729
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,759
soil in order to help keep costs down

730
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:32,039
that's it I wish we wouldn't have

731
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:46,170
started with me I probably need to

732
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:48,509
reflect on when it comes down to me as

733
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,890
chemistry and biochemistry you know at

734
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:52,230
the end of the day I think about

735
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,910
everything as a chemical profile a lot

736
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,650
of the papers I did in science I have a

737
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,120
background of a research scientist from

738
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,350
Colorado State University of PhD in

739
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,668
microbiology and that's what I was doing

740
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:01,230
for a long time it was really

741
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:03,390
fascinating not along with plant microbe

742
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:06,870
interactions with neutrons to a common

743
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:09,840
tree then as we all have a seed and the

744
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:11,489
PDK ratio in our bodies so do plants and

745
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,439
microbes and these are the things that

746
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,058
we're trying to fulfill we eat food

747
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,890
because we're trying to fulfill our

748
00:30:15,058 --> 00:30:19,500
internal stoichiometry our nutrient

749
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,850
demands our nutrient needs that's what

750
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,650
we're trying to do with a fertility

751
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:23,909
program we're trying to deliver the

752
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,880
nutrients at the plant seems of the

753
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:28,320
congroo uninhibited and so thinking

754
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,820
about these inputs what you want to

755
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,500
think about them is that a biochemical

756
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:33,210
level a nutrient profile level and you

757
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,339
grow those things up you know for

758
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,259
example office is a really good example

759
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:39,269
as I like you where it actually

760
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:41,519
incorporates more nitrogen into its

761
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:45,119
biomass because of the way it fixes that

762
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,529
nitrogen and so forage alfalfa is a

763
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,599
really good example of a relatively

764
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:50,490
higher nitrogen input you want to think

765
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:53,730
about these aspects and you can actually

766
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:56,308
test for it or test other you know any

767
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,019
kind of input for its nutrient profile

768
00:30:56,308 --> 00:31:00,149
and that's why you're selecting these

769
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:02,250
and so I think thinking about that

770
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,480
thinking about the scale that you're

771
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,579
growing and all these things going to

772
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,009
affect but generally what I would say is

773
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:10,409
if you don't know what's in it you can't

774
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:12,629
use it with precision any microbe the

775
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,040
function any of these inputs you have to

776
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,200
identify that once we

777
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:19,159
understand what it is we can use it with

778
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:23,210
confidence and precision and consistency

779
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:25,590
that's good I'd like you know you're

780
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:27,750
going back to the Humboldt example I

781
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:29,699
mean experiment right experiment in your

782
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,680
own gardens on your own farm and but

783
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,440
keep it control you know it's a lot of

784
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,789
times he will just broadcast completely

785
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,039
and then of course you know then they

786
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:40,079
they say oh well it didn't work that

787
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:41,819
well on this control but the control was

788
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:45,599
just the weakest plants don't select the

789
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:50,220
weakest plans for your control you know

790
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:53,129
you mentioned a number of things like

791
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,380
for instance if you're in a forested

792
00:31:53,130 --> 00:32:00,420
area here's something you can do get

793
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:01,730
organic milk in small containers bury it

794
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,920
open it up

795
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:09,089
bury it up to the level of the milk so

796
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:12,660
it stays cool in the soil and see if

797
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:14,519
that turns to yogurt often that is good

798
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,800
lactobacillus that you're getting right

799
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,049
out of the soil and you can take that

800
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,299
and you can actually put that into a tea

801
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:22,529
if you want to test different milks

802
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:25,259
that's always a great one you know you

803
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:27,029
can get commercial milks and when you

804
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:29,460
actually get it close to your nose you

805
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:32,549
know why that's not really a food what's

806
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:35,460
your favorite milk um well since I'm in

807
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:37,829
Sonoma County its Straus Straus organic

808
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,019
milk it comes in glass bottles and the

809
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:42,539
neck is just perfect the perfect size

810
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:44,819
for pretty in microdopes it's like it's

811
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:47,639
like an old school and it's like an old

812
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:49,829
school of microbiology flasks yeah so

813
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,660
that's a good one and you know it just

814
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:53,909
shows people if there's something

815
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,920
already in the soil so we people want to

816
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:58,500
just wipe everything out you know and

817
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,480
this is the this is the sort of thing

818
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,460
that Jeff was saying before about double

819
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,079
digging you know double dating now is

820
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,880
the fall so you're you're breaking up

821
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,710
the lower soil but you're not taking it

822
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,990
so completely flipping it when it

823
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,940
started out they were flipping the soil

824
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,028
completely and they were wiping out all

825
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,369
the fungi

826
00:33:13,028 --> 00:33:17,019
and you know what up the example I gave

827
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,698
was you know ripping the soil and of

828
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:21,038
course you're flipping it up and once

829
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:24,249
you go deeper than 10 inches and expose

830
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:25,568
it to full Sun is wiped out the fungi

831
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:29,169
and you've got to do something to

832
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:31,928
replace that and you know just going

833
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:35,349
back to the idea of T's I don't know if

834
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:38,339
anybody who uses you know how many

835
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:41,168
people here make T compost teas wow

836
00:33:38,338 --> 00:33:42,938
that's a lot of people let's go how many

837
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:46,949
people here have heard of Elaine England

838
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:56,399
that's even better you know because I

839
00:33:46,949 --> 00:33:56,399
was at that much it's already standing

840
00:33:58,048 --> 00:34:01,418
but it's good it's good that you've

841
00:33:59,858 --> 00:34:02,978
heard of Leaning minute because you know

842
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:04,659
she was one of the pioneers and sort of

843
00:34:02,979 --> 00:34:06,729
bringing the whole tea culture thing

844
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:08,470
back and you know a lot of people took

845
00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:12,730
it pretty far you know they started it

846
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:17,259
up to use wheatgrass and you know we

847
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:20,559
dress as zo tin in it and corn seed corn

848
00:34:17,259 --> 00:34:23,168
and you know you get different enzymes

849
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,059
when you make a fermentation out of that

850
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:26,230
and then put that on the tea too so

851
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:28,869
there's a lot of things to experiment

852
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:31,719
and try oh now I'm drifting really far

853
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:34,389
from the question but we can bring it

854
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:35,798
right back so Jeff since you haven't hit

855
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:37,269
this one yet and maybe you could

856
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:38,858
actually name a couple of species of

857
00:34:37,268 --> 00:34:41,348
plants that people who row so we're

858
00:34:38,858 --> 00:34:43,328
talking about inputs that people can

859
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:44,649
grow either at home that they can put

860
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:47,019
into their plants that will be helpful

861
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:48,159
and save them some money or be done in a

862
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:50,439
commercial level below that maybe

863
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,148
they'll do you know a handful a rose so

864
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,009
so what are those planets well you can

865
00:34:52,148 --> 00:34:56,558
get any number of carbon copy ously

866
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:57,789
lentils there's all sorts of red clover

867
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,650
white

868
00:34:57,789 --> 00:35:03,789
and they're cold catalogs just full of

869
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:06,710
cover crops and all of them were fine

870
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:08,329
one of the things I think that really

871
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,980
you need to do though is as you say you

872
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:13,579
need to know whether the stuff you're

873
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:16,190
using works you know and that's that's

874
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:19,369
always that means testing so you you've

875
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:21,769
got to test people don't test got a test

876
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:23,690
for a decade you got a test for the

877
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:25,699
microbiology using in Lane England's

878
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,500
test I think you got a test using this

879
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:29,359
new bike micro bio meter so you know

880
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,280
what kind of biomass and you've got to

881
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,559
use these tests intelligently you got a

882
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,760
some of our expensive some of our cheap

883
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:36,679
you got to be able to meld them together

884
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,950
so that it works for you and you've got

885
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:42,319
to be able to to retest to see where

886
00:35:39,949 --> 00:35:44,299
you're trending and to many of us don't

887
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,220
you get a fine-looking crop you know hey

888
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,250
I must be doing everything right you

889
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:51,289
don't know unless you test informations

890
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:53,599
power we've always been told that we

891
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:56,779
believe that and yet you know as growers

892
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:59,089
we don't test enough kind of test and I

893
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,440
think once you test then you start

894
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,539
putting in inputs because you want to

895
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,250
test to see whether it's working when

896
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:06,380
you buy a product you test to see what's

897
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:08,840
working if it doesn't work you don't buy

898
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:12,140
it again etc etc at night and you get

899
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:14,570
this but but it does start with growing

900
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:16,579
your own inputs if you can't grow your

901
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,410
own mycorrhizae fungi collect your own

902
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:20,569
mycorrhizal fungi from natural areas

903
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:23,449
around your property or rounder existing

904
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,620
grow your existing plants contain all

905
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:26,480
sorts of things that you want to use

906
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:29,599
again I always talk about you don't

907
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,340
throw away male plants you use the old

908
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,650
root system for both males and females

909
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:35,420
because that's put one unbelievable

910
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,190
extra days into the soil you want to

911
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,200
collect that kind of stuff if you see

912
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,590
somebody that's thrown away their male

913
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,589
plants

914
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:48,429
of course we all are that's why we're

915
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:58,420
here at this thing what else is out you

916
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:59,919
know in the sunshine getting cancer so I

917
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,990
think you know overall we think about

918
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,940
this Millis approach of having a living

919
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:05,439
soil because we want to reduce our input

920
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,329
I might keep what we have and continue

921
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,800
to use it but we have to understand in

922
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:10,960
that particular substrate plants are

923
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,110
always taking a wave long on the

924
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,849
substrate it's allocating resources said

925
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:17,710
it's gained mostly of all new terms from

926
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:19,989
the soil into its biomass when you're

927
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:23,590
harvesting that so it's going away so

928
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:25,209
there's never a complete regenerative in

929
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,309
agriculture that there's not some type

930
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,630
of replenishment and so there's you know

931
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:29,980
certain resources don't know how many

932
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:32,380
crows are out there using things like

933
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:35,230
soil testing you know nutrient analysis

934
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,940
where you know from one crop to the next

935
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,340
where your nutrients are substrates

936
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:42,700
maybe deplete so you can just add those

937
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:45,280
specific elements in with precision and

938
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:46,929
not add everything you know you're so I

939
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,120
might not need everything might need

940
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:51,159
some very few items or you know and

941
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,960
there's an example where even

942
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:55,299
phosphorous there's total phosphorous

943
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,490
that might be in your substrate but not

944
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,960
available so a de calais to maximize the

945
00:37:57,489 --> 00:38:00,429
availability of that phosphorous you

946
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,289
don't need to add any phosphorous in in

947
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:04,449
cases a lot of micronutrients are clear

948
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:05,980
examples nitrogen is always a world

949
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,569
problem and maybe you need a source

950
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,130
every well if you use mammoth P you

951
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,289
don't have to use Mac's person in fact

952
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,720
you can't even buy phosphorus in long

953
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:15,190
food anymore that's one of the that's

954
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:17,349
one of the challenges with some

955
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:19,329
nutrients because it's been so abused in

956
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:21,369
agriculture in other places they banning

957
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:22,809
banning phosphorus in general

958
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:25,599
fertilizers unless you can prove that

959
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:27,309
your souls needed significantly so you

960
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,230
can actually justify the purchases so

961
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:31,179
you know it is a movement of using

962
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,159
biologicals it's not just us that are

963
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:35,379
out there preaching this all agriculture

964
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:37,000
segments are trying to understand

965
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,360
by all of you because it's a necessity

966
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,969
for our environment for the ecology and

967
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:47,559
for maximizing crop quality Neel quite

968
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:49,089
frankly they're sexy and yeah lots of

969
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:50,529
lots of applications that's right hey

970
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,210
you know what one thing that keeps - you

971
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,290
mentioned though is fully or spring and

972
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,590
there was an article that came out in

973
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:59,139
science magazine last week I think about

974
00:38:55,590 --> 00:39:01,980
foliar spray compost tea I think it was

975
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:03,730
and what it did to the fertilizer

976
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,619
situation and the plant

977
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:09,010
it also been fully or sprayed and what

978
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:11,909
it did to be to the exudate mix in the

979
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:14,110
soil so we got a fall in the spring is

980
00:39:11,909 --> 00:39:19,059
apparent to me something we need to

981
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:20,890
study we study the roots we're not

982
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:23,049
studying the foliage like the see I

983
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:26,109
think we're going to get timid gonna be

984
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:28,810
careful with your folio spray why

985
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:31,000
because this article says can you do

986
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:34,650
that above ground you are impacting what

987
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,929
happens below ground and just google

988
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:40,809
foliar spray fertilizer below ground

989
00:39:37,929 --> 00:39:45,969
under news for this week or last week

990
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:48,269
you'll get the article organic garden

991
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:48,269
check out

992
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:55,650
not so so in finishing up I know this is

993
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:58,259
crazy because we got all this experience

994
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:01,470
but they only gave us 45 minutes so so

995
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:03,119
we we are complete here so the three

996
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:05,039
fellows will be here for questions

997
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,750
afterwards but for the moment we need to

998
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,469
start shifting for the next speaker so

999
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,469
thank you very much

1000
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,129
