1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,400
everybody was really surprised and and

2
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,740
some like me pleasantly when when we

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,320
found out that your your new book was

4
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,909
not going to be another soil science

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,099
book I mean we all loved the original

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,719
trilogy and we're all waiting for

7
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:26,129
something new from you and then and then

8
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,820
you you know tell me an emerald-cut

9
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:31,259
ah the new book is otto flower which

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,820
which caused me to decide that I want to

11
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:36,119
do you know this whole year of auto

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,929
flower programming but for you you know

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:42,000
what inspired you to choose you know

14
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:44,789
auto flower and cannabis plants as your

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,170
new topic and and would you share with

16
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,850
us that you know a bit about your new

17
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:53,219
book sure interesting question

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:58,140
you know I am oriented towards the

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,698
science stuff and I actually as I was

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,768
thinking last night and I have another

21
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:05,188
one of those coming but in the back of

22
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:07,079
my mind I see some other stuff but this

23
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:10,589
one was totally out of the blue

24
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:13,890
first of all writing a book is a painful

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,200
experience for me and all I love doing

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,950
it and I'm happy that I do it and it's

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,500
what I love to do it's painful you have

28
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,820
to go into a rabbit hole and stay down

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,618
there and you have to organize

30
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,898
everything in that rabbit hole so nobody

31
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,060
will touch it and then when you have to

32
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:31,799
come up for something with the wife you

33
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,259
know you got to get out of that rabbit

34
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,299
hole all the way and you don't want to

35
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,129
because you forget we put stuff in

36
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,009
everything so I swear every something I

37
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:43,318
would never write another book again

38
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:48,478
it's that people experience even though

39
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:51,149
I love it and so my wife was gone and I

40
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,150
was tending some auto flowers and I said

41
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,549
to myself you know this isn't nice to me

42
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,580
I'm gonna write the book and I sat down

43
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:00,560
and in a week while she was gone because

44
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:03,170
that's the only way I can really do it I

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,969
wrote a book you know wasn't the best

46
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,859
thing in the world by oh my god

47
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:08,868
she this enough here for a book I think

48
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:10,759
this might work and I really think we

49
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:14,000
need to spread the word about these

50
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,289
things and I realized that as I wrote it

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,889
it wasn't a book that I was writing for

52
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:18,259
you

53
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:20,779
or myself even I was reading this book

54
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:24,319
for people like my mother who grow

55
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:26,449
tomatoes and you know would love the

56
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,449
idea of a brand new plant that they'd

57
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:31,639
never heard of before and commercial

58
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,229
growers have never I'm so surprised the

59
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:35,599
reaction is something we want to talk

60
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:39,049
about as well but so here's a plant that

61
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,299
that nobody's heard of before brand-new

62
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,820
it's the same size as this tomato plant

63
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,350
it grows during the same season as a

64
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,319
tomato plant you can also grow it

65
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:50,419
indoors like it tomato plant basically

66
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,219
you take care of it exactly like it to

67
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:54,849
me it's good to share like a tomato oh

68
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:58,819
my god share like crazy it's it has

69
00:02:54,849 --> 00:03:00,169
trichomes like a tomato plant and and

70
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,750
everything you know about Tomatoes

71
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:04,129
applies to this thing a couple of things

72
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,020
you have to learn different flowers

73
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:07,459
obviously two different kinds of flowers

74
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,620
as opposed it tomato you have to learn

75
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:12,289
how to handle that kind of stuff but wow

76
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:16,340
this is a plant that anybody can grow

77
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:19,579
and so the book really evolved put a lot

78
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,640
of history in the of where cannabis came

79
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,140
from you know to explain landraces which

80
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,659
I think people need to understand

81
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:29,479
because we're going back getting some of

82
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:31,400
that genetics into the system explain

83
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:35,238
the chemistry of the cannabinoid system

84
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,550
a little teeny bit explain that it's not

85
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,640
sativa can you know sativa indica

86
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,590
anymore it's all about flavonoids

87
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:45,909
cannabinoids and all that great stuff

88
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:47,590
mixed together talk about the needing

89
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:50,289
means of this stuff how it all got to be

90
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,539
where it is and certainly how to grow

91
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:54,250
this stuff and then words are going in

92
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:56,739
the future because I think there is a

93
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,650
spectacular future this plan I really do

94
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,840
believe that once the stigma goes away

95
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:05,349
from cannabis and it is disappearing

96
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,080
quickly I read today that all but three

97
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:10,419
states have something to do with

98
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,219
legalizing cannabis all for three

99
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:17,589
politic well in such a short period yes

100
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:19,988
that that stigma aside you said earlier

101
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,129
in your answer you said you know if

102
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,649
there's something worth to be said about

103
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:25,810
the reaction of professional ornamental

104
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:27,729
growers to the arrival of Canada what

105
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,430
are you nuts in well you know all of a

106
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,500
sudden even the nurseries that grow you

107
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,199
know they're going is a begin to think

108
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,610
hey wait a minute now of course we don't

109
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,620
have a license and everything else but

110
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,720
but but this is a plant people can grow

111
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,000
at home we should be selling it but now

112
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,290
lots of places you are not even sure

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,209
even Washington State you're allowed to

114
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,400
buy plants and for a while thing you

115
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:50,228
were allowed to grow them well you still

116
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,759
can't grow them in Washington yeah yeah

117
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:53,379
and then I know in New York State there

118
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,699
they're talking about legislation when

119
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:56,800
they're thinking about being they're

120
00:04:54,699 --> 00:05:00,399
growing their plants whoa whoa whoa whoa

121
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,699
this is a plant couldn't shake it so so

122
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,079
I think this book has been this first of

123
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,810
all a lot of people who've never heard

124
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:09,668
of this plan you know they they're

125
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,439
waking up even commercial growers of

126
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:12,879
cannabis have never heard of an auto

127
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,509
flowering in cannabis think that's any

128
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,279
good I think once people start to see

129
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:20,978
that this is a regular plant the stigma

130
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:22,929
starts to fall tea is just like a tomato

131
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:25,389
we don't limit people growing tomato

132
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,709
plants why are we limiting you know what

133
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:29,199
do you mean I'm not allowed to grow this

134
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:30,879
plant it's legal I can buy it in a store

135
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,379
and I'm not allowed to grow it so I

136
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,999
don't know that stuff's gonna change I

137
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:36,259
think this is them this is the

138
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:38,088
thing that's gonna stimulate this

139
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:40,309
auto-fire well anything that we can do

140
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:42,168
to normalize right that's a big win and

141
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:43,639
and I think that for Otto flowers a lot

142
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:45,438
of folks you know just like early

143
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,149
feminized seeds right mean you don't

144
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,649
want to use feminized seeds to breed so

145
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:52,399
they and they're for particular types of

146
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:54,288
growing people but I think Otto flower

147
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,319
is the same way some of the early stuff

148
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:59,298
was a little sketchy and and but but the

149
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,799
new wave of Otto flowers are just like

150
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:02,418
out of this world they are out of this

151
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:03,828
world then it's so it's too gotten to

152
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:06,738
the point where you want the seeds

153
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:07,968
because it's that good yeah oh my god I

154
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:10,668
can make this even better my breeding

155
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:12,319
and so so I think you know we'll find a

156
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:14,118
lot of it that will not be feminized and

157
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,718
I noticed that a lot of the companies

158
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:20,329
are selling non feminized water flowers

159
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:21,769
which can this is so much fun

160
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:23,598
you know when you think about it you get

161
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:25,069
your tomato plant you look at at the end

162
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:26,868
of the season you go boy this was a

163
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:29,389
really good time I would save the seeds

164
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:30,979
for this particular water put it early

165
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,629
or whatever whatever it might taste

166
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:34,668
different surgery you know you might

167
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:37,309
breed it with another one stick you know

168
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:39,649
Russian you know it's just so easy to do

169
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:42,800
this is the same kind of plant and I

170
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:44,569
think people who are in the gardening

171
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,098
they don't want to just stick something

172
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:47,749
in the ground that they buy at a nursery

173
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:49,009
they want to start it from seed first of

174
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:51,110
all you're not real gardener unless you

175
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,369
start up from seed they want to start a

176
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,639
from seed and they want to play with it

177
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:57,529
this is their hobby well this is a hobby

178
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,468
planet if we ever saw one and we know

179
00:06:57,528 --> 00:07:02,658
that because we've grown the bigger kind

180
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:04,579
the little kinds are every bit as much

181
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:06,678
as a hobby even more so because they

182
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:10,129
grow so quickly so you have a specific

183
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:11,628
particular kind of disease someone says

184
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:14,419
see why don't you turn this kind of Otto

185
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:17,599
flower you grow it you improve it you're

186
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:20,478
growing your own medicine truly in seven

187
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:22,819
eight nine weeks Wow pretty amazing

188
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,889
so what's happening and that's why I

189
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:26,689
wrote the book because I think everyday

190
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:29,088
gardeners are really going to get it

191
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:31,218
into this plant not for the THC not for

192
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:33,468
the CBD just because it's a fun plant to

193
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:35,658
grow and then then within that you find

194
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:38,478
the parts you want right yeah so the

195
00:07:35,658 --> 00:07:41,959
