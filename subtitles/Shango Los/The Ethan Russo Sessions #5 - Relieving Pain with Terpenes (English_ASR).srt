1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:08,900
so Ethan I'm asked by paying patients a

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:11,870
lot especially new cannabis pain

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,690
patients what terpenes that they should

4
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:19,028
be seeking out to reduce their pain and

5
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:21,980
they they usually are asking me both for

6
00:00:19,028 --> 00:00:25,250
what they should be looking for in the

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,410
flower but then also most of them say

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,899
can I put it in my my aromatherapy

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,439
diffuser at the same time so so it's

10
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:35,929
kind of a two-part question what what

11
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,000
terpenes are gonna be best for chronic

12
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:40,878
pain patients just to feel a little

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,759
better in their human and are there ways

14
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:46,339
that they can get that terpene in

15
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,960
addition to than just the cannabis plant

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,399
to help them really really they're

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,649
suffering sure

18
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,620
well this is one of those instances

19
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:58,579
where mersin can have a benefit on pain

20
00:00:54,619 --> 00:01:02,869
but particularly at bedtime because of

21
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:05,170
its narcotic effect this is not

22
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:07,368
necessarily going to be the best choice

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:11,228
during the day for the chronic pain

24
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:15,890
patient alphap I mean has

25
00:01:11,228 --> 00:01:17,810
anti-inflammatory properties linalool is

26
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,650
going to help with anxiety that's

27
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:24,049
engendered by chronic pain Carrie

28
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,680
offlane is going to be a great choice in

29
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:31,390
terms of being an anti-inflammatory

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:33,439
analgesic in its own right and hopefully

31
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,930
synergizing with other components of

32
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:39,109
cannabis particularly if it's available

33
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:42,439
along with THC and CBD this is going to

34
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:44,599
be a big advantage so so we've talked

35
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:46,609
before about how Mir seen is you know

36
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,728
kind of a couch lock terpene right and

37
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:51,649
so the the the variety of terpenes that

38
00:01:49,728 --> 00:01:54,019
you just mentioned if put together you

39
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:55,759
know if you took that you know UV UV

40
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:57,339
sleep you'd be lethargic this is kind of

41
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,069
that's kind of an end-of-day cocktail

42
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,750
what would you recommend for pain folks

43
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:04,758
who need to remain productive during the

44
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,009
day would you say those same ones but

45
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:09,430
drop the mirror scene or would you keep

46
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:11,719
the mirror scene and put something else

47
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,420
stimulating like a citrine or something

48
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,219
on top of it - ty - that'd help modulate

49
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:19,699
it okay so during

50
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:24,280
day on ideal mixture would be a small

51
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:27,589
amount of THC a larger amount of CBD and

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:32,150
a little bit of alpha planing to allow a

53
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:36,289
clear head and maybe a bit of limonene

54
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:40,340
for mood elevation a good bit of carry

55
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:43,819
off alene to boost the pain relieving

56
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,990
properties that'd be a great approach it

57
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:47,449
and so if you want to learn more about

58
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:51,650
this you can find the link to dr.
