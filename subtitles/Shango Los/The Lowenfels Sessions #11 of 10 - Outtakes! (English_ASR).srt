1
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:14,959
I can't believe I went the whole summer

2
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,630
that didn't occur me does get a bigger

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,570
pot yeah yeah you never know yeah well

4
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:24,259
sort of those things you know the reason

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,609
I like four of these plasma lights down

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,970
in Oregon there's a guy down there who's

7
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:33,198
testing them out I think the next thing

8
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:35,979
I'm reading I want one that's that big

9
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:39,109
that you lose in the tent because there

10
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:41,599
but but the root systems are twice the

11
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:43,728
size and so this guy kept insisting that

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,350
he was gonna dig it up and I don't know

13
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:46,728
he was he was pulling off the leaves

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,460
that's what he was doing I kept saying

15
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:50,808
what are you doing you know that's sort

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,829
of is it I don't know if you're filming

17
00:00:50,808 --> 00:00:53,570
this or not but that's one of the

18
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,448
tendencies feel a lot of people pick off

19
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:59,030
the leaves and they pick off the leaves

20
00:00:55,448 --> 00:01:01,789
ostensibly I think to make the bottom

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,239
nodes maybe they get a little bit more

22
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:04,219
light

23
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,390
I'm not quite sure why they do it but I

24
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:08,060
think that's what it what it must be

25
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,129
because I just tuck them under but I

26
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,890
kept saying you don't understand dig

27
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:16,129
your root ball is and so we dug it up

28
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,420
and what am i doing

29
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:21,129
you're right I mean then you pull those

30
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:24,710
leaves off ain't owned the root system

31
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:26,390
you screw the plants up yeah it's a nice

32
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:30,409
most being balanced and worked together

33
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,329
and and you gotta be very careful how

34
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:35,030
you pitch back in train plans I think

35
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:36,890
it's really so so where we live here in

36
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,290
the northwest one of our biggest issues

37
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,200
are is mold right right and so a lot of

38
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,120
folks here will pinch leaves like you

39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,719
said for the for the light to get in but

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,760
also so the air can get in so that

41
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,010
there's there's constant fresh air in

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,780
the in the middle right is that worth is

43
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,030
that worth the trade-off to pinch leaves

44
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,430
well I don't I don't know I mean I think

45
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,310
if there's a way you can train the plant

46
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:04,040
by pulling it apart little bear this Oh

47
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:07,010
a the least disturbance you can do to

48
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,719
the physical part of the plan is the

49
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,658
best are the leaves really banking

50
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,419
nutrients for future use well I think

51
00:02:11,658 --> 00:02:16,609
that yeah I think so they're there

52
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:18,469
they're certainly those nutrients get

53
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,520
used up the reason why you see those

54
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:21,199
bottom leaves turning

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,350
turn yellows because those blue kids are

56
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,359
being used and you know so you can

57
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,859
publish yellow ones off sure I think

58
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,970
people people just get a little carried

59
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:34,300
away with it yeah you know it's it's

60
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:37,699
tempting play with our plants yeah yeah

61
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,439
this look this will make a good addendum

62
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:42,250
to our series yes all right so the next

63
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,250
question here

64
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:48,949
we read these cannabis plants again uses

65
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:51,289
in the hydroponic model puppet food in

66
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:54,139
pumping food in or pumping food that's

67
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:56,810
what that's enough we really need to do

68
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:59,268
that to all plants you know or you know

69
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,098
and but now that we're in the soil model

70
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:02,810
I'll be taking the hydroponic model into

71
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,068
the soil world or have we'd sort of

72
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,170
altered a little bit so that now we're

73
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:07,878
using the giant pumpkin model you know

74
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:10,848
you put as much food in the slow as you

75
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:13,399
possibly can that may not grow the best

76
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:14,899
cannabis and ultimately I think that's

77
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,450
what we got to get back to we understand

78
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,640
thinking about what kind of cannabis

79
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:23,539
were growing it is not necessarily the

80
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:24,738
best big is not necessarily better you

81
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:27,199
know we're looking we're looking for

82
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,849
good quality and the specific kind of

83
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,608
quality that we as an individual might

84
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:35,869
want you're going to love medical my

85
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:39,319
creations so let's let's take just one

86
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,359
more step so so if on one end it is it

87
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:44,810
is powerfully interesting to grow an

88
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:46,700
auto flower in plain bagged potting soil

89
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,469
and not and not give it a bunch of food

90
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:50,418
so I that's just interesting to watch I

91
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:52,009
did that last year I did a last year's

92
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:53,090
my first growth you're growing autos I

93
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:54,560
did a bunch of different stuff and the

94
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,680
damn thing is they all grew so I'm so

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,419
it's amazing samesies all time

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,400
oh I I did with three different types of

97
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:03,200
seeds and and they were all out of

98
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,209
flowers all feminized and they all grew

99
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,729
and it was it was like bulletproof ramen

100
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:10,819
and the fact that you can you can pop

101
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:13,488
seeds April first and harvest July one

102
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:15,679
pop a second round has seeds July first

103
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:18,019
and be done October one that's two

104
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,788
cycles with no light depth and you know

105
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,560
here in the northwest that's like gold

106
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:23,719
ready for baby who's Alaska that is

107
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,728
platinum Yeah right so there you go so

108
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,010
so my question though is that let's so

109
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:30,168
let's say so now now this season and for

110
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:31,550
you know folks who are you know a couple

111
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:33,560
years into Auto flowers

112
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,970
we're looking to fine-tune and let's say

113
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,610
okay we're already impressed that

114
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,830
there's we don't have to use nutrients

115
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,580
and we know that we don't want to give

116
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:45,348
too many nutrients because that will

117
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:47,478
confuse the plant but what would you

118
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:49,728
suggest would be a couple amendments

119
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:50,329
that we might want to use to find that

120
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:52,430
happy

121
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:54,740
we're okay yeah we don't have to add a

122
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,329
lot but what might be the targeted few

123
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,829
that will supercharge your plans sure

124
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:01,698
and the way I've approached this the

125
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:05,180
second year is is to experiment in two

126
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:07,340
ways one is to experiment fertilizing

127
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,199
during the vegetative state and I would

128
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:11,859
use the vegetative you know the typical

129
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,240
vegetative fertilizers we talked about

130
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:19,490
which was the nitrogen Sosa and then I

131
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,870
would also experiment I would we then

132
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,610
let them going to flower and not

133
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,379
fertilize them and then I would take

134
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,598
some that I would fertilize only in the

135
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:29,930
flower stage and then the certain third

136
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:31,939
said of course I fertilize both to see

137
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,530
to see I think that that might makes a

138
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:39,439
big difference I kind of like the idea

139
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:41,689
of letting the plant grow you know if it

140
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,800
flowers in the two to three weeks that

141
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:44,658
it normally should flower you know

142
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,478
you've got a plant that's getting into

143
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:50,000
the flower stage and and and then

144
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:54,050
fooling around with the the firts

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,689
are in the the flowering stage may

146
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,430
produce the best result so so I'm going

147
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:01,329
to go a little bit deviant so so

148
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,680
certainly we all have got more

149
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:05,478
experimentation to do with this with

150
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,189
these autumn flowers and we got to share

151
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:09,769
it which is why that Otto flower network

152
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:10,278
is so yeah bought a flower net don't

153
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,889
miss it

154
00:06:10,278 --> 00:06:14,990
Wow and so so where do you think it's

155
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:17,000
gonna end up though in your experience

156
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,110
with the soil food web and your

157
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,168
experience with checking out Otto

158
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,090
flowers outside of this testing for

159
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:25,098
people who like you know I'm very

160
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:27,739
patient focused right so so for a

161
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:29,990
patient who's using Auto flowers because

162
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,259
they've got low mobility low resources

163
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:36,168
and low space let's just cut them to the

164
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:38,810
ending and say this is what we think the

165
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:40,278
research is gonna go show just use these

166
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,668
few additives what would you tell them

167
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:46,550
to use uh soybean in molasses really

168
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:47,789
yeah and mycorrhizae fungi of course

169
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,740
sure I was like that's

170
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,540
but yeah I like so beating molasses in

171
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,850
myself you know if you can find GMO

172
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,620
soybeans kind of tough to do but I'm

173
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,360
sulphur molasses of course not too much

174
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,000
of it that's a bacterial food and the

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,100
soybeans a follow them yeah and the mix

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,029
of the two together you know the

177
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,650
microbes love it

178
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:06,869
so when you say soybeans do you mean

179
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:09,509
like Okara or do you meet what it would

180
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,420
exactly soybean meal slaving meals you

181
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:16,019
know again I always tell people you know

182
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,970
originally fertilizer was manure and

183
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,169
then I think people forget out Chia he

184
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,120
was just the manure it's kind of hard to

185
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,280
carry around why don't I use this stuff

186
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,079
it makes them anymore and so they bought

187
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,509
the food that goes anything so if you go

188
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,669
to a feed store you can find on Sulphur

189
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:32,219
molasses because it's a food and you can

190
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:35,370
find and you can find soybean meal also

191
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,230
food that makes great food great for the

192
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,030
lawns great for cab yeah I've never used
