[Music]

2
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,690
well thank you again for you all for

3
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,670
being here for our first I guess we'll

4
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,070
call this a panel today I want to

5
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,929
introduce two of my I would say that

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,320
you're both now friends more than just

7
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:40,009
guess to my right we have dr. Corrina

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,829
cherry who is director of plant microbe

9
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:45,289
interactions at mammoth microbes and

10
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:47,390
when I first heard her speak and then I

11
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:49,729
heard her title I was all I want to

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,230
learn everything you know and so have

13
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:53,449
been interviewing her every chance I

14
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:56,328
could to her left is also a good friend

15
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:59,350
Joshua Stein's Lynn he is a longtime

16
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:02,420
cultivator and now international

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:05,000
cultivating consultant all throughout

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,890
Canada and the Caribbean now but he's an

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,530
Oregon boy so many of you probably know

20
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,299
him as a local so um how we're gonna go

21
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,849
about this is I'm gonna ask them a few

22
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,829
questions about poly culture and for

23
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:19,368
anybody who's not familiar with poly

24
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:22,459
culture it's it's very simply the idea

25
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:24,829
of inter planting and companion planning

26
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:26,509
with your cannabis plants so you were

27
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:29,689
used to doing monoculture and just

28
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,460
having soil or or hydro underneath our

29
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:34,099
plants but this idea is that we're gonna

30
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:35,750
plant other plants with them for the

31
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,789
better benefit of the further everybody

32
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,890
so this first question I'm gonna start

33
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,180
with a Joshua if you would answer first

34
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,099
and then and then croon if you want to

35
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,010
pick up after that so our first question

36
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:48,379
is in what ways does polyculture

37
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:51,770
companion planning benefit cannabis

38
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:52,310
health that monoculture does not I'm

39
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,048
sure

40
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,118
thanks for having me Shango first off

41
00:01:54,049 --> 00:02:00,220
from really it's an honor to be here and

42
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:04,789
share the stage with you and so anyway

43
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:08,719
polyculture what I've noticed in in in

44
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:11,000
my Gardens is just kind of a it's hard

45
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,280
to quantify health benefit you really

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,459
we've seen we've noticed a lot less pest

47
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,069
pressure the soil health is more vibrant

48
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:22,310
and the plants really show that in the

49
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:23,799
end you get the finished product is it's

50
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,079
just different I had cultivated

51
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:29,950
conventionally for 1516 years previous

52
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:31,719
to switching to living soil and then in

53
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:33,579
and didn't even really think of it as

54
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,469
polyculture I was just companion

55
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,040
planting and putting things in to help

56
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:41,139
retain soil moisture moisture and

57
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,439
nitrogen and I just noticed that at the

58
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:47,109
end my plants just looked incredible and

59
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,818
that was that was the biggest selling

60
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,800
point to me and the kind of proofs in

61
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:52,899
the pudding moment you said that you

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,700
companion planted to help with moil

63
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,250
moisture retention when you break that

64
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:59,738
out of it I'm sure I mean typically in

65
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,239
basic in regular you know garden

66
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:02,920
situations where you have bare soil

67
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,750
you're clearly going to be losing a lot

68
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:08,048
of moisture to the atmosphere and

69
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,030
transpiration and anyway you can kind of

70
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:12,219
lock in that moisture is a benefit

71
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,560
sometimes people do it with mulch that's

72
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:17,739
a really common common thing strong or

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,709
bark chips or whatever but I really

74
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:23,140
liked the idea of using live plants that

75
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:26,560
interact with the rhizosphere and enrich

76
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:28,268
the soil microbiology and retain

77
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,810
moisture at the same time it's just kind

78
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,430
of a win-win

79
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,079
yeah well I've heard you described

80
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,629
before is like creating a little little

81
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,950
rain forest below your plants that's

82
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:39,939
just you know it's just creating this

83
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:41,530
like smaller moisture cycle so the same

84
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:43,689
thing to you since since you are

85
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,568
approaching this less as a cultivator

86
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:49,829
and more as a die-hard plant scientist

87
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:54,009
what do you see is the advantages from

88
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:56,079
polyculture versus a monoculture so when

89
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:58,090
you talk about polyculture basically

90
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,549
what you're doing is you're introducing

91
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,829
many different kinds of plants along

92
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,290
with cannabis what we are introducing

93
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:08,139
here is diversity and as we all know

94
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:10,509
diversity is always good with

95
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:13,389
monoculture you are basically providing

96
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:15,280
the nutrition you are providing moisture

97
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:16,780
you are providing pest control you are

98
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,029
doing everything on your own

99
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,959
but when you have a poly culture you

100
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:25,179
have all the different members in that

101
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,589
farm or in that Grove that take care of

102
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,848
all these different aspects and

103
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:30,459
basically you are going to be hands-off

104
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:32,649
plants that are grown in such diverse

105
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:34,629
environment are more healthy because

106
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:36,370
they kind of get all the nutrients on

107
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:38,649
demand they are all communicating with

108
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,228
each other I have we have spoken about

109
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:43,509
this many times before is beneath the

110
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:45,039
ground you have the roots and there

111
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:46,839
constantly communicating with each other

112
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,390
if there is just monoculture they are

113
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:51,250
only going to be talking one language

114
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:52,629
you are introducing many different kinds

115
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,220
of plants now they're going to be

116
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:55,990
talking different languages they are all

117
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,270
capable of doing different things and

118
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,379
that leads to a plant which is more

119
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:02,379
healthy because it gets the right

120
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:04,870
nutrition at the right time correct

121
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:06,399
moisture and also these plants can fend

122
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,519
off pests better than what a monoculture

123
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,769
can and so in all aspects having a poly

124
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,449
culture is the way to go it's the best

125
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:15,250
way to go it's it sounds like what

126
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:18,189
you're describing is a situation where

127
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,199
you know when you have a monoculture you

128
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:21,879
only get the know-how of the cannabis

129
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,219
plant but if you're adding all these

130
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,750
other types of herbs they all do their

131
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,580
own jobs and they're all providing

132
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,319
different types of foods to the microbes

133
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:31,859
in the rhizosphere and so what you've

134
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:35,949
got is a you know a greater diversity of

135
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,139
folks making short work of a complex

136
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:41,050
array that's correct

137
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:42,969
and I have seen few groves where they

138
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,400
have not introduced a different plant

139
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:48,730
per se they're still growing cannabis

140
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:50,799
but they have different cultivars in

141
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:53,110
there so some cultivars are susceptible

142
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,350
to pests some are not some are more

143
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,480
efficient in nutrition utilization and

144
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,150
in those growers I have seen that there

145
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,590
might be some plants that might be

146
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:04,629
infested with powdery mildew but the

147
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:06,689
rest of the grow is completely free of

148
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:10,060
Patri mildew so here is a completely

149
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:12,250
organic style farming just because you

150
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,860
decided to go a poly culture way rather

151
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:19,379
than just grow one cultivar in a grow

152
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:22,410
facility fantastic so so Joshua you know

153
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:25,420
you know the two of you would would be

154
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,310
attracted to companion planning and

155
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,330
choosing other plants in different ways

156
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,519
right

157
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:31,959
Karuna might be coming at it from a

158
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:34,569
scientific level because she knows the

159
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,669
specific botany of other plants you have

160
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:38,500
over your you know multiple decades of

161
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,240
experience have been and have been

162
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,850
choosing them more from your intuition

163
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,240
right so so I'm curious from both of you

164
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,920
how best can all of us from from you

165
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,230
know folks who are home growing as

166
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,780
patients and tents so all the way up to

167
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,879
folks who are watching who are you know

168
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,549
scaling commercial what's the best way

169
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,980
to go about choosing this

170
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,350
Pacific plants that we're gonna install

171
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,390
into our polyculture oh sure I think if

172
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,790
if you went kind of my route which is

173
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,509
just throw anything at the beds and see

174
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,750
what happens

175
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,789
it's what I've just kind of done and I

176
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:16,230
have not been afraid to throw anything

177
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:19,050
in my beds and as I learn and as I

178
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:23,220
observe and we're learning things like

179
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,750
mustard and potentially broccoli like

180
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,610
when those leaves break down they could

181
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,980
actually have a negative effect on the

182
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,840
fungal components in the bed so once

183
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,939
again it speaks to diversity if you just

184
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,079
had all of those as your companion plant

185
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:40,259
that mustard was it man you're really

186
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:41,939
setting yourself up there so I just kind

187
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,529
of throw things at the beds and whatever

188
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,930
makes it makes it whatever doesn't

189
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:50,609
doesn't and and that's that's the route

190
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,959
I've taken and so far so good so you

191
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,420
know I think don't be afraid don't be

192
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,639
afraid to just experiment and and like

193
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:00,960
we've spoken on diversity is the key so

194
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,339
if one thing out of the 12 or 13 or 20

195
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,979
things you have in your bed isn't

196
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,869
working it's not such a big deal you

197
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,460
don't have a nightmare on your hands so

198
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,720
the one that you the one companion plant

199
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:11,789
you mentioned was actually one that you

200
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,680
don't recommend can you easily read just

201
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,480
recommend three for folks that if they

202
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,430
just go and they plug into their soil is

203
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,050
sure to be a win yeah absolutely comfrey

204
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,420
is a huge it's a great dynamic

205
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:24,090
accumulator when you leave it in the

206
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,550
beds and allow the leaves to cycle the

207
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:27,750
nutrients back in it takes it takes

208
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,389
nutrients that were previously

209
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,250
unavailable to the plant rearranges them

210
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:35,220
into a plant available form and when

211
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,129
those when those leaves get mulched back

212
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:40,800
in its ink incredible for your for your

213
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:42,539
gross so definitely comfrey is huge any

214
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,039
of the nitrogen fixers we were talking a

215
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,709
little bit about clover and threat

216
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,639
pressure and all these other things so

217
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,620
clovers alright you don't want to do a

218
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,830
whole lot of it or just be prepared for

219
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:55,019
thrips but clover is great legumes are

220
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:58,590
great nitrogen fixing things are really

221
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:01,769
good so you know I like comfrey clover

222
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,660
and nitrogen fixers and and rye grass

223
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:06,360
the grasses are really nice they do a

224
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:08,219
really good job at creating a dense map

225
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,990
for that moisture retention and then

226
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,050
when they die off in cannabis

227
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,850
well we get a during a two month or

228
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:16,979
three month flowering cycle depending on

229
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,409
what you what you got going what's

230
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,600
underneath the canopy will die off and

231
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:24,269
and lots of times that's those are my

232
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,920
decisions on what make what stays as if

233
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:28,019
it just didn't make it through the die

234
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,029
off I'm not too concerned about it I'll

235
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:32,039
replant something else I want to I want

236
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:34,110
to pinpoint one thing on there for for

237
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,689
anybody who's been following polyculture

238
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,000
or may have heard Joshua on the shaping

239
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,880
fire podcast you know folks are talking

240
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,889
about now that that clover may not be

241
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,689
the best because it attracts thrips and

242
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:46,949
that of course really disappointed me

243
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,840
because that's when I used this year

244
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,700
already and so now I have to pull out

245
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,050
all the clover but but but I'm hearing a

246
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,470
slightly different message from you

247
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:58,049
today which is clovers okay

248
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,519
in very small moderation so will you

249
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:01,439
kind of clarify that for me because I

250
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,029
thought we were not using clover at all

251
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,160
anymore well I think I was just mainly

252
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:07,379
speaking to the diversity part that if

253
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,789
you had I think a little bit of clovers

254
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:11,759
okay because if you're planning other

255
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:13,529
diverse a diverse network of companion

256
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,919
plants we were just talking about this

257
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,750
before coming on that that that pest

258
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:22,069
pressure that might be present from the

259
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:24,450
clover can be mitigated by the

260
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,550
attraction of beneficial insects from

261
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,100
other your other companion plants so you

262
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:32,129
really up your ante by having that

263
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,590
diversity so if you were all clover or

264
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:37,769
50% clover you're gonna have a battle on

265
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:39,420
your hands whereas if you have 5% clover

266
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:41,250
you're still gonna get nitrogen-fixing

267
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:43,740
it's you're still gonna have diversity

268
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,029
in the rhizosphere and and I think that

269
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,950
that pest pressure is gonna be less of

270
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:49,019
an issue right now I think that idea of

271
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,870
don't put a mono crop under your mono

272
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:53,189
crop is a good idea right so so whatever

273
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,539
you're gonna put under your mono crop so

274
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:58,320
it's not a mono crap make sure that it's

275
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:59,939
diverse so you have poly culture nice so

276
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,650
so Cremona your approach is entirely

277
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,620
different right you are thinking about

278
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:06,959
what's going on in the rhizosphere

279
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,269
and and targeting specific plants

280
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,860
because of your botany and and because

281
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,500
you're involved with studies it's it's a

282
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,060
lot more expensive for your mistakes or

283
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,980
or your you know if you find something

284
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:19,409
that doesn't work so so how do you go

285
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,840
about choosing plans that you would want

286
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:22,850
to do a poly culture with so when you

287
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,290
are trying to go

288
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,540
with the polyculture you have to first

289
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:29,360
decide what is it that you need the

290
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:32,599
polyculture for are you trying to plan

291
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,220
things to get rid of pests to attract

292
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,800
beneficial insects or you're just doing

293
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,990
it for the nutrition cycling clover is

294
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,359
an excellent example it is very good at

295
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,818
nitrogen cycling so you want clover at

296
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,860
the same time yes it can repel trips but

297
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:48,019
if you have high humidity it can

298
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,149
actually introduce powdery mildew in

299
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:52,730
your growth so be very careful so you

300
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:56,269
have to be aware of what is it that you

301
00:11:52,730 --> 00:12:00,500
want to have in your grow for most of

302
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:02,870
the grow that we have is indoors so best

303
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,549
pressure is low to begin with so I would

304
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,370
basically look for anything that can be

305
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:10,278
helpful in nutrient cycling so many of

306
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,990
the plants like you have alpha alpha you

307
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:14,208
have clover your many of them that can

308
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:17,120
cycle not just nitrogen they can cycle

309
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:19,338
calcium they can cycle sulfur you want

310
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,709
to have those kind of plants in your

311
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,319
grow facility so while you are providing

312
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,429
your NPK fertilizer and other

313
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:27,620
fertilizers these plants are

314
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:30,138
communicating with the cannabis plants

315
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,360
and providing what they need in proper

316
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:34,938
amounts so that is for nutrition cycling

317
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,829
if you want to plant some marigolds it's

318
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:39,198
very nice it will always get rid of all

319
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:42,528
your other pests so you have a really

320
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:45,078
organic garden pest free garden so what

321
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,818
you want to plant depends on exactly

322
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:48,948
what you want to do so that's my way of

323
00:12:46,818 --> 00:12:50,750
looking at it if you really have lot of

324
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:53,479
pests in your area you go for something

325
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:56,149
that can get rid of them go for alfalfa

326
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,528
that can attract ladybugs so you know

327
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:00,139
you can take care of your spider mites

328
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:03,230
so it's just that mix-and-match

329
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:05,419
the best way clover is good and but

330
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,339
again as a warning I mean if you are

331
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:08,740
living in a place where there is high

332
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:11,360
humidity

333
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,278
unfortunately clover can attract powdery

334
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,839
mildew so you may want to go for plants

335
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,669
that a little bigger and not trapping

336
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,980
much of moisture so look at your

337
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:20,588
environment look at what is native that

338
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,930
is another thing I should point out is

339
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:26,509
just because we say clover worked well

340
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:29,419
or particular plant worked well in

341
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:31,850
Portland Oregon does not mean it will

342
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:33,889
work well in Fort Collins Colorado or it

343
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,019
might work well in Florida so you will

344
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:38,570
have to look around what plant

345
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:40,250
is present in your surroundings go for

346
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,020
the native ones because they know how to

347
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,179
live how to thrive in that environment

348
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:46,039
so just be aware of what you're looking

349
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:48,620
for in your poly culture and that goes

350
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:51,559
ee so if you happen to be using native

351
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,089
soils too because as we know microbes

352
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:55,369
are bioregional right you're gonna have

353
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:57,649
different microbes that are occurring in

354
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,409
Colorado than we have here in Portland

355
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:01,970
and so you know choosing companion

356
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:03,199
plants that are local will probably

357
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,930
interact with the microbes more

358
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,140
successfully so so Corona you said that

359
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:11,028
you know marigold is a good example of

360
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:13,519
something that will repel pests right

361
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:16,759
I'm a big fan of using beneficial

362
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,519
insects right and so will the marigolds

363
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:22,429
also repel my beneficial insects and

364
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,708
have them leave the neighborhood so

365
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:26,689
quite often when you have these plants

366
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:29,599
that have got lot of flowers lot of

367
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:31,700
pollen it's they will attract many of

368
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,009
your predator bugs that can get rid of

369
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,839
your pests and one reason being is that

370
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:37,399
you need to have plants which I've got a

371
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,400
lot of flowers you have marigolds you

372
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,230
have Jabara daisies because they can

373
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,629
offer pollen so when you have your

374
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,360
predator mites operator insects that can

375
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:48,889
take care of a pest what if you don't

376
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,350
have pests these guys still need to feed

377
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:54,049
on something and so they can they have

378
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,330
source of protein for them then becomes

379
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:57,859
pollen so having these kind of flowering

380
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,650
plants in your grow is definitely

381
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,870
beneficial because they can provide some

382
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:05,149
sort of food source to your predator

383
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,519
bugs which are keeping your grove pest

384
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:09,379
free one more follow up on that before

385
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,389
we move on so you're saying that you

386
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:13,610
know choose the particular plants that

387
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:15,470
you want for particular jobs and then

388
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,060
and then you know determine how much

389
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,690
pest pressure you're gonna have and

390
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:25,328
choose based on that are there also

391
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:28,310
plants that are negatively allopathic

392
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:30,319
instead of positively like plants that

393
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:32,208
we might choose as a companion plant

394
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,550
which actually doesn't play nice with

395
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:36,229
cannabis there are many plants

396
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:37,969
especially the ones that kind of grow

397
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,139
tall you don't want them because then

398
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,360
they are going to take away all the

399
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:44,629
sunlight that your cannabis is supposed

400
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,970
to relieve is to get so definitely look

401
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:49,230
for plants that are shorter then your

402
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,149
cannabis plants don't look for plants

403
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,920
require very high maintenance like if

404
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:55,169
you are going to plant roses well they

405
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:57,089
look nice but you are spending more time

406
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:59,250
now supporting the rose then your

407
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,800
cannabis you don't want to do that so

408
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:04,440
look for plants that are low-maintenance

409
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:06,269
they are shorter in growth compared to

410
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,760
your cannabis and that way you can

411
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:10,500
assure that your plants are healthy your

412
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,319
cannabis is getting all the benefits

413
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,580
keep the focus on cannabis not the

414
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,800
companion plants but you need the

415
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,560
companion plants do I make sense yeah

416
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,829
sure sure and you know that is a it's

417
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,569
really easy to get distracted by your

418
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,700
companion plants because you know I've

419
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:28,500
had the cannabis plants in my Gardens

420
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,509
for years but but now that there's

421
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,370
companion plants not only is it more

422
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:34,259
beautiful their plants that I'm not as

423
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,149
familiar with right and as we all know

424
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,429
growing cannabis is is a gateway to

425
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:39,990
horticulture right and so now that I'm

426
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:41,669
growing my cannabis plants and having

427
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,259
some amount of success now I'm all

428
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:45,029
interested in these other companion

429
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:47,189
plants which which again most everybody

430
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,629
else is also calling weed right so it

431
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,920
seems like all the plants I'm interested

432
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:55,019
in are all weed one way or another so so

433
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,819
one of the challenges with polyculture

434
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,559
and getting it adopted by people is

435
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,300
people are all like like ah it doesn't

436
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,479
work for commercial it doesn't work for

437
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:05,399
scaling we can't we can't do it it takes

438
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,019
too much labour you've got to get too

439
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,170
much education I've heard all of this

440
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:12,809
stuff but then I I see Joshua's

441
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:15,120
Instagram right and I'm seeing you know

442
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:17,879
these these beautiful commercial rooms

443
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,369
that our companion planted kicking out

444
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,440
these fantastically yielding plants and

445
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,909
flowers so Joshua you know tell us a

446
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,330
little bit about that like you know help

447
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:30,330
me dispel the myth that Halle culture is

448
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:33,329
not for commercial scale yeah I think I

449
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:35,460
think there's we're battling kind of an

450
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:38,129
old way of thinking when it comes to

451
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,870
just agriculture in general and we

452
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:43,140
really we're really fighting that kind

453
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:45,419
of monoculture mentality and so lots of

454
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,310
people just don't really they don't

455
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,200
really understand that it's just as

456
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:51,029
simple as what I just got described

457
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,910
earlier it's as simple as just throwing

458
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:57,089
stuff in there and seeing what works and

459
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:58,440
then at scale it's there's really no

460
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:01,889
you're not really adding much labour

461
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:05,429
because you're just scattering seed or

462
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:08,160
you know plant er there and and your

463
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:11,730
observation doesn't really change much

464
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,610
so at scale it's just it's not an issue

465
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:17,009
we've found and and the benefit of the

466
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:20,399
healthier beds and the healthier system

467
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:22,589
and in general is just worth that extra

468
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,809
effort and may be worth some of the

469
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:27,928
anxiety you might have with investors or

470
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:29,490
if you're working for an owner that they

471
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:30,990
might not understand those things and

472
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,579
they're really other common questions

473
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,109
are like aren't they taking nutrients

474
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,879
and aren't they robbing nutrients from

475
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:37,798
the soil and so a lot of these things

476
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:42,600
people just need to be reassured that

477
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:44,450
that there's a process in place and it

478
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:46,859
doesn't really require a lot of

479
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,720
interaction on our part it's funny that

480
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,519
you would mention the you know the

481
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,410
investors or the owners because that's

482
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,609
exactly where I was gonna go next you

483
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,080
know you know we probably have a lot of

484
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:56,668
cultivators in the room you know folks

485
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,798
who are just patients like me who just

486
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,419
have a few plants but but I know that

487
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:01,440
there are you know you know commercial

488
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,870
cultivators in the room that are

489
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,600
responsible for a lot of lights right so

490
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:09,629
you know as a commercial cultivator who

491
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,459
has had to turn on your investors to

492
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,919
this right you know what do you

493
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,529
recommend as being the the the best

494
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,679
argument to take to the owners on why

495
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:22,649
they should do this radical thing yeah I

496
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,290
think fortunately I have a body of work

497
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:28,200
to reference from my home gross and so

498
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:30,298
I've I've got several years I've got

499
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,850
beds that are four years old so I have I

500
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:35,339
have a little bit of a reference point

501
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:39,480
that I can I can bring them product from

502
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:41,069
my fist my grow and and just really talk

503
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,279
with them and gain and get them

504
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:47,279
comfortable with the idea that there's a

505
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:48,119
natural process at work here and that we

506
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,069
really don't

507
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:53,729
maybe not need to necessarily fully

508
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:55,259
understand it to implement it and that's

509
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,230
kind of a scary statement to say to

510
00:19:55,259 --> 00:20:00,808
people who have hundreds of thousands of

511
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,990
dollars into a project but um you know

512
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:06,119
just I have such confidence in in that

513
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:09,089
natural order that it's really it's a

514
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:11,219
really easy sell now Karuna I know that

515
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:12,089
for you it is all about analytics and

516
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,829
spreadsheets right

517
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:17,369
and so you

518
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:19,740
with very close awareness on what is

519
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:22,159
actually happening in the plant so so

520
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:26,700
from from your perspective how do you

521
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:30,420
you know explain to people how poly

522
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,940
culture is increasing yields and and and

523
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,820
if there is more labor it's well worth

524
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,350
it that's a very good question and that

525
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:39,599
is something that comes to the top of

526
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:42,149
everybody's mind who wants to go to poly

527
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,819
culture they're like are you not adding

528
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,800
more plants which means that you need

529
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:50,759
more water for irrigation you need more

530
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,349
you know fertilizers added so I will go

531
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,660
back and say first thing first thing you

532
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:57,539
choose a plant that is not going to be

533
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,429
as demanding so go local what can thrive

534
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:01,920
in your local environment is something

535
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:04,140
you go choosing for as I said don't go

536
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,940
plant roses they are really demanding

537
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,590
you don't want them there so go for

538
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,210
something that again classifies as weed

539
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:10,949
what did we talk about we talked about

540
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,340
Dell we talked about marigold we talked

541
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:16,470
about gerbera daisies we talked about

542
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:17,939
lavender can you kill lavender plant no

543
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,500
I don't think so they just thrive they

544
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,330
thrive you know so you want a plant

545
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,690
which is not going to be demanding on

546
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:27,329
nutrition or your fertigation what do

547
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:30,299
you get in return from all that just

548
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:32,250
look at that now these plants are going

549
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:35,220
to be there they are going to be cycling

550
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:37,859
nutrients as as per what your cannabis

551
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,630
plants require so you in long-term are

552
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:41,428
going to have really healthy plants

553
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,380
which have gotten the right amount of

554
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:45,960
nutrients at the right time that's the

555
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,550
first thing secondly by introducing all

556
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,049
these different plants you are going to

557
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:50,579
get rid of all the pests that you're

558
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:52,829
thinking of right so no more spider

559
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:54,119
mites no more any other mites that are

560
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:57,089
coming and troubling your cannabis

561
00:21:54,119 --> 00:22:00,149
plants you don't have to use pesticides

562
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:02,879
we all are aware of the biggest problem

563
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:05,340
that pesticides pose I don't have to

564
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,410
introduce the audience to that kind of

565
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:10,079
problem we all know we are aware of it

566
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:13,110
so if you don't have any pesticide use

567
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,990
in your grow what you have are is an

568
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:17,759
organic but an organic yield completely

569
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:21,480
you are not going to be worrying about

570
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:23,879
this pest management or using use of

571
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,558
pesticide anymore and the plants in

572
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,210
general are going to be so healthy I

573
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:29,279
have seen it with my eyes

574
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,620
that you are finally going to have a

575
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,410
very good yield which is completely

576
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:37,679
organic pesticide free and it does not

577
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:40,110
require as much nutrition and irrigation

578
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,940
as people think if you think you are

579
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,659
going to require that much you're doing

580
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,430
something wrong

581
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,990
go back and take a look at can you

582
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,670
change your companion plant and come

583
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,308
back to a plant which is not as

584
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:52,680
demanding I've experienced that myself

585
00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:55,129
so I've just recently learned about poly

586
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,570
culture from Joshua actually when we did

587
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:59,760
when we did our podcast episode on it

588
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:02,700
and so so I decided all right let's

589
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,140
let's do this and so um the of course it

590
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,308
gives you an excuse to buy more seeds

591
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,530
right and who doesn't love a seed

592
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:10,379
catalog right and so that was cool and

593
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:13,250
then and then of course I over sowed so

594
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,840
my companion plants you know luckily the

595
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:19,470
the cannabis is taller so I'm in good

596
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:22,049
shape there but one thing that I noticed

597
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,450
is is you know being a novice growers I

598
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:27,269
still consider myself I have a tendency

599
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,860
for my soil to go hydrophobic right I

600
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:30,058
think most of us have had the experience

601
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:32,099
where you're gonna you're gonna hand

602
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:33,509
water and the water runs off the side of

603
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:35,579
the pot and down the end and out the

604
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:38,490
hole and you're like come on you know

605
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:42,178
and and so when you companion plant

606
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:45,089
there's all these new I don't know entry

607
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:47,100
points into the soil so now when I water

608
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:49,349
it's not sliding down the side and going

609
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:51,808
down the side of the of the pot it's

610
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:54,539
actually staying there being held by the

611
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,569
other plants and then soaking in and for

612
00:23:54,539 --> 00:24:00,299
me that was the the the quickest

613
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:03,029
discovery I had and and my soil is so

614
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:04,558
clearly healthier so now you've both hit

615
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:06,629
on something that I hear all the time

616
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,549
people say alright if I've got all these

617
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:11,730
companion plants though they're stealing

618
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:12,899
nutrition from the cannabis plant and

619
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,058
you know there's there's two different

620
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,700
ways to address that there's the actual

621
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:19,769
soil amendments that are can be

622
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,830
expensive that that perhaps these plants

623
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:26,039
are using and then also is it literally

624
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:28,139
taking from the plant so so so Colonel

625
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,690
let's start with you will you address

626
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,580
the the nutrition whether or not you

627
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,000
actually have to increase it and and by

628
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:35,879
how much

629
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,769
so but there do you have to increase

630
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,420
nutrition I'll go to that question first

631
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:40,650
right away no I don't think so

632
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,390
and let me explain

633
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:45,120
what goes on so so far we have been

634
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:47,640
discussing what goes on on the top when

635
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,469
you're growing so what is visual what we

636
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,870
are completely forgetting is there is a

637
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,960
whole ecosystem down there in the soil

638
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:56,969
and each plant is quite capable of

639
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,250
attracting its own set of microbes that

640
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:00,779
it likes to play with and these plant

641
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,849
and microbes they communicate with each

642
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:05,160
other the microbes are very good at

643
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:07,409
fending off root pathogens they are very

644
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,840
good at solubilizing nutrients they are

645
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,960
very good at providing enzymes and other

646
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,519
metabolites that boost plant growth and

647
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,440
they don't steal from each other let me

648
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,389
tell you that if anything they provide

649
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,670
each other with healthy nutrients so you

650
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:23,100
have cannabis which can attract its own

651
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:25,980
set of soil microbes in its rhizosphere

652
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:28,679
and it's doing its job but the next

653
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,720
plant next to it is has its own set of

654
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,580
microbes that can provide a completely

655
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,190
new set of metabolites that is now

656
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:37,169
available to your cannabis plants so at

657
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,720
the end of the day your cannabis plant

658
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:42,120
is going to benefit from having any sort

659
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,230
of diversity in the soil these plants

660
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:45,209
don't steal from each other

661
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:48,410
they actually enrich each other so

662
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:51,630
that's a very good case for having

663
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,860
diversity in your group rather than just

664
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,480
having a monoculture the way you

665
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:56,399
describe it I want to move in myself

666
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,529
right that sounds like a community I

667
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,390
want to be a part of so Joshua same kind

668
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:02,970
of question to you right because the the

669
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:05,280
the the the science sounds believable

670
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,480
but when in the end it's all about you

671
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,579
know when the rubber hits the road does

672
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,289
this actually work and and you work

673
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:12,299
every day in this kind of environment so

674
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:14,819
so what are your experiences with

675
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:17,609
nutrition and water and the potential

676
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:19,470
from the companion plants to to starve

677
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:22,139
out the cannabis plant sure sure she

678
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,690
pretty much nailed it clearly and it's

679
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,930
basically what my what I would add is

680
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:32,070
that a properly amended soil or properly

681
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:34,769
amended garden is gonna have plenty of

682
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:38,909
available nutrient for everything there

683
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:41,430
and so I think I don't think of say my

684
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:43,740
beets as taking nutrients from my

685
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:45,930
cannabis I think of the beets as taking

686
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,930
nutrients from the nutrient pool and

687
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,610
then if I'm not taking those things out

688
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,750
of the garden and leaving them and

689
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,099
letting them cycle

690
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,930
those nutrients are kind of staying

691
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:57,659
there there's there's no subtraction

692
00:26:54,930 --> 00:27:02,190
happening really when you when you take

693
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:05,490
time into account so you know diversity

694
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:07,529
of course is key and I think that just

695
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,450
leaving the things in there to cycle

696
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:12,899
those nutrients back you're not going to

697
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,759
experience a loss one thing that I

698
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,280
didn't understand at first when I first

699
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:20,279
planted my polyculture is that you know

700
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,009
being brought up NPK and just dumped it

701
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:25,049
on the plant and hope for the best right

702
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:27,150
once once you realize that that there

703
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:30,119
are huge advantages to using a living

704
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:33,480
soil and that we then choose to feed the

705
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:36,089
soil instead of the plant I think it's

706
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,589
pretty surprising to realize that the

707
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:39,720
microbes that are there that we're

708
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:42,389
trying to support are actually making

709
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,839
plant food I found that I'm actually

710
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:48,180
having to add less amendments and top

711
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,909
dress after the fact because it's it's

712
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,580
once I've revved up this engine it's

713
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:56,519
actually becoming self-replicating

714
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:58,109
because the microbes are doing their

715
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,289
jobs once you kind of get the pump

716
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:04,619
primed so so Karuna and I would like you

717
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:07,559
to go into the science part so like go

718
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:08,909
over my head Ailey's and speak to the

719
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,809
people who are more familiar with this

720
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:14,840
what is going on at the microbial level

721
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:18,269
that is causing these microbes to

722
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:20,189
excrete these foods that other microbes

723
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:24,869
use like give us a snapshot of how that

724
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:28,830
works so as the plant grows in just in a

725
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:31,439
single 24-hour cycle the plant exudates

726
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:32,549
are given up through its roots right so

727
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,620
the plant when is doing is

728
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:36,089
photosynthesis making food but at

729
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:37,379
nighttime it is going to let those

730
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:40,230
exudate out from the roots

731
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,060
now those exudates we might think okay

732
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,309
it's an exudate but that exudate is

733
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:47,419
actually food for the microbes is

734
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:49,799
basically saying here is the food and

735
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,900
that food is so specific for a few

736
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,519
microbes or they get attracted and when

737
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,230
they come to eat that food from the

738
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,089
plant in exchange they are going to give

739
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,950
the plant something which is going to be

740
00:28:57,089 --> 00:29:01,919
a metabolite which is going to boost the

741
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,900
growth in a plant this is very cyclic so

742
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,029
you have different group of microbes

743
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,970
doing different things

744
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:09,950
throughout the day so this is one set of

745
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,539
microbes now you have second set of

746
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,789
microbes doing the same thing with other

747
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:15,200
plants after your you're done with

748
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:17,089
harvest you're saying okay now the

749
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,950
plants are already gone what do these

750
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,990
microbes do they don't perish they're

751
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:22,430
still there what they are going to do is

752
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,990
they're going to take rest of the roots

753
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,670
that are left there they're going to

754
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:27,200
decompose it so they are going to take

755
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:29,539
all the nutrients they're going to break

756
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,580
it down and they don't get washed away

757
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:33,079
they're going to be there so next time

758
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:36,169
when you are going to start with your

759
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:38,269
grow again these nutrients are already

760
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:40,009
available and like you said you over a

761
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:43,339
period of time you have to use less and

762
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:45,440
less and less of added fertilizer to get

763
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:46,699
much better plant you add less

764
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,950
fertilizer but you get much more

765
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,319
healthier plants so micro behaving

766
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:54,170
microbial diversity in the soil is the

767
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,730
key to having healthy grow and the more

768
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,350
different plants you have the more

769
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:59,539
different microbes you have in the soil

770
00:29:57,349 --> 00:30:01,879
and that will keep your grow very

771
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:05,509
healthy fantastic and also that is a

772
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,400
great time to plug no-till because as

773
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:10,789
we've all realized after you put all

774
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,490
this effort into infusing all of this

775
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:16,009
life into soil and and you're you're

776
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:17,660
using less of your your bottled

777
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:18,829
nutrients hopefully less and less of

778
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,690
them all the time

779
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:23,839
you know eventually you end up with this

780
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:25,670
beautiful living soil and it smells good

781
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:27,199
and there's worms and you're you know

782
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:29,210
occasionally you'll get mushrooms and

783
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,830
that's all great and then but then we

784
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:33,110
were all brought up to like you know get

785
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:35,990
rid of your soil sterilize the pots and

786
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:38,569
start with brand new soil so Joshua you

787
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,880
know you are a big proponent of no-till

788
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:43,579
and you've got these these great indoor

789
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,100
beds that you just plant on again more

790
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:48,769
and more which would you break out what

791
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:52,639
what your growing cycle looks like when

792
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:55,789
you are using no-till yeah it's an it is

793
00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:00,259
incredibly simple a it's so simple that

794
00:30:55,789 --> 00:31:02,119
I feel guilty accepting you know

795
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:04,670
appraised at the end it's really it's

796
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:08,779
really so so simple if you have your

797
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:10,640
beds nurtured in such a way you should

798
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:13,250
be able to just plant your plants in

799
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,960
adjust the light cycle and let it go and

800
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,329
we talked about this too about just

801
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,509
getting out of the way like there's so

802
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:20,579
much happening

803
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:23,549
that is independent of our involvement

804
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:26,819
once we insert the plant into a healthy

805
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:29,519
living soil that meddling it just brings

806
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:33,000
variables and variables I try to avoid

807
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:35,549
them like the plague and so you know I

808
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,420
think living soil really enabled me to

809
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:41,789
look at my cultivation practices and

810
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:44,670
eliminate just a myriad of these

811
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:47,849
variables that I was dealing with in the

812
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:49,470
15 or 16 years previous so you know I

813
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:51,750
think I think no-till is one of those

814
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:54,690
kind of buzz words in the community

815
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:57,058
right now and and for the most part

816
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:59,730
people understand it but people really

817
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:01,259
don't are having trouble wrapping their

818
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,670
head around the fact that you really

819
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:04,379
don't have to do anything that you've

820
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,990
got to kind of separate your ego and

821
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,120
your you're kind of mad scientist self

822
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:11,190
and just separate yourself from it and

823
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,069
let let that process play itself out and

824
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,539
just observe and that's that's what

825
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:18,149
really has turned me on about no-till

826
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:20,250
and why I've kind of become evangelical

827
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:23,130
about it is it changed me in so many

828
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:25,470
ways and my cultivation style and and

829
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,730
the quality of medicine and the quality

830
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,410
of products that we've seen even just

831
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:30,900
the quality of my produce at home when I

832
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:33,509
switched you know my vegetable garden to

833
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,450
a no-till type regenerative system it's

834
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:37,829
just it's hands down better I think I

835
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,120
think you nailed it too and you said

836
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:41,819
that you know it's one thing to

837
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,889
understand the definition of no-till but

838
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:45,419
another thing to like believe it right

839
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:47,429
because it it definitely sounds too good

840
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,500
to be true right because the labor

841
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:51,509
savings is incredible you're saving all

842
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,819
this money on soil and every time you do

843
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:56,460
a new cycle your soil is already primed

844
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:58,678
and ready to rock right so so let's talk

845
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,049
real brass tacks here for a second so so

846
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,300
you've got this no-till bed and you've

847
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:05,700
just harvested your cannabis plants and

848
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:08,308
you've got some amount of companion

849
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,080
plants that are still going what are you

850
00:33:08,308 --> 00:33:11,339
going to do next like specifically I

851
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,519
want you to talk about like root balls

852
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:16,889
and stuff okay sure yeah so you spoke

853
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,440
earlier about as the beds mature you

854
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:21,090
need to add less and less dry nutrient

855
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,190
and mineral content and that's really

856
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:24,058
true now I'm in my beds at home or about

857
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:29,009
four years old

858
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:31,750
I only remember cycle so after if it's a

859
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:35,079
real mentor I never

860
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:38,230
my cash crop the cannabis in the beds I

861
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:40,029
just kind of I've been wanting to

862
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,798
illustrate that that cannabis can be

863
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:43,509
grown with water only with no other

864
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:45,429
inputs and you can get the whole cycle

865
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:48,038
you're not sacrificing yields you're

866
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:50,288
getting a better quality so I don't do

867
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:53,079
any kind of top dressing or Riya mending

868
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:55,058
during that cycle and if it's an off

869
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:58,960
cycle I won't even reinvent I'll just

870
00:33:55,058 --> 00:34:01,690
harvest the plants cut the the stock at

871
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,909
the root at the soil level and just

872
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,860
leave it and as she described earlier it

873
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:08,260
just gets consumed by the the soil

874
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:11,019
biology it cycles the nutrients that are

875
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,869
locked up in the roots and I just plant

876
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:15,969
the new the new crop right next to the

877
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:19,030
old one and after about three cycles

878
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:21,368
sometimes two it's just completely gone

879
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:26,349
there's there's nothing left it's so

880
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:28,329
strange to see an old cut plant we're in

881
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:29,769
the bed it looks like as somebody who

882
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:31,840
likes to eat but I like to keep really

883
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:33,789
clean gardens it looks like like you

884
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,710
know heresy right there you know that

885
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:37,449
should be gone and and it takes a while

886
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,659
to realize that you know like nature's

887
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:42,908
not clean and and you know when we see

888
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:46,179
tree trunks and decaying plant matter

889
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:47,679
that's part of this whole cycle whereas

890
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,960
I have traditionally wanted to like

891
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:53,280
clean it all up but but I think it's

892
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,358
well to your point where we a lot of

893
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,430
polyculture well heck gardening at all

894
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:02,230
is just getting our egos out of the way

895
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:04,509
yeah so um so this idea you know adding

896
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:06,490
commanding plants is fun right and so

897
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:09,700
I'm curious to hear from both of you you

898
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:11,259
know how will the companion plants do in

899
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:12,879
this environment as well cuz really the

900
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,460
companion plants are there to serve the

901
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,410
rhizosphere and the cannabis plant but

902
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,900
it'd be really cool if they would you

903
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:24,069
know bloom or or or maybe even produce

904
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:28,450
food how are they going to you know work

905
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:30,490
on on an 18-6 you know or so light cycle

906
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:32,710
during veg that then gets shifted to

907
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:34,419
twelve twelve we know our favorite plant

908
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,210
likes that but I'm sure that some of the

909
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,740
companion plants are like whoa you know

910
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:41,710
so so how should we think about that

911
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:43,779
when you start pruning very funny and I

912
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,019
hear this question so many times about

913
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:49,310
what will the campaign

914
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:52,909
plants do 1212 cycle so cannabis has

915
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:57,170
been growing outside the grow for as

916
00:35:52,909 --> 00:35:59,179
many years as we all know and if you

917
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,680
look at any outdoor growth it doesn't

918
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:02,750
happen that the plant decides okay

919
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:05,719
twelve hours let's switch the light off

920
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:08,360
we got to bloom that doesn't happen so

921
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,799
if your companion plants are definitely

922
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,750
going to adapt if it is an outdoor grow

923
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,940
cycle they will be perfectly fine

924
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:15,260
because it does not happen that then the

925
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:18,260
light is going to be switched off right

926
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:21,530
like what we do for indoor grows in the

927
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:25,760
indoor grow again your focus is on

928
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:27,950
cannabis not the companion plant so when

929
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,560
you switch the light they might take a

930
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:33,169
little bit longer to blow maybe and

931
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,659
that's perfectly fine because your focus

932
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:37,460
is the cannabis not your companion plant

933
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:39,230
unless you want here you know

934
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,460
Yarbrough Daisy to bloom and you don't

935
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,420
want you don't care about a cannabis

936
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,960
that's a different story

937
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:47,150
then we cater to that population but at

938
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,889
any point you focus on your cannabis

939
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:50,869
plant and the rest of your companion

940
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:53,359
plants will definitely adapt and it will

941
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:55,369
not be a big issue at all fantastic now

942
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,740
Joshua I know that you've gone so far is

943
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:59,210
too intermingled food plants which I

944
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:02,000
think it's great to be able to get both

945
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:03,500
smoke and food out of the same bed like

946
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,820
like we're talking about efficiencies

947
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,860
here so why don't you talk a little bit

948
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,510
about about that process and how you

949
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,920
chose the foods and maybe make some

950
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:12,020
suggestions people might want to try if

951
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,300
they want to get stuff out - yeah sure I

952
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:17,929
mean I think I think when I decided to

953
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:21,080
introduce food into the poly culture it

954
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:23,299
was mainly to diversify what the soil

955
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:26,599
microbiology and the worms had access to

956
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:29,240
I really don't I try not to take much

957
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:31,099
out of my beds for that reason I like

958
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:35,629
just like those nutrients to cycle back

959
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:38,119
and so my experience has been to really

960
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:40,820
not consume much of anything and just

961
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:42,920
leave it to the beds it's it's it's my

962
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:46,910
I'm growing it for the soil microbiology

963
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:49,970
and and and talking on the light cycle

964
00:37:46,909 --> 00:37:52,399
thing we had we I've had a one

965
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:54,859
particular broccoli plant that's been in

966
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,619
my beds for two years and is never

967
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,340
flowered it's just constantly in this

968
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:00,469
this

969
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:02,329
native state and I'm thinking that that

970
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:04,250
has something to do with the light cycle

971
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:06,799
and and maybe some of the diffused light

972
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:11,210
but back to your your question as I

973
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,920
typically don't I don't grow food for my

974
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:15,050
consumption in the beds it's it's

975
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:19,450
basically just to kind of have a diverse

976
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:22,940
array of things to go back into the soil

977
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:24,379
and certainly companion planning food is

978
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,530
a whole lot easier if you're working

979
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,570
outdoors too right

980
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:33,110
Nicholas Mahmood down at a green source

981
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:34,490
in Wolf Creek Oregon he's by far the

982
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,440
person I've seen that it's done the best

983
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:39,139
I mean under his companion plants you've

984
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,360
got you've got beds of straw and then

985
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:43,460
under those he's got potatoes and he's

986
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,260
got artichokes coming up and and it's

987
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,510
amazing because as he goes through and

988
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:50,630
gives you a tour of the farm he's also

989
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:52,120
pulling out lunch right and I think it

990
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:55,099
makes for a really unique experience

991
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:56,929
both both reminding us that the cannabis

992
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,880
plant is a naturally occurring plant it

993
00:38:56,929 --> 00:39:03,559
does not have to be separate from nature

994
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:05,780
it is it is of nature and and also you

995
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:07,969
know especially when margins are so

996
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,769
tight here in Oregon you know if you can

997
00:39:07,969 --> 00:39:11,839
also get lunch out of it that's that's a

998
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:14,480
win as well right yeah I really I gotta

999
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,220
say I have the deepest respect for

1000
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,190
GreenSource Gardens they are they are

1001
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:20,839
literally the tip of the spear and and a

1002
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,760
shining example of regenerative

1003
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:26,360
agriculture and I think I think we all

1004
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,950
need to look to them as as that example

1005
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,510
and try to emulate it as much as

1006
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:31,909
possible and I think it's important to I

1007
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,380
I always say GreenSource and Nikolas

1008
00:39:31,909 --> 00:39:36,259
because he's the guy that I interviewed

1009
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,789
but but his wife Elizabeth or deserves

1010
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:40,220
just as much credit it's their

1011
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:42,110
partnership together you know bouncing

1012
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:43,789
things off each other you know both of

1013
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:46,519
them educating and then bringing

1014
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:49,369
bringing information back to each other

1015
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:51,050
and to to Jessie who's also on the farm

1016
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:54,199
you know it's a it's a real team effort

1017
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:56,269
just like polyculture right so so

1018
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:58,009
Colonel let's let's finish up with you

1019
00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:00,590
on a similar question from the science

1020
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:03,470
side you know if somebody did want to

1021
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:05,269
companion plant food what should they

1022
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:07,989
look for in a plant that's going to

1023
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:11,329
thrive food wise alongside cannabis

1024
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:12,079
again as I said when you're going for

1025
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:15,219
your companion

1026
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,809
focus should be cannabis not food plant

1027
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:19,879
so plant something that is going to be

1028
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:22,519
small and not going to be really tall

1029
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,780
you don't want to be planting big style

1030
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:26,030
Tomatoes

1031
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:28,220
you know you that require more care so

1032
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:30,800
plant something that will be shorter

1033
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:32,659
than cannabis plant will not take so

1034
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,880
much of nutrition I mean you don't have

1035
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:37,069
to keep fertilizing your companion plant

1036
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,099
rather than cannabis so those kind of

1037
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:41,960
any plan that fits that criteria and is

1038
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:43,759
quite local it can thrive in your local

1039
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,090
environment go for that kind of food

1040
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,390
plan

1041
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:50,960
so we're thinking lettuces radishes what

1042
00:40:47,389 --> 00:40:52,489
else you have lettuce radish alfalfa of

1043
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,340
course you don't eat alfalfa but then

1044
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:58,279
that is a good one to have there you

1045
00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:00,740
have dill you have basil many of these

1046
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:03,590
herbs they're very good I mean they look

1047
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:06,289
nice they are very good pest repellents

1048
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:09,140
and they also help with their shallow

1049
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:11,360
root system they can hold on to soil so

1050
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:14,359
you have less of erosion less of

1051
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,130
materials kind of just washing out what

1052
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,620
are the plants can I think of right

1053
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,900
doing mint is a very good one I

1054
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:22,309
completely agreement will also repel so

1055
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,110
many other pests that are present in

1056
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:25,820
your garden so there are so many herbs

1057
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,620
herbs isn't something that you can never

1058
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,590
go wrong with so that is the first thing

1059
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:32,239
that you go for I know he does a lot of

1060
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:34,910
beets I just heard from him and I was

1061
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:37,489
impressed about it so yeah beets you can

1062
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:40,129
go for beets apparently anything that is

1063
00:41:37,489 --> 00:41:43,099
below the ground or just little bit

1064
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:45,769
about the ground not competing for Sun

1065
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:47,269
space with cannabis is preferred I love

1066
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,980
the idea that that you went towards

1067
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:51,559
culinary herbs right because I'm

1068
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:53,659
thinking you know herbal plants and

1069
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:56,299
weeds not something that I'm gonna go

1070
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:59,269
and snip and go throw on some scallions

1071
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:01,550
and avocado with soy sauce right the

1072
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:04,400
idea of having an actual culinary herb

1073
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:06,800
garden below my plant sounds easy and

1074
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,539
delicious at the same time so we're all

1075
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,370
for that so it looks like that we are

1076
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:12,529
out of time please put your hands

1077
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:15,909
together for dr. Khurana Chari and

1078
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,910
jessica schewe seems like

1079
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:21,539
