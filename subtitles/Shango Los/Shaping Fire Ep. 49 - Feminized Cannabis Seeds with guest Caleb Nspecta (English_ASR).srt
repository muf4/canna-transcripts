2
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:10,589
for pretty much everybody in cannabis

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,798
except seed makers male Canada's plans

4
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:15,780
are a scourge for breeders male cannabis

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,368
plants are joyful thing and essential to

6
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,528
the advancement of cannabis genetics and

7
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:22,050
the creation of regular seed but for

8
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,329
nearly all hobby medical and commercial

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,490
growers though males are a pain in the

10
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,059
ass if you find a male in your garden

11
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:29,129
too late

12
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:31,140
he will pollinate your entire crop and

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,879
decrease its potency and ease of smoking

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,579
because the flowers will all be full of

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,890
seeds feminized seeds play an important

16
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,899
role in cannabis nowadays feminized

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,420
means that just about every seed will

18
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,460
produce a female plant for home growers

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,140
it means less room wasted on plants that

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,299
will eventually show that they are male

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,270
and for commercial growers it means less

22
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,558
risk of pollen in their fields if you

23
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,390
want to learn about cannabis health

24
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,829

25
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,719

45
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:36,539
inspector from CSI humble caleb and his

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,520
family have lived in Humboldt County for

47
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,790
over a hundred years for the last 40

48
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,500
years

49
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,210
three generations of his family have

50
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,310
cultivated extraordinary sensimilla

51
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,919
cannabis in Humboldt Mendocino in

52
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,329
Trinity counties caleb reaches way back

53
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,189
and works with significant strains

54
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:52,078
recreating them in new and interesting

55
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:53,849
ways today we're gonna talk with him

56
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,399
about modern feminized seeds

57
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:57,298
welcome to the show Caleb good to be

58
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,218
here right on man

59
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,259
so let's start by getting a little

60
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:02,489
better understanding of the tech the

61
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,828
terminology we're gonna use today

62
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,420
because you know when most people are

63
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:07,679
talking about the kinds of seeds were

64
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,899
going to talk about today a lot of

65
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,000
people just use the words feminized but

66
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,530
you know the more I study it and the

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,530
more I listen to people

68
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:20,039
who actually breed feminized seeds more

69
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,289
of them use the term selfed and and you

70
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,659
know then people are talking about s1

71
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:27,689
seeds their first generation of Femmes

72
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,030
and and on your seed packets they say s1

73
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,889
so would you kind of get us all in the

74
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,150
same page by talking about the

75
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:35,519
difference in terminology between

76
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,409
feminized seeds and selfed seeds and

77
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,900
what that all means

78
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:43,229
well basically selfed

79
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:50,659
only refers to s ones which is a plant

80
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:50,659
cross to itself feminized seeds is

81
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,500
generally it encompasses selfed as well

82
00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:00,509
but it also covers all the feminized

83
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,969
hybrids when you know say for example

84
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:06,539
you reverse one female and you cross it

85
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:09,568
to you know x y&amp;z female those are all

86
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:13,739
feminized you know hybrids hmm you you

87
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:18,359
don't refer to the hybrids as selfed or

88
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:21,599
you know s ones obviously you you only

89
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,610
refer to the the individual you know

90
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,449
plant that was soft on to itself as

91
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,709
solved

92
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:31,530
I see so so you know I cross for a self

93
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,769
seed would be for example chem dog by

94
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,500
chem dog versus versus chem dog versus

95
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:42,299
whatever else you're gonna cross it with

96
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,669
yep all right so I see so so so s1 sir

97
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,849
selfs are actually a subset of this

98
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:50,250
bigger tent that is feminized seeds all

99
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:53,430
right go ahead and you know to add to

100
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:57,030
that feminized seeds got a bad rep early

101
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:02,849
on because the the selfed while they

102
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:06,750
might be the closest best example of a

103
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:09,989
particular plant you know just crossing

104
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:14,669
it to itself there's a lot of inbreeding

105
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:18,389
going on in that and so anywhere from 40

106
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:22,589
to 60% of those seeds generally I just

107
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:25,740
say 50% are going to be inbred and just

108
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:27,359
kind of throw away plants whereas with

109
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,759
the hybrids you

110
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,340
you get the same hybrid vigor from a

111
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,360
feminized hybrid as you do from a normal

112
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:38,388
hybrid so you know people kind of

113
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,218
misconstrued the whole self thing with

114
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:43,680
feminized seeds in general when that

115
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:45,658
wasn't even a fact right on cool so I

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,189
want to talk more about the the early

117
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:50,129
days of feminized and the bad reputation

118
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:53,990
but before we leave S ones and selfed

119
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:57,120
seeds when when you when you self a seed

120
00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:01,168
or when you self a plant you're doing

121
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:05,490
that too you know one expression of one

122
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:09,508
Fino of that line will will the seeds

123
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:12,210
produced by selfing a plant give you

124
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:14,669
snapshots of all the fee nosed available

125
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:17,549
in that line or where they all be that

126
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:21,508
exact Fino of the plant yourself in oh

127
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:23,460
you will rarely get the exact plant it's

128
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:26,879
basically going to encompass all the

129
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:30,568
genetics contained in the DNA of that

130
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:34,319
plant and depending on how stable that

131
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:38,879
plant is it can be you know fairly tight

132
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,468
to extremely broad a lot of people think

133
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,500
they're gonna get an exact replica of

134
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:45,478
the mother and that's not true at all

135
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,360
you're gonna get everything from the

136
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:51,180
absolute worst inbred genetic that that

137
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,870
DNA contains you know in the recessive

138
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:57,689
traits to the absolute best which often

139
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,668
times in s ones you find stuff that's

140
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:00,959
way better than the mother plant that

141
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:03,120
was soft in the first place

142
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,668
Wow right on so so what I'm gathering

143
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,408
from that is that you know when you buy

144
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:12,990
a packet s ones that's really a pack for

145
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:15,120
somebody who is planning on you know

146
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,218
digging breeding or looking for fee

147
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,418
knows it's not necessarily you know a

148
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:24,509
stabilized pack that somebody would buy

149
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:26,189
because they want they want they want to

150
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,689
know what they're gonna get right with s

151
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:29,038
ones you really don't know what you're

152
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:31,978
gonna get if you if you're gonna buy a

153
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:34,228
pack of seven or ten seeds you may have

154
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:37,860
you know seven or ten different

155
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:40,528
expressions of the line absolutely yes

156
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,220
oh right on okay good alright so then

157
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:42,810
let's let's

158
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,580
back to the bad reputation that

159
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,810
feminised seeds have had for a long time

160
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:50,039
so so because I work so much with

161
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,530
patients you know I realized early on

162
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,129
how useful feminized seeds can be for

163
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:59,339
patients because you know they're it's

164
00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:01,439
so sad to see a patient pop ten seeds

165
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:03,779
and you know you know if you're gonna

166
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,790
pop a hundred or more seeds you you were

167
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:07,829
probably gonna generally see fifty fifty

168
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,660
male and female but at such a small

169
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:14,279
number above ten you could get any ratio

170
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,350
statistically and an occasional you'll

171
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,449
you'll find a you know a patty or you

172
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,370
know ten seeds and you'll get like six

173
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,529
or seven males and four you know a

174
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:26,430
breeder that would be fun but for for a

175
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:28,709
patient they're like oh my God all my

176
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,959
resources and all this soil and all this

177
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:33,089
space I just used for you know these six

178
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,339
or seven males that I'm gonna call and

179
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:36,959
so when I realize that oh my god we

180
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:39,929
could just get these people into

181
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,629
feminized seeds and all 10 will be

182
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,730
females I'm like hell yeah like I'm want

183
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,050
this but but as I told people I was

184
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,780
getting into this you know folks were

185
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,699
like oh man feminized seeds like suck

186
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,859
and they don't have the vigor and they

187
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,349
Herm on me and all all this kind of

188
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,449
stuff and and but then if you ask him if

189
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,939
you like really kind of drill down you

190
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:02,789
find out that either a they haven't

191
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:04,800
tried a feminized seed in years or be

192
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:08,069
like they heard it from their bro you

193
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,040
know and so you know give us a little

194
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:14,310
context if you will about you know the

195
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,230
how feminized seeds have gotten better

196
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,300
you know since they started showing up

197
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:21,660
in the scene and and what your thoughts

198
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,310
are on today's femme seeds versus the

199
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,890
the stuff that where people are

200
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,290
originally popping I think a lot of

201
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:31,889
people were really focused on just the S

202
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:35,460
ones early on and so they had a lot of

203
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:38,668
those recessive inbred genetics coming

204
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,889
out and so when you popped your films

205
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:45,269
you ended up with you know like I said

206
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:48,059
about 50% just weak inbred plants well

207
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:51,210
when folks started realizing wait you

208
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:54,969
need to you know make you know hybrids

209
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:59,170
of it then you you get this you know

210
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,889
that vigor back and then of course the

211
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:02,318
herm thing

212
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:05,470
it's definitely valid I mean

213
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:12,188
unfortunately you know in today's you

214
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:15,459
know a cannabis landscape most of the

215
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:21,389
popular stuff is a result of no

216
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:23,619
selection and you know just you know

217
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:25,990
hermaphrodite a plant onto hermaphrodite

218
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,318
a plant you know and so on and so on and

219
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:33,278
so you definitely you know will get a

220
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:38,159
certain percentage of hermaphrodites in

221
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:39,970
feminized seeds but that also depends on

222
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,818
their environment

223
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,990
you know in indoors it's it's gonna be

224
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:47,708
higher

225
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:50,649
you know outdoors you know most of the

226
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:52,989
times it's gonna be non-existent you

227
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:56,500
know unless you really really stress

228
00:09:52,990 --> 00:10:00,068
something out or the genetics that you

229
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:03,458
know the FEM feminine were really prone

230
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:06,159
to hermaphroditic so what's the variable

231
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:10,628
between indoor and outdoor that causes

232
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:20,049
the the her mning more indoors you know

233
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:23,550
I don't know I honestly you know I mean

234
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:27,370
indoors where we're putting such extreme

235
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:29,828
stress on a plant you know taking it out

236
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:32,980
out of its natural environment you know

237
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:35,078
exposing it to this that the other a lot

238
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,149
of times you know light leaks you know I

239
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:39,669
mean not everybody has just you know

240
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:42,490
light tight rooms so something as simple

241
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:44,860
as that you know easy to you know stress

242
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,568
something out and I would also think

243
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,019
that you know since so much of this

244
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:52,509
reputation is built on forum posts you

245
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:54,759
know when you're indoors you are

246
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:56,470
stressing a plant you know like an

247
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,938
Olympian you know it's ahead it's

248
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:02,199
healthy and thriving but it is under

249
00:10:57,938 --> 00:11:04,419
stress even at its best right at the the

250
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:06,099
best-run room and you know the majority

251
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:07,919
of people are not running you know like

252
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,230
put together rooms

253
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,208
and so so just about everybody is taking

254
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,850
a plant that is already stressed and

255
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:17,128
then and then stressing it out more by

256
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,689
you know changing their inputs or you

257
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:22,109
know their power goes out or whatever

258
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:24,298
whatever and so so you've got that that

259
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:28,379
added challenge indoors as well

260
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:31,438
yeah and you know honestly I I've always

261
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:34,139
I've always thought that the roots are

262
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:37,009
kind of the core to you know whether a

263
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:40,709
plant will hermaphrodite or not and

264
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:44,759
indoors you're most people are generally

265
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:47,219
using smaller pots you know three

266
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,749
gallons five gallons whatever you know

267
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,839
compared to you know outdoors where

268
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:54,720
you're using 20 100 200 gallon oars and

269
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,359
when you keep the roots happy you know

270
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,939
the whole plant is happy I think that's

271
00:11:57,359 --> 00:12:03,720
true with everything right yeah you know

272
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:07,168
so indoors you know you got the small

273
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,329
root balls it's easy to just you know

274
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:12,778
tilt them one way or the other to make

275
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:15,388
them unhappy I mean too dry too wet too

276
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:17,458
much nutrient too little nutrient you

277
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:20,399
know anything like that you know too

278
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:23,039
cold too hot it goes on and on but any

279
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:27,178
of those extremes you know are going to

280
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:30,328
you know change change that plants you

281
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:31,889
know yeah how its gonna express itself

282
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:33,688
because you know you piss off you piss

283
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:35,308
off that raizo sphere and suddenly it's

284
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:38,698
sending all these different messages off

285
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:40,528
the plant yeah yeah so so the other

286
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:44,159
thing too you mentioned is like you know

287
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:45,389
a lot of people are just looking to well

288
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,558
alright I guess that's not fair I was

289
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,269
gonna say a lot of people are just

290
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,798
looking to make money and seeds and

291
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:52,499
that's certainly true but there's

292
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:55,769
there's also people who are in it who

293
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:58,139
are just cookies right and and and and

294
00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:01,619
they don't really have maybe the space

295
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:03,839
or the experience to do the kind of sips

296
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:07,109
that you do I mean we we all see like

297
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,089
the the way people put out seeds right

298
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:11,788
now where they're like okay I got I got

299
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:14,579
one mail and I'm gonna hit it to the ten

300
00:13:11,788 --> 00:13:16,438
hot strains in my area and I'm just

301
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:20,099
gonna rush that stuff out and you know

302
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:21,389
that stuff you know has not been sifted

303
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,070
properly

304
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:24,269
and probably not even tested right

305
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,300
they're just running them out the door

306
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:28,919
while it's hot and and so to that degree

307
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:33,419
I think that what you're saying probably

308
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:36,149
applies to FEM seeds the same way it

309
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:38,279
applies to reg seeds where hey men

310
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:40,590
there's good Femmes on the market and

311
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,809
there's you know sketchy Femmes on the

312
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:46,170
market so no your frickin breeder oh

313
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:47,939
absolutely absolutely no not only no

314
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:50,669
your breeder but no your genetics you

315
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,340
know because I mean you can you can give

316
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:55,799
a dozen different breeders the same

317
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:59,220
exact cut and they're gonna be playing

318
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:02,299
with the same exact you know potential

319
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:05,910
that same variability that same you know

320
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:07,109
you know possibility of everything that

321
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:10,519
comes out of that cuts gonna be a

322
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,779
hermaphrodite mm-hmm you know and that's

323
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,389
that's where the bad reputation comes

324
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:18,120
from and really ruins your run yeah so

325
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:22,169
um so you mentioned a little bit earlier

326
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:27,179
about how the you know the the Femmes

327
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:29,639
have got the same vigor as as a reg

328
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:33,029
version of it is and you know I often

329
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,220
hear people kind of get confused who

330
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:36,539
don't know a lot about the breeding side

331
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,210
because they get them kind of confused

332
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:42,059
with autos right because with with autos

333
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:45,000
which I'm also a fan of you you get

334
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:47,789
these you know you get whatever the

335
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,039
let's take like a and Auto Girl Scout

336
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:53,029
cookies for example all right so so

337
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:56,219
people go alright well that's not really

338
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:58,799
like Girl Scout cookies anymore that's

339
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,899
actually a new keema var that's Girl

340
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:04,620
Scout cookies crossed with a ruderalis

341
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:06,629
plant from Siberia right and so you you

342
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,840
are definitely taking a step away from

343
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:14,340
the original phenotypical package of any

344
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,930
particular kima var but if I you know

345
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,540
the way I understand it that is not the

346
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:20,250
case with Femmes because you're not you

347
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:23,429
know you know you you you will either

348
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:25,799
get the the full package of an S one of

349
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:28,049
that one plant or if you're gonna

350
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,679
hybridize it to another one you're gonna

351
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:31,109
get

352
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:34,439
you know the essentially clean fie nose

353
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:37,500
of of those two plants together but

354
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,509
isn't a third plant added to the mix

355
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,870
like in autos which is bringing in all

356
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:46,680
these like kind of wild Rudy genetics

357
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:51,209
from Russia and so so so Femmes really

358
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:56,758
should be just like you would expect the

359
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:59,159
the Reg version to be yeah so so let's

360
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,449
let's get to the heart of that you know

361
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,759
that query because most people don't

362
00:16:00,448 --> 00:16:05,128
understand where Femmes come from period

363
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:08,009
right and and that's where a lot of the

364
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:12,209
confusion comes from so would you kind

365
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:14,490
of go through how feminized seeds are

366
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,628
made you know people you know you ask a

367
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,060
lot of people and they'll give you one

368
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:20,039
of two answers he'll either say oh don't

369
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:21,778
you like dump colloidal silver on them

370
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,299
and then the other folks you know

371
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:27,838
referred to Matt riots FEM spray right

372
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:30,448
and so so this is the part of it that

373
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,310
I'm least familiar with as well so will

374
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:34,229
you kind of just talk about the the

375
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:40,278
various ways of getting to feminized

376
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:47,938
seeds well basically I've always used

377
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:50,578
STS so silver thiosulfate and you know

378
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:52,620
what a lot of people don't realize this

379
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:54,269
might be a little bit of a tangent but

380
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,839
what a lot of people don't realize is

381
00:16:54,269 --> 00:17:00,240
it's not that easy I mean I've got

382
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,140
buddies who have tried to reverse you

383
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,318
know 20 30 plants and have never had a

384
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,709
successful reversal where they got seeds

385
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:15,568
you know let alone even pollen from

386
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:18,419
their reverse plants why n why is that I

387
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:23,068
mean what's the failure point you know

388
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:26,909
if I knew I'd share I mean I'm good

389
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:31,019
buddies with with Matt riot and I mean

390
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:33,960
you know we we chat about this same

391
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:36,929
topic quite often and you know it's not

392
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,690
unusual for me to have a failed reversal

393
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:43,470
run it's not unusual for him you know to

394
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:47,130
have a failed one and I mean I've used

395
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:48,299
his spray eyeball generally I've always

396
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,090
used my spray

397
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:54,149
but I've you know tried his spray and

398
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:59,369
I've also tried my other buddy hyb his

399
00:17:54,150 --> 00:18:03,330
hypertext spray and it's really variable

400
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:06,019
on what works when it works and you know

401
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:08,639
how well it works

402
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:10,410
yeah and it's it's not an exact science

403
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,450
that's true that's for sure

404
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,650
right on so do you do you think that you

405
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,029
know and I know I know that I'm asking

406
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,530
you to guess here cuz you already said

407
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:19,289
you don't know for sure but do you think

408
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:22,680
that do you think that it probably has

409
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:25,680
more to do with how a particular plants

410
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:28,500
genetics accepts it or do you think it's

411
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,490
about method and people are just not

412
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:34,890
doing it right

413
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:37,799
it definitely has a lot to do with the

414
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:40,340
individual plants certain people

415
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:43,829
absolutely it's got to be method because

416
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:46,319
you know if you can't reverse you know

417
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:48,809
20-plus plants there's something going

418
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:53,909
on that's not quite right and their

419
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:56,339
method I'd imagine but you know I've

420
00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:00,360
successfully done you know plenty of

421
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:03,709
reversals and sometimes you get tons

422
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:07,399
upon tons of seeds blah blah blah and

423
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:10,319
other times you get no pollen and

424
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:14,070
sometimes you get loads of pollen and

425
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:17,549
almost no seed so you know it's just

426
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:20,669
like huh I don't get this but you know I

427
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:23,039
don't claim to be an expert but I'm I'm

428
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,460
in a very active student right on right

429
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,369
on it

430
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:30,269
and in artisan as well so I'm gonna ask

431
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:33,299
I'm gonna want to go more into the STS

432
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:34,920
but before we like go past it will you

433
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:39,450
address the colloidal silver thing is

434
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:44,700
this just an outmoded method okay so I'm

435
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:50,220
more uh I'm fairly busy let's put it

436
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:53,039
that way and with chloral silver that

437
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,740
reversal method you essentially have to

438
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:59,089
spray and spray and spray I think you

439
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:01,950
have to spray every day and honestly

440
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:06,509
that just doesn't work with

441
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:09,360
you know my style or my workload and so

442
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:11,519
I need something where you know I only

443
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:15,779
have to spray it you know one time maybe

444
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:19,230
twice and I'm good so that's you know

445
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:21,269
why I go with the STS and you know

446
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,819
lately I've just been spraying the one

447
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:27,180
time you know when I trigger that

448
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:30,389
reversal plant if I was using colloidal

449
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:33,870
I'd have to spray every single day that

450
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:36,030
plant and that's a lot of spring

451
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:37,949
yeah for sure it was so what do you

452
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:39,599
think about its reliability so let's say

453
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,360
that you know we've got a home grower

454
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,279
who wants to make you know some reversed

455
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:45,689
there wants to reverse their plant but

456
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,190
they only have four plants they need to

457
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,890
worry about and spraying everyday is

458
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:54,240
easy you know do do does it have the

459
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:57,420
same quality of results or likelihood of

460
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,750
success as using STS if you've got that

461
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:03,840
time if you've got that time I know

462
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:07,710
plenty of people who have you know had

463
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:10,379
good success with that you know it's a

464
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:14,789
lot of you know hobbyist type work yeah

465
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:16,230
you know you got a oftentimes you you

466
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:23,420
got to kind of make it yourself

467
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:25,980
right basically just from raw silver and

468
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:30,690
yeah I've never entertained that much

469
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:32,220
time right on fair enough so um so what

470
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,769
I'd like to do right now is would you

471
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,440
take us through step by step you know

472
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:40,049
you don't you don't have to you be

473
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,450
overly elaborate but but um you know

474
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:45,960
would you walk us through what you're

475
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,400
doing with the STS spray that causes the

476
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,769
feminized seeds if you could just break

477
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,660
it down into steps so that people who

478
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:54,059
really want to picture it in their head

479
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,350
what what did it looks like or maybe

480
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,579
they're actually looking for actionable

481
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:58,949
information because they want to go and

482
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:59,750
try this would just break it out for us

483
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:04,130
would you

484
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:08,339
I'll do my best all right thank you

485
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:10,410
basically you're spraying some form of

486
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:13,169
silver on your plants whether it's

487
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,460
colloidal silver or silver thiosulfate

488
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:21,130
and you spray it

489
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:27,850
your target female and the silver acts

490
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:30,669
as a ethylene inhibitor and the ethylene

491
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:34,109
is what you know makes your plant female

492
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:40,750
so by inhibiting the ethylene production

493
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:45,158
you are essentially changing the hormone

494
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:50,710
balance I guess in the plant to exhibit

495
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:52,270
you know a male and you know if if all

496
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:57,159
goes well with your spray and your

497
00:22:52,269 --> 00:23:01,408
timing and everything then your your

498
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:07,049
mail your reversed female male plant

499
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:10,299
will uh will give you pollen roughly in

500
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:14,139
four to six weeks from the time you

501
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:16,778
first spray so this this plant that we

502
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:20,559
just sprayed with the STS our goal with

503
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:23,259
that plant is just to get male flowers

504
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,990
to be produced and then we will collect

505
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:29,609
that pollen and then hit that to a

506
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:33,099
second plant we're not so the idea isn't

507
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:36,398
necessarily that oh we want the plant to

508
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:38,439
have both male and female flowers and

509
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:39,969
then self pollinate no we're taught

510
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,390
we're talking about we want to force

511
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:45,100
this female plant to make pollen so we

512
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,470
can take her and hit something else oh

513
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:51,519
yeah right although although some people

514
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:54,130
do do individual branch spraying on a

515
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:58,599
plant and then they can take it'll only

516
00:23:54,130 --> 00:24:00,760
reverse the one branch and and it'll

517
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:03,398
pollinate you know you can pollinate the

518
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:04,898
rest of the plant that hasn't been spray

519
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:07,569
yeah that's the only way I've ever seen

520
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:09,308
it actually and so the idea of doing a

521
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:10,538
whole plant and collecting a pollen

522
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:13,000
sounds like could be a hell of a lot

523
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:16,240
easier they have been going branch by

524
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,210
branch I mean me personally when I do my

525
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:24,038
reversals I'm I'm generally reversing

526
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:27,250
four to eight plants that are they

527
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:29,259
generally finish out at about three to

528
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:32,920
five feet tall

529
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:35,589
and you know two to three feet around so

530
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,570
I'm I'm reversing some pretty big plants

531
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:40,240
but I'm also pollinate and you know

532
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:43,509
good-sized rooms as well so I need a lot

533
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:47,829
of a lot of pollen and a lot of people

534
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:50,500
don't know but you do not get even

535
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:53,079
remotely close to as much pollen from a

536
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:56,259
reverse plant as you do a regular male

537
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:57,309
plant so that's why you need the you

538
00:24:56,259 --> 00:25:00,970
definitely need them because like

539
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:02,409
normally a male pollen a male plant

540
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,089
giving off pone there's a hell of a lot

541
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,680
of pollen in there and so that's why you

542
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:08,639
have to do multiple so so if you're

543
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:11,440
going to be doing four or six of these

544
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,920
are you are you doing your best to make

545
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,730
sure that these females are either you

546
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:21,850
know from the same Fino of seed or are

547
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:24,250
you taking one primary mother making

548
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:27,569
clones of her so they are all the same

549
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:30,700
fee no and then and then reversing that

550
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:33,549
the majority of plants I reverse are all

551
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,200
just heirloom cuts you know so yeah

552
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:39,099
they're they're all all the same

553
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:43,180
cuttings and one other thing I do is I

554
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:46,329
stagger him because in early on I I had

555
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:48,009
plenty of failed runs and when I'm

556
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:52,509
trying to reverse in pollinate a room

557
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:55,059
and half the time it was because the

558
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:57,549
reversal plant either dropped pollen too

559
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:58,990
early and missed the window or it

560
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:01,389
dropped pollen too late and missed the

561
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,910
window and I'd get you know a 10% seated

562
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:08,050
room which that doesn't really help me

563
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:10,480
or anybody yeah you know and so nowadays

564
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:14,230
what I do is is I'll pollinate I'll

565
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:17,529
reverse I'll reverse a female you know a

566
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:19,900
week or two in advance of flowering the

567
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:23,289
rest of the room out then all then I'll

568
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:26,050
do a you know a couple more at the

569
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:29,700
trigger date and then you know and I'll

570
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:32,589
also use different different different

571
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:36,370
STS products different STS

572
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:38,399
concentrations that cetera etc so so

573
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:40,929
you're trying a variety so that

574
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,380
somewhere in the mean of this somewhere

575
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,110
in the middle every

576
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:48,020
we'll get the particular combination it

577
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:53,019
needs since everybody's so finicky yeah

578
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:55,819
it's just a you know trying trying to

579
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:56,720
circumvent failure yeah yeah better your

580
00:26:55,819 --> 00:27:00,349
odds a little bit

581
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,230
so so clearly if these reversed plants

582
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:06,139
produce less pollen and everybody in the

583
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:09,919
room is more finicky this of course

584
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:13,580
increases the value of each bit of

585
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:16,159
pollen and you know storing pollen can

586
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:19,908
really be a [ __ ] and it goes bad so

587
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:23,240
easily do you find you know it in your

588
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:25,220
process are you collecting the pone and

589
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,720
saving it or are you all like you know

590
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:30,350
oh no I'm just gonna put you all in the

591
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,940
same room and and it's gonna happen live

592
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:38,240
without any saving of the pollen I

593
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:40,880
always do it alive I've I would love to

594
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,460
you know have faith and saving it but

595
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,179
just like you said you know I don't have

596
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,350
trust

597
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:49,880
for saving the pollen so it it would it

598
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:52,069
would be pretty miserable to be like I

599
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,679
got this room and you know throw a ton

600
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:56,869
of pollen out there and you get 17 seeds

601
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,429
you know yeah totally and and where I

602
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:02,989
was going with that is that it was do

603
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:04,130
you have a a pollen storage technique

604
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,829
that you trust and I'm thinking the

605
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:09,830
answer's no I've never even bothered to

606
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:13,668
store pollen yeah right on right on so I

607
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:15,649
should I should but you know it just is

608
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:17,750
one of the things that I haven't gotten

609
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,100
into right on and like you said earlier

610
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:24,349
like it's something that you can do with

611
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:25,819
all that extra time you've got right all

612
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:27,589
right cool well with that let's uh let's

613
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:29,629
go ahead and take our first commercial

614
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:31,730
break you were listening to shaping fire

615
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:35,390
and my guest today is Caleb Inspectah

616
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,829
from CSI humble as a listener of shaping

617
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,630
fire you already understand the

618
00:28:36,829 --> 00:28:41,029
importance of living soil when growing

619
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:43,100
cannabis when you have active microbe

620
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:45,168
communities in your substrate you go way

621
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:47,839
beyond simply fertilizing with nitrogen

622
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:49,490
phosphorus and potassium having active

623
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,349
microorganisms in your substrate

624
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:53,240
supports vigorous plant growth

625
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:55,909
throughout the plants root zone making

626
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,309
for higher yields and thriving flowers

627
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,860
mammoth pee is the first organically

628
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:02,269
derived microbial inoculant that focuses

629
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:04,879
on your plants nutrient cycling

630
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:06,619
processes to release soil phosphorus and

631
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,020
other micronutrients from they're bound

632
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:11,509
forms making them more available to the

633
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:13,190
plant increased levels of phosphorus

634
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:15,049
will also keep internode shorter and

635
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,210
focus your plants energy on bud

636
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:19,250
production not only that but the

637
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,470
microbes act as a defense shield for the

638
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:23,509
plants rhizosphere by out competing

639
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,009
potentially harmful pathogenic microbes

640
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:26,720
pretty cool right

641
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:28,879
mammoth pee not only unlocks the

642
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,759
nutrients in your soil but it also helps

643
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,740
protect your plant from disease mammoth

644
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:37,009
Peas beneficial bacteria act like

645
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:39,950
microbial reactors continually producing

646
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:41,750
enzymes that release nutrients mammoths

647
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:43,880
pee was developed at a u.s. university

648
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,740
has been extensively tested by Colorado

649
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,260
growers and independent laboratories

650
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,990
mammoth pee is proven to increase growth

651
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:52,190
and enhance blooming one of the great

652
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,870
things about supplementing with

653
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,730
microorganisms is that they won't

654
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:58,099

growers find locations design build and

668
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,539
equip their greenhouses for over a

669
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,549
decade first starting in Northern

670
00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:00,470
California but expanding over the last

671
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:02,329
five years to helping clients throughout

reputation for both depth of knowledge

674
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:09,229
and kindness and communication you can

675
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:09,798
hear Erik explain some of the challenges

676
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,480
facing

677
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:14,359
Animus greenhouses and how to overcome

678
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,569
them in episode number 41 of the shaping

679
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:19,699
fire podcast no matter where I go in the

680
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:21,528
country good people with smart

681
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,200
backgrounds still are making the mistake

682
00:31:21,528 --> 00:31:26,269
of building without knowing cannabis and

683
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,090
it causes them to burn through capital

684
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:31,429
and time fast everyone has their own

685
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:33,408
failure point for some it is improper

686
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:35,149
ventilation planning for others it is

687
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:37,850
surface temperatures of the building or

688
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:39,229
the plants leaves or both some folks

689
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:41,418
that build their greenhouse from scratch

690
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,128
make really basic errors like placement

691
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:44,629
of the greenhouse on the property or not

692
00:31:43,128 --> 00:31:46,219
understanding the natural environment

693
00:31:44,628 --> 00:31:48,528
where the greenhouse sits

694
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,720
some have even built a decent greenhouse

695
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:52,220
but are inefficient in their deployment

696
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,519
of light deprivation techniques and

697
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,839
never really hit their target yields

698
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,730
it's great when you learn from your

699
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:00,858
mistakes but it's even better when you

700
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:03,048
learn from the mistakes of others when

701
00:32:00,858 --> 00:32:04,699
you bring on greenhouse advisory group

702
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:06,618
you will learn from the mistakes of

703
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,210
their many clients and you'll take

704
00:32:06,618 --> 00:32:10,428
advantage of the best practices

705
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:12,230
developed by Eric Branstad over his

706
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:15,139
years of working with clients just like

707
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,999
you from location development to

708
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:18,888
choosing a builder and tricking out your

welcome back you are listening to

716
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:36,108
shaping fire I'm your host Shango Louis

717
00:32:34,608 --> 00:32:38,148
and our guest this week is caleb

718
00:32:36,108 --> 00:32:40,158
Inspectah from CSI Humboldt

719
00:32:38,148 --> 00:32:42,678
so during the first set we talked a lot

720
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:45,169
generally about feminized seeds and what

721
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:46,970
they are and what they aren't but during

722
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:51,619
the second set Caleb I want to talk more

723
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:54,679
about your particular approach to to you

724
00:32:51,618 --> 00:32:57,648
know building feminized seeds you know

725
00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:00,320
the great interview that you did with

726
00:32:57,648 --> 00:33:03,589
Kevin Joe tree at wonderland nursery

727
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:06,558
during the Wunderland seed series you

728
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:09,798
know Kevin definitely made the

729
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:12,528
suggestion that you do significant seed

730
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:14,720
sifts right you are you are very active

731
00:33:12,528 --> 00:33:16,638
in popping a lot of seeds and you put a

732
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,129
lot of thought into your choices which

733
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:21,408
you know I wish would I wish that a lot

734
00:33:19,128 --> 00:33:23,449
more people are doing that but I would

735
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:27,560
you know to give people an idea

736
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:29,509
of you know how to sift and what a sift

737
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:31,460
looks like would you just kind of walk

738
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:33,319
us through what you typically do when

739
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:39,890
you're when you're hunting for the

740
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:44,119
keepers so generally from every reversal

741
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:49,610
I'll usually sprout anywhere from 200 to

742
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:52,339
500 seeds and a lot of them are you know

743
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:54,919
just feminized hybrids

744
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:57,709
I'll also you know run out the S ones as

745
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:00,019
well best ones I usually do separate and

746
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:04,340
those are usually in hundred Lots or two

747
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:07,339
hundred Lots but for the feminized ones

748
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:11,480
I just like to you know get a good idea

749
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:14,269
of everything that's contained in you

750
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:18,710
know in the seeds I sell and you know

751
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:21,619
just see how things combine and usually

752
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:25,210
you know the the funnest part is you

753
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:27,319
know watching them all grow selecting

754
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:30,168
selecting out you know you hurt your

755
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,090
favorite your terpenes and you know all

756
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:34,609
your favorite plants out of them and

757
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:38,030
then of course at the end you know you

758
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:41,329
gotta go through and sample and figure

759
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:44,630
out really which ones you know make it

760
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:48,259
from your your favorite growing plants

761
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:50,929
to your favorite smoking plants it's

762
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:53,570
it's it's a big process so when you are

763
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:56,090
so like let's talk about like what your

764
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:57,590
call points are right so so you the

765
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:59,329
first call probably happens naturally

766
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,800
the ones that just straight up don't

767
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:02,690
germinate you're like okay those those

768
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,060
aren't those genetics are not gonna be

769
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,950
part of it and then I'm assuming that

770
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:10,489
you probably do another call just for

771
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:13,399
you know mediocre plants that aren't

772
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:16,149
really thriving right and but but when

773
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,860
do you start what's your first call for

774
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,269
plants that are not obviously failing

775
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,460
right the ones that failed they're out

776
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:25,340
of the mix but but but how soon do you

777
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,409
start saying that plant doesn't look or

778
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:31,100
isn't expressing self in a way that I

779
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:33,649
want to keep you you know and and this

780
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:36,619
this is something that a lot of people

781
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:39,860
do I think for one

782
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:42,679
I usually have a pretty high gem right

783
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:45,890
so I usually have between 98 and 99

784
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:49,279
percent germ so I'm not having a big

785
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:54,109
call as far as you know just you know

786
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:59,870
seeds that don't sprout and I rarely

787
00:35:54,110 --> 00:36:03,380
kill a plant I I like to see every

788
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:07,369
single plant you know go start to finish

789
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:10,369
no matter how small of a rut it is you

790
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:13,309
know no matter how weak it looks cuz

791
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:15,619
honestly some of the best plants I've

792
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:19,389
ever come across have been these little

793
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:22,039
weak runty just you know weirdo plants

794
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:23,179
now are they gonna be great for breeding

795
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:25,579
probably not

796
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:27,319
you know usually you're not gonna

797
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:28,549
forward them but I still like to give

798
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,700
them a chance and see what they have

799
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:34,490
I've seen tons of breeders who you know

800
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:36,939
think that you know they can call it the

801
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:41,089
seedling stage or think they can call

802
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:43,309
you know in early veg and they're making

803
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:47,120
their decisions they're mostly making

804
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:51,380
their decisions on structure and you

805
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:54,170
know vigor which you know for certain

806
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:57,320
things that's great but you know for a

807
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:59,329
final finished product that has nothing

808
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,580
to do with that you know what I mean

809
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:04,309
yeah totally and and there could totally

810
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:06,289
be something in one of these runts let's

811
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:08,329
say that it's a runt but you're like oh

812
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:10,190
my gosh it's got this terpene profile

813
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:11,960
that's out of the world if you would

814
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:14,210
have culled it early you wouldn't have

815
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,240
smelled that and and now you know to

816
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,829
look for it elsewhere in the sift but

817
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:21,199
also you know if it's an attribute that

818
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:23,029
you particularly think is badass maybe

819
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,039
you're like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna

820
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:28,130
take that plant and do something with it

821
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:30,769
to maybe help it not express as a runt

822
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:35,660
but also keep that terpene or whatever

823
00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:38,690
variable right right exactly so you know

824
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:42,289
to grow out that many plants that's a

825
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:45,349
lot of freaking space so are you do you

826
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:45,800
run them in one gallons or you know or

827
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:50,339
shorter

828
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:55,170
oh no no III predominantly just use

829
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:57,390
you know raised beds so my beds are four

830
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:03,269
foot by four foot by about one foot deep

831
00:37:57,389 --> 00:38:09,059
and I'll generally run anywhere from 16

832
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:12,150
plants in a bed 281 plants I mean it

833
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:16,139
that's really close yeah yeah I mean I

834
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:19,680
just did a little last year I did a run

835
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:24,389
where I had either 72 or 81 chem dog

836
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:27,000
hybrids in every single bed and I mean I

837
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:30,210
had probably less than a 10% drown out I

838
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,440
mean most everything in those beds you

839
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:37,320
know finished up just perfectly fine

840
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,260
didn't get drowned out and I got a you

841
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,600
know sizable sample of each one to you

842
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,510
know make my assessments and judgments

843
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:47,519
on so when you run them that close are

844
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:50,400
you doing a lot of D leafing or are you

845
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,920
leaving them just as the seed intended

846
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:57,450
so you can actually find the ones that

847
00:38:52,920 --> 00:39:00,210
are leafy ER and Leslie fiour um it

848
00:38:57,449 --> 00:39:03,509
definitely varies but I will I have no

849
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:05,909
problems kind of a taking off the the

850
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:09,090
fan leaves you know I don't like

851
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:11,519
overdoing it but I won't you know let

852
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:16,100
them overlap and just completely you

853
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:18,420
know over overload a bed with leaves so

854
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:22,289
definitely a lot of cleanup on the

855
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,119
underneath and also uh I don't know if

856
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:27,659
this is the right part to throw this in

857
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:32,190
but I always make sure about you know

858
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:33,420
two weeks in the flower I your two to

859
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:37,289
two and a half weeks let's put it that

860
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:39,840
way I'll clean up all the lowers I won't

861
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:44,909
clean them up early just because I want

862
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:46,650
to see what type of firm expressions the

863
00:39:44,909 --> 00:39:49,170
plants put on and you won't see that

864
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:51,809
until two to three weeks into flower so

865
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:54,480
you know I leave all that undergrowth on

866
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:56,489
them and until that time and then I

867
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,860
clean them all up and I check every

868
00:39:56,489 --> 00:40:02,069
single plant and you'll be able to see

869
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:04,440
you know any any herm troubles and a lot

870
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:06,420
of times you know

871
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,710
you know these plants will have maybe

872
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:13,309
like one ball here or you know just a

873
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:16,309
couple balls per plant mm-hmm

874
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:21,299
most of them generally aren't you know

875
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:25,079
don't have any and then very few are

876
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:27,230
really bad hers I usually see a a really

877
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:32,190
bad herm indoors

878
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:35,849
maybe one or two per hundred plants you

879
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:38,639
know and when they are her me like that

880
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:40,409
indoors you know obviously you are

881
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,239
checking them constantly right because

882
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:45,569
this is this is what you do but are they

883
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:48,689
a threat to the rest of your crop no not

884
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:50,970
generally I mean basically I'm not

885
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:53,880
checking them constantly at all I check

886
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:56,189
them in that window of two to two and a

887
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,849
half weeks into flower and that's gonna

888
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:00,780
be the window

889
00:40:56,849 --> 00:41:03,869
where they will be visible they'll be

890
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:06,300
expressing but they won't be dropping

891
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:08,969
pollen and sabotaging your room and so

892
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:11,490
as long as you check your plants at that

893
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:13,349
time you know it doesn't matter if

894
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:16,019
you're doing rag seeds if you're doing

895
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:17,759
feminized seeds you know hell it doesn't

896
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:20,849
even matter if you're doing clones from

897
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,530
the dispensary or whatever I mean you

898
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:24,659
know it should be you know a

899
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:27,750
prerequisite that you check your plants

900
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:31,339
in that window you know and make sure

901
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:34,530
you know otherwise you get what you get

902
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:37,100
so so alright so so you're you're doing

903
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:39,269
this sift of a few hundred plants and

904
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:42,360
you are looking for the particular

905
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:43,829
traits that you want for that run so you

906
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,930
know and I know you grow a lot of

907
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:47,579
different types of plants for four

908
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:49,739
different expressions and and honestly

909
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:51,480
how you express your craft - right

910
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:53,819
they're not your you you have a pretty

911
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,550
wide variety the kinds of seeds that

912
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:59,490
that you like to make so so let's say

913
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:03,800
that so you've gone through the sift are

914
00:41:59,489 --> 00:42:06,799
you trying to find you know your two

915
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:10,710
favorites that you think will have

916
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,410
create the best seeds among those two or

917
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:17,429
are or are you gonna do this cycle

918
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:18,149
several times and cross and re-cross so

919
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:20,879
that you

920
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,559
can pull out multiple traits that you

921
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,809
want like do you have to commit to two

922
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:27,089
at this point or or are you actually

923
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:29,130
going to commit to you know four to six

924
00:42:27,088 --> 00:42:32,849
and then work with those and bring those

925
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:35,809
down to your final you know pair that

926
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:43,318
you're going to bring to the market

927
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:45,420
honestly um I I make selections but I

928
00:42:43,318 --> 00:42:48,088
rarely end up keeping them for very long

929
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:51,358
just because I grow so much so so many

930
00:42:48,088 --> 00:42:54,088
different things out and I always just

931
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:57,058
just you know for me personally I always

932
00:42:54,088 --> 00:43:00,599
save the mother stock versus any hybrids

933
00:42:57,059 --> 00:43:03,480
so most of the time the hybrids even if

934
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:05,579
they're just absolutely amazing you know

935
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,190
they end up going by the wayside just to

936
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:11,329
make sure my mother stock is you know

937
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:18,539
happy and healthy and has plenty of room

938
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:24,750
the the predominant sifting I do for

939
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:26,400
keepers is in the s1 stock where that

940
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,289
that's actually gonna be the second

941
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,338
phase of my company because I don't

942
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:38,359
remake any of any of these hybrids in

943
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:42,358
general I'm and I'm only making I'm only

944
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:46,889
reversing them and making the seeds so I

945
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:50,190
have s1 stock to go through and refine

946
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:52,440
the s wands you know into you know

947
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:56,130
exactly the direction I want to go and

948
00:43:52,440 --> 00:44:01,318
and so the second phase of my company is

949
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:04,048
going to be to make all these s2 lines

950
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:06,989
and then from there you know I think

951
00:44:04,048 --> 00:44:09,900
I'll go to s/3 s/3 might be the limit I

952
00:44:06,989 --> 00:44:13,108
think that's where you're just gonna get

953
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:15,630
too much inbreeding past that but you'll

954
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:19,730
be able to have you know as we're fine

955
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:21,990
as you need for like future hybrids

956
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:24,630
you're like so it's like you're it's

957
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:29,519
that so by going to s2 and s3 you're

958
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:31,090
essentially making a very stable library

959
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:34,179
Abul seed stock

960
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:37,030
that you can put on ice and no if you if

961
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:39,579
you want to call on that you know that

962
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:42,269
genetic line again in you know six or

963
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:46,059
ten or twelve years that you've got it

964
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:50,949
encapsulated from this work absolutely

965
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:52,929
but also that that stock say say I have

966
00:44:50,949 --> 00:44:57,899
ten different things that are in that s2

967
00:44:52,929 --> 00:45:02,949
s3 form well I can start making true

968
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:05,470
feminised F ones you know because each

969
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:09,069
when each line is you know just rock

970
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:10,989
salt and stable then you you combine

971
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:13,300
those together and you're gonna have

972
00:45:10,989 --> 00:45:16,149
something completely different than you

973
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:18,610
know that original f1 where it's just

974
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:20,950
you know say a amend Oh purple times of

975
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:22,539
purple Arkell you know if you work both

976
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:24,460
those lines you know for multiple

977
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:26,889
generations on their own and then you

978
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:28,659
know create stable on both sides and

979
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:30,339
they cross them together it's gonna

980
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:33,339
create something way different than just

981
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:35,200
that original mother times mother you

982
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,420
know yeah talking about that that s1

983
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:41,289
variability you know I can imagine that

984
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:43,570
a hobby grower who wants to get you know

985
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:45,039
a bunch of plants that are similar you

986
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:47,320
know alright phenotypically different

987
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:50,259
but reliable you know they wouldn't want

988
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:53,050
an s-1 because there's so much noise in

989
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:55,650
the in the line but I would think that

990
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:58,330
as you know for those of us who are

991
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:00,670
canvas plant nerds right who just love

992
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:03,789
to see all her expressions right that

993
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:06,730
that that that packing popping s ones

994
00:46:03,789 --> 00:46:09,670
even though it'll be losers in there you

995
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:11,590
know a lot of them I think that that

996
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:13,480
would be really fun just for the joy of

997
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:15,850
like getting all these what the [ __ ]

998
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:20,789
plants like oh my god what is this oh

999
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:24,759
yeah oh yeah no I I love s once s ones

1000
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:27,759
are I don't think there's a single s one

1001
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:32,440
line I've run yet that hasn't just been

1002
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:35,380
a pleasure you know well that's a that's

1003
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:37,720
a good recommendation so so so while

1004
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,730
we're talking about all the the weird

1005
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:41,859
the weirdness of it and and the things

1006
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:44,559
that are in the the hidden recesses of

1007
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,800
these genetic lines you know you know

1008
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:46,690
you

1009
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,930
you and I are both fans of feminized

1010
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:52,690
seeds and yet sometimes you know some of

1011
00:46:49,929 --> 00:46:54,609
the these ultra purists will say that

1012
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:56,829
they're they're not down with feminized

1013
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:59,320
seeds because they're they're unnatural

1014
00:46:56,829 --> 00:47:03,099
and and and anything that comes from

1015
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:05,019
stressing or forcing the plant is is you

1016
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:07,839
know an abomination right they may be

1017
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:10,599
useful but it's not what nature intended

1018
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,900
and I just like to hear what your

1019
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:16,360
thoughts are on the the potential

1020
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:18,940
unnaturalness of feminized seeds I'd

1021
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:22,660
like to ask these same people have they

1022
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:25,030
ever seen landraces grown out and have

1023
00:47:22,659 --> 00:47:29,849
they ever seen a land race that isn't a

1024
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:32,410
hardcore hermaphrodite most land races

1025
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:36,039
that come from source whether it's

1026
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:40,409
Afghanistan Pakistan Thailand Colombia

1027
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:43,300
wherever you know there are huge

1028
00:47:40,409 --> 00:47:46,210
populations of hermaphrodites so you can

1029
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,710
almost guarantee that you're gonna your

1030
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:53,800
little land race seeds you're getting

1031
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:56,260
are gonna be part feminized and part

1032
00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:01,870
regular and everything in between

1033
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:04,120
you know so and you know one thing a lot

1034
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:07,029
of people don't even realize is there's

1035
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:10,559
tons of male hermaphrodites and most

1036
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:16,930
most breeders most anyone it seems

1037
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:18,820
doesn't really realize that and males

1038
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:19,719
can produce seeds themselves when

1039
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,820
they're hermaphrodites

1040
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:25,839
and what happens when a male produces

1041
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:28,420
its own seed is you get a portion that

1042
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,309
are pure male you get a portion that are

1043
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:35,079
hermaphrodites and you get a portion

1044
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:37,960
that are pure females and that's a whole

1045
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:39,279
nother topic I like I like your response

1046
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:43,300
though they're like for the people who

1047
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:46,540
think that that all of this all than all

1048
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:48,880
the noise in the seed is unnatural like

1049
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:53,320
you want really messy go to actual

1050
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:56,619
nature exactly you know nature is as

1051
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,510
messy as it gets thank you and you're

1052
00:48:56,619 --> 00:49:01,139
welcome yeah

1053
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:03,359
right on so so you know one of the

1054
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:04,980
things that that you know attracted and

1055
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:06,659
to me to your seeds when I was first

1056
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:11,250
getting turned on to you and your work

1057
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:16,649
was that you you're you foraging your

1058
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:21,059
own path right there you you choose good

1059
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:22,500
genetics to start with and then you have

1060
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:23,759
a vision of what you're looking for and

1061
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,320
you go for it and so you don't

1062
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,600
necessarily I mean certainly you you

1063
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,119
work with a lot of you know hot sexy

1064
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,819
named stuff right that's true but but

1065
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:36,390
you don't really seem to care first

1066
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:38,609
about what is popular you are you are

1067
00:49:36,389 --> 00:49:42,659
following your art and your craft based

1068
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:47,639
on what is exciting you personally next

1069
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:50,429
and so I'm curious what you'd look for

1070
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:54,299
when you are looking for starter

1071
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:57,329
genetics that tells you that this might

1072
00:49:54,300 --> 00:50:02,190
be good for a feminized seed breeding

1073
00:49:57,329 --> 00:50:06,150
run I mean honestly most everything up

1074
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:09,000
up until you know up until recently

1075
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:12,358
anyway that you know I've worked with

1076
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,358
for the feminized is just all old

1077
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:17,460
heirloom stock that I've held you know

1078
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:19,799
for years and the people before me have

1079
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,869
held for years I mean you got you know

1080
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,000
Arkell I mean I've had that cut for

1081
00:50:21,869 --> 00:50:26,760
we're getting close to 20 years with it

1082
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,269
you know a snow I've had that cut for 20

1083
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:33,270
years you know you know the chem dog

1084
00:50:30,269 --> 00:50:35,849
I've had that for going on 15 years and

1085
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:39,840
you know that makes dates back all the

1086
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:42,329
way to you know 1991 the triangle cush

1087
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:46,170
you know it dates back to the early 90s

1088
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:48,630
as well you know so I'm just working

1089
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:51,960
with stuff that I've held for a long

1090
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:55,829
long time minimum a decade oftentimes

1091
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:59,030
you know multiple decades and you know

1092
00:50:55,829 --> 00:51:03,029
things that have been around you know

1093
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:05,250
you know for the long stretch I haven't

1094
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:08,580
I haven't really worked with anything

1095
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:10,889
that is you know just popular for its

1096
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:11,789
own thing if I've worked with stuff

1097
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:15,239
that's pocket

1098
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:17,489
it's just you know it's just stood the

1099
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,959
test of time that's all that is is the

1100
00:51:17,489 --> 00:51:21,719
reason why you're not necessarily

1101
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,940
working with the the the hot trending

1102
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:27,509
stuff right now simply because you like

1103
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:30,179
the older genetics that are you know

1104
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:35,430
they're they're they're more referent

1105
00:51:30,179 --> 00:51:37,829
more refined than a land race but

1106
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:43,099
they've been worked a little bit to be

1107
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:46,529
stable without being boring I I think

1108
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:51,150
it's just a little bit of a personal

1109
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:53,700
issue with me too though where I am I

1110
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:57,059
know the history of the genetics and

1111
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:59,279
I've watched how genetics have have

1112
00:51:57,059 --> 00:52:01,980
moved over the last you know thirty

1113
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,720
years and then I also know you know the

1114
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:07,110
history of the genetics you know going

1115
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:09,239
back further and so everything that's

1116
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:13,440
really come out in the last 10-15 years

1117
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:15,899
I mean I have pretty much all the

1118
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,880
building blocks or most of the building

1119
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:20,579
blocks that created all these things I

1120
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,740
mean you know your Girl Scout cookies

1121
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:25,759
you know it's it's just an OG Kush

1122
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:32,149
crossed with yeah probably not d'oeuvre

1123
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:34,770
you know yeah but you know I mean a

1124
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:38,789
perfect example is when we ran out the

1125
00:52:34,769 --> 00:52:44,070
triangle cush s warms there were green

1126
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:47,519
phenotypes of essentially cookies in

1127
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:52,830
those plants so basically all cookies is

1128
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:56,960
is an expression of of that green og

1129
00:52:52,829 --> 00:52:59,549
cush triangle cush plant crossed with a

1130
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:03,720
certain dumb and a purple strain and

1131
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:06,330
honestly the only plant that I've really

1132
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:08,699
ever seen that does the certain purple

1133
00:53:06,329 --> 00:53:12,809
ink that you know the the common form

1134
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:17,579
cut of cookies does it's it's deep chunk

1135
00:53:12,809 --> 00:53:20,070
you know yeah I mean so the these these

1136
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:23,130
guys I mean cookies was founded in

1137
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:24,990
Mendocino County and the guys who are

1138
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:29,730
responsible for it yay cookie

1139
00:53:24,989 --> 00:53:31,409
Shango they they they aren't you know

1140
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:35,969
the most honest individuals when it

1141
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:41,069
comes to genetics and history so I mean

1142
00:53:35,969 --> 00:53:43,289
but you know weed nerds like myself you

1143
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:45,119
know obviously care a little bit more

1144
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:47,699
about that stuff yeah well because

1145
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:51,360
you're not you're not worried primarily

1146
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:52,769
for marketing and IP or intellectual

1147
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,329
property right you actually want to get

1148
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:57,090
to the truth of the matter it's a it's a

1149
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:59,750
different goal exactly exactly

1150
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:03,090
while we're while we're talking about

1151
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:06,860
you know strain histories and stuff and

1152
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:09,480
and how you like to use local heirlooms

1153
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:12,059
you know I read a lot of and listen to a

1154
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,760
lot of your other interviews to prepare

1155
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:16,590
for our interview today and do I

1156
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,680
remember correctly that the that the

1157
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:24,090
Humboldt snow that you use is a is a

1158
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:26,129
purple cush team of are okay so the

1159
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:32,180
humble snow is a kind of a tricky one

1160
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:38,430
that I'm still working on tracking down

1161
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:40,799
the the full story on it for one we do

1162
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:46,230
know it came out of Eugene back in the

1163
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:49,140
mid 90s there were there were stories I

1164
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:51,750
heard you know around humble talking

1165
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:54,299
about blah blah blah but then I know a

1166
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:58,170
handful of cats who actually brought it

1167
00:54:54,300 --> 00:55:01,859
down from Eugene in like 95 96 something

1168
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:09,389
like that and I got the cut in I think

1169
00:55:01,858 --> 00:55:15,380
99 well there's a story up in Eugene how

1170
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:19,500
it was just a selection of for way but

1171
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:22,530
you know some of the some of some of my

1172
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:26,219
boys have been talking to the cats kind

1173
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:28,200
of involved up there with that and some

1174
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:31,139
of those who are really in the know seem

1175
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:35,429
to think or seem you know that they

1176
00:55:31,139 --> 00:55:38,940
claim that it actually came to Eugene

1177
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:41,460
from Florida so basically worse

1178
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:44,369
still backtracking that one mm-hmm you

1179
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:47,039
know and I almost wonder if it's not

1180
00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:49,890
just one of those old hash plants that

1181
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:53,099
were popular in the early 90s out of

1182
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:55,920
Florida because hash plant you know it

1183
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:58,289
had a heyday back back in the early you

1184
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,930
know late late 80s early 90s in Florida

1185
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:03,568
so I'm just wondering if you know and

1186
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:05,759
and you know I never I never pretend

1187
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:08,460
like humble or where I'm from is the

1188
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,109
source of you know everything wonderful

1189
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,849
I think there's so many hot pockets

1190
00:56:10,108 --> 00:56:16,679
everywhere you know

1191
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:18,720
III I'm a fan of you know whatever koala

1192
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:22,318
genetics and where they came from you

1193
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:24,118
know I'm I'm not blind to you know oh

1194
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:26,130
you know we're the best right on right

1195
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,599
now and that's also you know and I'm

1196
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:29,130
gonna make a judgement but I also would

1197
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,920
guess that that's one of the reasons why

1198
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:33,900
you know you tend to be you know one of

1199
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,750
the more polite and play nice with

1200
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:38,430
everybody breeders out there because you

1201
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:40,469
want to have relationships with these

1202
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:42,059
other pockets around the country and you

1203
00:56:40,469 --> 00:56:44,639
don't get access to other people's

1204
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:47,880
networks by being an [ __ ] right right

1205
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:50,400
sure yeah so so um the reason why we

1206
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,920
asked about the Humboldt snow as it was

1207
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,019
was to as an example was because you

1208
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:58,710
you've done a lot of crosses with the

1209
00:56:55,019 --> 00:57:00,929
Humboldt snow and so and I also know

1210
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:02,818
that you are a hell a twosie with what

1211
00:57:00,929 --> 00:57:05,539
you're gonna cross with so what was it

1212
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:10,230
about the expressions of Humboldt snow

1213
00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:14,099
that you saw that made you want to make

1214
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:15,630
it a major player you know in your lines

1215
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:17,609
for a couple years and the reason why

1216
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:20,099
I'm asking to kind of inform your answer

1217
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:22,108
is there are people who are listening

1218
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:25,230
who are gonna want to you want to do

1219
00:57:22,108 --> 00:57:27,900
this right and so so they they may model

1220
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:29,639
their decision-making process a cut on

1221
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,710
how you thought through the challenge as

1222
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:34,049
well so so kind of tell us a little bit

1223
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:37,079
about how you decided to choose that

1224
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:40,260
particular keema bar you know honestly

1225
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:43,230
um it probably has to do with I've just

1226
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:48,390
had it for so long I mean when I got it

1227
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:50,860
back in 1999 we actually traded a the

1228
00:57:48,389 --> 00:57:54,159
this this cat

1229
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,820
are pretty much well this cut called

1230
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:58,179
Uriah

1231
00:57:54,820 --> 00:58:00,970
it was it was a it was inherited cut

1232
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:03,399
from my dad and we traded Uriah for the

1233
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:06,939
snow and the very first time I ran the

1234
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:09,910
snow out it only ended up being like I

1235
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:12,700
don't know six inches tall or something

1236
00:58:09,909 --> 00:58:15,309
and it produced produced four grams but

1237
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:17,619
it was the widest stuff I'd ever seen at

1238
00:58:15,309 --> 00:58:19,509
the time I mean it was and we actually

1239
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:23,409
got in a snow cap and it looked like a

1240
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:27,190
little snow capped mountain you know but

1241
00:58:23,409 --> 00:58:32,079
you know anyways the the last time I

1242
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:33,789
grew it like a full light of it I think

1243
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,539
I did like two and three-quarter pounds

1244
00:58:33,789 --> 00:58:37,029
from a bed

1245
00:58:34,539 --> 00:58:39,940
so it's yields are definitely you know

1246
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:47,080
have potential over that four gram

1247
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:49,929
initial but I I just really learned how

1248
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:53,590
to grow it really well back in the early

1249
00:58:49,929 --> 00:58:57,069
2000s and just grown that cut taught me

1250
00:58:53,590 --> 00:59:00,640
a lot I grew a lot of it indoors and

1251
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:04,180
then I grew a lot more of it outdoors

1252
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:08,079
and it was just you know a really solid

1253
00:59:04,179 --> 00:59:12,460
you know quality plant um high potency

1254
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:15,699
you know great bag bag appeal um just a

1255
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:20,139
hashey kind of a old school a little bit

1256
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:22,089
of pine a little bit of you know this

1257
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:25,059
and that but a little bit of pepper I

1258
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:29,289
think but uh just just kind of an

1259
00:59:25,059 --> 00:59:30,250
old-school you know solid plant when one

1260
00:59:29,289 --> 00:59:31,539
of the things that that's interesting

1261
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:33,730
that that you pulled out because I

1262
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:36,460
thought you were just gonna go for you

1263
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:37,690
know typical variables like you know I

1264
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,949
liked the terpene profile in the

1265
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:41,619
structure in the yield you know just

1266
00:59:38,949 --> 00:59:43,899
your basic stuff but you went right to I

1267
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:45,759
had a relationship with that plant yeah

1268
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:47,950
and I'm like oh wow that's a different

1269
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,590
idea you're like you're like I know her

1270
00:59:47,949 --> 00:59:54,009
I know how to grow her I can do a

1271
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:57,370
successful run with her and also you

1272
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:58,840
know she's she's very resinous right and

1273
00:59:57,369 --> 01:00:02,339
and then and then and then you

1274
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:04,750
eventually is also a good yield or - I

1275
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:07,360
like that idea - because that

1276
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:09,309
a really different kind of growing than

1277
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:11,769
what we're seeing commercially right now

1278
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:15,519
where people are just hitting lines with

1279
01:00:11,769 --> 01:00:17,530
with their male of the day right yeah

1280
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:20,920
then again you know very few people are

1281
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:21,670
sitting on mothers you know cuts from 15

1282
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,190
years ago either

1283
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:26,260
so yeah it's one of the advantages you

1284
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:29,170
have you know not only living where you

1285
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:31,240
live in the Emerald triangle but also

1286
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:34,420
having a lineage like you do where you

1287
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:37,000
know multiple generations of your family

1288
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:38,740
have been growing therefore for ages

1289
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,409
that's a that's a pretty good network

1290
01:00:38,739 --> 01:00:46,329
for for attracting genetics your way oh

1291
01:00:41,409 --> 01:00:48,849
yeah oh yeah and you know honestly you

1292
01:00:46,329 --> 01:00:51,279
know I got I got into the whole you know

1293
01:00:48,849 --> 01:00:54,400
internet forums and everything you know

1294
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:57,700
in the early 2000s and that you know

1295
01:00:54,400 --> 01:01:01,200
really you know helped to create access

1296
01:00:57,699 --> 01:01:05,339
to you know a lot of really high-quality

1297

1389
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:26,050
week is Caleb Inspectah from CSI

1390
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:29,739
Humboldt so Caleb you know one of the

1391
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:30,789
things I enjoy about your packs is is

1392
01:04:29,739 --> 01:04:33,549
the

1393
01:04:30,789 --> 01:04:35,829
the names that you choose and you know a

1394
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:39,460
lot of people in the modern more

1395
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:41,650
commercial market are just taking names

1396
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:43,269
that have nothing to do with the lineage

1397
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:45,820
right they're just you know they'll

1398
01:04:43,269 --> 01:04:48,699
they'll make a and they'll cross it to B

1399
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:50,740
instead of the the final name being a B

1400
01:04:48,699 --> 01:04:51,939
they're like it's called L now and

1401
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:55,929
you're like all right well I can tell

1402
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:59,710
nothing about the that about the the

1403
01:04:55,929 --> 01:05:00,759
strain based on the name and you know

1404
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:02,530
I've always thought that's one of the

1405
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,780
cool things is that it's it's like a

1406
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:06,820
it's like a verbal puzzle right it's

1407
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:10,750
like okay what what in this name

1408
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:11,920
conjures other you know other Kim parts

1409
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:14,139
like you know the word they'll you know

1410
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,690
blue or dream right you know like you

1411
01:05:14,139 --> 01:05:18,339
can you know in the in the early blue

1412
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:21,220
dream cross days like you could tell

1413
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:23,590
where it came from and and and there is

1414
01:05:21,219 --> 01:05:25,899
a certain artistry in naming those

1415
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:28,870
things because you know very often the

1416
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:30,329
the strain names don't naturally fit

1417
01:05:28,869 --> 01:05:33,039
together easy they're they're pretty

1418
01:05:30,329 --> 01:05:35,980
unrelated and so you have to kind of

1419
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:38,230
come up with a poetic ways to put those

1420
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:40,240
together and I think that's great

1421
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:42,610
and a lot of the scene is moving away

1422
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:45,879
from it and and so many of your kiemce

1423
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:48,250
of our names are so playful I think that

1424
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:50,320
you must enjoy doing that like what's

1425
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:53,230
your story on how you name your strains

1426
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:55,769
oh I gotta give credit where you know

1427
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:59,260
credits do I mean

1428
01:05:55,769 --> 01:06:02,349
my name's early on yeah they were okay

1429
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:05,160
but they weren't nothing special but

1430
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:11,049
when I started doing name games on

1431
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:13,899
Instagram I I would you know I'll have a

1432
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:17,340
thousand people chime and in you know

1433
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:23,680
with just to name one single strain and

1434
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:27,340
you get so much just you know so many

1435
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:30,759
options and just all kinds of clever

1436
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:34,030
names I mean that's the Instagram

1437
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:37,570
community is is where all all of my best

1438
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:40,450

1439
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:44,160

put out for for this summer so like so

1481
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:27,579
one of my favorite named is the

1482
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:31,329
mozzarella right and and that and that's

1483

right that like that's cool and then and

1486
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:39,520
then a girl's best friend is also I

1487
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:41,980
thought pretty creative so that's Girl

1488
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,779
Scout cookies and chem dog 91 and

1489
01:08:41,979 --> 01:08:45,639
there's so much poetry in that girl's

1490
01:08:43,779 --> 01:08:47,890
best friend it's her dog Girl Scout

1491
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:50,650
cookie and is I just feels you know it

1492
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:52,450
feels good right it does it does I like

1493
01:08:50,649 --> 01:08:54,608
it and then and then one that I'm

1494
01:08:52,449 --> 01:08:57,159
excited to grow this summer I've always

1495
01:08:54,609 --> 01:08:57,609
wanted to grow the Big Sur holy weed and

1496
01:08:57,159 --> 01:08:59,170
and

1497
01:08:57,609 --> 01:09:01,450
and have never had access to the

1498
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:03,699
genetics but then you put out sacred

1499
01:09:01,449 --> 01:09:06,039
snow which is the Big Sur holy weed

1500
01:09:03,699 --> 01:09:08,319
cross with the Humboldt snow and so I

1501
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:11,289
don't know what she's like yet but it's

1502
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:13,449
it's it's not only cool to be able to

1503
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:15,909
play with something that's part Big Sur

1504
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:18,250
holy weed but I like the fact that you

1505
01:09:15,909 --> 01:09:21,099
chose a name that that really focused on

1506
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:24,130
the the holy weeds sacred snow kind of

1507
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:28,359
Baha you know vibe where it came from

1508
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:31,359
oh absolutely and you know that's one of

1509
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:35,950
the things you know I really appreciate

1510
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:39,490
when people go for because not a whole

1511
01:09:35,949 --> 01:09:41,889
lot of people you know get like the Big

1512
01:09:39,489 --> 01:09:44,349
Sur holy weed hybrids they it's not

1513
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:48,039
popular people most people don't care

1514
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:50,920
but every time I run out a Big Sur holy

1515
01:09:48,039 --> 01:09:52,869
weed hybrid they're the [ __ ] best

1516
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:57,250
excuse my language they're the best

1517
01:09:52,869 --> 01:10:01,269
plants in the room you know I mean it

1518
01:09:57,250 --> 01:10:03,699
produces some of the nicest plants it

1519
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:07,030
doesn't matter the hybrid the the sacred

1520
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:09,429
snow they were amazing the chem dog you

1521
01:10:07,029 --> 01:10:11,349
know Times big star holy weed I don't

1522
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:14,050
even think I've even released those ones

1523
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:17,680
yet but those things were beasts you

1524
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:19,960
know it's just it's one of those things

1525
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:21,550
though that it's some of the most

1526
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:26,909
impressive plants and just you know

1527
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:29,590
gorgeous overall plants and yet you know

1528
01:10:26,909 --> 01:10:33,069
something popular is just gonna outsell

1529
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:34,840
it you know a thousand to one for sure I

1530
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:38,859
mean like you you really have to come

1531
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:41,199
across some of the the lineage stories

1532
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:43,239
right written in a magazine about Big

1533
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:45,670
Sur holy weed or like like I didn't even

1534
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:49,179
get turned on to it from cannabis I got

1535
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:51,130
turned on to it by you listening to an

1536
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:53,320
interview with a poet from the Big Sur

1537
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:55,119
region talking about it and I'm like my

1538
01:10:53,319 --> 01:10:58,299
god I'm learning about a you know a new

1539
01:10:55,119 --> 01:11:00,159
strain from a poet at a college and so I

1540
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:03,579
went back track tonight and I found out

1541
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:06,130
about it but because it's not a trending

1542
01:11:03,579 --> 01:11:08,859
thing you're right it's gonna get out

1543
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:11,078
sold all the time but but clearly you've

1544
01:11:08,859 --> 01:11:13,598
got a depth of experience and you're

1545
01:11:11,078 --> 01:11:15,009
excited about it and which just makes me

1546
01:11:13,599 --> 01:11:17,590
more excited to grow it the summer I'm

1547
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:20,050
actually concerned though because you

1548
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:22,360
know I think it's gonna go longer than

1549
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:24,760
the first or second week of October and

1550
01:11:22,359 --> 01:11:28,598
which means that it's gonna have to be

1551
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:30,400
in a in a tent where I live in on Vashon

1552
01:11:28,599 --> 01:11:32,260
Island in Washington because we get the

1553
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:35,019
rains here and everything I've heard

1554
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:37,690
about it is that she's tall she's a big

1555
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:40,150
plant and she's just a big plant she's

1556
01:11:37,689 --> 01:11:42,428
just gonna crush my you know you know my

1557
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:44,618
7 8 foot ceilings on like I know on a

1558
01:11:42,429 --> 01:11:45,908
basic tent so I'm gonna have to figure

1559
01:11:44,618 --> 01:11:49,000
out something special for her for this

1560
01:11:45,908 --> 01:11:52,359
year yeah yeah I mean there's a plant

1561
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,899
and plant for every place she'll be a

1562
01:11:52,359 --> 01:11:54,098
big one

1563
01:11:52,899 --> 01:11:55,839
yeah well that's well that's one of the

1564
01:11:54,099 --> 01:11:58,270
reasons why I've been so hot on Otto

1565
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,520
flowers recently not only do I like them

1566
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:02,500
because you know I'm always selecting

1567
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:05,290
for patients right helping them like get

1568
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:06,908
their their home grows up but also you

1569
01:12:05,289 --> 01:12:13,090
don't have to worry about them growing

1570
01:12:06,908 --> 01:12:15,578
into the lights I've never personally

1571
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:19,869
played with Otto flowers but my buddy

1572
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:23,380
hyb he he's been breeding Otto flowers

1573
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:26,828
for I don't know 15 or 20 years and I'm

1574
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:29,170
actually a gonna be a cell on his Otto

1575
01:12:26,828 --> 01:12:33,939
flower seeds on my Humboldt CSI site

1576
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:36,099
here pretty soon but I I definitely see

1577
01:12:33,939 --> 01:12:39,339
the value and I'll never hate on an auto

1578
01:12:36,099 --> 01:12:41,110
flower because you know hey justjust

1579
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:43,328
like we said you know a time and a place

1580
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:45,368
for all all the plants yeah yeah

1581
01:12:43,328 --> 01:12:48,000
absolutely well if we're gonna if we're

1582
01:12:45,368 --> 01:12:51,848
gonna do that let's let's hit on your

1583
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:54,340
your Australian bastard so so it's it's

1584
01:12:51,849 --> 01:12:57,039
funny it actually where was I recently

1585
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:59,909
that it came up oh that's right it was

1586
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:03,939
at the regenerative agriculture

1587
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:06,670
conference that Joshua Rutherford Dutch

1588
01:13:03,939 --> 01:13:11,259
blooms took across the country I was in

1589
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:13,149
Michigan and they put up wait a minute

1590
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:15,610
no that's not where it was sorry it was

1591
01:13:13,149 --> 01:13:19,388
it was just a couple weeks ago it was

1592
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:22,058
Jeff Lowen fells the pic the picture

1593
01:13:19,389 --> 01:13:24,150
that you put on Instagram of the

1594
01:13:22,059 --> 01:13:28,890
Australian bastard

1595
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:32,460
he's got in his in his slides too as an

1596
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:34,500
example of the wide-ranging variety that

1597
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:38,189
the cannabis plant has that we haven't

1598
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:40,619
even accessed yet oh I liked he stopped

1599
01:13:38,189 --> 01:13:43,229
by at the Emerald cup and sat down for a

1600
01:13:40,619 --> 01:13:46,939
good probably half hour just amazed at

1601
01:13:43,229 --> 01:13:53,029
that Australian bastard he was like wow

1602
01:13:46,939 --> 01:13:53,029
so yeah well he remains excited about it

1603
01:13:54,649 --> 01:13:58,859
he's a good intelligent fellow that's

1604
01:13:58,289 --> 01:14:01,079
for damn sure

1605
01:13:58,859 --> 01:14:03,029
yeah I think I think that between this

1606
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:07,380
summer and next summer it's going to be

1607
01:14:03,029 --> 01:14:08,969
the the real coming to prominence of

1608
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:11,130
Auto flowers I mean certainly the

1609
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:14,100
quality of the seeds have gotten a lot

1610
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:16,380
better recently but also you know Jeff

1611
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:19,590
Lowen fellows has got his book on Auto

1612

1614
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:27,059
turned on to him so I have done like a

1615
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:29,399
whole year of auto flower content like

1616
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:30,900
you know I mean I I'm interviewing well

1617
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:34,170
it just had Jeff here on Vashon Island

1618
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:36,989
to do an auto flower presentation and

1619
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:39,600
then I'm doing an auto flower panel at a

1620
01:14:36,989 --> 01:14:41,460
cultivation classic in Portland but you

1621
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,930
know I'm all like well if this is what

1622
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:45,300
everybody's gonna want to learn about

1623
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:48,930
let's try to get them good information

1624
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:50,640
to start instead of have to untie all

1625
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:53,550
the rumor that usually comes with

1626
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,860
something new right right right right

1627
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:57,480
all right so let's circle back around to

1628
01:14:55,859 --> 01:15:00,719
names so I wanted to get your thoughts

1629
01:14:57,479 --> 01:15:03,509
on this and so you know there's a lot of

1630
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:07,230
people usually kind of green rushar new

1631
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:10,380
business types who advocate for the for

1632
01:15:07,229 --> 01:15:12,209
the simplifying of stray names they

1633
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:15,420
they're all like you know you need to

1634
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:17,909
know too much history to know these

1635
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:21,899
names and unpack them and you know I

1636
01:15:17,909 --> 01:15:23,670
understand how people new to seeds and

1637
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:25,619
breeding and purchasing canvas they want

1638
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:27,329
to simplify it so that they can kind of

1639
01:15:25,619 --> 01:15:29,519
dumb it down so they can sell the most

1640
01:15:27,329 --> 01:15:31,529
of the most people but I personally

1641
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,570
think that feels like some culture

1642
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:35,009
vulture [ __ ] because you know I think

1643
01:15:33,569 --> 01:15:37,409
one of the beautiful things about

1644
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:39,329
cannabis culture is the creation

1645
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:41,639
these names whether or not you're making

1646
01:15:39,329 --> 01:15:48,329
them at your home or you're getting them

1647
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:50,880
from like wonderful crowd crowd crowd

1648
01:15:48,329 --> 01:15:52,769
sourcing you know on Instagram I think

1649
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:55,350
that's a really important aspect that we

1650
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:59,670
need to aggressively preserve in our

1651
01:15:55,350 --> 01:16:02,130
culture what do you think oh I I agree I

1652
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:07,260
mean there's definitely pros and cons to

1653
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:10,409
the whole name game you know I mean the

1654
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:12,810
names have definitely gotten a little

1655
01:16:10,409 --> 01:16:18,710
out of hand but then on the flip side I

1656
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:21,210
mean you you you you really can't just

1657
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:22,500
keep calling something you know

1658
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:25,289
especially generation after generation

1659
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:27,359
after generation blank times blank times

1660
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:29,579
link times like times Leigh if you use

1661
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:31,439
just the original strain names that's

1662
01:16:29,579 --> 01:16:35,340
gonna end up you know getting a little

1663
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:38,879
long so yeah you need original you know

1664
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:43,220
unique names to describe and define and

1665
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:45,690
I like how you put it you know where a

1666
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:48,600
lot of these names don't have anything

1667
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:51,179
to do with you know the plants they're

1668
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:54,810
trying to describe I think that's almost

1669
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:57,930
imperative that the name has something

1670
01:16:54,810 --> 01:17:00,390
to do with the genetics it comes from

1671
01:16:57,930 --> 01:17:02,010
yeah I mean personally I think I think

1672
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:05,130
so I think it helps everybody involved

1673
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:07,260
the the consumer the breeder and and

1674
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:09,180
certainly it's a you know it's just a

1675
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:10,560
valuable thing of our scene right it's

1676
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:12,780
another way for us to express ourselves

1677
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,520
and and certainly there you know some

1678
01:17:12,779 --> 01:17:17,009
names can get us in trouble like you

1679
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:19,050
know you know like gorilla glue and Girl

1680
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:20,940
Scout cookies specifically I mean it's

1681
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:23,220
dumb that that stuff ended up getting

1682
01:17:20,939 --> 01:17:24,869
litigated but but you know all of us in

1683
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:27,300
this scene you need to be aware of that

1684
01:17:24,869 --> 01:17:30,599
and then you know even even you have got

1685
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:33,300
some strain names that you know will

1686
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,800
probably never become popularized in

1687
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:37,320
magazines simply because it's called

1688
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,909
coked-out Girl Scout right you know I

1689
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,869
mean I might when I thought you know the

1690
01:17:38,909 --> 01:17:41,819
so that's Girl Scout cookies and

1691
01:17:39,869 --> 01:17:43,590
Humboldt snow when I first saw that I

1692
01:17:41,819 --> 01:17:46,590
just started howling right because it

1693
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:48,329
it's funny it's an inside joke but but

1694
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:50,849
you know you're not gonna hear coked-out

1695
01:17:48,329 --> 01:17:53,510
Girl Scout in any crossover magazine

1696
01:17:50,849 --> 01:18:00,630
and and and just just for the record

1697
01:17:53,510 --> 01:18:03,960
just for the record I don't use any

1698
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:07,380
drugs whatsoever except for cannabis

1699
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:09,599
maybe an Advil once in a great while but

1700
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:12,179
that's it right I guess I guess that's

1701
01:18:09,599 --> 01:18:14,789
good to clarify III just like the name

1702
01:18:12,179 --> 01:18:17,130
and you know that that name itself is a

1703
01:18:14,789 --> 01:18:18,988
perfect example because there's a lot of

1704
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:20,550
people are like oh that's terrible you

1705
01:18:18,988 --> 01:18:23,009
named it that I'm like you know what

1706
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:25,679
have a little bit of sense of humor and

1707
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:26,190
don't take it so serious and it's

1708
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:27,599
alright

1709
01:18:26,189 --> 01:18:29,250
and know it's not gonna be on the

1710
01:18:27,599 --> 01:18:32,639
magazine it's not gonna be on the

1711
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:34,738
dispensary shelf girl's best friend that

1712
01:18:32,639 --> 01:18:36,989
was named so it can end up on the

1713
01:18:34,738 --> 01:18:38,549
dispensary shelf coked-out Girl Scout

1714
01:18:36,988 --> 01:18:40,618
okay that's just for fun right there

1715
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:43,710
yeah right on and you know and in and

1716
01:18:40,618 --> 01:18:45,598
even though it's you know it's a it's a

1717
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:47,310
bold pile it still actually fits the

1718
01:18:45,599 --> 01:18:50,730
cross right Girl Scout cookies and

1719
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:52,770
Humboldt snow it's it fits it does so

1720
01:18:50,729 --> 01:18:54,479
rhinos all right cool well I think

1721
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:56,610
that's pride enough on naming I love

1722
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:58,618
that that whole topic though so all

1723
01:18:56,609 --> 01:19:00,809
right so next question as far as you

1724
01:18:58,618 --> 01:19:05,908
know a lot of people say that you should

1725
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:08,280
not breed with a feminized see a mother

1726
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:12,238
from a feminized seed what are your

1727
01:19:08,279 --> 01:19:14,429
thoughts on that complete I'll shut

1728
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:17,069
those people down every single time I'm

1729
01:19:14,429 --> 01:19:20,789
like if you breed with a Sour Diesel a

1730
01:19:17,069 --> 01:19:24,389
chem dog and OG Kush and X a Y or Z

1731
01:19:20,789 --> 01:19:26,729
you're already breeding with a feminized

1732
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:28,800
seed so if you want to breed with

1733
01:19:26,729 --> 01:19:30,899
anything popular and I'm including Girl

1734
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,550
Scout cookies cherry pie is this that

1735
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:33,658
the other

1736
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:36,239
everything that stems from any of those

1737
01:19:33,658 --> 01:19:39,059
if you're gonna sit on that high horse

1738
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:41,669
and be like oh you can't do that I'm

1739
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:45,449
like yeah well you can't do that so

1740
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:47,940
we're you what are you breeding with and

1741
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:49,618
and and and I already already hit the

1742
01:19:47,939 --> 01:19:51,479
whole land race thing where you don't

1743
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:55,738
know what exactly those seeds are that

1744
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:58,919
you're you're you're growing so yeah all

1745
01:19:55,738 --> 01:20:00,598
right all right I'll get good so just

1746
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:04,230
just a couple more things before we wrap

1747
01:20:00,599 --> 01:20:09,779
up here you know for for folks who

1748
01:20:04,229 --> 01:20:12,449
our longtime multi-generational growers

1749
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:15,210
probably everywhere but I've run into it

1750
01:20:12,449 --> 01:20:17,880
most in the Emerald triangle area you

1751
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:20,220
know it said sometimes bye-bye

1752
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,560
longtime growers that certain strains

1753
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:24,840
that they've got are kept close and not

1754
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,940
shared and I was just curious as

1755
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:29,850
somebody who did not grow up in Humboldt

1756
01:20:26,939 --> 01:20:32,129
I can only guess why those are not

1757
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:34,200
shared and so you know something you

1758
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:36,510
know they they don't want it to get in

1759
01:20:34,199 --> 01:20:38,399
the hands and be belittled by pollen

1760
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:41,070
chuckers maybe or maybe it's like a

1761
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:43,799
family secret special sauce for their

1762
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:45,179
for their seeds like but but you live

1763
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:48,090
there and you grew up and you probably

1764
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:50,010
have some of these so so what what are

1765
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:53,610
you locals what's the motivation that

1766
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:57,390
locals have to hold cuts close and not

1767
01:20:53,609 --> 01:20:59,849
share them well it's easy economics

1768
01:20:57,390 --> 01:21:04,110
I mean supply and demand if the supply

1769
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:08,310
is small you know I mean you know you're

1770
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:11,279
gonna fetch it you know a high dollar so

1771
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:14,789
it's it's essentially always been about

1772
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:17,670
the money on that tip that's the only

1773
01:21:14,789 --> 01:21:22,319
reason really to hoard anything you know

1774
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:25,890
I mean when everybody has it a perfect

1775
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:28,829
example is say a purple Arkell when I

1776
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:32,970
first got purple Arkell back around 2001

1777
01:21:28,829 --> 01:21:35,550
2002 not a whole lot of people had it

1778
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:38,579
you know and the people who had it were

1779
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:40,529
you know if you were you know you have

1780
01:21:38,579 --> 01:21:42,930
that trust and everything they'd be like

1781
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:44,429
you know here have a cut but don't go

1782
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:47,489
giving it out so you know a bunch of

1783
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:49,739
people you know fast forward you know

1784
01:21:47,488 --> 01:21:54,089
four or five years from there you know

1785
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:58,079
it essentially or it eventually got out

1786
01:21:54,090 --> 01:22:00,480
and you know about popular tons of

1787
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:05,010
people had it and you know then the

1788
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:07,979
price started dropping on it and a lot

1789
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:09,360
of people you know aren't really quality

1790
01:22:07,979 --> 01:22:12,419
growers they don't really have a love

1791
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:14,759
for their craft and they're just trying

1792
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:18,029
to pump out something with the name and

1793
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:20,640
not giving two shits you know and so

1794
01:22:18,029 --> 01:22:23,699
you know they watered down for everybody

1795
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:25,500
else and eventually you know but you

1796
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:28,199
know if if you hold something tight and

1797
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:32,220
you keep it tight you know there that

1798
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:33,840
demand is never gonna add you know yeah

1799
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:36,869
and you can put it out itself you can do

1800
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:40,110
crosses with it and and so you know it

1801
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:41,970
may not be the level of popular that

1802
01:22:40,109 --> 01:22:44,309
something gets to be when everybody's

1803
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:47,100
growing it for a little while but you

1804
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:48,750
essentially have got you know a monopoly

1805
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:50,490
on that and on that intellectual

1806
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:51,899
property if you will and it's something

1807
01:22:50,489 --> 01:22:54,119
and you know I would say that we're

1808
01:22:51,899 --> 01:22:57,149
probably in that arc right now with

1809
01:22:54,119 --> 01:22:59,849
Kappa laters Mac won right we're we're

1810
01:22:57,149 --> 01:23:03,509
you know at the beginning people lost

1811
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:06,660
their freakin minds and and you know it

1812
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:08,489
was you know barely available and just

1813
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:10,680
through like whispers and friends around

1814
01:23:08,489 --> 01:23:13,469
you know that we're near where you live

1815
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:15,960
and then like the first flowers you know

1816
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:18,030
we're like wildly overpriced in the

1817
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:20,699
market but now we've got to the point

1818
01:23:18,029 --> 01:23:22,529
now much later that that you know a lot

1819
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:24,630
lots of people have got the cut gotten

1820
01:23:22,529 --> 01:23:27,960
the cut one way or another probably by

1821
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:30,300
by breaking caps rules around it right

1822
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:32,640
yeah exactly and and now every you know

1823
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:35,070
everybody's hitting it with their you

1824
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:38,400
know hitting it with everything and so

1825
01:23:35,069 --> 01:23:40,439
you know we are probably on the far side

1826
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:42,210
of that arc which is why you know even

1827
01:23:40,439 --> 01:23:44,699
probably cap himself you know he's moved

1828
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:47,130
on to his his next project and his

1829
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:49,109
crosses with it right but it's

1830
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:52,020
interesting though that to watch that

1831
01:23:49,109 --> 01:23:54,569
that arc from nobody's got it and it's a

1832
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:57,120
rumor and then there's just pictures and

1833
01:23:54,569 --> 01:23:59,609
then and then it becomes kind of

1834
01:23:57,119 --> 01:24:01,529
available at an insane price and then it

1835
01:23:59,609 --> 01:24:09,059
kind of gets washed out you you know you

1836
01:24:01,529 --> 01:24:12,449
bring up a perfect example to so I get

1837
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:16,590
asked you know from time to time you

1838
01:24:12,449 --> 01:24:18,449
know just friends that friends of mine

1839
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:21,300
are like we got to hold this tight you

1840
01:24:18,449 --> 01:24:23,159
know we can't let it get out you know

1841
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:25,110
blah blah blah blah when people get it

1842
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:27,090
you know then it won't be worth nothing

1843
01:24:25,109 --> 01:24:29,789
I'm like why are we worried about that I

1844
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:31,050
mean you know I'm working on ten

1845
01:24:29,789 --> 01:24:31,920
projects that are probably going to be

1846
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:34,289
better than that

1847
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:39,470
you know in a year or two you know and

1848
01:24:34,289 --> 01:24:43,170
so you know I think it's it's fear-based

1849
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:44,820
you know people get stuck with you know

1850
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:46,409
thinking oh they only have one little

1851
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:48,929
thing of value and they got to hold that

1852
01:24:46,409 --> 01:24:51,359
tight I'm like man I got so many things

1853
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:52,890
of value I don't even care right it's a

1854
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:55,799
the people acting on a scarcity

1855
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:57,720
mentality right yeah and honestly that's

1856
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:59,250
how I feel about popping my seeds like I

1857
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:01,110
have lots of respect for people who

1858
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:04,350
collect seeds I get it it's a it's a

1859
01:25:01,109 --> 01:25:06,239
it's a thing and I'm not really a seed

1860
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:08,370
collector I like to get my hands on good

1861
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:10,800
seeds and then I grow them you know

1862
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:12,300
that's the point yeah and you know you

1863
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,369
know certainly you know people who are

1864
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:16,050
breeding they want to sit on stock for

1865
01:25:14,369 --> 01:25:18,029
you know they're building their palette

1866
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:20,760
of colors for a future breeding program

1867
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:22,710
right but but but since that's not my

1868
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:25,140
shtick I just like to grow plants I'm

1869
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:26,699
all like well hell I'm gonna well like

1870
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:27,960
even your seats you know that are there

1871
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:29,460
sitting in front of me I'm looking

1872
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:32,100
forward to popping all this stuff this

1873
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:33,779
summer and and because you know what

1874
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:35,430
you're gonna you're gonna put more stuff

1875
01:25:33,779 --> 01:25:38,460
in the market next year you know yeah

1876
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:41,360
and so you know so long as there are

1877
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:44,819
people like you who are doing the work

1878
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:48,000
of selecting and sifting so I don't have

1879
01:25:44,819 --> 01:25:50,189
to I don't have to do that myself and

1880
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,840
there's certainly no question that that

1881
01:25:50,189 --> 01:25:54,149
you're gonna keep on you know putting

1882
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,920
out quality things so so there's no

1883
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:58,469
reason to have that scarcity mentality

1884
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:02,609
if you got seeds pop them and grow them

1885
01:25:58,470 --> 01:26:04,949
oh absolutely my boy is a underrated and

1886
01:26:02,609 --> 01:26:08,549
Garth cultivator they got this new rap

people just grow in their own you know I

1908
01:26:58,229 --> 01:27:04,529
mean and you know that's that's the

1909
01:27:00,569 --> 01:27:06,719
whole you know message of that of that

1910
01:27:04,529 --> 01:27:09,869
track I think they teamed up with Mendo

1911
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:11,850
dope on that track too so you know yeah

1912
01:27:09,869 --> 01:27:13,019
well we're big fans here every but you

1913
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:15,030
know liberating the plant

1914
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:18,510
everybody becoming a gardener you know

1915
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:20,429
it's like Eliot you know there's a lot

1916
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:22,829
of truth to it you know like there's no

1917
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:24,869
reason why everybody shouldn't have a

1918
01:27:22,829 --> 01:27:27,269
few plants in their yard every summer

1919
01:27:24,869 --> 01:27:29,340
it's super easy to grow the sunshine is

1920
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:30,720
free it gives you an emotional

1921
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:33,360
connection to the plant

1922
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:35,550
you know nothing tastes as good and as

1923
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:38,099
emotionally as awesome as the stuff that

1924
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:39,449
you drew yourself versus the you know

1925
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:42,090
the stuff that you're gonna pick up at a

1926
01:27:39,449 --> 01:27:44,460
dispensary and and that doesn't mean

1927
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:46,860
that it's gonna hurt the cannabis market

1928
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:49,289
either because like you know I grow my

1929
01:27:46,859 --> 01:27:50,969
patient grow and then I also go to the

1930
01:27:49,289 --> 01:27:53,189
store it's both it's like tomatoes right

1931
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:55,110
I grow tomatoes in every store I grow

1932
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:57,239
tomatoes every summer but you also know

1933
01:27:55,109 --> 01:28:00,179
I'm buying them at the store - oh yeah

1934
01:27:57,239 --> 01:28:03,479
oh and and that's that's that's a

1935
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:06,630
perfect one too though that's the whole

1936
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:09,569
reason people ask a lot on Instagram

1937
01:28:06,630 --> 01:28:11,670
like what's the point of you know

1938
01:28:09,569 --> 01:28:15,000
growing or working with this Australian

1939
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:16,770
bastard cannabis and just - you

1940
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,170
mentioned earlier you said you know

1941
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:20,550
you're Australian bastard cannabis it's

1942
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:24,720
not mine

1943
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:27,440
the kid who sourced it you know painted

1944
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:30,840
forests farms painted forests organics

1945
01:28:27,439 --> 01:28:31,259
that is his and I'm just working with

1946
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:33,449
him

1947
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:35,760
just to clarify that fair enough yeah

1948
01:28:33,449 --> 01:28:40,220
but but the Australia bastard cannabis

1949
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:44,100
it is something that people will not

1950
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:45,810
recognize as cannabis so you can grow it

1951
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:49,620
in your backyard you can grow it you

1952
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:53,460
know now the way it is right now it's

1953
01:28:49,619 --> 01:28:56,670
unrefined yeah it's it's like the

1954
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:59,340
ruderalis that created the you know Auto

1955
01:28:56,670 --> 01:29:03,149
flowers before it got

1956
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:05,520
and you know bread for quality so it is

1957
01:29:03,149 --> 01:29:08,009
in its bare-bones building blocks and

1958
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:11,550
we're given people the opportunity to

1959
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:13,920
breed it themselves or to you know work

1960
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:17,610
from the starting point of quality

1961
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:19,949
hybrids to breed it so when you say that

1962
01:29:17,609 --> 01:29:21,479
it's not recognizable clearly the plant

1963
01:29:19,949 --> 01:29:23,069
itself visually does not look like

1964
01:29:21,479 --> 01:29:25,169
cannabis it looks like a fern or

1965
01:29:23,069 --> 01:29:27,119
something it's weird but but but you've

1966
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:29,730
had the flower I'm assuming at this

1967
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:31,829
point when you do the do the flowers

1968
01:29:29,729 --> 01:29:33,839
look like cannabis leaves do this

1969
01:29:31,829 --> 01:29:35,460
alright so so when you if you got a bag

1970
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,050
of it you'd be like okay this is weed

1971
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:40,109
even though the plant does not look like

1972
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:43,829
it yeah yeah everybody recognizes weed

1973
01:29:40,109 --> 01:29:46,979
or cannabis by its leaf you know yeah I

1974
01:29:43,829 --> 01:29:49,170
mean if it doesn't have that canvass

1975
01:29:46,979 --> 01:29:52,019
leaf whether it's indica leaf or sativa

1976
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:54,480
leaf it does not look like cannabis you

1977
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:55,740
can walk by a fully flower adapt plant

1978
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:57,799
of Australia bastard

1979
01:29:55,739 --> 01:30:01,769
and be like oh that kind of looks like

1980
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:04,110
yeah you don't have the leaf yeah it

1981
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:06,480
looks like a shrub you know it's a

1982
01:30:04,109 --> 01:30:08,039
really strange plant so right on well on

1983
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:10,379
that on that fun note let's wrap it up

couple different ways that you can do

2000
01:30:43,109 --> 01:30:48,359
that I definitely recommend that you

2001
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:52,380
follow his Instagram it is enjoyable and

2002
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:56,399
educational at the same time so so his

2003
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:59,630
Instagram is CSI underscore Humboldt and

2004
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:02,819
don't get confused there is another old

2005
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:04,680
CSI Humboldt Instagram profile that

2006
01:31:02,819 --> 01:31:07,049
comes up but you don't want the one with

2007
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:09,030
hardly any followers his is the one that

2008
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:11,239
he keeps updated is is you know two

2009
01:31:09,029 --> 01:31:12,420
hundred thousand followers or more and

2010
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:14,519
you

2011
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:16,079
follow that because you'll be able to

2012
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:18,480
watch the progress of this Australian

2013
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:21,119
bastard plant as well which you can see

2014
01:31:18,479 --> 01:31:23,000
pictures of there now if you want to get

2015

yourself get your hands on some of

2016
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:30,029
Caleb's seeds you want to go through his

2017
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:32,699
distribution website and that's you flip

2018
01:31:30,029 --> 01:31:36,840
the name around that's at Humboldt CSI

2019
01:31:32,698 --> 01:31:39,479
so he you know he breeds as CSI Humboldt

2020
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:43,340
but the distributor is called Humboldt

2021
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:46,619
CSI so that's at Humble CSI comm and

2022
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:49,050
that's got not only his feminized lines

2023
01:31:46,619 --> 01:31:50,670
but also his reg lines and probably

2024
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:53,400
eventually the Australian bastard lines

2025
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:56,130
and and your buddy hives Auto flowers

2026
01:31:53,399 --> 01:31:57,960

2027
01:31:56,130 --> 01:32:00,800

2028
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:03,960
