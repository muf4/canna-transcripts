1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,560
hey it's Shango from the shaping fire

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,778
podcast you know a few weeks ago I was

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,058
at the Washington cannabis summit and

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:11,039
Kevin Jo Durie was there up from

5
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:12,089
Wonderland nursery in Humboldt County

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,949
where he lives

7
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:15,929
and he was on that cannabis as

8
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:17,669
agriculture panel and it was a fantastic

9
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,679
panel actually the whole panel was great

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,380
but you know I'm a big fan of Kevin Jody

11
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,539
and so I pulled out all the bits with

12
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:28,049
Kevin talking and edit them all together

13
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,340
and posting it here for you today and so

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,800
you know you can kind of considered a

15
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:33,420
whole bunch of Kevin Jody gems he talks

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,070
a little bit about terpenes of course he

17
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,809
talks a bit about strange choice a

18
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,820
little bit about russet mites and you

19
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:41,820
know a little bit of this and that but

20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,530
this is all solid gold so thanks to the

21
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,649
canvas Alliance for letting me record

22
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,420
and thanks for Kevin for coming up and

23
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,420
sharing his insights with us here you go

24
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:02,189
Washington your exceptional instigator

25
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:06,150
work with my canvas is pretty expensive

26
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:11,700
in terms of my ways trying to get about

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:15,090
21 years and I always as even as child

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,659
believed we would end up here I knew

29
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,289
what some morning that Canada's

30
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:22,329
become except in a different view and I

31
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:25,868
approached it from that point of view

32
00:01:22,328 --> 00:01:27,609
and so I try to understand as much as I

33
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:29,469
could about what I was doing so that I

34
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:31,149
would have a future I'm looking to some

35
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:33,899
point I end up here and I knew that I

36
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:38,950
would have to be allowed skillset to

37
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:42,039
survive so to speak and a lot of money

38
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,710
studying cannabis and working in this

39
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:47,049
was trying to understand primarily how

40
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:48,548
does one get cannabis to the table which

41
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:51,009
means are we headed to the market and

42
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:52,780
then it's really the most important

43
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:55,659
thing to me because that dictates

44
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,299
everything backwards and then we put

45
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:00,670
ethics with it you actually have a very

46
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:02,409
sustainable situation so we use combine

47
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,769
how do we get product to the table and

48
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,810
how do we do it in that the core manner

49
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:09,909
what you have with the cannabis is it

50
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,039
was held in check for so long

51
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:16,150
that what we did was we created an

52
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:18,879
entire of a library of genetics that

53
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,539
were improperly source what we did all

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,039
these years is we we chose canvas of the

55
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:27,310
stealth so we took away a lot of

56
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,989
desirability and smell and we use all

57
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,989
these illegal pesticides and fungicides

58
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:34,629
and PTR's plant growth regulators to

59
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:36,819
assist us and what happened over all

60
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:41,439
these years decades is that we created

61
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:43,149
the gene the week we chose varieties

62
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,060
that were Trinity and we

63
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,010
to have any bottleneck room and so what

64
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,920
you have is you have a secret population

65
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:54,128
in cannabis varieties that we use that

66
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:56,018
are inherently prone to all these

67
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:59,500
different pathogenic problems as

68
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:02,200
problems inherently in certain

69
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,848
circumstances exceptionally hungry for

70
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:05,919
exception at night nutrient loads

71
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:08,078
because everywhere always gave their

72
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,358
plants the most fertile soil the best

73
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:12,549
situation and when we select in that

74
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:14,530
situation what you select is plants that

75
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:16,420
thrive in perfection or I live in a

76
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,250
vacuum what I want to see is a play that

77
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:24,189
really doesn't is treated in a horrible

78
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:27,039
situation that didn't get that we

79
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:29,229
actually work with in Seoul I don't know

80
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,780
many campuses a nursery operated I have

81
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:34,119
a farm so I'm kind of herbal so I hope

82
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,280
hot stuff going on but I'm not primarily

83
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,289
for nursery work and in California

84
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,829
basically created the modern nursery

85
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:44,289
model in terms of walking store nursery

86
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:47,079
from it was never done prior to that and

87
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:49,209
I created the nursery problem

88
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:51,069
dispensaries where the dispensary itself

89
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,560
created in stock so the last ten years

90
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:56,828
I've been applying what I learned in the

91
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,859
thirty years prior and rather that what

92
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:03,219
we found was that most cultivators are

93
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:06,069
basically praying for success and

94
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:06,969
they're there unfortunately praying in

95
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:08,530
the wrong direction

96
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:11,020
because what they

97
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,818
cheese products that are trendy with no

98
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,830
consideration for where they're going to

99
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:16,509
cultivate it and no acceleration to the

100
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:20,379
cultivation methodologies or the

101
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:23,649
operators and no diversity and what

102
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:25,240
happens is all she pushes an example

103
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:27,129
just because it's just such a hot water

104
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,050
where we live in California so everyone

105
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:30,639
wants to grow algae but oh geez a

106
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,410
massive family it's sort of hanging a

107
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,180
lot of cultivar emoji you get you might

108
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,360
get one that's exceptionally high really

109
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,668
prone exceptionally the tracks prone and

110
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,000
now we have rusted and Brooklyns that

111
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:45,839
are everywhere the promos also epidermal

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,180
layers thick top hasn't resist and so

113
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:51,250
people use these inferior cultivars and

114
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,870
they wonder why they're in the little

115
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,660
crafting table of the entire time to

116
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,959
cultivate and so what we try to do

117
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,660
through the normal nursery model was do

118
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,329
population sense so our idea was I go to

119
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,139
large populations of lands and we find

120
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:09,948
the outliers we find plants

121
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:13,158
ability to resist naturally and this is

122
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:15,199
a normal agriculture Erasmus I looking

123
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:16,550
in that I get to tour all kinds of neat

124
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,370
the symphonies I get to see some really

125
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,610
interesting stuff but I had to go and do

126
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,949
a tour of the largest redwood nursery

127
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,050
propagation facility in the world

128
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:29,300
so Rita is the world's largest record

129
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,550
producer they're also the largest event

130
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,228
with nursery I meant to talk to the lady

131
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,069
grabber who's been cultivating there for

132
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:35,718
28 years

133
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:38,028
he's involved in a reading project

134
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:40,848
that'll take 150 years and so mainly

135
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:42,560
carries the first 30 Republic but he

136
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:44,658
took me out into the it was mother

137
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,930
library so to speak which was acres and

138
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:50,509
acres of forest and it was from every

139
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,449
thousand eight years of redwoods the

140
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:55,699
biologist selected one as the greatest

141
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:57,978
of that thousand acres and they brought

142
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:00,080
that Hellman as I had to tour entire

143
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:02,088
fire sort of nothing of trees but then

144
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:06,228
it is selected from thousand acre lives

145
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:07,519
and one of these trees was known and it

146
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:09,408
was I mean one hundred and eighty

147
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,508
percent greater growth than any other

148
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:13,038
red whatever the better recording but

149
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:14,990
they were intelligent enough to not

150
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,728
follow Robin they did not allow to prop

151
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,129
that Baltimore what they did is they put

152
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:20,418
it so many miles from the other plants

153
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,639
that work with so that these patches

154
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:25,549
he's forty to give a farce of that

155
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,288
specific were laid out so they had a

156
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,740
diversity so even though it's within the

157
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:33,378
same family the cultivars have been

158
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,259
separated and bereta but it takes my

159
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:36,689
hundred

160
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,000
20 years to do see propagation and so

161
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:42,230
this phrase was it takes a 100 years

162
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,230
before she gets sexy

163
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,670
I thought something that make understand

164
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,230
that what we're doing now is we're we're

165
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,300
that we're the beginning of this where

166
00:06:49,230 --> 00:07:01,800
we're the foundation of this is

167
00:06:51,300 --> 00:07:03,689
California for days in this world in

168
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,560
terms of poverty approach called our

169
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:09,149
selection how do we approach I most

170
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,949
people have no clue that that means it's

171
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:13,319
a it's a rate law a pair of hands maybe

172
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:15,110
because really most cultivators in

173
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,879
Canada said never been in mainstream

174
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,160
attire but Washington that can start or

175
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,829
that's been legal for a while now so

176
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,630
that's been very uh I only need to come

177
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:26,250
here for the years that I have because

178
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:28,350
you get seen integration at a level that

179
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,990
you don't have to California in

180
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,370
California don't want to observe

181
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,410
situation where I get to work with the

182
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,019
tremendous number of professors from

183
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,180
universities scientists from private

184
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:41,789
organizations because they can't touch

185
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,290
Guinness it's they can't happen in hand

186
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,300
so to speak we can't have it at a school

187
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,560
they can have better facilities and so

188
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,290
they fly guys like these that are

189
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,170
willing to play detective and we

190
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:55,420
chase problems that we have cultivars

191
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,759
deceiver resist and they come in and

192
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,250
analyze and say this one is virally

193
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,469
infected this one it's not let's see

194
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,360
what happens when we probe and so what

195
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:07,240
yes I have happening is you start having

196
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,460
this intersection between the science

197
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,500
component and the actual ad component

198
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:14,889
because the 200 Rafi different worlds

199
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,420
and it's me Sciences it's understanding

200
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:18,699
but it's back you've got a whole little

201
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,670
variables constant in order to solve for

202
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:23,469
X you can't do that as a farmer and I

203
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,840
apart - and I've been fireman for a

204
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:29,860
really long time and other organic level

205
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:33,129
and so it's it's an attempt to try to

206
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,979
understand how does one as a farmer take

207
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:37,990
the information from normal agricultural

208
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,900
practices that are so organically based

209
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,729
biologically driven and then apply it to

210
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:47,279
what we do and actually have some

211
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,280
success and your scene

212
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:59,099
trying to figure out how song and we

213
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,179
have to be able to understand some of

214
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,180
the stuff going on this time he won't

215
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:05,250
proactive in our approach and like I

216
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:07,649
said in Prior for me I like to work on

217
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,929
populations what I find is that if I

218
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:12,208
want to get a good good friend you might

219
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:14,219
find him in groovy too you might find it

220
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:17,250
a little better that's good 200 you

221
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,870
might find a really decent person mm you

222
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,389
get 20,000 you can find something

223
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,709
exceptional and that's how I see ken is

224
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:24,899
called the power selection to his

225
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:27,268
population and it's been very difficult

226
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,339
for us you can burn these black market

227
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:31,259
operations who here so these incredible

228
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,810
populations that I work with a highly

229
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:35,909
legal parent or not and I think as a

230
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:38,638
farm operator here it's but all the art

231
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:41,399
and all the work all prior stuff that

232
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,110
was all through the desire for people to

233
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,149
really bring the cameras where you were

234
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,490
really about it willing to take the risk

235
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:50,458
it's a hunt the product that is going to

236
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,379
work for you whatever your needs were

237
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:54,750
and that was a common need so it's fine

238
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:56,278
and if it was from the distal needs and

239
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,399
perfect than it is but personally each

240
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:01,769
that's training but it requires you to

241
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,870
be able to have enough of that ability

242
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:06,870
to understand what is it you're seeking

243
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,909
a kind of ascertain that and what we've

244
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,318
tried to do is we've frightened to take

245
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:12,078
these cultivars with these big

246
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:15,240
populations and then my use of

247
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,159
milwaukee's technology to map them and

248
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,700
what it does it allows people not to be

249
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,469
able to find in that called

250
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,379
you know an exceptionally academically

251
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:25,540
resistant cultivars that we have that

252
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:28,120
are exception for your problems I call

253
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:30,939
them either of their desire because of

254
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,220
their they're too risky for cultivators

255
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,620
to take a gamble on and so what happens

256
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,420
is you end up having to back down the

257
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,759
populations you work with you know to

258
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:42,250
find specific cultivars the markets

259
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:45,059
trendy but when you chase those trends

260
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,769
much a seesaw brightness of accuracy and

261
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:50,519
what we try to recommend individuals is

262
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:53,439
a diversity in terms of what would be

263
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,779
diverse in terms of resistance so that

264
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,880
we have the greatest chance of survival

265
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:59,949
of a portion of the ground and then we

266
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,470
work on diversity in terms of market

267
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,509
velocity how fast those products will be

268
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,430
through the system so you have things

269
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:08,980
that are trending very quickly but there

270
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:12,189
is smaller markets and things that are

271
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:14,470
very stable and in the larger markets

272
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,200
but lower price points and so you try to

273
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,580
get this clear intersection of what is

274
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,910
the plan that you're trying to work with

275
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:25,360
and how you get it to function for your

276
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:27,039
weighted unique the concept Marla

277
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,419
culture is an important one and we just

278
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,000
had this discussion this morning about

279
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:32,740
the banana and so the benefit because

280
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,250
six exhibit assault we don't want my

281
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,049
Nana's

282
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,769
was because it was no more than an

283
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:38,089
estate

284
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:40,819
ergonomic that went out all the bananas

285
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:43,070
and so they [ __ ] another than in Tikal

286
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,140
it's called Cavendish the Cavendish come

287
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,790
on so they have finished all the part

288
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:49,039
about the country that they introduced

289
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,839
it and lo and behold it works clearly

290
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,649
and it's resistant to Fusarium and

291
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,509
everybody's happy

292
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:55,939
well why did that kind of are rarely

293
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:57,439
succeed it wasn't about the resistance

294
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,180
as much as he thought it was because it

295
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,790
didn't have to be refrigerated when you

296
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:04,639
move it it can handle 45 to 55 degrees

297
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:06,139
on movement so it changed economic

298
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,299
consideration of that cultivar

299
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:10,580
dramatically it made it to where they

300
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:12,529
cheapen the price of shipping it so that

301
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,620
one was a resistant but it's cheaper to

302
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:17,269
move and then just in the last year is

303
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,950
another folder Fusarium that is

304
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,360
attacking the cat additional Department

305
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,360
so now we'll obviously another one of

306
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,209
these banana epidemics let them in have

307
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,769
and that's what I see within canvas we

308
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,988
see certain populations that are

309
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:33,078
exception and problem we notice when you

310
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:34,579
say who came in we noticed when what

311
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:36,708
pans been here for a long time the

312
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:38,868
background the 1518 years - I remember

313
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:41,058
when I first came in and I can be traced

314
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:42,889
it back in the Oregon roads or the road

315
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:44,238
scrubs with you can kind of see where

316
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:46,129
things will follow me

317
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:50,089
but then the growth light that came in

318
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:51,980
for us elected followed these these

319
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:54,259
issues are relatively even with a speed

320
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,909
of the statement is incredible and so

321
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:57,409
it's the same situation where the only

322
00:12:55,909 --> 00:13:00,948
way you're going to find out resistance

323
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:03,289
on Mises Academy and so the entire team

324
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:05,178
everything is protected as possible all

325
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:06,738
the time in the production end of it but

326
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:08,769
really there's very little honor indeed

327
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:11,179
done in cannabis where they're actually

328
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:15,619
exposing these plants to these issues

329
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:18,318
and detest them there is some for me I

330
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:19,550
can do it because I own a nursery so my

331
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:21,889
nurse was a little different

332
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:25,370
nurseries because of my location of Mon

333
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:28,220
Ami and in English that is I supplied

334
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:31,820
people who produce touch for a long time

335
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:34,129
and so my estimate that the work that

336
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,350
the nursery creates money anywhere

337
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:38,899
between 150 to 200 million dollars a

338
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,209
year in product grown from the cutting

339
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:44,720
so last point years I might be about to

340
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:47,088
be 20 about to canvas on the dating so I

341
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,459
was differently I can create a hundred

342
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:51,920
million dollars myself but my nursery

343
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:56,319
stock created approximately that much

344
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:59,149
now and it's it's a huge responsibility

345
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,610
in your mind understand how you maintain

346
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:05,419
this kind of relationship with the

347
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:07,639
farmers and how he T people be solvent

348
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:10,759
how you keep the movement father and

349
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:13,100
what we see now is basically I've got

350
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:15,500
calls from somebody right grab something

351
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:19,190
from some onion known as any day that I

352
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,620
none and so for us you know in order to

353
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,870
make it work the way I do at the tonnage

354
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,019
grounds is if he only typically release

355
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,339
a cultivar a year after selection and so

356
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:30,818
what that does is it lets me take a

357
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:32,959
little plan and

358
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:35,809
Productions which is indoor/outdoor

359
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,518
greenhouse and went back and those four

360
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,958
different situations have rattle

361
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,589
different impacts on the collage

362
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:45,138
performance it's on the logical trades

363
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:47,420
desirability to the market and so all of

364
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:49,669
this stuff takes time so you have a

365
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:52,159
situation we were all operated using

366
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:55,519
stock that we gathered unless you start

367
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:59,719
to DNA into the beauty of the galaxy and

368
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,339
I love the nation so it's not pushing

369
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,500
abilities that I've used the tool

370
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:05,569
because it lets me get a really clear

371
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,839
moment where the pockets in America

372
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:10,938
diversity and that way we can start

373
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,160
saying listen less diversify what we're

374
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:13,909
working with genetically and then in

375
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:16,039
these things

376
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:19,429
what information we happen and how we

377
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:22,360
start to work with it and what a trustee

378
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:24,409
do all these ears which just costs of my

379
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,850
friends and the passages we don't

380
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:29,448
believe the stress was like us very

381
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:31,459
often with this i shared the bats which

382
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:33,469
are a disinformation she had the

383
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:35,750
bachelors are babies love spinning the

384
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,920
whole the proprietary didn't put it in a

385
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,320
situation where all these special

386
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:40,779
individual

387
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,520
well we were ranked in the canvas came

388
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:43,990
to the kinder I was to use this

389
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,879
fundamentally that's what makes up the

390
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:51,250
chemist and is made up of a pregnant or

391
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:52,779
are there any divisions how he is and to

392
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,980
meet that that's the most important part

393
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:55,449
because that's the human connection

394
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,940
that's what allows us have a different

395
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:59,860
industry mind that's what my skin is to

396
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,010
be unique in the way it is it allows us

397
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,769
to actually create an industry based off

398
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:08,049
of our relationship with the plant you

399
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:10,480
see very little relationship with planes

400
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:12,639
whose relationship we plant and I'm not

401
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,769
auntie business at all but that

402
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,740
shouldn't be the driving force all

403
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:19,659
weekends and so so much of the stuff

404
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:23,440
that we're trying to understand is is

405
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:26,850
highly take the information from very

406
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,140
intelligent scientists researchers

407
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,519
nursery operators who work with

408
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:32,259
regulatory process

409
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:34,600
and how do you take that information and

410
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:37,120
how to apply it to what you do because

411
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,500
that it's applicability to matters if

412
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,870
anything you get out of talking to me

413
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,559
it's really about again the product of

414
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,509
the table

415
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,549
everything else is conversation like

416
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:47,019
that's my main direction and I hope

417
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:49,769
today that we can get into some stuff

418
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:57,980
how do we do that so thank you very much

419
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:59,659
I think so much it is money driven

420
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,580
a little bit products that sold in

421
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:02,539
cannabis people that's mine may be much

422
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,670
more expensive they are

423
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:07,730
I mean what I wish I saw this article

424
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:10,400
years ago it was about that CDC specific

425
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,950
bacteria as I said that's fascinating I

426
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,780
said and how they're possibly targets by

427
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,279
itself so I read researched it I found

428
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:17,930
the company that made the drive and then

429
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:19,879
I found the real act product which was

430
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,170
the same product it was five bucks to

431
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,630
the Container there's a hundred bucks

432
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,730
again this early enterprise and so the

433
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,340
problem this campus people can't sue

434
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,900
really a lot of authority to come after

435
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,149
you in court we didn't have the ability

436
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,280
to say listen you've solely surprised

437
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,950
that you could on the snow well you can

438
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:39,109
now and I think with the accountability

439
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,390
you'll have a change in it but it's it's

440
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:43,809
we have some people all the time any

441
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:47,360
product you see this working that well

442
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:49,159
have that stuff checked because there's

443
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,549
nothing that knocks anything back

444
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,620
organically but the counter

445
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:57,019
slow mister process it doesn't just wipe

446
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:59,359
it out and so anything received and it's

447
00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:01,220
moving too well it's too trendy it's too

448
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,639
pricey we just wait and then it comes

449
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,380
out of analyst and there's ultimately

450
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,730
you don't want the same cultivar every

451
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,350
part of the United States because it's

452
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:12,049
really not meant for it it's it's

453
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:13,730
shooting the geographical solvers so

454
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,980
this way here you're optimizing an

455
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,509
actual situation you're made into as a

456
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,420
vacuum we can

457
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:22,970
the world but that's the most expensive

458
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:25,700
form of Hiroshi and for a lot of

459
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,799
individuals I over this uh pretty

460
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,200
accurate in terms of probability but

461
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:32,119
it's going to be specific for you

462
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,460
location so you can share the

463
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,379
information in the data but ultimately

464
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,539
you better have to do another sifting

465
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,000
process to get the cultivar working the

466
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:45,470
dampness of coastal Washington versus

467
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,980
the interior dry you can reach me direct

468
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,329
I'm pretty easy accessible but and I'm

469
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,309
talking about which means rectify the

470
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:55,250
problem just an accessible to talk about

471
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:57,259
products yet this year the information

472
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:00,019
otherwise we'll do it collapses up as a

473
00:18:57,259 --> 00:19:01,609
culture my luck in is so much because

474
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:04,099
it's all these small individuals have

475
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:05,899
made it up and I'm not against

476
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:07,480
corporations it's just how America's

477
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,940
growing but I'm definitely against

478
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,759
taking over an industry in at the hands

479
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,590
of the few and so for me I try to share

480
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,690
as much as I can and get as many

481
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:19,490
products into the market as possible I

482
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,470
can't share genetics in the states

483
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,240
that's illegal but the information is

484
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,339
definitely available so you can check me

485
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,319
out see me out for the thing I don't get

486
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:29,389
any mail and then you think we can chop

487
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:30,980
it up about what is it you're trying to

488
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,240
do what you struggling with and then

489
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,339
we'll take a look at what your market is

490
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,900
because the market determines where

491
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,669
you're going to put this drive so you

492
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,620
can't just grow stuff that you want to

493
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,940
grow people get into use with that

494
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:43,518
you have to grow things at the market

495
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,600
walls but the markets pretty big and you

496
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,399
have to be able to take a look at that

497
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:49,998
market that turned 18 that federal

498
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:51,498
courts in your specific and so much it

499
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:54,710
is trying to find other farmers around

500
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:57,700
use a similar geographical situations

501
00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:00,740
environmental conditions cultivation

502
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,929
sameness and then you'll be able to work

503
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,700
in groups I'm lucky in the sense that I

504
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:07,788
had to provide genetics to the state of

505
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:10,639
California which is massive and it lets

506
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:12,919
me work with hunt Alice's people over

507
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:14,839
these years about how to perform for you

508
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,879
and there's locations and what happened

509
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,798
it wasn't resistant with their problems

510
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:20,990
and then we can start to take a look and

511
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,058
say hey this cultivar that was selected

512
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:25,368
for this shines here it does not do well

513
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:26,960
there and it would allow you to get that

514
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:28,039
information so yeah that's all that's

515
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,079
all Gary

516
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:32,480
don't build this situation of your

517
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,819
friends do you have to team up you

518
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:48,799
cannot be a solo producer I love where

519
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:51,169
our practice Mariah Tori and CEO got it

520
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,619
for somebody down the street and I know

521
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:55,880
claiming it's yours it's not what you

522
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:58,519
want to be able to do is work in

523
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,550
conjunction and and the combined

524
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:03,799
brainpower of many farmers is really

525
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:06,169
driven agricultural forward for

526
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:08,319
millennia and now science is handing it

527
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,580
over and it creates the situation where

528
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,079
there's only certain things that can

529
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:15,019
enter the market because they have the

530
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,730
energy of resistance but at that level

531
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:19,339
right now we're still in the level of

532
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:21,500
back to the table and you have to really

533
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:23,569
use conventional farming technology to

534
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,150
do it and so to be sharing the

535
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:27,859
information with your friends make me a

536
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,810
bit of the jeddak's available

537
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:31,879
everyone thinks that if I give you this

538
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:33,740
clone sort of take away my whole world -

539
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,890
well if your market is that small my god

540
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,509
you're really a bubble on itself so you

541
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,220
have to be able to just you know see it

542
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:41,539
like that and don't be careful who you

543
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,059
work with because otherwise you're not

544
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:44,549
gonna get

545
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:47,069
native act but for someone who's a

546
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:49,169
farmer who's trying to produce cannabis

547
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:51,689
or less understand I use varieties and

548
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,970
these mountains you team up there have a

549
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,820
lot collaboration on that I received as

550
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,769
any other way all the wives combined we

551
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:00,720
are a massive creepy so there is another

552
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:04,650
brand there's no brand in Washington

553
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,809
around I would read seven bill inaudible

554
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,030
interoperation and he gave me the

555
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:11,700
lecture on this he was a CEO of seven

556
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:12,930
billion dollar of distribution and he

557
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,299
said Kathy doesn't none of you were

558
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:17,850
brand he said it'll occur a brand is you

559
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:20,039
can be in 44 thousand stores at once

560
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:22,649
and within 24 hours you could be stopped

561
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:25,259
all because none of you guys are brands

562
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,990
you must work collectively the form

563
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:29,789
regional brands and then eventually over

564
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:32,849
time those things will become parts

565
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:36,569
powerhouse crimes but in the interim you

566
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:38,579
must work together and canvas especially

567
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:40,649
when we are humble like idols at find

568
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:43,470
those where everybody use a little mini

569
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:45,060
cane run in our little big world and you

570
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,970
don't even want to team up on anything

571
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:49,919
but not the money's drained I'll assist

572
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:55,839
so people are a lot more willing to work

573
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:57,950
together for a long period of time

574
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,049
priorities somebody's good to eat it's

575
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,110
humbling it's going to stand work

576
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:04,819
together and you have to be able to team

577
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:06,740
up in that in that respect and every

578
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:08,269
worker group they're so smart and so big

579
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,220
and I think all these guys are the giant

580
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:11,629
had farmers never revolutionize the

581
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,009
kingdom and they get very provide

582
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,380
because again this is especially

583
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:17,390
cultivar and so they have to go through

584
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:20,630
this process to learn and understand to

585
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:22,730
and so there's no chugging Vantage right

586
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,010
now except in terms of scope and scale

587
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,480
and efficiency of production but in

588
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:28,430
terms of knowledge of the cultivar I

589
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,950
work with the private understanding how

590
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:36,740
to work together we can build that we

591
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:38,480
really have this opportunity because you

592
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,819
choke to that each other the next

593
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,269
question I can't use their profiles

594
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:46,599
tomorrow you can't do that without your

595
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,599
actual

596
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:53,269
and you so much are indeed for other

597
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,730
companies on inputs and that I run all

598
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:58,329
the tests afterwards to see these things

599
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:01,460
and so I just did video on this because

600
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:03,470
it's so fascinating that you couldn't

601
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,660
this you could not tell the human could

602
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:08,000
not tell which samples came out of those

603
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:11,330
two bags but one of them was very high

604
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,609
in alpha beta ie0 campaign and the other

605
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:16,519
varietal was high you can't be no alpha

606
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:18,769
beta money so therefore one of them is

607
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:21,558
right one that's not right now they've

608
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:24,049
already people believe is that when you

609
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:25,279
add input you just increase the terms

610
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:29,359
it's like it's all going to move

611
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:31,879
linearly it doesn't they it's complex

612
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,490
and you can have bacteria that converts

613
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,760
turkeys and other turkeys you can have

614
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:39,650
all these enzymatic conversions to make

615
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,779
smell appear and so when you're looking

616
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:44,900
at that from that point of view it's

617
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:45,470
move its do people like the way it

618
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,809
smells

619
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:51,860
ultimately the big numbers are nice on

620
00:24:47,808 --> 00:24:53,660
the display board at the store but the

621
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:56,389
bottom line is trying to eat turkeys

622
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,130
tomorrow right exceptionally inaccurate

623
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,080
and we

624
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,730
this for a while and highly favored

625
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,339
effective that's what the DNA comes in

626
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:06,670
and then it prints it now you're gonna

627
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:08,740
have more actual changes from an insult

628
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:11,740
shifts and what they do but on a gene

629
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,720
level the same but terms all over the

630
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,759
place and you don't know the difference

631
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,009
that's what we my mind was on comparing

632
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:21,129
these of these tests preparing this was

633
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:23,230
are indeed and no one in my circle we're

634
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:25,690
all career guys that we know chemistry

635
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:28,299
well you could not differentiate which

636
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:30,580
one was grown but one of them very high

637
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:32,710
I mean you know anion can't be really

638
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:36,250
don't some say in terms of Campion

639
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:38,920
writings but exact same training just

640
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:40,930
two different inputs so you know you

641
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,600
have harm could what you'll find is that

642
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:46,960
for you you're trying to find out what

643
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:50,859
creates the most distinctive desirable

644
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,360
impact on a customer and that's working

645
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:54,099
with your inputs and you're going to

646
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,649
discover what you use on your farm

647
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:58,539
drives in the direction you want and

648
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,690
that's what you care about but otherwise

649
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:02,579
what the turkeys signature

650
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,950
oh my god so variable is no word for him

651
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:07,558
and I think it's so complex that people

652
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:15,509
are trying to dumb it down too much it's

653
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:18,210
too big I think so another medicine they

654
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:19,950
did maybe they do apply with that we

655
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,710
think you apply between I was asked that

656
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,629
by a reporter and I had talked to the

657
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,519
economy they use it before start this

658
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:28,648
whole the face of control they pioneer

659
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,269
that in Canada so in homo economy they

660
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:31,829
probably wiped out a billion dollars

661
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:34,589
with the Canada they're spraying this up

662
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:36,628
continuously and so you can clean your

663
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:38,788
crop as much as you want but it's going

664
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:41,038
to come back and what we found was

665
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:43,470
cultivar selection on things that have a

666
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,940
higher resistance and then you work with

667
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,759
your beneficial it's that company you

668
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,190
work on a strategy of human or adults at

669
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:53,489
a creek that predation rate that's going

670
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:56,308
to have competed so I haven't blown away

671
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:58,858
at a pharmacy about apart and we saw

672
00:26:56,308 --> 00:27:01,108
some bug's present so let's develop it

673
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:03,210
with some food which means that eating

674
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:04,798
something and so once we started to find

675
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,569
the silicon or diamonds on the bottle is

676
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,249
leads we like it they go and it's too

677
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:10,648
late do you salt for salt works really

678
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:11,999
well for this is a cheap it cymatics to

679
00:27:10,648 --> 00:27:13,738
talk because they bleach the lead

680
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:15,899
Moloch's would and designed to talk it's

681
00:27:13,739 --> 00:27:18,149
an actually look at culture on the plant

682
00:27:15,898 --> 00:27:20,608
which then disqualifies you can style

683
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:22,469
the bride so depending on what point in

684
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:24,749
time you use some of these tools so

685
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,419
sulfur and everyn flowers will in effect

686
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:28,829
erotic and somatic stem Kurzweil because

687
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:31,109
what effective product in terms of bone

688
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:32,548
but the beneficial insects work it's

689
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:34,710
just that people don't do it at the

690
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:36,450
level you need to I'm talking you let it

691
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,909
get on everywhere those plans to be

692
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,649
juveniles and adults so that the adults

693
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:43,139
come out and will right to work and the

694
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:44,668
neutrals collar eyes at work basically I

695
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:46,709
was learning three times the normal

696
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:48,690
level of predation that was required but

697
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:52,079
I establish that crop loss

698
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:54,450
five to ten percent my friends lost 95%

699
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:57,569
do you think about the Kenneth you see

700
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:59,519
plants that have inherent levels of rest

701
00:27:57,569 --> 00:28:01,919
when was the sense that are

702
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,069
significantly different than others I I

703
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,930
do and I always think it's do I want to

704
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:09,119
say at all record or a later do you see

705
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,250
plants I have like rhino skin they seem

706
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,049
to do better because when I when I do

707
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,630
intestine I have a tremendous number all

708
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:17,519
the bars at the test site certain ones

709
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,890
getting enacted certain ones don't at

710
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,269
different levels of investigation but

711
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,190
the problem is that the stuff that's

712
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:25,319
resistant you're selecting for that open

713
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,730
earlier yeah at least I know that what I

714
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:29,009
could say is hey we've had very good

715
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,900
success with this use this is a portion

716
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:32,400
of your crop because you don't want to

717
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,500
be so harmful for that way either

718
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,600
because now you produce other after that

719
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,819
problem so you have to kind of figure

720
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:41,269
out what you distribution based off of

721
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:43,379
market velocity and survivability and

722
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:45,000
you'll be able to kind of get yourself

723
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,150
into a situation that requires a

724
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,460
tremendous amount of preemptive or

725
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,460
active on it whatever happens
