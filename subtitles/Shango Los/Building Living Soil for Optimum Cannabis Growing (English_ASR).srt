1
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,600
So, I'm really excited about the guest

2
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:20,480
tonight. Our guest tonight is Tad Hussy

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,480
Simple is an edible nursery, production,

5
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:28,559
greenhouse, outdoor preschool, organic

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,439
hydroponic shop, and feed store in

7
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,280
Redmond. Uh Tad is an educator and

8
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,359
sought-after speaker on probiotic

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,000
growing for all kinds of crops,

10
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,719
cannabis, food, and anything else that

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,799
there might be. Um so tonight he's going

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,800
to talk about a wide range of probiotic

13
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,759
growing techniques so your gardens

14
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:50,959
thrive. And I saw this presentation at

15
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,799
Canacon in Seattle um over the winter

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,000
and it was standing room only. There

17
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,878
were a couple hundred people there.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,198
Everybody's all packed in because Tad's

19
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,198
u experience is so valuable. So, I hope

20
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:04,640
you find it valuable as well tonight.

21
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,640
Please give Tad a warm

22
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:16,239
welcome. First off, I just want to say

23
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,519
thank you to Shango and Vivian for

24
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,879
having me out here tonight. I really

25
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,879
appreciate the opportunity. Um, when I

26
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,560
talked to Shango and he told me I had a

27
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:28,000
little more time to talk, I actually

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,000
changed my talk around. So um I made it

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,078
more about kind of my journey through

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,759
growing and learning and we'll cover all

31
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,319
the topics that we discussed but just in

32
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,040
slightly different order. So I I titled

33
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,959
this talk biological horiculture. Um

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,159
I'll explain more here in a little bit.

35
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:47,359
So uh let's see if we can get this thing

36
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,280
working. All right. So this is uh keep

37
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,078
it simple farm. This is my place out in

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,640
Redmond. My parents own a 7acre property

39
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,399
here. About 5 years ago now, we realized

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,118
that the nursery industry was crumbling

41
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,040
and uh I was just getting into edible

42
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,959
landscaping and chickens and all of this

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,799
stuff. We had an online business and the

44
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,599
nursery that was on the property uh

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,719
moved to a new location. So, we decided

46
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,919
to take it in a totally different

47
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,479
direction focused on urban farming. Uh

48
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,119
we opened a feed store. Um we're doing

49
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,479
like like uh Shango said, we have an

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,959
outdoor free school that meets there

51
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,799
every day. And um that was a giant

52
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,280
pumpkin we grew one year was 725 lbs for

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,640
over 1,000 this year. Uh and then this

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,318
is just kind of a shot of the property

55
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,399
here to give you a little bit of idea.

56
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,079
But we also have a trail in the back

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
along Bear Creek which is a salmon

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,480
spawning stream uh just for education

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,878
where we have over a thousand people

60
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,039
every every fall coming through to learn

61
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,280
about salmon and about native habitat.

62
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,959
So we're really uh excited to just be

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,560
part of the community there. Um it's a

64
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,680
wonderful piece of piece of property. If

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,400
you ever get a chance to come out to

66
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,239
Redmond, love to give you guys a tour.

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,319
So, this is our greenhouse in the back.

68
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,159
We're doing veggie starts all from seed

69
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,639
at the beginning of the year starting in

70
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,639
the spring and then we eventually um

71
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,878
that's actually my dad right there. We

72
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,639
uh we planted out. So, this is a photo

73
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,399
towards the end of the season where we

74
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,119
had a beneficial bug mix growing in the

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,959
middle row here, our tomatoes over here,

76
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,480
and then right here we have our uh

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,878
cucumbers that are just kind of on their

78
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,238
last legs for the season. Um, so

79
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,000
everything's just kind of starting up

80
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,599
this year. We haven't gotten tomatoes

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,199
yet, but we're getting really

82
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:26,639
close. This is I had some farm shots. I

83
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,639
thought we had a photographer come out.

84
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,878
Uh, we just had baby pigs recently.

85
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,719
These are mini pigs, so full grown is

86
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,518
still not all that big. We got turkeys

87
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,039
running around. Uh, these goats arrived

88
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,959
two weeks ago, including this little

89
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,359
baby. They're mini, so we will hopefully

90
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,959
eventually have have milking goats. But

91
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,560
the thing I love about the property is

92
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,920
the kids actually get to come in and

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,439
interact with the animals. We have an

94
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,518
area with the chickens and the turkeys

95
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,759
and some beehives where the kids get to

96
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,799
go right in there um and interact with

97
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,120
the living parents because that was

98
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,159
something I never really got uh got to

99
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,000
do as a child. But let's back up a

100
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,919
little bit.

101
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,560
So, oh, I don't know about 10 years ago,

102
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,238
I was working uh my dad had this online

103
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,920
business selling compost tea brewers and

104
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,719
I came into the business after finishing

105
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,559
my master's degree down in Australia and

106
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,080
I kept getting all these phone calls and

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,160
people are like, "Hey, I'm growing 30

108
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,160
tomatoes in my basement and all

109
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,000
right." I was like, "What is everyone

110
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,839
using our product for?" So, I started

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,360
doing a little research and I walked

112
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,799
into my first hydroshock and this is

113
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,240
kind of what you see when you walk in

114
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,759
there. It smells funny. It's like

115
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,519
walking down that that aisle at Home

116
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,280
Depot and I was like, "What does this

117
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,879
have to do with growing plants?" It was

118
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,799
totally foreign because I come from

119
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,800
having my parents owning a landscaping

120
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,560
business and nursery my entire life. I

121
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,639
hadn't even seen any bottle nutrients

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,160
before then. So, uh, I I started looking

123
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,879
into it at that point and trying to

124
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,520
learn more about um about what exactly

125
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,560
was going on in the whole thing. So, uh,

126
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,918
one of the things I like to talk about

127
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,519
is the environmental impact of some of

128
00:04:53,918 --> 00:05:00,478
these phenri. So, I did a consult at one

129
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,918
of the larger 502s uh this year and I

130
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,079
walked in at a facility and they were

131
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,918
literally emptying one of these totes of

132
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,000
chemical nutrients down the drain and I

133
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,839
asked them where where's that going? Oh,

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,120
we have a septic out back. They're

135
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,038
literally across the street from the

136
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,560
fisheries and wildlife. Like I'm just

137
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:15,918
waiting for the EPA to show up on the

138
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,439
door. And I think that's the next big

139
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,758
issue we're going to have for a lot of

140
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,079
these larger growths. So, it's really

141
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,160
important that you consider where this

142
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,519
stuff is going. And on top of that, the

143
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,520
the traditional thing is you you get

144
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,719
your soil, it's fairly inert. You pour

145
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,560
your bottle nutrients on it, you

146
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,680
directly feed the plant, and then you

147
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,360
have to oh, let me back up. So, all of

148
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,319
these phosphates that we're dumping are

149
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,000
creating algo blooms, which pull all the

150
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,439
dissolved oxygen out of the water as the

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,360
algae grows. And then we have all these

152
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,038
areas where fish and other wildlife are

153
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,199
no longer able to survive. And one of

154
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:50,079
the largest besides Texas is actually in

155
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,600
Oregon. So, uh, homeowners in general,

156
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,399
especially with our our our perfect

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,759
looking lawns and then also, um, our

158
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,359
cannabis plants, we need to be

159
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,400
especially careful not to be putting

160
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,520
excess nutrients out. Um, this is what I

161
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,879
was getting at. In addition to that,

162
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,560
when we're done growing, a lot of

163
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,918
growers, we just they dispose of their

164
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,199
soil. So, this is now no good and you

165
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,478
have to throw it out and it ends up

166
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,079
looking like this in your landscape

167
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,079
because it has all the perlite in the

168
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,599
first time it rains. And this is the

169
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,399
traditional way that people were growing

170
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,199
for the last I don't know 20 or 30 years

171
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,758
you know ever since uh based nutrients

172
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,319
were

173
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:28,000
invented. Uh so during this process I

174
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,000
started reading more and learning more

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,279
about what is actually going into these

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,079
products and what are we what are we

177
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:37,198
paying for? Um one example is potassium

178
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:40,079
silicate. So silica helps with thicker

179
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,038
stocks keep the plant from tipping over

180
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,120
uh in the wind. It also helps with

181
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,959
overall just plant health and growth or

182
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,560
if there's too much um of any

183
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,318
micronutrient in the soil like a little

184
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,038
too much magnes or a little too much

185
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,479
iron. Uh the the silica will help

186
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,000
mitigate that by spreading it more

187
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,000
evenly through the leaf tissue so you

188
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,279
have less damage. So silica is a

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,478
wonderful addition to your garden.

190
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,159
There's a bunch of different ways you

191
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,240
can get it. But if you were to go down

192
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,759
the store the hydro shop and buy it, uh

193
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,439
the most common brand I think most

194
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,080
people know is Dagrow Protek. That's the

195
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,800
one I heard of before before I got into

196
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,240
growing. You know, $44 a gallon. Well,

197
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
all they're doing is taking this powder

198
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,360
here, this egg 16, which we sell online

199
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,759
for $12 a pound. This makes up 3/4 of a

200
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,000
gallon to the exact same strength as Dro

201
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,520
Protect. Uh silicon blast has a little

202
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,800
bit of sodium silicate, but we don't

203
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,478
really need more sodium for the most

204
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,079
part with a lot of our a lot of growing.

205
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,478
And then Rhino Skin, which is the

206
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,639
advanced nutrients one, is really the

207
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,240
worst in terms of price. And I won't

208
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,840
pick on these other mild nutrient

209
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,199
companies with the exception of Advanced

210
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,638
Nutrients because I think they've done a

211
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,478
lot to hurt the industry in terms of the

212
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,280
way they promoted themselves and

213
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:48,079
cannabis in general and they're just

214
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,918
well known and ripping people off. So

215
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,598
when we start looking at what's in

216
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,120
organic bottle nutrients because we're

217
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,959
we're completely organic on our

218
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,319
property. Uh we don't sell chemical

219
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,680
nutrients. I don't really know a lot

220
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,960
about chemical nutrients. I understand

221
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,240
how they function, but it's not

222
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,318
something I'm really passionate about.

223
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,000
So I'm going to stick to organic all

224
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,919
nutrients. So, what's in most of these

225
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,598
products that we see here, you're going

226
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:13,598
to find molasses, hemic acids, seaweed,

227
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,199
fish emulsion, fish hydraulicate, and um

228
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,839
added labeling nutrients down here.

229
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,598
Because one of the things I didn't know

230
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,519
prior to all this is when you see a

231
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:25,519
number on this bottle that says, let's

232
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:28,399
say 555, that means it's 5% nitrogen, 5%

233
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,318
phosphorus, 5% potassium, or at least

234
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,399
that's what they're guaranteeing. So,

235
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,479
what some of these places will do is

236
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,479
they'll say, "I have a proprietary

237
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,839
nitrogen source that's exponentially

238
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,839
better than everything else on the

239
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,560
market." It's not. They're just putting

240
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,080
10% nitrogen in there, guaranteeing 5%.

241
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,518
So, you So, their product is going to

242
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,879
get you're going to get that putting on

243
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,159
more nitrogen than you realize. Your

244
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,120
plant's going to grow a little faster,

245
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,439
and then you think that you have to

246
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,720
spend an extra $100 on this product.

247
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,000
It's It's a crazy racket, and uh it's

248
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,680
something I was never even aware of

249
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
until I had to register my first product

250
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,759
as a fertilizer.

251
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,159
So, also when I'm looking at soil tests,

252
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,600
I can't necessarily assume that that MDK

253
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,600
that I think I'm putting out to match my

254
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,759
soil test is actually going to match it.

255
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,560
So, keep those things in mind um just in

256
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,278
the back of your head when you're

257
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,399
evaluating products. So, molasses,

258
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,278
that's what you're going to find in

259
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,399
products called Strapped or Sweet or Bud

260
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,759
Candy. Again, enhanced nutrients. Um we

261
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,879
sell a three and a half gallon bucket

262
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:27,200
for around $20 at our store. Um,

263
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,200
unsulered blackstrap molasses is really

264
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,759
unsulered blackstrap molasses. You don't

265
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,640
you don't need to spend all this money

266
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,000
on it. And uh, one other thing about it

267
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,080
too, it's not going to make your butts

268
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,919
taste any sweeter. Plants don't work

269
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,519
that way. That whole pour Kool-Aid on

270
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,000
your plants to get bread. I think we

271
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,839
disagree. It just doesn't it just

272
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,679
doesn't work. So, the sugars in there

273
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,920
though are a wonderful microbial food

274
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,679
for all the different microorganisms

275
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,199
that we'll talk about in a second. Um,

276
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,838
it also has a little bit of potassium in

277
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,360
it. But, um, again, you don't need to

278
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,279
spend your money on, um, a brand like

279
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,919
that. Uh, seaweed is one of my favorite

280
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,519
amendments. It they contains over 70

281
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,838
different elements, uh, plant growth

282
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,879
hormones and plant growth regulators.

283
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,519
Um, it helps with drought resistance,

284
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,360
uh, heat and cold stress. Um, it's just

285
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,560
it's one of the best things. Like if I

286
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,039
had to choose just a couple things that

287
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,039
I can use in my garden, uh kelp meal or

288
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,599
seaweed would be probably top of the

289
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,360
list. Um but when we look at what's

290
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,839
actually in them, they're they're all

291
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,440
going to be seaweed derived from asylum.

292
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,200
It's just it's North Atlantic sea kelp.

293
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,720
It's the most widely studied. If you

294
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,879
want to read more about kelp, there's a

295
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,759
little book you can get for probably 20

296
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,200
bucks on Amazon by TL Sen called seaweed

297
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,919
and plant growth. Did you have a

298
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,959
question? Yes. See, you just use that as

299
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:49,278
a cup as a bulge. I so I use it two

300
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:51,799
ways. I uh I buy I I use kel which I mix

301
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:55,200
into the soil

302
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:58,319
um for my potty mixes and then we also

303
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,519
carry a product that I buy from Aadian

304
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,160
makes it and then same with this

305
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,120
Nature's Essence and it's just uh think

306
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,199
of it like a extract. So it's like a

307
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,440
fine concentrate orange juice. So you

308
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,519
can add this to water and get over 100

309
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,120
gallons. Now, if you're harvesting

310
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,480
seaweed, which I think that might have

311
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,560
been what you're getting at, you do need

312
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,600
to rinse and wash it to remove all the

313
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,838
all the salt and sodium from it prior to

314
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,920
uh composting it or putting it in in

315
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,680
your garden, but you could pick up a lot

316
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,799
of these same nutrients. It's a little

317
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,799
different kelp that we have out here,

318
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:33,919
but can still be beneficial.

319
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:36,240
Yeah. So, as you can see, a pound uh I

320
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,000
think we sell for around $18. Um or you

321
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,600
can there's a lot of places you can find

322
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
it. um make up over 100 gallons of

323
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,519
liquid liquid kelp to the same, you

324
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,839
know, the same rates as what they're

325
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,320
selling you in these bottles. So again,

326
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,200
it's just another way to save your

327
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,200
money. Uh humic acids, uh humic acids

328
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,120
are excellent chelators, which means

329
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,278
they bond with the minerals in your soil

330
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,120
and help make the plant available.

331
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:05,039
Um variety of different products. Again,

332
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,120
when it comes to that, uh the ones that

333
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,639
we use are uh it's called from

334
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,159
Terravita, the SP85. It's 85% humic acid

335
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,240
by content. You're using just an eighth

336
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,679
of a teaspoon per gallon of water. And

337
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,000
that comes out of the agricultural

338
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,679
industry. Um the the gentleman that buy

339
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,078
the seaweed and the humic acid from is

340
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:25,439
over in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and he

341
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,838
works with all the um all the farmers,

342
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,600
large scale farmers over there. Um

343
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,519
because realistically, like no farmer is

344
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,278
buying Rinse organics or general general

345
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,278
hydroponics. it's just not practical and

346
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,720
they can't afford it. And yes, I I

347
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,320
firmly believe cannabis is a special

348
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,399
plant and it's medicine, but it is

349
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,399
called weed for a reason. It's not hard

350
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,839
to grow once you learn stuff. And from a

351
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,000
nutrient perspective, it's actually

352
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,440
quite easy to grow a big healthy robust

353
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,039
plant. Uh fish hydraulicate, that's

354
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,800
probably the one liquid nutrient that I

355
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,319
really like to use. Um we use it on our

356
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,838
veggie starts when they start to get a

357
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,760
little rebound in our in our farm. U

358
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,560
fish hydraicate is very different than

359
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,078
fish emulsion. So fish emulsion is going

360
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,719
to be very high in nitrogen. Fish

361
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,399
hydraulic is be much higher in

362
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,320
phosphorus. Uh fish fish emulsion is

363
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,759
typically the Alaska fish fertilizer

364
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,120
that you may see in the store. So keep

365
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,679
in mind that they're very different. And

366
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,159
when you give both of them to soil based

367
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,000
microbes, the fish hydrolate is going to

368
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,519
perform exponentially better. So it's a

369
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,360
much better microbial food than fish

370
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,480
emulsion.

371
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,720
Natural form of that a natural form. So

372
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,399
depending on the brand like Organic Gem

373
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,480
I believe um they use an enzyatic

374
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,360
process to break down the fish. They're

375
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,959
all certified organic. Um but they do

376
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,000
have to put in a small amount of fat

377
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,679
phosphoric acid as a stabilizer. But u

378
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,078
as far as I know, every organic

379
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,919
certified agency allows for that. Um

380
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:51,439
otherwise it would break down way too

381
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:53,519
rapidly because it is such a good micro

382
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,720
food. Um, we use it to charge our

383
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,480
biochar that we put into our soils. Um,

384
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,600
we soak it for a week in the fish

385
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,360
hydraulic as a way to fill the cation

386
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,199
sites

387
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,120
up. Uh, so one of the other things I

388
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:10,799
like to point out, uh, right now, this

389
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,120
has been a big issue with pesticides.

390
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,120
It's something that a lot of a lot of

391
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,320
consumers and medical patients weren't

392
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,399
even aware of. They think when they're

393
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,399
buying a plant, it's a plant, you know,

394
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,759
it's grown naturally. Well, it really

395
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,120
isn't. And unfortunately, there are a

396
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,879
lot of uh unscrupulous people growing

397
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,320
plants cuz it's a lot easier to spray a

398
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,519
plant with Eagle 20 and not have to

399
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,278
worry about powder rebuilding for the

400
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,959
life of the plant. But these things are

401
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,559
systemic for a reason. They live inside

402
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,679
the leaf tissue. It's not something that

403
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,039
you want to be putting in your bodies.

404
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:40,399
So, if you can know your grower, I think

405
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,559
that's the really the best thing. Or

406
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,559
grow your own medicine. It's really uh

407
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:48,319
really what we promote. Um just half a

408
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,239
step back. Oh, yeah. Great. Thanks.

409
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,680
Okay. So, the other thing I like to

410
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,519
point out, uh, this just came out

411
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,559
recently. So, the Oregon Department of

412
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,078
Agriculture tests, uh, a lot of these

413
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,000
microbial plot products. So, something

414
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,679
like the MFP, for example, they would

415
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,120
test to see, are they meeting the claims

416
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,879
that they say they're putting on these

417
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,720
products because no one else is doing

418
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,399
that. You could put whatever you want on

419
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,839
the label, and no one's regulating it

420
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,759
when it comes to microbial products. Uh,

421
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,440
some of their findings were were kind of

422
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,919
surprising like this advanced nutrient

423
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,160
product, Piranha. uh they didn't detect

424
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,399
any of the product that they claimed was

425
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,159
in

426
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,919
it. Dr. Earth came back higher, you

427
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,919
know. So, uh these tests are all freely

428
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:31,039
available online. Um if you shoot me an

429
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:33,039
email, I can send you a link to it. Um

430
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,799
OG Bowar is another one most people know

431
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:38,559
and microisal applications. Um Santium

432
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:39,919
Organics. So, they are looking at these

433
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,278
things to actually test to see if you're

434
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,479
getting what you you pay for. So, just

435
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,000
because it's on a label and just because

436
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,240
it's made as a claim doesn't mean it's

437
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,360
necessarily true.

438
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,079
So, you really have to do your due

439
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,800
diligence.

440
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:54,399
Um, all right. So, after all of that, we

441
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,240
decide I decided I learn figured there

442
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,000
was got to be a better way to grow

443
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:03,120
plants. Uh, and this first half of my of

444
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,559
my talk is really focused on um what I

445
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,759
learned from my father and from Dr. Leum

446
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,359
and Jeff Loenfeld when it comes to uh

447
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,600
organic gardening. And this was my

448
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,120
philosophy for the the first 10 years

449
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,959
that I I was growing. So, uh, what is

450
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,959
biological horiculture? Well, this is a

451
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,278
photo from the Olympic rainforest. My

452
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,958
friend Moan came to visit from Australia

453
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,120
and she had never seen trees like this.

454
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,919
She was just blown away. Um, she's a big

455
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,198
hippie. She absolutely loved it. So, uh,

456
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,799
one of the reasons I like to show this

457
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,000
is because, uh, Jeff is always famous

458
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,240
for saying, "Well, there's no one out

459
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,240
there dumping Miracle Grill out in the

460
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,879
rainforest." And it's so true. These

461
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,120
these ecosystems are diverse. They're

462
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,919
phenomenally healthy. And it's all

463
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,320
because of the biological activity

464
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,519
that's going on uh beneath the soil and

465
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,320
on the and on the surface of the floor.

466
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,759
So when we look at this look at this

467
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,440
tree, you can see all these roots down

468
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,959
here. Well, the plant is

469
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,720
photosynthesizing light. It's taking in

470
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,518
light from the sun and it's putting

471
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,439
anywhere from 30 to 70% of that energy

472
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,759
back out through its roots to feed the

473
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,120
microorganisms in the soil. So when you

474
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,279
think about it just shows you how

475
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,838
important these microbes are to this

476
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,558
entire gardening process. So when we put

477
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,879
out Miracle Grow uh highly which is a

478
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,078
highly concentrated salt, we're actually

479
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,799
killing off a lot of these

480
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,038
microorganisms through the process of

481
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:27,439
osmosis. Um and then we become in charge

482
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,679
as the gardener of directly feeding this

483
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,919
plant and playing God. Well, in an

484
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,519
organic system really all we're doing is

485
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,120
trying to create the optimal environment

486
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,879
for these microbes and then putting the

487
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,479
plant in charge. And that's really the

488
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,679
most important thing I can I can

489
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,038
emphasize when it comes to uh microbes

490
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,038
and your garden. So the main thing here

491
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,359
is the nutrient cycling. So it starts

492
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,679
off you have your plants here. Um it's

493
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,119
going to drop leaves down. It's it's

494
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,880
photosynthesizing energy. It's also

495
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,119
dropping detritus onto the floor

496
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,280
creating a mulch. It's getting eaten by

497
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,159
uh different microorganisms that are

498
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,918
then cycling the nutrients back into uh

499
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,160
nitrogen or whatever nutrient form the

500
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,759
plant wants. And then uh that nitrogen

501
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,840
feed the plants feeds the plant and it

502
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,919
continues. Now in the indoor garden

503
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,759
we're pulling organic matter and we're

504
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,919
pulling nutrients out of the soil and

505
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,359
that we're not always replacing with

506
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,280
that plant because we're harvesting our

507
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,798
crop. Same with our vegetable garden. So

508
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,879
it's a little bit different but we can

509
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,720
incorporate this concept into our

510
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,200
growing practices for the healthiest

511
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,558
plants possible. So this is another

512
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,240
thing I stole from Jeff because I

513
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,038
thought it was just such a great

514
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,400
illustration. So the plant is really in

515
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:35,839
control of this process. It's putting

516
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,919
out exidates. These are things like

517
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,240
sugars, carbons, carbohydrates right

518
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,240
into the soil to select for the type of

519
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,480
microorganisms to create the food that

520
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,919
it wants. So if it wants more uh I'll

521
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,038
say it wanted more Japanese food one

522
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,559
night, well they would put out food and

523
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,079
the Japanese person would appear and

524
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,879
they they get to eat that or the next

525
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,558
night maybe they want uh Indian food or

526
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,440
Mexican food whatever whatever

527
00:18:54,558 --> 00:19:00,079
particular type of uh exidate it creates

528
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,600
it can control this process. Um and it

529
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,759
can actually change it on an hourly

530
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,759
basis. So if it wants its nitrogen in

531
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,079
the form of nitrate, it will select for

532
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,919
the microorganisms that will create that

533
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,159
create that nutrient that nitrogen in

534
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,559
that form. Same for ammonium or whatever

535
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,519
whatever particular uh nutrient that

536
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,519
plant wants. It's an amazing process. I

537
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,160
heard a soil scientist speak and he was

538
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,319
saying we know more we know more about

539
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,840
the moon or about the solar system than

540
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,599
we do about what's going on directly

541
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,359
under our feet in terms of uh soil

542
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,639
science. There's just so much more for

543
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,918
us to learn. So, I'm going to go over

544
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,160
really quickly just kind of what makes

545
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,720
up the biology in our soils. Uh,

546
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,320
bacteria and archa are clumped together

547
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,519
because they have similar functions, but

548
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,399
archa is something that we didn't even

549
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,359
know existed outside of deep water vents

550
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,759
up until I think 15 20 years ago. Um,

551
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,000
they're their own kingdom classification

552
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,759
altogether. Uh, but they function for

553
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,359
all intents and purposes very similar to

554
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,879
bacteria.

555
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,240
uh fungi or fungal hype uh prozzoa those

556
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,160
are all the things you studied in you

557
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,240
know 8th grade biology class uh

558
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,720
nematodes microarththopods worms and

559
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,120
larger

560
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,120
creatures so bacteria um one interesting

561
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,199
fact is that they can produce in the

562
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,639
vicinity of 5 billion offspring in the

563
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,400
span of 12 hours if they have enough

564
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,400
food unchecked they would double the

565
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,080
mass of the planet in in just a couple

566
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,840
months they're amazing amazing growers

567
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,439
and uh I'll show you a photos of some

568
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,599
here in a little This is under an

569
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,000
electron microscope here. Uh they're

570
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,319
great decomposers. So they are the ones

571
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,759
that break down all of those uh greens.

572
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:35,759
So anything that's high in nitrogen,

573
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,440
it's easy to break down. Simple sugars.

574
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,240
Bacteria is going to take it up really

575
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,840
quickly. Uh and they decompose all that

576
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,120
plant matter and material to um cycle

577
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,720
these nutrients, but they also

578
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,959
immobilize the nutrients. So when that

579
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,960
bacteria eats that leaf, it takes that

580
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,400
nitrogen, holds it inside of it until it

581
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,159
gets eaten by uh prozzoa or you know

582
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,000
silate or something and then what it

583
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,799
then excretes is that plants available

584
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,079
nitrogen. So that's it's it's a very

585
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,759
important part of that whole

586
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:07,439
process and it enhances soil quality

587
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,599
because it's food for these other

588
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,000
microorganisms in the soil. uh

589
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,639
decomposes organic matter for us and

590
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,319
retains nutrients in the ryosphere which

591
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,640
is that's just a fancy word for area

592
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,599
around the roots

593
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,038
uh enhances soil

594
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:25,240
structure competes with diseasecausing

595
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,839
organisms. So, if you have beneficial

596
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,759
microorganisms around your roots or on

597
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,399
your leaf surface, they're going to help

598
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:35,119
protect the plant from uh airborne and

599
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,120
and soil based

600
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:41,039
pathogens. And certain uh certain

601
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,558
bacteria actually can fix atmospheric

602
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,879
nitrogen. They're in the riseobia

603
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:48,038
family. So, it's pretty amazing um all

604
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,559
the things that bacteria can do. Uh

605
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:52,640
fungi, they're the decomposer of all the

606
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:54,558
brown. So, when you're told to get your

607
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,880
uh greens and browns right when you're

608
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,519
thermally composting, that's so that the

609
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,520
bacteria and fungus can grow to really

610
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,000
uh decompose everything correctly for

611
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,400
you and and heat up by their uh by their

612
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
reproduction. So, they create pathways

613
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,400
in the soil, all these little pockets.

614
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,839
When that when that hay dies, then

615
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,280
bacteria and other things can move

616
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:15,439
through it to different areas in the

617
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:18,319
soil. And you can see how how it can

618
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,720
create soil structure uh just based on

619
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,558
how it combines soil into aggregates. So

620
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,679
by just by having better structure in

621
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:28,558
your soil, you'll reduce um you can

622
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,880
reduce erosion and other problems. Uh

623
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,798
fungi release acid which will lower the

624
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,720
soil pH. uh it retains nutrients in its

625
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:38,639
biomass and they uh there's actually a

626
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,319
whole field now created by Paul Stam

627
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,120
it's called micological remediation

628
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:46,158
where they've used different species of

629
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:48,479
fungi to uh deal with everything from

630
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,520
radiation to oil spills. It's it's

631
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,400
really fascinating um and a really

632
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,918
exciting field. It's still

633
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,038
growing. So most people have seen

634
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,360
something like this before on wood

635
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,038
chips. This is myelium. thousands of

636
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,678
strands and a fungal hy wrapped around

637
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:05,359
each other. Uh this is it under various

638
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,679
types of different microscopes. This is

639
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,918
a bright field microscope here. This is

640
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,798
a phase contrast microscope which is

641
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,799
what I use. This is a microscope filter

642
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:18,319
that my uh my friend Tim Wilson came up

643
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:19,720
with. So how many people have heard of

644
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,038
microisal

645
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,240
fungi? Oh wow, that's pretty good. Yeah.

646
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,798
So it's something that we didn't even

647
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,960
know about I think also 20 20 years ago

648
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:33,200
and now it's you know fairly popular.

649
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,079
Um 90% of plants have a symbiotic

650
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,960
relationship with this fungus with the

651
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,960
exception of uh brassacas. So things

652
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,360
like kale, broccoli, cauliflower can

653
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,360
actually um have decreased healthy

654
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,678
growth if you if they do form that that

655
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,199
relationship. Um but most most plants

656
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,960
do, but it's specific to the type of

657
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,759
plant that you're growing. And for

658
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,558
cannabis, for tomatoes, for peppers, uh

659
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,400
for fruit trees, it's all

660
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,759
endomicizing. What you see here is

661
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:03,840
ectoicroising. So the endomic actually

662
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:06,440
infects inside the root. Um and it is

663
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,558
one of the primary ways the plant gets

664
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,080
phosphorus. So when we start looking at

665
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:13,839
different brands, if we want to spend

666
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:16,399
money to buy microisal products, um

667
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,278
here's an example of some. So this so

668
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,798
again what we're looking for is

669
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:23,038
endomicroisa and specifically glomis

670
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:26,158
intrarates and glomis mossi are the two

671
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:29,119
ones most widely studied and known to uh

672
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,559
infect cannabis and fruit trees

673
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,199
vegetables all the things we were

674
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,038
talking about before. Now uh aelas

675
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,200
blueberries those are all a totally

676
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,240
different type and so are conifers. So

677
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,919
we're really just talking about most of

678
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,319
our our basic vegetable crops and then

679
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,640
cannabis. Um here you're getting 83

680
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:47,759
propagules per gram of bonus interatis

681
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,480
lus mossia 8 8 ounces for $71. You're

682
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:53,119
also picking up

683
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,480
313,000 propagules of triricoderma. Now

684
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,000
if you were a mushroom grower, you're

685
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,360
probably familiar with triricodera. It's

686
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,960
a very very aggressive micro and um

687
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,479
they've done studies that show that it

688
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,319
inhibits microisal infection. So having

689
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,360
in your microisal product in rates that

690
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,879
are exponentially higher than the the

691
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,879
microisal you're buying really doesn't

692
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,880
make a lot of sense. At least I haven't

693
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,360
seen any studies to support it. The ones

694
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,440
where they have shown good good results

695
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,639
using tricoderma the trachoderma levels

696
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,720
are much closer to what you would find

697
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,840
in soil not these highly elevated

698
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,759
levels. Um, but when we look at these

699
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,798
other products here, you have, you know,

700
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,720
27 spores, 23 scores per gram. You're

701
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,200
getting 3% hemic acid, a little bit of

702
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,880
sugar, but you're paying $52 a pound.

703
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,440
Um, this product down here, you know,

704
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,679
2.46

705
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,159
propag, you know, for $14 a pound. Uh,

706
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:47,919
the two that I carry in my in my hydro

707
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,278
shop for people are uh the micos by RTI.

708
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,759
And then this one just came out this

709
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:54,640
year. It's uh by a gentleman named Ron

710
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,240
Wallace. He's over in um Rhode Island

711
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,159
and he's a giant pumpkin world record

712
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,919
holder and his product is guaranteed at

713
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,600
300 scores per gram. It's actually um

714
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,600
but he has testing on his website for 5

715
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:10,240
to 600 sports per gram and it runs $12 a

716
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:13,038
pound 5 lb increments. Um so these are

717
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,480
the two products I use. Now most of

718
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,839
these companies I think are sourcing it

719
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,599
all from the same place and just cutting

720
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,158
it at different levels. There's very few

721
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:22,639
people that are actually uh actively

722
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,679
cultivating uh and no mic horizon. Most

723
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,120
of it's coming out of Canada. But again,

724
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,038
we're still taking their word for a

725
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,639
certain for to a certain level that

726
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:32,640
actually what they say is in here is in

727
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,480
here. I did hear back from the Oregon

728
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,559
Department of A that the numbers on the

729
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,919
micros product were pretty accurate. Um

730
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:39,599
but they haven't released that yet to

731
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,799
the public. They just that was all they

732
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,519
could tell me was that they came back

733
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:46,000
looking pretty good. So again, you know,

734
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,079
you can spend $14 for two scores per

735
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,839
gram um thinking you're buying a

736
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,720
microisal product. It really isn't going

737
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,918
to do anything. And if if you buy a

738
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,440
fertilizer bag that says it contains

739
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,840
microisa, you're probably not getting

740
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,360
microisal because um they put just

741
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,558
enough to get on the label. It'll be

742
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:05,199
like 01 or 05 spores per gram. There's

743
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,359
really nothing in there. Um one other

744
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,120
thing I want to mention about it is it

745
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,879
needs to come in direct contact with the

746
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,119
roots. If it's more than I think it was

747
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,880
like 5 millimeters from a root tip,

748
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,879
it'll never infect your grow. That plant

749
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,120
will just stay as a spore. So, it

750
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,520
actually requires those root exodates in

751
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,639
order to in order to grow. So, really

752
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,240
important that you put it down into the

753
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,000
root. Sprinkling it on top of your soil

754
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,798
and watering is just not an effective

755
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,400
way to get that infection. So for me, if

756
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,400
I'm planting a bed of strawberries or

757
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,480
I'm transplanting a rooted clone, I'm

758
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,000
putting it directly into the root zone,

759
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,919
right into my transplant hole or I'm

760
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,440
sprinkling it right on the roots in the

761
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,320
plant and then I'm forgetting. I'm not

762
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,600
going to worry about worry about it

763
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:45,278
here. Uh the only other thing about

764
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,678
micro I like to mention is in addition

765
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:49,679
to tricoderma, high phosphorus has been

766
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,519
found to inhibit this relationship,

767
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,200
which makes a lot of sense. The plant is

768
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,720
getting all the phosphorus it needs.

769
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,960
It's not going to try and cultivate this

770
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,399
relationship. Uh Jeff Blanchfell is

771
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,640
writing an entire book that's going to

772
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,119
be out this winter just on microisal

773
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,480
fungus which should be uh should be

774
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,879
really really good. There's a lot about

775
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,440
this um this particular relationship

776
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,278
that we're still

777
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,519
learning. Uh so this photo here is of

778
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:17,200
neatus fungi. I like it because

779
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:18,639
uh it's it's a wonderful illustration of

780
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,919
all the things that we don't know that's

781
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,080
going on in the soil. So this is a fruit

782
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,240
eating neatode. Neatodes are blind. It's

783
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,798
crawling through looking for fury and it

784
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,159
stumbles into these rings right here.

785
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:34,879
And these rings um are when they fill

786
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,440
this this is an actual fungus that when

787
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,640
the neode goes through it, it actually

788
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,558
can close and it's it's like

789
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,120
instantaneous. It's like one of a second

790
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,278
and it fills with water and then it will

791
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,959
consume that neatode and then use that

792
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:49,200
nutrients to feed itself and in turn

793
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,798
feed the plant. So it's these natural

794
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,319
systems that we weren't even aware of

795
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,079
that were going on in the soil this

796
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,599
whole time that uh are really

797
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,639
fascinating and these are the sort of

798
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,439
things that we want to promote. That's

799
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,600
why these microorganisms are so so

800
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,919
important to the biological aspect of

801
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:07,359
growing. Uh so prozzoa one thing I want

802
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,038
just want to say about them is they they

803
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:12,199
consume a ton of bacteria. They're what

804
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:14,640
keep bacteria in check for us them and

805
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,558
neatodes. And so they they retain the

806
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,080
nutrients and then when they die um

807
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:22,879
after eating all this bacteria, what

808
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,879
they poop out is also uh soil available

809
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,000
nutrients. These are nematodes. That's

810
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,398
actually a good neatode there. And those

811
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,558
are little wants and it eats bacteria.

812
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:35,199
This is a root feeding neode here. This

813
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:37,278
is this is this neatode under a

814
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,120
microscope. So you can see the see the

815
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,440
difference. And there's a root feeding

816
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,519
one actually inside of the root there.

817
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,679
Um, so nematodes are good and bad. You

818
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,759
can buy them

819
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:50,640
um actually online for different a

820
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,960
variety of different uh diseases as a

821
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,679
biological control. I personally haven't

822
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,840
used them, but I you will if you look at

823
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,360
a slide of good soil or compost, you

824
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,959
will naturally see a bunch of

825
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,719
nematodeses. However, nematodes don't

826
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,880
like a liquid medium. So, you won't find

827
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,200
them um in compost tea. They don't grow

828
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,000
in compost tea. They don't like being in

829
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,640
water.

830
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,240
So nematodes are kind of like the I

831
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,640
guess the lions and tigers that are the

832
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,319
apex predator of the soil. Um they

833
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,320
mineralize these nutrients in plant

834
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,519
available forms and then they find a

835
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,558
food source for other other

836
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,558
microorganisms as

837
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:32,240
well. So worms uh are actually not

838
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,278
native to North America. That's

839
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,359
something I didn't know. They were

840
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,278
brought over by Europeans I believe or

841
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,119
maybe the Vikings. I don't know. But

842
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,038
they weren't the Germans. Okay, the

843
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:44,959
Germans, they weren't here originally.

844
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:47,119
Um, they're amazing shredders. So,

845
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,558
compost that would or organic matter

846
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,599
that would normally take one two years

847
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:53,359
to decompose uh without worms can be

848
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,038
decomposed in 3 months. So, they shred

849
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,798
everything down really really well and

850
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:00,158
they increase your microbial activity in

851
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:02,798
the soil. um and what they excrete is

852
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,039
not only going to be higher in uh

853
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,319
beneficial

854
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:07,759
microorganisms, but it's they haven't

855
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,678
figured it out yet, but when it come

856
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,200
when by processing through the worm's

857
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,440
body, it comes out with five times the

858
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,080
levels of nitrogen, uh seven times

859
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,399
levels of phosphates, and 11 times the

860
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:21,119
levels of potach, which is potassium.

861
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:23,119
So, uh worms are worms are amazing

862
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:25,038
creatures. Now, I'm not I'm not saying

863
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,398
go out and buy worms for your garden or

864
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,759
take worms and throw them in your in

865
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:31,199
your container plants. Um, if the

866
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,519
conditions are right, the worms will

867
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,278
appear. Um, otherwise, you're just

868
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,960
wasting your money and you're feeding

869
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:38,798
your neighbor's garden or killing off a

870
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,640
bunch of worms. And if you do want to

871
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:43,359
buy worms for a worm in, uh, you can buy

872
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,360
the cocoons online and they're uh much

873
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:49,918
much more affordable. Um, yes. But is

874
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:52,240
there any um like program? I'm I'm a

875
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,759
student that will permit me to get a

876
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,919
loan to have started compost pile and

877
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,480
that other people could use that compost

878
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,600
pile and that we can use natural soil

879
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,480
and have no need of any any chemicals at

880
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:09,439
all. I have no idea on that. I know well

881
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,798
I I I know I may I'm getting in contact

882
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,960
with them. Okay.

883
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:17,519
Yeah, there are um there are programs

884
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,960
for composting through different cities,

885
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,919
I know, and counties, but I'm not sure

886
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,519
about for worms, but um well, it's not

887
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,679
specifically the worms at all. Just have

888
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,079
Oh, just for composting. Yeah, just have

889
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,720
natural soil and no need of bringing any

890
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,119
soil on, taking any nutrients out at

891
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,600
all. Yeah. Yeah, there probably there

892
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,119
probably are things like that available.

893
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:41,158
I'm just not familiar with them. All

894
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:43,839
right. Yeah. Thank you. So

895
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,679
uh the reason I show this slide is just

896
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,599
so people realize that it's not a linear

897
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,320
progression. All these things are

898
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:53,359
interacting together. Uh that bird for

899
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,960
example is going to have mites and and

900
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,398
other microorganisms on its feet every

901
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,000
time it lands. It's going to fly

902
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,158
somewhere else and drop down these

903
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,079
things. Um it's going to the bathroom

904
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,919
which is being eaten by you know

905
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,278
bacteria, nematodes, all these different

906
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,799
organisms. So they work together um

907
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:11,398
symbiotically. It's it's a web not a not

908
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:13,679
a linear

909
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:16,518
relationship. Uh this is a chart I like

910
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,440
to show people because

911
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:21,359
um it really starting over on this end.

912
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,798
We have the plants that prefer highly

913
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:26,398
bacterial soils. As soils progress, they

914
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:29,038
become more fungally dominant all the

915
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,798
way down to an end like here. Um

916
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:31,919
cannabis, veggies, things, they end up

917
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:34,398
right around here. They want a balance

918
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,240
of bacteria and fungus. That being said,

919
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:38,398
when we make compost te's when we're

920
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,240
looking at microbial products, uh, we're

921
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:41,599
just trying to put out, it's a shotgun

922
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,319
approach. We're putting out what we can

923
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,599
and let the plant really be in control.

924
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:47,200
A lot of people get caught up on this

925
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,839
chart and say, "Well, I'm growing

926
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,440
tomatoes and tomatoes like bacterial

927
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,558
soil. So, I'm only going to do things to

928
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,480
feed the bacteria or I'm going to add

929
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:57,519
bacteria." Which gets us away from that

930
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,120
whole thing that I was showing you

931
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,359
earlier where the plant really controls

932
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,359
that environment.

933
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,240
In fact, uh, one of the things

934
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,039
interesting things about plants is they

935
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,119
can adjust the pH in the ryosphere. So

936
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,639
even if the pH of the soil or the water

937
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,559
you're using or the nutrients is not

938
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,559
what the ideal for the plant, it can

939
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:20,719
actually change the pH right in the soil

940
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:22,878
itself. Um, for whatever it needs, and I

941
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,519
found with our soils over time, the pH

942
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:27,838
just settles into that, you know, 66 to

943
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:30,719
68 range. Even if we started with a soil

944
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:32,559
that was 7 72 um higher than you would

945
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,519
traditionally think to use for a plant.

946
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:38,000
Yes. Do you know how uh it's through the

947
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:40,960
X again the stuffing out into the soil?

948
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,079
They they release certain organic acids

949
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,720
that will adjust adjust the soil pH.

950
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:51,200
Yes. Do they release those same organic

951
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:52,878
acids in soilless mediums? Um I believe

952
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,239
so. But I don't think that if you don't

953
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,239
if you don't have enough microbial

954
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:59,000
activity going on around there then you

955
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:02,559
won't have that same effect.

956
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,559
Um but that's a good question. I it it

957
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,199
depends I think on the media too. Like

958
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,358
cocoa can support cocoa core can support

959
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,598
a fair amount of microbial life but it's

960
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:13,119
it's inert when you first you first get

961
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,680
it. If you were mixing worm castings

962
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,200
with some other uh biological source

963
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,799
into there then I think it would have

964
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,319
much better chance. whereas Pete Moss

965
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,440
already has a lot of good microbial

966
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,599
activity in it. So um it just depends if

967
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,480
you're talking a rock wall or you know

968
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,960
truly hydroponic situation then um I

969
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,960
wouldn't really

970
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:36,719
know. So having good u microorganism

971
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,118
activity increases your disease

972
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,879
protection your nutrient immobilization

973
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,119
against lockup within the cellular walls

974
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,680
of the plants. uh you get the right

975
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,079
nutrients at the right

976
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:50,719
time and uh it helps decompose toxins,

977
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,680
get rid of residues. Uh that on the lawn

978
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:55,759
is a classic example of uh not having

979
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:58,239
enough microbial activity in your in

980
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,480
your soil. Um it builds your soil

981
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:04,039
structure, reduces your water use,

982
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,639
increases water capacity and on and

983
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:11,039
on. So how do we increase beneficial

984
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:12,319
biology? Well, bunch of ways. um compost

985
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,279
being one of the one most people are

986
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,599
most familiar with. Uh mulching compost

987
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,760
TE's uh nutrient TE's that are going to

988
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,119
feed microorganisms in the soil and then

989
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,240
organic fertilizers.

990
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,920
Um I'm not going to spend a lot of time

991
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:27,199
on these uh because I think you guys are

992
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,000
probably pretty familiar with them, but

993
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:32,399
I can always cut back if we have time.

994
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,639
Uh a few different types of of compost,

995
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,240
thermal, static, and worm composting.

996
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:39,519
Um, if you're buying compost, I tend to

997
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:42,000
recommend the worm castings just

998
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:44,400
because, uh, most likely the worms did a

999
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,920
better job of it than than we did. Um,

1000
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,039
thermal composting, you actually have to

1001
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,119
heat the material up to 131° for 3 days

1002
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,199
where you turn it, keep it below 160.

1003
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,800
Um, it's quite a process. Static

1004
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,719
composting, you literally just leave it

1005
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,640
a pile, let it sit there for a year or

1006
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,439
two or 6 months or whatever until it

1007
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:03,039
breaks down.

1008
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,039
Um, compost, not all compost is created

1009
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:06,559
equal. Um, every time I walk through the

1010
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:08,400
grocery store, for example, when I walk

1011
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,559
by these bags of compost, I just have to

1012
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,838
shake my head cuz they're not anything I

1013
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,838
would ever let anywhere near my garden.

1014
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:17,920
Um, a lot of it a lot of the municipal

1015
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,920
composts are really, in my opinion,

1016
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,838
poorly made. Um, and when you look at

1017
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,119
them under under a microscope, you can

1018
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:24,799
see that they're not they're typically

1019
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,240
not finished. Um, that's where you get

1020
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,800
all the ammonia and some of the off

1021
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,639
casting and the odors. Yes. Also an

1022
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,560
issue with marine compost now with

1023
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:35,759
bioplastics is that there's there's

1024
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:38,078
actually PLA in the in the compost that

1025
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,000
has broken down all the way. So do you

1026
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,160
know what the life is on them? Uh well

1027
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,760
it depends on the actual product and it

1028
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,358
depends on the facility and how well

1029
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,800
they're like you said in a in a in a

1030
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,159
high heat compost compost facility. Uh

1031
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,320
if they're really doing their job and

1032
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,239
they're screening well um you can end up

1033
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,240
with very little residue. But uh I used

1034
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,319
to work in in commercial composting and

1035
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,078
you know you uh believe the stuff that

1036
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,280
gets through those bags. I would never

1037
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,280
put it in my garden either. Yeah.

1038
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,639
Uh so there's a bunch of different types

1039
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,319
of teas that you can make and I like I

1040
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:13,759
like to differentiate the difference so

1041
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,160
people can understand what we're talking

1042
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,320
about. uh plant teas that would be an

1043
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,879
example of uh well something like this

1044
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,320
here or uh using like and I'll talk I'll

1045
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,400
give some examples here like nettles

1046
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,160
comfrey where you take it steep it in

1047
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,920
liquid and then water it um you're not

1048
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,399
using compost as a source the main

1049
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,559
benefit is is for nutrients not for

1050
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,519
beneficial

1051
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:37,759
microorganisms the other thing I hear

1052
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,440
people talk about when they say te's uh

1053
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,800
they're actually talking about leeing so

1054
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,639
the stuff that comes out the bottom of

1055
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,359
their compost pile or out the bottom of

1056
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:47,838
their worm bin Uh that's not really a

1057
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:50,400
compost tea either. Um it's going to be

1058
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:52,239
high in nutrients, but it's not going to

1059
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,838
have a lot of beneficial microorganisms.

1060
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:55,919
You may get some bacteria that slide

1061
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:57,759
through there. Um but that's something

1062
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,400
that you would need to uh be careful

1063
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,640
with and make sure to dilute down quite

1064
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,000
a lot before watering your plants. Uh

1065
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:05,118
the last thing I like to mention on that

1066
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is if your worm bin, you're getting a

1067
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,920
lot of liquid out the bottom of your

1068
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,519
worm bin, you're putting in either way

1069
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,720
too much veggies or you're overwatering

1070
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,920
it because it really you shouldn't get

1071
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:15,199
anything on the bottom. uh manure teas.

1072
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,480
That's something maybe your grandparents

1073
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,319
did where they throw a bunch of manure

1074
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,519
in a bucket and it stinks up in place in

1075
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,599
the barrel and then you water your

1076
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,358
plants with it. Um you're going to get

1077
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,720
nitrogen and other nutrients, but you

1078
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:26,078
are also potentially getting some

1079
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:27,919
pathogens there. So you have to be

1080
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,519
really careful. Um that's something that

1081
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,880
I think would work great for roses, but

1082
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:32,639
I wouldn't use in my vegetable garden

1083
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,880
because I don't want to risk ecoli,

1084
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,440
salmonella, all these things that are

1085
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,000
known and a

1086
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:42,400
rose. Uh put to sleep teas. These are

1087
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,800
those things that you're buying um in

1088
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,720
the store, the hydra shop where you you

1089
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,400
know they have a label and you put it

1090
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:50,799
you put it in a bucket and then they

1091
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,760
tell you you can water it in. Um I

1092
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,519
looked at a lot of these under

1093
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,440
microscope and there's just not a lot

1094
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,199
going on a lot of times which makes

1095
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,639
sense when you think about it because

1096
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,399
you're making these organisms go

1097
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,480
dormant. They're left on the shelf for

1098
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,079
who knows how long. Um I try to avoid

1099
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,639
these products whenever possible unless

1100
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,599
I don't have any other alternatives.

1101
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:13,279
Uh compost extract is where uh the

1102
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,800
farmer has a ton of a ton of compost and

1103
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,160
doesn't have time to brew it all and

1104
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,960
just needs a lot of liquid. So they're

1105
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:22,078
just stripping the microorganisms off of

1106
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,920
the com the soil aggregates out into a

1107
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,240
liquid media and then applying it to the

1108
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,240
plant. Um and then lastly, the one that

1109
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:31,959
I'm most familiar with is airated

1110
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:34,078
compost tees. It's also called ACT uh or

1111
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,039
ACT. And that was really what our

1112
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,640
company specialized in for 10 years. And

1113
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,440
the whole idea behind it is really

1114
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:43,039
simple. Uh we want uh aerobically

1115
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,800
brewed. So we're selecting for aerobic

1116
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:48,079
microorganisms. These are ones that want

1117
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,000
high uh high levels of oxygen. When you

1118
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,079
walk down to the edge of a pond or a

1119
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,159
swamp and it's all that stinky smell,

1120
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,680
that's from uh anorobes, things that

1121
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:59,279
like low uh low to no oxygen levels. Um

1122
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,199
whereas if you pick up really healthy

1123
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,200
soil it has very little odor to it if

1124
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:05,239
any that's all those beneficial

1125
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:07,919
microorganisms that are are

1126
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:10,078
growing. So uh next to that the water

1127
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,838
source is really important. Having uh

1128
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,119
having clean water without chlorine or

1129
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:18,799
chloromines in it. Um and then lastly

1130
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:20,559
compost is is the last is the last two

1131
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,160
one of the last two ingredients. So

1132
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:23,358
having compost that has good biology in

1133
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:27,279
it because your brewer is only going to

1134
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:29,519
replicate the micro you put into it. Um,

1135
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,880
and then what food source you add to

1136
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,280
that is going to determine what

1137
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,119
microorganisms grow. So, it can be as

1138
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,839
simple as literally throwing some

1139
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,519
compost in a bucket, stirring it for 24

1140
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:41,599
hours, you know, as you walk by

1141
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,199
periodically and watering down with

1142
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,880
that. Or you can get really scientific

1143
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:46,639
with it in my brewer where you know

1144
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,559
you're maintain your dissolved oxygen

1145
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:51,039
levels above 6 milligrams per liter for

1146
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,559
the entire brew cycle. And you know,

1147
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,159
that's what our company is. We tested

1148
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,480
all this and we came up with recipes and

1149
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,679
I can tell you at this elevation at this

1150
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,838
temperature you should brew for this

1151
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,000
length and you'll get this this final

1152
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:03,440
product. But don't get daunted by that.

1153
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,440
Like to feel like you have to go out and

1154
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,440
buy a brewer. You can make these things

1155
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,720
at home. I can send you links. Um

1156
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,720
there's plenty of ways to do it

1157
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,239
affordably on your own too. Yes. The

1158
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,399
same thing of like putting the the

1159
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,838
compost is like putting worm castings in

1160
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,280
and you can do the same thing with

1161
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:20,078
Exactly. And is this the same thing

1162
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,880
where like you put a a little pond pump

1163
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,720
in the bucket

1164
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,318
is that is that is also in your

1165
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:30,559
experience for irration. If it is a pump

1166
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:34,800
that has an impeller motor where the the

1167
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:37,039
micro the compost the microorg

1168
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,000
times that will kill off a lot of the

1169
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:42,159
the microbes. Now, if you were to have

1170
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,280
an air pump where you're pushing oxygen

1171
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:49,598
into a tank where you use an airdood,

1172
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:52,560
then um it's it's much better for for

1173
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,960
the for the organisms. Um that being

1174
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,559
said, when this industry first started,

1175
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,559
you know, 15 20 years ago, they were

1176
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:01,279
using little aquarium pumps and a little

1177
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:02,719
tiny uh airstone, and then we found that

1178
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,119
those really weren't maintaining enough

1179
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:06,639
oxygen um to the levels that we wanted.

1180
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,640
So, they ended up we had now bigger

1181
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:10,159
pumps. And then we found that airston

1182
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,559
really hard to clean. You have to use

1183
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:14,879
like muratic acid and they get clogged

1184
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,199
with bofilm. That's the because the

1185
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,280
bacteria forms glues to try and stick

1186
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:22,639
around there. And uh if you don't get it

1187
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:26,079
clean, it will build up kind of like uh

1188
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,519
Jeff's example of our bofilm being the

1189
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,280
plaque on your teeth in the morning. You

1190
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:31,280
wake up that slimy surface that's all

1191
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,119
created by bacteria. So you actually

1192
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,400
have to remove that. It's really hard to

1193
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,720
do that on an air stone.

1194
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,639
Uh, this is like this is our my little

1195
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:42,000
lab at home. My little home office now.

1196
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:46,480
It's pretty fun. That's my microscope

1197
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,079
set up. Um, and this is what the tea

1198
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,000
looks like under a microscope. I don't

1199
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,400
know if you can really see, but there's

1200
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,199
a lot of bacteria cruising around. This

1201
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,200
is the the fungal hay. It's eating. This

1202
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,078
is probably like a piece of alalfa or a

1203
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:00,960
small bit of

1204
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:02,240
organic. But this is what we're looking

1205
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,599
for under the microscope because

1206
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,199
otherwise you just have a bucket of

1207
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,160
brown water. you really have no idea

1208
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,919
what the heck is in it.

1209
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:11,519
Um, and while this is the microscope is

1210
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,480
fun, it's not necessarily a tool that

1211
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,960
everyone needs to needs to use, but it

1212
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,599
is it is a great one to have around. Um,

1213
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,400
what power is that? This is this is

1214
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,359
probably at uh 200 times magnification.

1215
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,760
You're probably getting a little bit

1216
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:29,480
more from

1217
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,480
the from the camera itself.

1218
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,640
Uh so the last thing in the little in

1219
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,039
the biology aspect of this is uh

1220
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,480
biological controls. This is something

1221
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:40,318
that's becoming really popular in

1222
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,159
cannabis. Um I know I had the issue with

1223
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,159
grips and I was just going in the

1224
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:45,519
flower. I didn't want to spray anything

1225
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,879
because I was already scared to get some

1226
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:52,079
pistol formation out here. So um I

1227
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,240
bought some of the the cucaris which is

1228
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,200
a insect right here that will eat the

1229
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,799
juvenile ths. and uh roof feedles was

1230
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,439
another one that will consume grips as

1231
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,720
well as fungusn larv. So these are these

1232
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,960
are alternatives and ways to control

1233
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:09,679
uh different disease problems in your

1234
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,079
garden without having to spray or

1235
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:13,358
anything anything dangerous. Um there's

1236
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,839
a bunch of different companies that sell

1237
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:18,239
these online fire for shame back there

1238
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,880
with natural defense. Uh I've used

1239
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:22,078
Evergreen Brewers in the past. Um

1240
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,680
there's there's a whole bunch of

1241
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,440
different places you can get these these

1242
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:28,000
bugs.

1243
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,440
I wouldn't buy these in a store. I would

1244
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,920
order them online and have them shipped

1245
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,559
to you. Um, just so that you know it is

1246
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:38,800
is going to be um fresh and and more

1247
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:40,639
viable. So that was the first 10 years

1248
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,000
of my gardening experience right there

1249
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,719
and that was the extent of my knowledge.

1250
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,358
So I thought okay if I have a problem I

1251
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:49,039
put on more compost it solves everything

1252
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:50,559
and I get healthy plants. I didn't

1253
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:52,639
really get into the whole idea of these

1254
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,279
different minerals and their and their

1255
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,960
point the nutrients in the soil until I

1256
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,440
read uh Steve Solomon's book the

1257
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,240
intelligent gardener. Has anyone in here

1258
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,880
read this book? Few people. Okay, great.

1259
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,078
I always promote it in my talks. Uh I I

1260
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,960
talk to Steve all the time online now.

1261
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:12,880
Um and basically what what he did in his

1262
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,679
introduction in his book I think is

1263
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,440
really what made it sold me on it. So

1264
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:20,078
he's found a territorial seed down in

1265
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,639
Oregon. uh back in the 70s he was

1266
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,800
homesteading feeding I think 80% off of

1267
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:27,679
just his land triing all these different

1268
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:31,440
seed crops um really committing to this

1269
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:32,719
homestead lifestyle and over time as he

1270
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,599
was doing this you know he was just

1271
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:37,439
bringing in more compost like you teach

1272
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,359
um and his teeth started his gums

1273
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,838
started to get loose and his wife's

1274
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:44,480
fingernails were softening and they

1275
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:47,519
moved to Fiji and while they were living

1276
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:50,159
in Fiji they uh their health improved

1277
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,519
dramatically micro. So he wanted to look

1278
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,118
they were in the exact same diet. They

1279
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,239
weren't growing themselves, but he he

1280
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,318
looked at where their vegetables are

1281
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,799
growing and they found that they had a

1282
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:00,318
field where or valley where where all

1283
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,240
these veggies were being grown that was

1284
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,159
flooded every year by ignous rock

1285
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,000
deposits. So essentially the field was

1286
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:08,039
being remmineralized with all these rock

1287
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,039
dust every year by this

1288
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:13,920
river. And uh so then he moved back to

1289
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,440
Oregon and continued with the same diet

1290
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,000
and started having the exact same health

1291
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,720
problems. So he started looking into

1292
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,480
this idea of mineralization and it

1293
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:24,480
actually dates all the way back to the I

1294
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,280
think the 1910s or the 1920s with

1295
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,039
William Alrech um and since then there's

1296
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,040
been people like Michael Stera Carrie

1297
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:34,159
Reeves with the whole idea that if you

1298
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:36,239
balance the minerals in the soil um

1299
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,838
everything else all the beneficial

1300
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:40,399
microorganisms and everything else will

1301
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:42,078
take care of themselves whereas the

1302
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,720
first half of my talk there when you

1303
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,400
hear from um Dr. like Ingum and Jeff

1304
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,559
Loenfells is like if you just if you get

1305
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,079
all the beneficial microorganisms there

1306
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,400
they'll make everything available in the

1307
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,720
soil and you don't have to worry about

1308
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,160
minerals. So Steve what Steve had to say

1309
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,480
made a lot of sense to me. I mean if you

1310
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,159
plant a tomato in soil that doesn't have

1311
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,358
the right levels of you know zinc and

1312
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:03,358
maganesees and all these other things

1313
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:04,960
then they're not going to be in that

1314
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:06,639
tomato and then what I'm eating is not

1315
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,639
going to be as healthy as it could have

1316
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:11,199
been and neither neither is the crop

1317
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:13,358
itself. So this is where he started

1318
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:15,118
getting the idea of soil testing. So, a

1319
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:17,519
lot of his a lot of his book is is

1320
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,358
pretty dry, but it's it's on the whole

1321
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,039
concept of balancing the minerals to

1322
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,039
grow nutrient-dense vegetables. So, the

1323
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:26,480
healthiest vegetables possible. And he

1324
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:28,400
claims that since doing this, uh, he he

1325
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,079
actually started fat. He had to stop

1326
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,000
eating so many vegetables because they

1327
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:36,318
were so much healthier for him. Um, and

1328
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,880
he also looked at different cultures

1329
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:40,960
around the world and what sort of

1330
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,519
mineral and nutrient deficiencies those

1331
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,838
populations had based on the soils that

1332
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:49,119
they were growing agriculturally on. So

1333
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,960
really, really interesting idea. Um,

1334
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,960
this is a test from a friend of mine.

1335
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,679
This is actually on our soils that we

1336
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,679
make. This is this soil that is uh I

1337
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:00,078
believe three years old that we've been

1338
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:03,358
amending, you know, every cycle for

1339
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:05,039
cannabis. And uh this is the test result

1340
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:07,440
that we got back. Now, these test

1341
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:08,558
results, one test here is just $25. So,

1342
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,400
if you have a garden, you want to test

1343
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,680
your soil, it's 25 bucks. You're

1344
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,280
probably going to spend that on

1345
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,719
fertilizer anyway and not even know if

1346
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,680
you're getting the right fertilizer for

1347
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:19,439
your garden. Um so, it's a great great

1348
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:22,318
option for people. The lab that we

1349
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,679
really like to use is Logan Labs. Um,

1350
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:25,920
was that your question? Is that correct?

1351
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:28,239
Yes. So, Logan Labs standard soil test.

1352
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,559
It's 25 bucks. It explains on their

1353
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:34,399
website how to take a sample.

1354
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:36,720
Um, the thing about So, King County will

1355
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,639
give you a free soil test with ANL Labs,

1356
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:40,719
but they don't look at anything beyond

1357
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,239
uh your macronutrients. So, that that

1358
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:45,118
free test doesn't tell us levels of

1359
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:47,279
boron or iron or zinc um or any of these

1360
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,800
other these other micro nutrients or

1361
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,839
trace minerals that we may want.

1362
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,680
So this is this is our greenhouse. I say

1363
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,838
it doesn't work. I I don't know whe our

1364
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:59,919
plants love it. I mean this was our

1365
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:01,519
first year growing in this fashion. Um

1366
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,280
this is actually from this year at the

1367
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,838
beginning of the season. This was from a

1368
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,280
couple years ago um in our inside of our

1369
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:09,078
greenhouse that one of our own employees

1370
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,519
built.

1371
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:12,880
Um we have exceptionally healthy plants.

1372
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:14,559
you really like to the reason I call it

1373
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,920
biological horiculture is because I like

1374
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,160
the idea of doing both that that

1375
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,720
biological aspect but also incorporating

1376
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:23,639
the science and horiculture of mineral

1377
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:25,799
balancing and some of these other

1378
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:28,639
things. All right.

1379
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,318
So what I told Shango I would talk about

1380
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:32,639
this whole idea of wildcraft and you're

1381
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:35,279
growing your own nutrients. This is

1382
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:39,199
comfrey. Um from this angle you can't

1383
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,880
really see but uh all along here we have

1384
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,279
um our fence line around our employee

1385
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,358
garden. So we planted comfrey all the

1386
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,200
way along that edge because comfry is a

1387
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,279
dynamic accumulator. It pulls up

1388
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:51,919
nutrients out of the soil into its

1389
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,519
biomass and it produces a ton of biomass

1390
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,519
which you get to harvest three or four

1391
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:58,880
times a year and you can use it to feed

1392
00:50:55,519 --> 00:51:01,599
your worms to feed your animals to um

1393
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,440
compost or just um a lot of times in

1394
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,599
orchards they'll plant a gill around the

1395
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,119
trees and literally just cut it down and

1396
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,599
lay it back down right there in the

1397
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,440
spot. So it's it's an amazing plant. I

1398
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,519
actually have a couple here. This

1399
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,760
particular cultivar that we have is the

1400
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:18,800
R is a Russian cultivar called Bocking

1401
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,240
14. It's sterile. So that means it's not

1402
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,160
going to take over. Most people hear the

1403
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:24,959
word comfort and they they freak out and

1404
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:26,558
I get it. So where you do plant it,

1405
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,800
you're committing to having it there for

1406
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,559
the rest of your life. My employees

1407
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,000
screwed up in a few places and now I

1408
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:35,839
can't get rid of it. It's in the garden

1409
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,159
itself. Um if you dig around that area,

1410
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:40,558
just a quarter of a root will form a new

1411
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:43,920
plant. So, it's super easy to propagate

1412
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:46,559
too once you have it in place. Yes. Is

1413
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,920
Russian is the Russian cultivar the one

1414
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,119
though that you want to be really

1415
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,440
careful about ingesting? I know there is

1416
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,880
there sort of two basic types of comfry

1417
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,358
and there's one that you really want to

1418
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,440
be careful about ingesting. I read a lot

1419
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:01,838
of stuff on comry and depending on which

1420
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,000
website you go to, some will say it is

1421
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:06,239
it has a you know a low melonated

1422
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,519
toxicity and then other ones say it's

1423
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:11,519
this amazing medicine. Um, I personally

1424
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,119
don't ingest it. We do feed it in small

1425
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:15,599
amounts to our animals and we haven't

1426
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,680
had any issues, but I couldn't comment

1427
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,480
on that. It's one of those things I

1428
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:23,199
don't depends leaf or root and the root

1429
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,880
while it has great use topically does

1430
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:26,719
have the stuff that you don't want to

1431
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,480
ingest. That said, I've been growing it

1432
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:31,480
and eating it for 30 years and I'm

1433
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,480
obviously

1434
00:52:32,909 --> 00:52:38,719
[Music]

1435
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:42,239
okay. So, here's a nutritional profile

1436
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:45,598
on comry. Um, you can find these for any

1437
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:48,719
any plant. Um, this is a beautiful

1438
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,240
flower. Bees love it as well. Uh, borage

1439
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:52,000
is another one. I brought a few plants

1440
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:54,799
out of that. Another dynamic

1441
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,480
accumulator. It self slows, so wherever

1442
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,160
you plant it, if you let it go to seed,

1443
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,440
you'll have a ton of them. It's easy to

1444
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:01,358
pull out, though, so it's not a big deal

1445
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,200
if it does. And the flowers are actually

1446
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:04,960
wonderful. They're edible. You can have

1447
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:07,598
it in the salad. They don't taste like

1448
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,318
anything, but they look nice and Uh

1449
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,680
here's uh my dad grew a few plants a

1450
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:12,880
while back in this tiny greenhouse and

1451
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:14,440
we had some borage growing right there

1452
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,440
and there cannabis. It was really

1453
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:19,358
pretty. Uh horse tail or equism is

1454
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,119
another one that's high in silica.

1455
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:23,598
Again, all these things claim to have

1456
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,599
these nutrient profiles, but I like to I

1457
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,800
like to think back to what uh Steve and

1458
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,559
these other guys are saying regarding

1459
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,280
minerals. So if that soil is low in

1460
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,440
silica, well that that equinim is

1461
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,280
probably not going to be really really

1462
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,639
high in it either. Yes. So, I've been

1463
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,880
reading some articles that have been

1464
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:43,199
talking about silica possibly becoming a

1465
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,960
new macronutrient. Yes. Okay. Yes. And

1466
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:47,919
like before people thought it was just

1467
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,079
MK and that was it. And like now silica

1468
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,800
is becoming starting to be thought of as

1469
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:56,720
being almost as needed as MDK. Yeah. If

1470
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:59,519
you if you Google uh silicon s l i l i o

1471
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:01,838
n the strange medium element, there's a

1472
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:03,119
wonderful article that's talking exactly

1473
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,480
what we're talking about. Yeah. I think

1474
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,920
it's a really really important

1475
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,679
underappreciated nutrient. Is there any

1476
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,760
issue with like overdosing plants with

1477
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:15,919
it or besides potassium blocking out? Uh

1478
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,520
I believe well with potassium silicon

1479
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,599
there is because you're also applying

1480
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:21,519
potassium but uh one thing I notic with

1481
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,119
cannabis especially is it really likes

1482
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:25,119
potassium and it seems to really like

1483
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:28,640
silica and I haven't seen what those

1484
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:29,920
upper limits necessarily are but uh yeah

1485
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:31,358
that's one of the things about this is

1486
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,119
it is a balance. So, you're looking at

1487
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:35,598
your they're looking at their calcium to

1488
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:38,480
magnesium ratios and I think there's

1489
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:39,838
another one between like iron and magn I

1490
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,838
don't remember. I have to go back and

1491
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:45,159
read the book for some of those. Yes.

1492
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:47,679
So, do you have to process the horse

1493
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:50,159
tail, compost it, whatever. You can't

1494
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:51,759
just put it in your soil around your

1495
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:53,519
plant. So, most of these are either you

1496
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,839
can you can use them a variety of ways.

1497
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:58,559
So, you can just dry it and throw it

1498
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:02,480
right on top as a mulch. You can uh boil

1499
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,640
it and put it into a pot or you can um

1500
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,400
leave it in a container with water for

1501
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,078
an extended period of time and then

1502
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,400
water your plant. So it's just you're

1503
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,480
just extracting it over time for any of

1504
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,000
these leaves. So for me it's as simple

1505
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,639
as just taking a machete and cutting

1506
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,318
down the the comfry and then laying it

1507
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:20,279
right back down where where it came from

1508
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:22,800
around my around my crops a lot of

1509
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,800
times. Uh willow is another one. It's

1510
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,280
where aspirin comes from and salicylic

1511
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,200
acid. Um, it's a wonderful uh rooting

1512
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,040
hormone, natural rooting hormone. You

1513
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:34,799
can take the twigs. Um, I actually talk

1514
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:38,519
about when I show those podcasts and uh

1515
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:41,359
create your own your own rooting hormone

1516
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:42,880
using this is a chart I got offline.

1517
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:44,159
Just all I want you to get out of this

1518
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,599
is that there are a ton of different

1519
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:47,118
plants out there. I'm happy to share

1520
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,680
this with people. I know it's possible

1521
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:51,039
to read it here. Um, but for all these

1522
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,118
different types of plants, they all have

1523
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,279
different nutrient levels, provided that

1524
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,838
those nutrients are in the soil. Um, I

1525
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:00,240
do see tobacco on here or nitrogen. I

1526
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:01,239
brought a couple tobacco plants here off

1527
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:04,479
for you

1528
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:06,318
guys. Uh, really quickly, this is

1529
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,639
something that a friend of mine um down

1530
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:10,239
in Oregon discovered. You may more

1531
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:13,199
people talk about like the idea sprouted

1532
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:15,118
seed teas or barley teas. Essentially,

1533
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:18,159
barley is really really high enzyatic

1534
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:20,400
activity. That's why we use it for um

1535
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:22,078
for uh brewing beer for example. And

1536
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,318
when you malt it, you're you're

1537
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:27,599
arresting that end at its highest

1538
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:29,199
enzyatic level. So they've done the work

1539
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,960
for you. I actually brought some barley

1540
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:33,039
to raffle off today, but literally all

1541
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,039
you want to do is take it, throw it in

1542
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:37,119
ideally a flower mill, but if you have a

1543
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:39,440
blender or coffee grinder, throw it in

1544
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,720
there and then uh take it and sprinkle

1545
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,318
it over the top of your plants because

1546
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:44,318
if you think about it, that seed has

1547
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:46,558
everything that plant needs to live. It

1548
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,480
has all the enzymes um and everything

1549
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,760
else. Especially uh kiteese is one

1550
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,318
that's really important to us as

1551
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,640
gardeners. Um kiteise is one of the main

1552
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:57,119
ways that the plant protects itself. Um

1553
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:58,719
that's why we add crustation meal and

1554
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,039
different different other aspects to our

1555
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,959
to our soils. Yes. I'm sorry. Is that

1556
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:05,838
special barley? Is it already molted or

1557
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,358
you can use any barley? Molted barley.

1558
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:10,318
Okay. You can buy it at your brewing

1559
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:12,318
store. Okay. So molting is like a

1560
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:13,759
commercial process that they do to the

1561
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:16,480
barley and you want to make sure to buy

1562
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:19,200
molted. You can you can buy regular

1563
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,798
barley. You can sprout it until the I

1564
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:22,879
think it's the merist stem is is half

1565
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:24,639
the length of the seed hawk and then you

1566
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,400
can grind it and then immediately apply

1567
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:28,159
it. But you can also just go out and

1568
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,039
buy,

1569
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:30,960
you know, where they're like

1570
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:32,798
scientifically doing it exactly right

1571
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,318
for you that whole process. But you

1572
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:36,159
don't want to put it in the water and

1573
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:38,159
let it sit. That was the mistake I made.

1574
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:39,679
Um these enzymes break down quite

1575
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:42,159
rapidly. You literally want to just put

1576
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:44,239
it right onto the soil and water it as a

1577
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:48,239
really cheap, affordable

1578
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:50,239
uh thing. And my uh my friend Jan, who

1579
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:52,239
was the one who taught me about this,

1580
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:54,519
I'm doing trials on it right now, but he

1581
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:57,358
claims um

1582
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:59,679
15% sooner flower times for cannabis.

1583
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:02,558
And um he hasn't had any issues, he

1584
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:05,639
says, with powdery milk.

1585
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:08,640
These are pretty big claims, but

1586
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:09,920
um it's it's it's a very affordable way

1587
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:13,039
to do I know guys spending as much as

1588
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,960
two cups a week on a 30 gallon pot. So

1589
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:17,119
that's a top dress of the soil, not

1590
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,720
application on the plant. Yes. Yes.

1591
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,559
You're literally just sprinkling on top

1592
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:22,199
of the soil after you after you grind it

1593
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,400
and then watering

1594
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:27,199
it. Uh biochar

1595
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,519
um there's going to be a talk out here

1596
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:32,558
on that. Uh essentially it's it's based

1597
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:35,119
on terapreta this idea of uh Amazonian

1598
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:38,240
soils that were enhanced over time

1599
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:41,000
through the breakdown of uh carbon and

1600
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:43,598
manurs and organic matter.

1601
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,159
Um I wasn't a big fan of biochar at

1602
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,079
first and uh started learning more and

1603
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:50,239
more about it. The main thing it does is

1604
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,480
erase the CDC for essentially the cat

1605
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:55,759
exchange capacity or the ability of the

1606
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,079
soil to hold on to nutrients. Um does it

1607
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,760
work? Well, this is this is our soil.

1608
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:02,000
Both of these photos, this is our soil

1609
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,319
with 10% added biochar. So, we make a

1610
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,119
biochar soil and my my buddy at Goldie

1611
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:08,400
Garden set this

1612
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:09,760
daily. That really shocked me on the

1613
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,838
first cycle. I thought the main benefit

1614
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,760
of biochar would be over time as it

1615
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:15,759
breaks down it helps retain nutrients in

1616
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,079
the soil, but it really it really does

1617
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,240
seem to be a pretty amazing thing. Um,

1618
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,760
and it's not just charcoal, it's

1619
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:24,318
pyrolyze, which means they're really

1620
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,720
really high heat at very very low oxygen

1621
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:30,239
durations. This is uh my dad. This is my

1622
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:32,078
dad made kil um for making biochar. This

1623
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:33,679
is not a good example of a burn in it. I

1624
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,200
was burning up a bunch of juniper. You

1625
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:38,000
shouldn't see that much ash or white

1626
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:39,679
stuff on top. But um this is the design

1627
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,358
that he used. They sometimes even just

1628
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:43,519
put holes in the ground. But he's trying

1629
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:45,199
to take this concept over to China as a

1630
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:46,960
way of increasing soil fertility over

1631
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:48,239
there in addition to compost tees in

1632
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,920
some of these villages. Yes. Is that

1633
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:54,558
like a gi this giant walk? Pretty much.

1634
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,720
Yeah. um what's in the outside there

1635
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,559
that you're it's got like a a barrier on

1636
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:00,159
the outside but then um the way it's the

1637
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,160
way the air goes through it. If you if

1638
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:04,000
you Google cont kilm you can read all

1639
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:05,358
about them. I don't know I didn't know a

1640
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,838
lot about the physical properties of

1641
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:09,358
this was totally my dad's project. I we

1642
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:11,920
buy our biochar from a company called

1643
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:13,719
black biochar. We don't make our own for

1644
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,720
our

1645
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:18,639
soils. So the last thing and I'll go

1646
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:20,639
really fast. Biological horiculture for

1647
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:22,159
cannabis cultivation. Here is this is I

1648
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:24,358
got this photo from uh Gold Leaf

1649
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:27,679
Gardens. They're a 502

1650
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:29,440
um here that does all organic growing.

1651
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:33,039
Um they're using our biochar soil. Here

1652
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:36,880
they have a micro clover as a um as a

1653
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:38,318
living cover crop for their cannabis. Um

1654
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,838
this is what we're putting into our

1655
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:41,279
soil. I was going to talk about what all

1656
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:44,400
these things are, but I think I'm out of

1657
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,760
time. Um I have a lot of them up here.

1658
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,119
Hey Tad, why don't you go ahead and go

1659
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,880
through it? You've been taking questions

1660
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,720
that we we've been going. We'll just go

1661
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,720
into the question time. So go ahead.

1662
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:56,078
It's interesting stuff. Okay. All right.

1663
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:58,318
I go really fast there. So uh Alaska

1664
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:01,680
Pete Moss. Uh, I like Pete Moss over

1665
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:03,920
cocoa because it has um a little bit

1666
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:05,440
higher cat exchange capacity. Um, the

1667
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,159
biggest reason I like it is because it

1668
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,159
contains existing microbial life. Uh, I

1669
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:12,558
I've tested it my buddy Tim Wilson under

1670
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:16,000
the microscope. Cocoa cord is not. They

1671
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:17,519
both have sustainability issues. Um, but

1672
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,280
I personally prefer Pete Moss. That's

1673
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:22,798
why we use it in our soil and we use

1674
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:25,280
this 50% of our total. Uh, old fish

1675
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:27,519
compost. It's a 2 to three year age fish

1676
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,079
compost. They do use some postconumer

1677
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:32,159
waste which is why or sorry uh they use

1678
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,920
some yard clippings not postconumer

1679
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:35,279
waste so they're not using food scraps

1680
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,920
but that's why I was curious about the

1681
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:41,119
plastics. I was just talking to the guy

1682
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:42,798
today. Um so hard to find high quality

1683
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,200
compost. This was the best I've been

1684
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:46,480
able to find. Um and for the most part I

1685
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:48,798
really like it. I have an example of it

1686
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,358
here. I used it in my garden. Uh earth

1687
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:54,318
castings which I discussed essentially

1688
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:56,798
warm poop. Uh volcanic pummus. It's an

1689
01:01:54,318 --> 01:02:00,480
irration source similar to perlite um

1690
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:02,318
without being heated and it's uh it's

1691
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,358
what adds porocity or arration because

1692
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:07,039
the plants need that in the soil. Um I

1693
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:09,199
prefer it over perlite because it

1694
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,480
doesn't rise in the soil like I prefer

1695
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:12,039
over perlite because it doesn't rise in

1696
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,559
the soil like perlite

1697
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:17,279
does micro catalyst is a product that we

1698
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:20,798
have um it's what we use when we make

1699
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:23,359
compost tea. We're putting it in our uh

1700
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:25,759
in our soil as well. Um when we look at

1701
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:27,679
the place for rock dust and basalt those

1702
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,760
are mineral things adding trace minerals

1703
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,519
to our soil. Um all the things that we

1704
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,079
were talking about there with mineral

1705
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:35,759
balancing. Uh calfos is soft rock

1706
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,079
phosphate. So that's a calcium and

1707
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,960
phosphorous source that's also mined. Uh

1708
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,960
oyster shell flour is a mind calcium

1709
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,119
source calcium carbonate. You could also

1710
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,960
use agricultural line which we have down

1711
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:48,400
below too. Exact same thing. Whichever

1712
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,199
one is cheaper if you're looking to get

1713
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:54,400
calcium in your garden. Um, organic

1714
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:55,759
alphaalfpha meal. Alpha alpha meal is

1715
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,559
probably my second favorite amendment.

1716
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,880
It's it's very low in nutrients. Um,

1717
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,160
it's put on 1% nitrogen, but you're

1718
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,920
picking up something called

1719
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:05,920
triricontinol, which is a plant growth

1720
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,039
hormone, which plants really like.

1721
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,599
That's why you always hear about people

1722
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:12,880
using roses and it's a wonderful

1723
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,798
microbial food like molasses. Um, you

1724
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,519
can get wonderful compost teas and it

1725
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:18,880
just increases your beneficial microbial

1726
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:21,599
activity in the soil and it's really

1727
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:24,720
cheap. Um fishbone meal is a phosphorous

1728
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,519
source. Uh crustation meal is a

1729
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:30,239
wonderful source of

1730
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:32,400
um of uh slowreleas nitrogen and also

1731
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:33,759
kiten we talked about that kitenise

1732
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,079
enzyme that breaks down that's really

1733
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,440
important for disease

1734
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:39,680
protection. Uh kelp meal we already

1735
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,240
talked about a little bit. uh nink cake.

1736
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:44,199
Nink cakes is a is a holy tree out of

1737
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:47,598
India that

1738
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:49,519
uh is slowreleas nitrogen and then it

1739
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:50,720
also is a wonderful bacterial food. I

1740
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:53,119
found I was just testing that with the

1741
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:55,919
microscope recently. But you can take a

1742
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:58,079
couple cups of neck uh put it in water

1743
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,318
solubilize it over a day or two water

1744
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:01,839
the soil it'll kill all uh fungus net

1745
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:03,838
larvae for you. It's a it's a

1746
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:06,480
wonderfully affordable uh fungus net

1747
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:08,960
remedy. Uh karani cake is also out of

1748
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,519
India. It's uh it's another nitrogen

1749
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,679
source as well. Fish meal is a fast

1750
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,318
release nitrogen source. Feather meal is

1751
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:18,480
a slowreleas nitrogen source. Uh bone

1752
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:21,519
meal's got a little phosphorus in it. Um

1753
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,838
calite and egg are just calcium sources.

1754
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:25,199
Um I have microisal on here, but again I

1755
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:26,480
would consider this a microisal

1756
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:28,439
application. That's why it has some

1757
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,400
asterics test in it. And then

1758
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,960
beneficial. So that's what we're putting

1759
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,880
specifically into our soil mix. There's

1760
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:38,000
so many different ways to make your own

1761
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,358
soil mixes as well. Um, but this will

1762
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,440
just give you idea of some of the

1763
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:43,598
variety out there. One thing that I do

1764
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,000
like to caution people on is azamite.

1765
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:48,640
It's actually it's a it's quite high in

1766
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,159
aluminum. So, whenever I see a soil test

1767
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:52,159
where someone use azimite, I can usually

1768
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:54,159
tell right away just by looking at the

1769
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:55,759
aluminum levels. I think there's better

1770
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:57,440
options, especially locally. We talk

1771
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,520
about mining things. Well, the the guy

1772
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:01,280
green uh glacial rock test is coming out

1773
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:03,440
of Canada and the basalt's coming out of

1774
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,119
Oregon. So they're they're locally quite

1775
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,960
uh geographically close to us, too,

1776
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,358
which cuts which makes it a little bit

1777
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,358
more

1778
01:05:08,358 --> 01:05:13,679
sustainable. Uh so does it work? Well,

1779
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:15,679
this is uh this this is a crop that's

1780
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:19,399
over four years old here that was grown

1781
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:23,118
by a friend of mine um for under $50 in

1782
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:25,119
nutrients per uh per light. So or per

1783
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:28,559
yard of soil. So and he was averaging

1784
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:30,720
about 1.2 to 1.6 pounds per light um

1785
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:33,519
growing in this style. And literally all

1786
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:35,279
you do is you harvest the plant. So you

1787
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:38,000
yank it out, shake off whatever soil is

1788
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,440
on the roots and uh take it away and

1789
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,760
then you bring it back in a little bit

1790
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,679
of organic matter and uh some we have

1791
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,359
our nutrient impact. But essentially

1792
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:47,199
it's a combination of those nutrient

1793
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:49,519
ingredients that you would remend the

1794
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:52,078
soil with and then 24 hours later you're

1795
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:54,400
replanting uh back into that soil into

1796
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:56,880
your flower room. So it becomes a much

1797
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,920
more uh ecological and sustainable way

1798
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,920
of growing indoors. Yes. Are you tilling

1799
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,760
that stuff back into the soil or are you

1800
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,639
actually just top dressing it and kind

1801
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,720
of That's a good question. So, we're not

1802
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,239
uh we're not literally tilling it. We're

1803
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:12,399
we're disturbing the first few inches of

1804
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:15,759
the soil which are naturally designed to

1805
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,960
be disturbed anyway. Um I've had

1806
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,640
multiple discussions with a friend of

1807
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,798
mine of whether or not that's no till or

1808
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:23,679
not. We are likely disturbing the soil.

1809
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:26,960
So, it's kind of but we're not we're not

1810
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:28,639
like digging it yet.

1811
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,639
Uh here's what a room like that would

1812
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:32,159
look like under uh say AutoCAD or

1813
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:34,318
something. So we have the beds, we're

1814
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:37,440
filling with soil, we're adding levels

1815
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,880
to scrog those beds. Um and this is what

1816
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,159
I think the most efficient way of

1817
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,838
growing is. And this is what we really

1818
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:43,199
promote for people because once that

1819
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:45,038
soil is in place, we're not having to

1820
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:47,279
move it in and out of the facility. We

1821
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:50,559
can lightly amend it and uh everything

1822
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:52,640
stays put. Now this is a this is a shop

1823
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,920
moldy gardens. They're one of our

1824
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:58,558
they're one of our favorite growers.

1825
01:06:54,920 --> 01:07:00,000
um they are doing 4x4 beds on pallets

1826
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:02,400
that they literally can move those

1827
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,559
pallets around the facility um as

1828
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,039
needed. They're actually getting up to

1829
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:09,160
three lbs per light um using the Vita

1830
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:12,799
double-ended hoods and

1831
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:14,558
uh they're using CO2 as well. But uh

1832
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:16,239
really amazing people say that this

1833
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:19,039
style of growing can't produce the same

1834
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:21,038
levels as hydroponics and I I would

1835
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:23,920
disagree. I mean they're they're doing

1836
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,920
really really well.

1837
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:28,880
[Music]

1838
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:30,798
I'm a soil guy. Yeah. But uh yeah, so

1839
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:34,640
this is Gia checking the light levels

1840
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:36,159
with his meter on that. Oh, thanks.

1841
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:37,838
And then uh the last thing I want to

1842
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:40,318
talk about here is blue mats. Anyone

1843
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:41,599
heard of blue mats? Yes. They are auto

1844
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:42,960
waterers. They're awesome. So this

1845
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,200
little carrot here, there's no

1846
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,440
electronics whatsoever. It measures the

1847
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:49,358
moisture tension in the soil. And then

1848
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,519
you can control through these drippers

1849
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:53,759
how much water comes out by turning the

1850
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:55,280
little knob on top right here. And so I

1851
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,039
have this hooked up to a reservoir in

1852
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,200
this photo. I just filled. It's gravity

1853
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,640
fed. And once I dialed it in where I

1854
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:02,159
wanted to, you're done. You don't have

1855
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,318
to water your plant. It takes care of it

1856
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:05,679
for you. I had a guy leave to Alaska. I

1857
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:07,759
came back. His plants were touching the

1858
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:09,199
lights. Um, which was a problem, but

1859
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,520
they were healthy. I mean, after being

1860
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:13,598
gone for a month and having his wife

1861
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:16,960
fill the reservoir. So, you can hook it

1862
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:18,880
up to a mainline. Um, the most important

1863
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,359
thing with these soils is water, keeping

1864
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,359
the soil evenly moist. So, we found if

1865
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,359
if you get a moisture meter from this

1866
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:28,079
company and you keep it between 80 and

1867
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:30,319
120 MR, um, you really keep that dialed

1868
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:33,039
in, uh, you end up with a much much

1869
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,400
better crop than if you have wet dry

1870
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:35,679
cycles or you're not consistent with

1871
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:38,639
your watering. So, we don't want to

1872
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:39,759
stress the plant out um, dramatically

1873
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,000
with our watering. We don't want to

1874
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:43,600
stress these micro either.

1875
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,279
Uh here's just some examples of some

1876
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,120
hybrid programs. These guys are spraying

1877
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,920
chemicals or not spraying chemicals, but

1878
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:51,599
they're applying ionic salts. They're

1879
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,600
throwing the soil after every run, but

1880
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,239
they're still using a high quality soil.

1881
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,838
This is in our biochar soil. Um and

1882
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:59,919
these guys had a bumper crop with it,

1883
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:01,278
but uh you still have the same issues

1884
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,480
then of sustainability, and you're

1885
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:05,000
having to throw away the soil every

1886
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:08,838
cycle.

1887
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:11,238
Um this is another one. These guys are

1888
01:09:08,838 --> 01:09:15,318
uh this is

1889
01:09:11,238 --> 01:09:18,238
uh Green Rush. They're tier three.

1890
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:20,560
Um they they do a phenomenal job, too.

1891
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:24,318
But they're also uh they're throwing out

1892
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:25,759
the soil every run as well.

1893
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,480
And they have a better photographer than

1894
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:31,079
we

1895
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:34,158
do. So, here's some resources.

1896
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:35,039
Um Kiss Organics is our online store. If

1897
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,238
you want to read more about these

1898
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:38,000
amendments or anything like that, we

1899
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:41,039
have a description under every

1900
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,679
amendment. Uh Kiss Farms store and then

1901
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:45,920
logo garden is a free forum that um I

1902
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,399
have with Tim Wilson that you can sign

1903
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,719
up or look at free information on there.

1904
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:53,039
I have the Oregon Department of A list

1905
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,719
on that website right now. Um these are

1906
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:56,279
the two books I talked about and this is

1907
01:09:54,719 --> 01:10:00,920
my contact info if you have any

1908
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:00,920
questions. Thank you for your time.

1909
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,440
So, so yeah. So, so for the folks that

1910
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:14,719
are the kind of people who don't like to

1911
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:16,960
interrupt the speaker, I want to give

1912
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:19,359
you a chance to ask a question. So,

1913
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,960
we'll get three questions. So, who's got

1914
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:22,479
a question or maybe you already asked?

1915
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:26,600
Oh, there you go. What is your masters

1916
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:26,599
in special education?

1917
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,159
Yeah. Soil is just something I'm really

1918
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:35,119
passionate about my whole life.

1919
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:35,119
So that's special

1920
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:41,760
education more

1921
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:44,159
than topical questions. You talk about

1922
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:46,000
developing a symbiotic relationship with

1923
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:48,000
the microbes. Is there a best time to do

1924
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,800
that? it's something that you plants

1925
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,238
that you choose to do or like if you're

1926
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:55,719
going to do it, is there a better time

1927
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:58,399
to try and cultivate those or add those

1928
01:10:55,719 --> 01:11:00,000
or I think of it more like a mentality

1929
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:01,920
or sort of a paradigm in terms of how

1930
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,679
we're always treating the soil. When I'm

1931
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,279
looking at soil and treating soil, what

1932
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,800
I'm thinking about is that microbial

1933
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:08,399
interaction and that activity. So,

1934
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,760
that's what I'm always cultivating. I'm

1935
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:13,519
less concerned with um what's going on

1936
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,280
above ground as I am below ground. And I

1937
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,120
just think it's just a it's kind of just

1938
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:19,439
a a mental switch though is really what

1939
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:21,760
I'm what I'm suggesting for people

1940
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:23,359
regarding regarding these plants and

1941
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,199
gardening. So it's something you're

1942
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:27,559
always trying to do with you know micro

1943
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:30,559
fungus with quality inputs with

1944
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:32,719
composting compost piece plants all that

1945
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,960
stuff.

1946
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:36,880
You touched on bacteria and fungi but

1947
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,480
you didn't really touch on protozoa a

1948
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,719
lot. Um can you talk about like their

1949
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:44,879
nitrogen fixing abilities and and how

1950
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:47,840
that works? Yeah. So the main function

1951
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:50,640
um as I understand it is that these the

1952
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:54,000
prozzoa you know flagagulates amoeba

1953
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:56,480
they're it's very very good at consuming

1954
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,600
consuming bacteria. So then what they

1955
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:03,839
excrete or when they die is that plant

1956
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,320
available nitrogen or nutrient.

1957
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,000
That's the

1958
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:10,799
main and so like if you were to brew a

1959
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,439
tea earlier in the production of the

1960
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,600
plant like in veg would that prozzoa

1961
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:17,119
dominant tea be beneficial for

1962
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,960
increasing nitrogen for the plant

1963
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:21,760
naturally or would that be detrimental

1964
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,359
to like kind of increasing the burn or

1965
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,039
anything like that to your plant? I've

1966
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:26,799
never seen a properly made compost tea

1967
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:28,079
burn a plant. You really you really

1968
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,320
can't over apply it if it's made

1969
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:32,319
correctly. But over time, so when you

1970
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:33,559
first start brewing compost tea, you

1971
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:36,639
know, let's say

1972
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:39,360
70°, good good brewer, good oxygen,

1973
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,960
you're looking at around 24 to 36 hours

1974
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:43,920
is sort of that optimal window where you

1975
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:46,079
have all the diversity and that that

1976
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,480
thing can maintain. As you start moving

1977
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:51,760
further out towards 48 hours, you'll

1978
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:54,000
start to see um one species of protozoa,

1979
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,840
one one type of flagagulate uh with its

1980
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,119
specific morphology and you'll see one

1981
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,520
bacteria and it'll just kind of take

1982
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:01,760
turns going back and forth in terms of

1983
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,520
um all those yeah all those flags eat

1984
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,199
all bacteria and then it'll die off

1985
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,440
because there's no more food source. So

1986
01:13:05,198 --> 01:13:09,919
I always aim for that 24 to 36 hour

1987
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:11,279
window uh for the most part um depending

1988
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,359
on what I'm brewing. I don't try to make

1989
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:14,960
a bacterial tea or a fungal tea. I just

1990
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:17,359
try to make a I guess a nutrient

1991
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:20,560
universal tea and that's fine throughout

1992
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:22,399
the whole period of cuz I find like I'm

1993
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,080
trying to make these dominant teas where

1994
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:26,319
I'm using different ingredients of like

1995
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:29,079
either kelp or molasses normal acid

1996
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:31,279
sometimes to get more bacteria or

1997
01:13:29,079 --> 01:13:32,640
whatever is it worth it to try to put

1998
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:34,319
all the effort in or just make one tea

1999
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,079
the whole time. I would make my tea the

2000
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:37,840
same for compost te's when I'm talking

2001
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:39,920
about beneficial microorganisms and then

2002
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:42,079
you could cater your nutrient tees or

2003
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,719
plant te's more specifically towards

2004
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:46,079
that that stage in yeah Johnny why don't

2005
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:49,760
you be the last question then we'll move

2006
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:52,079
on oh um I was curious if you know

2007
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:55,039
anything about

2008
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:59,039
uh well you mean in terms of these sorts

2009
01:13:55,039 --> 01:14:02,719
of microorganisms or like with humans or

2010
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:05,198
there's a way to grow this propion and

2011
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:07,039
I'm curious. Oh, well there. So, there's

2012
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:08,879
a forum on Facebook, the Shango I'm part

2013
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:10,800
of that's a probiotic farmers

2014
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,159
association. They're they're primarily

2015
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,199
focused on a lot of anorobic

2016
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:17,119
microorganisms um in Bukashi and EM,

2017
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:21,119
which I'm not as familiar with. They're

2018
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:23,119
they're anorobic microorganisms. Um but

2019
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:24,880
I I would say I don't really know if

2020
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:26,880
that term has been defined yet for for

2021
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,480
gardening or farming, but a lot of these

2022
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,560
things I would say are friendly towards

2023
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:33,119
that. Yeah. And for those for those of

2024
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:35,440
us who do who are not ultra nerds on it

2025
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:38,319
like people like me we you know I booked

2026
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:40,639
him as a probiotic growing speaker. So

2027
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:43,039
for most of us we would call this entire

2028
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:46,079
presentation probiotic. Okay. Because

2029
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:48,399
the idea is about creating the plant to

2030
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:50,479
be as healthy as possible so you don't

2031
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:53,279
have to add all these non-natural

2032
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:55,759
inputs. Right? So it's probiotic. You're

2033
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:57,759
making the plant healthier by by feeding

2034
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,640
the soil and the soil takes care of the

2035
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:02,039
plant. Right? So pretty much the whole

2036
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:05,280
presentation loosely would be

2037
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:08,359
considered. Yeah. So cool. So there you

2038
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:08,359
have it.
