2
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:09,179
once you have decided to move beyond

3
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:11,039
simply supplementing your cannabis

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,990
substrate with bottled synthetics and

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,388
you find your way to living soils things

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,460
can get pretty messy compost wild

7
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:20,789
crafted nutrient teas and fermentations

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,650
all have smells that are very potent

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,789
shall we say I wouldn't say that many of

10
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:29,038
them stink but they do smell intense

11
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:32,489
exceptionally strange and very wildly

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,920
alive working with organic and living

13
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:37,919
inputs as a strong reminder that life

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,559
baguettes life it is in that spirit that

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,320
I offer today's episode entitled dead

41
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,658
to have him to here today to talk about

42
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:39,599
animal inputs from bones and blood to

43
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,579
poop and flesh one last note this week's

44
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,828
episode simply does not sound as good as

45
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:45,449
our episodes usually do when setting up

46
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:46,978
for the interview I missed that my side

47
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,560
of the conversation was being recorded

48
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,899
by my laptop microphone and not my fancy

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,390
studio microphone so there's a lot more

50
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,040
echo than usual I mean it's tolerable

51
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,899
it's very tolerable but if this is your

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,368
first time listening to shaping fire I

53
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,759
don't want you to think that this is how

54
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:04,290
it normally sounds luckily tad does most

55
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,060
of the talking during the episode and

56
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,859
his microphone sounds just fine so

57
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,709
thanks for listening and enjoy the show

58
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,150
hey will whoo the show tad oh man I'm

59
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,650
excited to be here thanks for having me

60
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,209
on yeah I'm really glad that you could

61
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,530
peel off some time for us so let's get

62
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,080
right into it you know we're gonna be

63
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,729
talking about a lot of animal inputs

64
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,790
that can be used when growing cannabis

65
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:25,109
or anything today but you know you have

66
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:26,609
taught me that one of the important

67
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,099
things is to always start with a soil

68
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,170
test so even though this is not a soil

69
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,818
test show would you just give a quick

70
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:34,439
summary of why people should have their

71
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:37,018
soil looked at so they understand

72
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,370
whether starting with yeah I appreciate

73
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,450
you giving me a minute to talk about

74
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,579
this because I think it's really

75
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:43,078
important one thing I want to make clear

76
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:44,819
is that there's different types of soil

77
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,890
tests and they all give slightly

78
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:48,869
different results there's may like three

79
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:51,089
tests bree olson a bunch of different

80
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,378
types of tests and so whatever tests you

81
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,209
go with you need to keep testing with

82
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:55,679
the same lab in order to get consistent

83
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,989
results but this is really the

84
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,640
foundation that allows you to use a lot

85
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,739
of these different nutrients

86
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,389
appropriately because if you know what's

87
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,700
in your soil then you can amend that

88
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:08,518
soil to make up for any deficiencies or

89
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:10,979
excesses so I think soil soil testing is

90
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,469
really important and I the one that we

91
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:15,268
like the best is Logan lab standard soil

92
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:17,280
test it's like twenty five dollars so

93
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,539
it's not it's not terribly expensive and

94
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,729
I'll tell you everything that's in the

95
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,620
soil including your trace minerals right

96
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,108
on cool and so based on the results from

97
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,539
that you'll know what you need to do to

98
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:28,680
bring your soil in to the the range you

99
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:30,900
want it to be in for whatever you happen

100
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,260
to be growing yeah they'll help you with

101
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,650
interpretation and if if they can't do

102
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:35,818
that

103
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,709
you know I'm available or there's other

104
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:39,328
people in the industry that can you know

105
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,819
help you understand those tests and then

106
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,989
you can use that information to utilize

107
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:45,119
some of the other things that we're

108
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,139
going to talk about today right on cool

109
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,280
and the other thing while I've got you

110
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,079
here I want to ask you is one of the

111
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,810
questions I get asked a lot people ask

112
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,209
me what the three numbers the NPK

113
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,489
percentages on the front of nutrients

114
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,169
mean why don't you want you to go ahead

115
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,889
and feel that question for folks who may

116
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:03,030
be listening show new to fertilizers

117
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:06,419
sure well I think you kind of set it

118
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,759
there so yes those are your nitrogen

119
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,219
phosphorus and potassium percentages and

120
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:12,929
those are required there's you know

121
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,969
state law here in Washington Oregon or

122
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,739
whatever state you're in and those

123
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:18,538
numbers will tell you what percentage of

124
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,939
that nutrient is going to be guaranteed

125
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:22,228
in that product now you have to be a

126
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:24,180
little bit careful in the cannabis

127
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:26,098
industry because if they put five five

128
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,769
five on the label that means there's at

129
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,509
least five

130
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:30,430
sent you know nitrogen phosphorus and

131
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:31,960
potassium but there could be more so

132
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,478
with the things that we're gonna talk

133
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,489
about today things like these different

134
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,639
animal manures and meals they tend to be

135
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,900
they tend to be not over inflated but in

136
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,340
the cannabis industry you have to be

137
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:44,769
careful because someone may say you know

138
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:47,228
my proprietary nitrogen source is better

139
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:48,758
than another one that's also five five

140
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:50,258
five well it could be because they're

141
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,970
putting in excess those numbers just

142
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,680
give you the minimums that's required

143
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,810
and that's what that state tests for

144
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,879
yeah right okay that's a good point so I

145
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,009
want to thank you too for being willing

146
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,830
to come on a show called dead bodies and

147
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:04,360
poop you know I think that I've been

148
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:05,800
thinking about these kind of nutrients

149
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,710
for a long time I've been thinking about

150
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,840
it as you know the animals give give

151
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,549
everything so that we can grow our

152
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,288
cannabis in these examples and you know

153
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,629
some of the things like especially the

154
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:17,860
feces and stuff the animal gives off but

155
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:19,418
some of these things like our first

156
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,759
example insect frass

157
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:24,158
it's everything so insect praxis is

158
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,259
something that was new to me just this

159
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:29,439
summer and I used it for the first time

160
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,520
and I saw incredible results so so why

161
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,490
don't you start there why you tell us

162
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,258
about insect frass yeah you know it's

163
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,840
something that's relatively new to the

164
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:40,389
industry too and something that I didn't

165
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:43,028
know a lot about five years ago but yeah

166
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:45,579
essentially the frass is the waste or

167
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:47,918
excess of what's left over in the

168
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:50,439
process for example the source that we

169
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,598
have is up in Canada and they're growing

170
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:54,310
out black soldier flies and black

171
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:56,348
soldier flies they don't have mouths the

172
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,418
larvae will eat just about anything and

173
00:05:56,348 --> 00:06:00,009
then what is left over in that process

174
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:03,068
they're calling the frass after

175
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:04,990
everything that the insect has eaten so

176
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:07,330
think of it like insect compost more or

177
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,978
less but the great thing about it is

178
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:11,528
you're getting that NPK you're getting

179
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:13,689
calcium magnesium it's a slower release

180
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:16,240
source of these nutrients and it's

181
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:18,339
really high in chitin and people talk

182
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,430
about chitin as something that's really

183
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:22,329
important because it's related to

184
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,490
there's some research that shows it

185
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:27,339
supports systemic acquired resistance or

186
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,930
SAR which is shown to help reduce or

187
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:31,359
suppress certain pests or fungal

188
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:34,899
pathogens it's a it's a specific enzyme

189
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,610
that is created by these bacteria fungi

190
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:38,980
and other microorganisms that are

191
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,319
specific for breaking down the chitin

192
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:45,009
that you would see in you know an insect

193
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:47,199
frass in crab or crustacean meal things

194
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:49,599
with shells right on right on so is what

195
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,180
is you know the idea of the insect frass

196
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,960
I pictured it as just being a bunch of

197
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,269
dried up soldier fly carcasses that are

198
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:01,479
then put through a grinder and comes out

199
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:03,579
as a powder is that is that a good

200
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,370
picture of that and do they choose

201
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:08,919
soldier flies because they particularly

202
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:11,740
have got these healthy nutrients in

203
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,770
their bodies or or is insect frass made

204
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,199
out of any insect technically it's any

205
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:20,139
insect I've only worked with the black

206
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,300
soldier fly frass but the frost is

207
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,459
really think of it like with earthworm

208
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,280
castings it's the left over casting or

209
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:29,799
the or the the poop more or less that or

210
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,319
the compost that's not been consumed by

211
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,759
the insect itself so you will get some

212
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,209
dead bodies and things like that in

213
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,699
there but in general what they do is the

214
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:43,239
larvae is harvested and that is then

215
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:46,229
sold as grubs or as a fertilizer to the

216
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,759
industry separate from the frass itself

217
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,530
interesting so so I guess I guess my

218
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:54,579
expectation is actually not accurate

219
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:58,209
it's not like adult soldier fly body

220
00:07:54,579 --> 00:08:01,089
parts it's it's there it's it's there

221
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:05,019
poo and then also anything that's left

222
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:08,049
over from the larval process so I don't

223
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:10,569
know extra extra shells and mucus --is

224
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,410
and random stuff like whatever's left in

225
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:16,540
the bin then man what a weird product

226
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,939
you know it is but the the crazy thing

227
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:22,900
about it for example the the source that

228
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:25,089
that we use my buddy up at Whistler

229
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:26,829
medical marijuana facility he sent it

230
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:29,529
off to his friend in Quebec who runs a

231
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:31,779
laboratory and they tested it and found

232
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:34,179
that and I haven't had a chance to play

233
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:35,439
with it myself yet but they test it

234
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,539
instead it came back with a higher

235
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,940
microbial charge even than worm castings

236
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,189
so there's a lot of good beneficial

237
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,450
microorganisms in it and that's that's

238
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,920
one of the other things that you have to

239
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,140
consider when using a product like this

240
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:49,299
is not only are you getting you know the

241
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:52,028
the NPK and the micro and macro

242
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:53,429
nutrients but you're also getting this

243
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:55,450
you know diversity of microorganisms

244
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:56,829
right on that makes that sense I can

245
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,570
tell you one thing I mean that adding

246
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,509
the insect frass was the only major

247
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:04,120
difference in my last crop and the depth

248
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:06,189
of green in my plants was unlike

249
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:10,120
anything that I had acquired up to that

250
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:11,529
point and I actually you know give it a

251
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,179
lot of that up to the insect but

252
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:16,419
actually I bought your insect frass I

253
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:18,309
bought it from you at the kis store so

254
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:20,259
yeah so anyway so that's pretty good so

255
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:22,299
one thing I want to point out to people

256
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:25,990
when working with insect frass is that

257
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:28,719
it's really powdery it gets taken up

258
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,450
into the air quickly like perlite does

259
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,649
and so you either want to handle the

260
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,850
stuff really gently or wear a mask

261
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:40,110
because you can get that stuff and

262
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,250
inhale it easily and that's that's gross

263
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,300
you know that's a really good point a

264
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,330
lot of the stuff we're gonna talk about

265
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:47,979
today probably should be used with a

266
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,540
mask in general just to avoid

267
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,980
particulate in your lungs at the very

268
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:53,139
least even if it's not something

269
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,909
terribly gross that's a really good

270
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:57,129
point yeah that's a good idea so all

271
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:58,389
right cool so let's move on from insect

272
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:01,539
frass to another one of my favorites

273
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:04,149
worm castings and so you know hits worm

274
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:06,338
castings is such an elegant way to say

275
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:07,509
poop right because it casts off what it

276
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,990
doesn't need anymore

277
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:13,000
so so tell us a bit about worm castings

278
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,829
you know worm castings are their the

279
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,278
greatest that for an organic gardener

280
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:20,649
they're probably my number one my number

281
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:22,389
one tool and the thing about worm

282
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,240
castings to consider is they're not all

283
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:26,769
created equal so like you mentioned worm

284
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,240
castings are essentially worm poop

285
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,240
they're usually coming out of commercial

286
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,269
facilities or people will have their own

287
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,310
vermicompost in bins and the more the

288
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:38,289
worms protet process that material

289
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:39,399
that's put into the bin the better but

290
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:42,610
there's going to be a difference between

291
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:45,339
worm castings made from say finished

292
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:49,089
compost versus ones made from food

293
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:51,010
scraps for example so knowing what went

294
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:52,720
into the worm castings I think will help

295
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:54,039
a lot in determining the quality of them

296
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,800
as well as how long the worms have

297
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:58,778
worked out material and I know for us

298
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,179
like we took some of that holy mountain

299
00:10:58,778 --> 00:11:04,000
fish compost in these giant four hundred

300
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:04,899
gallon smart pots and then we put worms

301
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,568
in there and then

302
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:10,389
added some basalt and some calcium

303
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:11,860
sources and some M cake and a few other

304
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:13,299
ingredients in there and then let the

305
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,889
worms work it for over a year

306
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:17,588
and by the time it was done we had a

307
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:20,110
really great worm casting product we

308
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:22,809
were able to use right on that's good so

309
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,869
do they normally say on the bags the

310
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:27,639
source of what the worms were eating so

311
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:30,069
that you can judge the quality or do

312
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:31,990
like you know lower quality ones not

313
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:34,748
mention anything with the really good

314
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,399
stuff says yeah you know or all organic

315
00:11:34,749 --> 00:11:39,939
finished compost fed or something like

316
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,379
that they don't it's not a very good

317
00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:44,198
industry in that regard it's not

318
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:45,879
standardized what you what you can do on

319
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:47,528
your own to do your own due diligence is

320
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:49,178
you can call the company and find out

321
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:51,009
what they're feeding their worms what

322
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:53,139
their bedding their worms in and then

323
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:54,550
when you look at the worm castings and

324
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:56,379
this is gonna vary based on the type of

325
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:58,719
worms like African where notes for

326
00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:00,938
example have really big poop and so it's

327
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,600
really easy to see versus things like

328
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:05,649
red wigglers have much smaller poop but

329
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,019
what you're looking for when you're

330
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:10,328
evaluating worm castings visually is it

331
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,889
should be a bunch of tiny little dots if

332
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:14,588
it looks like regular compost there's a

333
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:15,789
bunch of other you know woody materials

334
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:17,499
and things in there then that compost

335
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:20,528
just really isn't

336
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:21,790
mostly castings at that point whereas it

337
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:24,100
should just look like a bunch of little

338
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:25,870
tiny brown or black dots well that

339
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,278
actually that's what's a good was going

340
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,688
to ask you next is that when you're when

341
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,249
you're looking at it sometimes when I

342
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:32,620
buy it it looks like a bunch of little

343
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:35,019
pellets and sometimes it looks like a

344
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:42,220
really dark compost and I was going to

345
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:44,860
ask you how you get the castings out of

346
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,240
the compost to sell it but but what I'm

347
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:50,169
realizing is what you're telling me is

348
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,909
that they're Jade they don't remove the

349
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,919
castings from the compost the question

350
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:57,990
is how long have they had the worms work

351
00:12:53,919 --> 00:13:00,849
that compost so that the percentage of

352
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:04,149
castings in the compost number is really

353
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:06,790
high yeah they'll put it through a

354
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:08,860
variety of filters or sips essentially

355
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:10,568
that will remove the larger particulate

356
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,789
but you got to keep in mind a lot of the

357
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:15,099
worm castings are being sold the worms

358
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:17,048
aren't being used specifically for

359
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,360
meaning-making castings but rather for

360
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:19,129
making

361
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,659
or worms that they can then sell the

362
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:22,750
worms to you know

363
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:25,028
gardeners or sell them to you know

364
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:28,039
fishermen and things like that so

365
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:29,539
knowing what the facility is really set

366
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:32,719
up for it can help determine sometimes

367
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:34,519
the quality of the of the worm castings

368
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,170
but everyone should have their own worm

369
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,360
bin they're super easy they're very

370
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:40,969
affordable you can even just use horse

371
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,579
manure as an initial bedding which is

372
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,709
really easy to find locally so growing

373
00:13:43,578 --> 00:13:47,599
your own worms is a great option for

374
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:49,369
most growers yeah totally that's a great

375
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,509
idea and especially if you're if you're

376
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:56,000
new to probe a growing it is an easy

377
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:57,319
entry way into starting to play around

378
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,700
the stuff that won't cost you a lot of

379
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,190
money and actually gives you something

380
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,500
that's really valuable for for both your

381
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,880
cannabis and your food garden so right

382
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,078
I'm cool so we're gonna take our first

383
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,610
short break and be right back you're

384
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,469
listening to shaping fire and my guest

385
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,470
today is tad Hussey of keep it simple

386
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,209
organics if you grow cannabis with

387
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,129
sunshine you can often feel limited by

388
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:18,078
the seasonal cycle you want to grow

389
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:20,179
sustainably and save money so you use as

390
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,919
little electricity as possible but if

391
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:23,299
you haven't studied or implemented light

392
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:24,828
deprivation techniques into your

393
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:27,109
greenhouse you're leaving a lot of money

394
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:28,489
on the table by incorporating light

395
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,230
deprivation solutions into your

396
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,879
greenhouse you can often add two or

397
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,070
three additional growing cycles to your

398
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:35,480
year when you pencil out the financial

399
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,579
benefit of those additional cycles

400
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,740
you'll realize why commercial scale

401
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:42,349
light deprivation technology is remaking

402
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,970
the cannabis industry what used to be

403
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,769
done by pulling tarps over hoop houses

404
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,000
has been scaled up over the last few

405
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:49,578
years in such a way that has become

406
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,899
mechanized easy and affordable to even

407
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:54,169
small-scale commercial cannabis

408
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:55,909

flowering I talked with Eric about the

422
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:22,338
importance of intelligent greenhouse

423
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,379
management as well as the huge financial

424
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:27,110
benefit of incorporating light depth

425
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:28,850
techniques there are so many aspects of

426
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,279
utilizing a greenhouse that can go wrong

427
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,560
from temperature and airflow to light

428
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,059

forward slash FFG to find out more while

445
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,660
I certainly still enjoy smoking joints I

446
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,670
moved over to using vaporizers about

447
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:15,230
three years ago the high was a little

448
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:17,120
different than burning the flower and in

449
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,159
the end I decided I preferred it for

450
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,620
daily use especially because I have

451
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,409
asthma more importantly though I could

452
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,029
taste my flower so much more it's hard

453
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:28,009
to express to you how significantly

454
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:30,649
different cannabis with a good terpene

455
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:32,960
profile tastes when vaped instead of

456
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:34,610
burned I have brought my vape with me to

457
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,440
visit growers and they are astonished by

458
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,639
the clarity of taste and they say they

459
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,370
feel like they're tasting their flower

460
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:43,069
for the very first time the air vape

461
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:45,529
vaporizer from air vape usa.com is a

462
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,870
great device to use on the go or at home

463
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:48,889
when you pick it up and feel satisfying

464
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,990
like a medical device

465
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:53,120
it isn't flimsy like many vape Tsar I

466
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,339
like how the flower is inserted in the

467
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,259
top instead of the bottom so travels are

468
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:58,850
shorter path to my mouth with the

469
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:00,649
cannabis at the top I get a hit that

470
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,600
feels more substantial even though I'm

471
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:05,209
just inhaling vapor and not full bodied

472
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,578
smoke since I used this vape for flower

473
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,078
hash and concentrates I really liked it

474
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:11,240
the digital control for the temperature

475
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:12,649
is right there on the front three clicks

476
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,599
of the button and it fires up to the

477
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,209
temperature I specify really quickly and

478
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,639
discreetly you know vape concentrates

479
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,140
are a milder experience than dabbing but

480
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,329
you still get the potency in your hit

481
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,120
also the taste is great as would be

482
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:28,068
expected with a low temp tab I love that

483
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,059
this vape gives quick little vibrations

484
00:17:28,068 --> 00:17:31,670
when it gets to the right temperature

485
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:33,139
that way if I'm chatting or distracted

486
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,600
while it's heating up it lets me know

487
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,180
when it's ready if you are ready for a

488

00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:53,210
shaping fire on your host Shango louis

496
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,400
and our guest this week is tad hussy of

497
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,289
keep it simple organics so during the

498
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,809
first set we talked about soil tests and

499
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:03,019
NPK percentages insect frass and worm

500
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:06,109
castings and here during set two we're

501
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:08,119
gonna move more towards the seaside so

502
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:10,939
so the first thing i want to talk about

503
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:12,859
is crab an oyster shell and so there

504
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,390
there are there are subsections of both

505
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:17,689
but can you kind of explain just

506
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:22,340
generally tad why we like shells to

507
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:24,048
begin with well they're very different

508
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:26,569
products so when we're talking about

509
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:28,009
like crab or crustacean meal we're

510
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:30,079
talking about something that's going to

511
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:32,419
be high in calcium but also gonna give

512
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,490
you some slow release nitrogen and again

513
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:36,110
that chitin the same thing we found in

514
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,750
the insect frass which we already kind

515
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:41,629
of covered but it's about four percent

516
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:44,419
nitrogen one percent phosphorus on in in

517
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,160
general and it's a really good way to

518
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:49,009
get that slow release nitrogen and also

519
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,330
encourage that chitin a specific

520
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:55,000
bacteria and fungi right on so so so is

521
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:57,259
there a real difference between the

522
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,009
crushed shale cuz like you know I've

523
00:18:57,259 --> 00:19:02,720
seen it in bags and it's just shale bits

524
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:04,400
versus I've also seen people sell flour

525
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,350
and I'm assuming we're not baking bread

526
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,530
with it so so why does it come in these

527
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:11,599
two different forms yeah and this is a

528
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:13,339
good thing to be aware of across all of

529
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:14,389
these different products and meals and

530
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:16,639
just in general when you're adding

531
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:19,220
things into your soil is really the

532
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,330
difference between like and we haven't

533
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,669
talked about oyster shell yeah but

534
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:25,069
oyster shell flour versus actual oyster

535
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:27,169
shells it's really the surface area so

536
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:30,019
that waster shell flour is going to be

537
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:32,600
broken down much faster and be more

538
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:34,160
available to the plants sooner than the

539
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:36,409
actual oyster shell so if you for

540
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,750
example and oyster shells are calcium

541
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,279
that's something I meant to mention so

542
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,500
if you're if you want something to be

543
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:45,859
available over a period of a series of

544
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,599
months then even want to use the oyster

545
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:49,519
shells whereas the oyster shell flour

546
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,959
will still take some time to become

547
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,160
available but it will be much faster

548
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,130
because there's a greater surface area

549
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,930
for these bacteria and microorganisms to

550
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,490
start breaking it down Wow

551
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,769
that's a really great idea so that so

552
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,289
getting the crushed shell pieces is more

553
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:05,059
of a time-release kind of nutrient

554
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:07,220
whereas the flour is going to be

555
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:08,990
instantly and fully available that's

556
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,930
really cool so when choosing between

557
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,910
crab and oyster shell what do you teach

558
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:16,340
people you know how to come to their

559
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,810
decision on which to go with well I just

560
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:20,389
want to touch on one thing just to be

561
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:21,859
really clear the calcium in general

562
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:24,350
takes a while to become available when

563
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:26,240
added in these forms so when I say more

564
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:30,019
available we're still talking weeks to

565
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,630
months in general with calcium but that

566
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:35,299
being said if you're looking for a slow

567
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,160
release nitrogen source then that crab

568
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:40,430
crustacean meal is really great if

569
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:43,330
you're looking for just calcium then you

570
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:46,250
could use something like oyster shell

571
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:48,769
well alright but you you would get the

572
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,930
calcium with the with the crustacean

573
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:53,000
shell - right so why wouldn't everybody

574
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,680
just go with crustacean shell there's is

575
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,150
there something special that's unique

576
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,870
about oysters shell that you can't get

577
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:01,640
from the crab shell no not really you

578
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:02,839
know you could the thing with the crab

579
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,340
shell though is you are getting four

580
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:05,959
percent nitrogen so you would end up

581
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:09,319
with more nitrogen relative to the

582
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,799
amount of calcium you needed ice and one

583
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:14,809
thing to mention is the oyster shell is

584
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,450
primarily just calcium carbonate and

585
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:22,129
it's a lot easier to get that calcium

586
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:24,049
directly from agricultural lime they're

587
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,510
both mined products but you can go down

588
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:30,440
and buy a bag of agricultural lime at

589
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:31,879
your local feed store or your you know

590
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,769
any kind of garden center and it might

591
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,360
be you know eight to ten dollars for a

592
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:37,789
50-pound bag so really affordable

593
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,619
whereas that waster shelf flour may cost

594
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:41,299
you you know fifteen to twenty five

595
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:42,979
dollars a bag so there are more

596
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:45,409
affordable sources for gardeners and

597
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,420
farmers on the calcium side than

598
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,220
necessarily using oyster shell flour

599
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,289
right on and this will probably come up

600
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,870
a couple times today but is there such

601
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:56,119
thing as you know sustainably harvested

602
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:58,099
crab and oyster shell products versus

603
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:00,500
unsustainably farmed is this something

604
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:04,009
that we need to be aware of when buying

605
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,839
it or are there just so much leftovers

606
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:08,119
of that from the other industries that

607
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,740
it's it's it's just stuff that would

608
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,909
otherwise get thrown away

609
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,798
you know it's a really good question I

610
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,929
haven't looked into the crab crustacean

611
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:18,750
meal processing enough I do know it is

612
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:21,540
leftover byproduct of that you know the

613
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,819
fishing and seafood industry in terms of

614
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:25,589
the oyster shell flour I know it's a

615
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:27,990
mined product just like agricultural

616
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:30,750
lime they're mining these old ocean beds

617
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:32,880
that are now on land so they're not any

618
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,650
more sustainable than the agricultural

619
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,210
lime so to me there's not a huge

620
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,400
advantage to using oyster shell flour

621
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,259
over other lime sources they're all

622
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,660
their own mind products yeah right on

623
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:45,419
right on so when doing research for this

624
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,590
show I came across a variety that I've

625
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:50,130
never actually heard before

626
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:51,389
um fossil shell flour and you know I'm

627
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,280
actually excited to find out what this

628
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,259
is because I imagine that you know you

629
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:58,139
deep in the earth and you've got you got

630
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:00,599
some some animal that like died near the

631
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,309
near the beach and then years of

632
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,019
compression and now you've got a fossil

633
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:06,359
and somehow they dig this out what's the

634
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:08,339
story with this you know you've probably

635
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:10,789
already seen it on shelves and heard of

636
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:14,279
it under the name diatomaceous earth oh

637
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:17,879
yeah yeah yeah they're essentially the

638
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:21,058
same thing it's just a legal term but

639
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,940
really the diatomaceous earth the cool

640
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:27,599
thing about it is it is you know 33%

641
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,789
silica and 19% calcium it's got some of

642
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:33,569
these trace minerals in it so it has

643
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:35,250
some beneficial nutrients and things for

644
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:37,619
your plant one thing to keep in mind

645
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:41,519
though is even though it's you know so

646
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:43,289
high in silica only about a quarter of a

647
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,839
percent is actually in a plant available

648
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:47,730
form so you're not really getting that

649
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,730
high dose of silica that you could from

650
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:54,900
other sources but it also works as a

651
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:57,450
natural desiccant as I understand it so

652
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,610
when you put it on an insect or use it

653
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:01,950
to top dress your soil and the insects

654
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:04,678
walk through it it creates little micro

655
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:07,410
cuts because of these tiny diatoms and

656
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,480
that will eventually cause them to

657
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,070
dehydrate I've heard a couple different

658
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,779
stories in terms of the process but how

659
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:16,019
of how it works but that's the one that

660
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:17,579
most people tell me but it is an

661
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:20,039
effective pesticide in that regard but

662
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:21,359
once you water it so for example when

663
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,680
you talk to us with it's no longer as

664
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,779
effective but

665
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,789
yeah it has a couple different uses yeah

666
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:28,289
I know people who use it for that for

667
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:32,879
that cutting ability when they're

668
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:34,980
fighting soil gnats because I guess you

669
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,600
know moving around that stuff cuts off

670
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,610
their body would that have the same

671
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:41,069
thing to do for us which should we be

672
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:44,609
using gloves when handling diatomaceous

673
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:48,200
earth I'm not so concerned about your

674
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:51,659
skin but in general you want to wear a

675
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:55,910
respirator especially and then I made

676
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:59,279
the mistake of one time using it for

677
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:02,070
four not for mites and that's and not

678
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,649
wearing eye protection so actually when

679
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:06,929
I was done my eyes were super bloodshot

680
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,940
and it was kind of like this Oh moment

681
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:11,340
after I was finished but at the time it

682
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,509
didn't even occur to me so yeah you got

683
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:14,159
to protect yourself when using these

684
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:15,900
things man that sounds really

685
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,820
uncomfortable you know that blows back

686
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,400
in your face now it's in your eyes and

687
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:23,309
it's all these micro cuts on your that

688
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,610
doesn't sound good at all so so what

689
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:29,039
would somebody use diatomaceous earth

690
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:31,709
for what is it what's its target usage

691
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,559
other than other than you know a

692
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:38,340
protectant on the top is it is it also a

693
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,619
heavy nitrogen fixer you know I'm not

694
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:43,319
seeing a lot of people using it for it

695
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:45,779
as a particular fertilizer so much as

696
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:47,519
you'll see it in the pet industry for

697
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:49,980
dealing with you know organic flea

698
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,019
solution or powder you'll also see it

699
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,240
for dealing with mites and gnats and

700
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:56,069
things like that but it does add some of

701
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,990
these things especially that silica that

702
00:25:56,069 --> 00:25:59,909
will slowly break down over time and the

703
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,710
calcium so you know people are starting

704
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:05,040
to use it more and more in their soils

705
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:07,500
right on so one last thing on this so if

706
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,259
it's fossil shell how actually is is it

707
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:13,890
is it made is it is it really compressed

708
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:16,430
shells along the seashore that they they

709
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:19,920
go in a mine because it's got you know

710
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:22,019
10,000 years of compounded shells and is

711
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,570
that really what it is or is the the

712
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:26,849
name a misnomer no you're right it's

713
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:30,059
these diatoms or tiny shells that were

714
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:32,189
left on these ocean beds from you know

715
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,849
I'm guessing thousands maybe hundreds of

716
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,910
thousands of years old now that are now

717
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:38,250
the

718
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:40,290
now on land in mind so there these are

719
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,569
mines products still that we're talking

720
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:45,029
about unfortunately right so let's move

721
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:47,240
on to actual fish so there's a lot of

722
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:50,069
different ways that I've seen people

723
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,559
work with fish I've seen you know fish

724
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:55,470
emulsion Xand meal and fish bone and

725
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:58,829
fish compost and I even saw his old guy

726
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:01,910
here on Vashon Island who just took the

727
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:04,829
fish guts from his salmon fishing and

728
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:06,690
just chucked him in the hole that he was

729
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:08,699
about to plant his cannabis plant in and

730
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,980
just threw him in there raw and I'm like

731
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,809
man I'm not sure if you should age that

732
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,099
first or do something but he said that's

733
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:16,679
how he's been doing it for twenty years

734
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:18,569
and he grows great flowers so I'm not

735
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,799
going to complain but it was it was

736
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:22,439
weird to see like this the whole

737
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:24,750
carcasses put in there so so let's start

738
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,900
with that you know can you just to

739
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:29,910
simply throw fished railings into the

740
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,100
hole where you're gonna plant or in

741
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:34,980
almost all cases do you want to process

742
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:37,980
that fish somehow so it's not just

743
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:40,559
rotting underground you know that's an

744
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,150
old school gardening move actually it's

745
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,639
been around for a long time in fact I

746
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:47,130
think it dates back to a Native American

747
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,860
culture originally so yeah a lot of

748
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:52,770
people will do that I've never

749
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:55,169
personally done that but I do use a lot

750
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:56,819
of fish products both in our soils and

751
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,230
in my own gardening for a variety of

752
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:59,939
reasons yeah right on

753
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:02,970
so what's a fish emulsion I hear that

754
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,170
term are thrown around a lot yeah in

755
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,269
general when you see fish fertilizer

756
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,980
that's a liquid it comes in two forms

757
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:10,680
it's either gonna be fish emulsion or

758
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,000
fish hydrolysate and the emulsion the

759
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,890
big difference is the emulsion uses a

760
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,839
heat process so that material is heated

761
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:18,870
up which can destroy some of the

762
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:21,089
enzymatic qualities of the final product

763
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:22,469
in general fish emulsion tends to be a

764
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:25,169
little bit stinkier than fish

765
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:28,019
hydrolysate as well but it is gonna have

766
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,789
a higher nitrogen content now fish

767
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:32,220
hydrolysate on the other end uses

768
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:35,190
Coldwater processing and typically

769
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,839
specific enzymes that break down all the

770
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:39,420
you know leftover fish bits and

771
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:41,339
carcasses and then for some silly reason

772
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,650
with bureaucracy you're allowed to

773
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:45,750
stabilize it with phosphoric acid and

774
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:47,750
still have it be considered organic so

775
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:49,930
you do have a higher phosphorous content

776
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,759
than you would in the fish and

777
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,410
so the quick way to tell really quickly

778
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:54,759
just staring at two fish products as if

779
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:57,250
it has a higher phosphorous than

780
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:59,170
nitrogen it's probably hydrolysate if it

781
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:02,890
has a high nitrogen and no phosphorous

782
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:04,900
it's probably emulsion and both come and

783
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,970
deodorized or less stinky version so

784
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,500
using these fish products they're still

785
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:12,039
gonna smell like fish a little bit but

786
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,180
they're not going to be terrible and one

787
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:15,220
thing that's really important to mention

788
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:17,049
is that fish hydrolysate is actually a

789
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,690
really really good

790
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:22,839
microbial food specifically for fungus

791
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,549
so it will grow great fungal hyphae and

792
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:27,099
compost teas and also help promote them

793
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:29,230
in your soil right on so so moving along

794
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:31,529
to fish meal then is that is that just

795
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:34,480
simply fish ground up

796
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:36,700
yeah as far as I understand it's it's

797
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,140
literally ground fish you know leftover

798
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,529
ones that they couldn't they couldn't

799
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:43,030
use for you know up processing so it

800
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:45,309
kind of sounds like the old school

801
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:49,619
version of just chucking the fish in the

802
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:52,859
ground but but in a shelf stable package

803
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:55,359
yeah they do have to stabilize it they

804
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:57,069
it's literally like a brown powder it's

805
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,919
not terribly stinky none of the powders

806
00:29:57,069 --> 00:30:02,169
are nearly as smelly as the liquids in

807
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:05,259
general but the great thing about fish

808
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:08,140
meal is it's ten four zero and it's a

809
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:10,180
fast release nitrogen source relatively

810
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,520
speaking compared to other nitrogen

811
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,049
sources out there so really what we're

812
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,629
talking about by comparing these

813
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:19,619
different fish products it's not really

814
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:22,510
the same product in four different

815
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:25,929
packages we're really talking about you

816
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:28,869
know the the emulsions versus the how do

817
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:31,840
you say high hydro state I say

818
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:34,089
hydrolysis Hydra also hurt hydro lysate

819
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,399
you know I'm not sure what they write on

820
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:39,339
the technical corrected pronunciation

821
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:42,160
the fish emulsion versus the hydro that

822
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:45,220
seems to be you know what NPK you want

823
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:48,610
and then the fish meal takes that and

824
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,890
adds the additional variable of how

825
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:52,599
quickly you want it available to the

826
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,330
plant so so even though these are all

827
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:58,480
fish based really it sounds like the the

828
00:30:55,329 --> 00:31:01,769
nature of the processing has a lot to do

829
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,730
with which product you end up choosing

830
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:06,849
and the last one of my list is

831
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:08,769
fish compost which which it's an

832
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:10,599
interesting idea because the compost

833
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:12,639
that we have where I lived I've been

834
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:15,069
told not to put any animal products in

835
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,070
it so so what what's the story with fish

836
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:20,200
compost you know you don't see a lot of

837
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:22,569
it I we work with one company here in

838
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,279
Washington that makes a fish compost and

839
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:26,259
I think what's so great about that

840
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:27,910
product is the fact they let it age for

841
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,890
at least two years before they sell it

842
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,360
so to me it's not so much the fact

843
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,250
they're using fish which is great but

844
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:35,109
the fact that they allow that material

845
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,900
to be fully composted through static

846
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:39,849
composting you just can't beat nature in

847
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,560
that regard but yeah it's a great

848
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:44,559
product we find it comes in with a lot

849
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:48,789
of really good beneficial micro and

850
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,960
macro invertebrates and you know it's

851
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:52,019
gonna be a little bit higher in nitrogen

852
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,230
than some of the other you know strictly

853
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:57,609
food waste or you know plant waste

854
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:59,890
compost but one thing I wanted to

855
00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:01,750
mention that I forgot to was in regards

856
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:03,820
to fish hydrolysate that is sort of my

857
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:07,559
go-to bottled nutrient you know if you

858
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:10,329
want a just very simple bloom nutrient

859
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,460
fish hydrolysate could replace I think a

860
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:14,649
lot of the the bloom nutrients out there

861
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,360
on the market it's just a swap for a

862
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:18,040
quarter of the price right now and

863
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:19,750
that's fantastic you know you mentioned

864
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:22,779
earlier too that the liquids tend to

865
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:24,549
smell fishy ER and for me um you know I

866
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:26,470
would consider that a win I mean if it

867
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:29,019
smells fishy I'm thinking it's got more

868
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:31,630
of the you know the active life force if

869
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:34,029
you will of the original fish then some

870
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,770
of the you know overly processed powders

871
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:37,480
which have lost that smell I'm thinking

872
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:39,879
that that the liquids are just gonna

873
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,110
hold more of the essential oils of the

874
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,580
fish throughout the process

875
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,809
not sure if I'm right but that's

876
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:46,779
certainly how I would go when I was

877
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:48,909
buying it you do get higher oil content

878
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:50,920
which is great but the one thing I

879
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:53,710
noticed you that remind me of the fact I

880
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,769
tested this like freeze dried or flash

881
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:58,269
dried fish powder that was carried in a

882
00:32:56,769 --> 00:33:00,160
local garden center and I was looking at

883
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:03,400
under the microscope by at using it as a

884
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,110
food source for soil microbes and I

885
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,980
found that I did not get very good

886
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:10,839
results so it's amazing how different of

887
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:13,059
a microbial food for example the fish

888
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:15,459
hydrolysate is then the fish emulsion or

889
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:16,210
the fish meal or even this freeze-dried

890
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,519
product

891
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,920
they can really vary across the board so

892
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:22,750
in general fish hydrolysates sort of my

893
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,060
go-to for liquid and then if I want

894
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,309
nitrogen I'll go with fish meal if I

895
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:29,679
want calcium you can use something like

896
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:31,839
fish or I'm sorry phosphorus then you

897
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,269
can use fish bone meal which is another

898
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:37,269
fish product while we're on the topic so

899
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:39,009
so they remove all the fleshy bits of

900
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:40,809
the fish and they just go with the bone

901
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:44,230
is that is that so you make a more

902
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:45,669
targeted nutrient again I think it's a

903
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:48,960
byproduct they were able to make into a

904
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:52,150
fertilizer but if you don't want to use

905
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,970
you know land animal or mammal based

906
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:57,400
phosphorus sources then the fish bone

907
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:00,460
meal is a really good option I only know

908
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,259
of one other non animal-based phosphorus

909
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,549
source which would be soft rock

910
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:05,589
phosphate but that has its own

911
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:07,899
challenges so fish bone meal to me is

912
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:09,940
really one of the best phosphorus

913
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,789
options out there for gardeners and

914
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:16,090
growers beyond compost right on right so

915
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:19,000
before we leave the seaside and move

916
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:21,490
inland again let's talk about some guano

917
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,989
so so you know people have been using

918
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:29,139
back Watteau for decades and at least in

919
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:31,989
my world seabird guano is something that

920
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:34,929
that seems to have come more recently

921
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:37,689
can you first speak to why people like

922
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:39,730
using these the sea side guano's to

923
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:41,409
begin with and and then what the

924
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,740
difference is between the bat and the

925
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:46,539
seabird guano yeah

926
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:48,039
so people have been using guano's for

927
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:50,739
years now you hear a lot of old-school

928
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:53,199
growers that talk about how the guano is

929
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:55,989
what separates their butt from you know

930
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,939
everyone else's and guano's are great

931
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:59,199
because they're good fast early sources

932
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,139
of a lot of these micro and macro

933
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:04,659
nutrients it's one of the great examples

934
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:06,190
to of why a soil test is so helpful

935
00:35:04,659 --> 00:35:08,019
because they come in a variety of

936
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,860
different NPK values depending on where

937
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:11,230
they're sourced from

938
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:14,200
so you may see like Peruvian seabird

939
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:17,469
guano that has you know 10% phosphorous

940
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:20,619
for example whereas a Mexican bat guano

941
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:23,279
or seabird guano maybe 10% nitrogen and

942
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:25,420
no phosphorous so depending on what

943
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,240
habitats coming out can really determine

944
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,960
the nutrient content so they're all the

945
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,539
guano's will vary

946
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,820
across the board in that regard now I'm

947
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:36,820
personally not a huge fan of guano's and

948
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:38,440
I'll share why in general it's not a

949
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,599
rapidly renewable resource

950
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,460
these caves lose their biodiversity when

951
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,530
they're harvested and that can destroy

952
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:46,780
some of the ecology in the caves and

953
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:48,490
also if it's harvested when the bats are

954
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,900
present the bats may not want to return

955
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:51,399
back to that cave to care for their

956
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,769
young or they may abandon that cave

957
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,150
altogether and even though it's the

958
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:58,000
source of economy for a lot of these

959
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:59,289
local and indigenous populations it can

960
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,730
cause a lot of respiratory health

961
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:03,279
problems and other things for the people

962
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:05,559
actually doing the collection now before

963
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,830
people get super mad at me I will say

964
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:11,949
there are safe and sustainably harvested

965
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:13,509
ways of doing that process but it's

966
00:36:11,949 --> 00:36:15,669
impossible to know when you go pick up a

967
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:18,460
bag on the shelf how that stuff has been

968
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,838
has been processed without calling the

969
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,030
manufacturer and really doing a lot of

970
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,920
research on it so it sounds like wonho's

971
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,599
one of those things that we really want

972
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,050
to know our producer because we want to

973
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:33,609
know you know where and how it was

974
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:35,140
produced but then also we want to know

975
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,569
what the makeup ID is because it sounds

976
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:38,980
like guano's or not you know you can't

977
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,170
just swap them out one for the other

978
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,440
each one is going to be kind of its own

979
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:46,300
product yeah and the other thing to

980
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,389
think about too is the microbial aspect

981
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,890
of bag wonho's or seabird guano so some

982
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:53,230
people swear that the reason they love

983
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:55,179
these guano's is because they bring in

984
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,679
specific microbes that are really good

985
00:36:55,179 --> 00:37:00,909
for bringing out all the you know the

986
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:02,440
terpenes in your in your final bud that

987
00:37:00,909 --> 00:37:05,799
being said you're also have the

988
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:08,409
potential for pathogens like e coli or

989
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,390
salmonella there's a specific one to

990
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:12,608
bats called histoplasmosis that's a

991
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:14,858
fungal spore that is is pretty nasty

992
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:16,449
that you don't want to get and you know

993
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:18,279
you had asked me before the show about

994
00:37:16,449 --> 00:37:20,049
guano's and one of the questions you

995
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,300
asked was are there any requirements

996
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:24,220
around microbial testing like for these

997
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,960
pathogens so I called the Department of

998
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:27,009
Agriculture in Oregon and was talking to

999
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,599
the guy and he said that they don't

1000
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:31,510
actually have any requirements for that

1001
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:33,099
to register guano as a fertilizer but

1002
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:34,630
there may be some in terms of with the

1003
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:36,670
USDA in terms of what they allow you to

1004
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:39,910
legally import I haven't looked into it

1005
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:41,440
that far but be aware with these you

1006
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:42,519
know with these guano products you could

1007
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,099
be bringing in

1008
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:48,639
you know potentially dangerous pathogens

1009
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:51,190
as well right on I remember so I had

1010
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:54,069
Kevin Jodrey from Exedy Kevin Joe jury

1011
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:56,920
from from wonderland nursery humble

1012
00:37:54,070 --> 00:38:00,250
County up here to do a talk a few months

1013
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,559
back during this summer all on how to

1014
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,639
how to breed for terpenes and he said

1015
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,489
that one of the things that you have to

1016
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:08,529
be really careful about with guano is

1017
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:11,439
how much it influences the terpene

1018
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:14,380
profile yes it'll it'll turn up your

1019
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,960
terpenes but it only turns up a spec to

1020
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:19,090
a particular spectrum of terpenes and he

1021
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,829
says that he remembers way back I think

1022
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:25,480
he said it was in the early 90s but

1023
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:27,579
yesterday many way when back 1o became

1024
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,690
really popular and humble and then

1025
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:31,029
suddenly and oddly

1026
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:34,030
people's canvass flowers started tasting

1027
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:35,410
very similar and people are like hmm I

1028
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:39,010
wonder if that's because we've all

1029
00:38:35,409 --> 00:38:41,769
started using guano and then the the

1030
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:43,330
overseas manufacturer for the bulk of

1031
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:45,519
the guano that was coming United States

1032
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:47,619
changed and they changed where they are

1033
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,400
getting it from and then suddenly in one

1034
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:50,769
season

1035
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,780
all these terpene profiles all changed

1036
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:57,340
at the same time and they all realized

1037
00:38:52,780 --> 00:39:00,160
how much using guano was was encouraging

1038
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:04,210
certain terpenes and discouraging other

1039
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:06,219
terpenes and so for for Hemis i like n i

1040
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:08,829
don't really want anything in my

1041
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:12,279
fertilizers that's going to artificially

1042
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:14,319
air quotes artificially um change the

1043
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,900
planet he's because I want to taste the

1044
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,120
full spectrum of the plant so so Kevin

1045
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:22,119
went on with things that that he has

1046
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,460
found that that can be used as a it was

1047
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:27,329
a nutrient but that wasn't going to

1048
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:30,250
spike certain terpenes and not others

1049
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:31,809
thus not having the plant properly

1050
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:34,300
express itself and I found that really

1051
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:35,860
interesting both the fact of of adding

1052
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,990
products like you know it Turpin ater

1053
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,970
that does that then that will turn up a

1054
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:41,889
certain spectrum of terpenes while not

1055
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:45,009
doing the others but also the influence

1056
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:47,379
on agriculture as a whole as agriculture

1057
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:50,620
changes from one nutrient being invoked

1058
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:54,220
to another it will really impact the

1059
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:55,569
agricultural product whatever it is yeah

1060
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:56,449
and I think it from an ethical

1061
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,700
perspective at

1062
00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:00,169
very least you know we're talking about

1063
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:02,210
importing these things they had to have

1064
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,800
a massive fossil fuel cost just to get

1065
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,920
into the United States I think that we

1066
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,930
can find a lot of these same nutrients

1067
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,099
in other sources some of which we've

1068
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:11,899
already talked about I know we're going

1069
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:13,940
to talk about some other options too so

1070
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,430
I think there's replacements for about

1071
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,260
bat guano's and and sea bird guano's out

1072
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:21,019
there that we can find more locally and

1073
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,820
I think also a lot of the reason that

1074
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:24,588
you're getting these terpene changes is

1075
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,530
due to the high sulfur levels that

1076
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:29,630
you're seeing in in bagua knows there's

1077
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:31,369
a big link between sulfur and terpenes

1078
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,750
it's already been established so that's

1079
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:34,700
something I think you can play with

1080
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,199
yourself as a girl if you're doing soil

1081
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:38,569
testing is you can you can experiment

1082
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:40,399
with different sulfur levels in your

1083
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,530
soils and see how that expression

1084
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,088
changes your final your final flower

1085
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,349
right on so we're gonna take another

1086
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:46,880
short break and be right back

1087
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:48,619
you're listening to shaping fire and my

1088
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,530
guest today is Ted Hussey of keep it

1089
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:52,970
simple organics as a listener of shaping

1090
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,769
fire you already understand the

1091
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:57,169
importance of living soil when growing

1092
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:59,239
cannabis when you have active microbe

1093
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:01,430
communities in your substrate you go way

1094
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:03,979
beyond simply fertilizing with nitrogen

1095
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:05,629
phosphorus and potassium having active

1096
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,490
microorganisms in your substrate

1097
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,380
supports vigorous plant growth

1098
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:11,739
throughout the plants root zone making

1099
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:14,450
for higher yields and thriving flowers

1100
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:17,000
mammoth pea is the first organically

1101
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:18,409
derived microbial inoculant that focuses

1102
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,019
on your plants nutrient cycling

1103
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:22,759
processes to release soil phosphorus and

1104
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:25,159
other micronutrients from they're bound

1105
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,650
forms making them more available to the

1106
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:29,328
plant increased levels of phosphorus

1107
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:31,190
will also keep internode shorter and

1108
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:33,349
focus your plants energy on bud

1109
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:35,389
production not only that but the

1110
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:36,440
microbes act as a defense shield for the

1111
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:38,480
plants rhizosphere

1112
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,150
by out competing potentially harmful

1113
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,858
pathogenic microbes pretty cool right

1114
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:45,019
mammoth pee not only unlocks the

1115
00:41:42,858 --> 00:41:47,900
nutrients in your soil but it also helps

1116
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:49,880
protect your plant from disease mammoth

1117
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:53,180
peas beneficial bacteria act like

1118
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:56,088
microbial reactors continually producing

1119
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:57,889
enzymes that release nutrients mammoth

1120
00:41:56,088 --> 00:42:00,019
pee was developed at a u.s. university

1121
00:41:57,889 --> 00:42:01,879
has been extensively tested by Colorado

1122
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:04,429
growers and independent laboratories

1123
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:07,130
mammoth pee is proven to increase growth

1124
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:08,328
and enhance blooming one of the great

1125
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,780
things about supplementing with

1126
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:11,430
microorganisms is that

1127
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,680
won't compete with whatever fertilizer

1128
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:15,869
program you're already running simply

1129
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,299
dose on top of your fertilizer schedule

1130
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:19,829
for increased benefits to learn more and

1131
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,220
to find out where you can buy mammoth

1132
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:43,019
pee near you check out their website at

1133
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:44,730
wwlp.com with most terpene providers is

1134
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:46,469
that they're not sourced naturally and

1135
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:48,889
instead are made as a byproduct of

1136
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:52,139
refining petroleum and that's so sketchy

1137
00:42:48,889 --> 00:42:54,329
the terpenes sold by true terpenes are

1138
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:57,119
entirely different they are certified

1139
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:58,829
organic non-gmo and food grade that

1140
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,380
means they are extracted from real plant

1141
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:03,059
sources there are no solvents of any

1142
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,579
kind used during the extraction process

1143
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:09,059
they are distilled only with steam

1144
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:10,949
that's right only steam in fact terpenes

1145
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:13,079
from true terpenes are so pure that you

1146

can eat them not only that but you can

1147
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:16,110
stack them with better results - what I

1148
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,300
mean is

1149
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:20,400
other companies terpenes have got a few

1150
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,289
percent of impurities and when you stack

1151
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,849
those terpenes to make a blend you're

1152
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:26,699
adding a variety of impurities that

1153
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:29,610
degrade your final product true terpenes

1154

listening to shaping fire I'm your host

1181
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,750
Shango Luce and I guess this week is tad

1182
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:32,940
hussy of keep it simple organics so

1183
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:35,789
let's come inland a little bit from the

1184
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,280
ocean shore and let's talk about blood

1185
00:44:35,789 --> 00:44:42,088
meal where does it come from and what

1186
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:45,510
are we using it for tad yeah blood meal

1187
00:44:42,088 --> 00:44:47,549
is a byproduct of the meat or

1188
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:51,059
slaughterhouse industry it's literally

1189
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:53,339
what you think it is and it's about 13%

1190
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:56,579
fast release nitrogen so a lot of

1191
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:58,349
gardeners I know will use it in veg as a

1192
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:00,359
way of increasing that nitrogen

1193
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:03,150
percentage it's really affordable it's

1194
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:04,469
it's kind of nasty in my opinion you

1195
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:07,530
don't want to get it wet and on your

1196
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:09,118
fingers but it is a it is like a reddish

1197
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:11,010
powder that you can add into your soil

1198
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,250
is it simply blood that's been

1199
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:16,770
dehydrated as far as I know yeah it's

1200
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,900
pretty much that's pretty much all it is

1201
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:22,440
how much thread is there preferred to

1202
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:24,869
carry pathogens you know I haven't heard

1203
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,460
of any issues around it but honestly I

1204
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:29,010
don't have a lot of growers that I know

1205
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,559
using it it's it's one of those things a

1206
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:32,760
lot of people have ethical issues around

1207
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:34,650
but I you know I've worked with some

1208
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,750
really good tomato growers and such that

1209
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:38,608
would put a small amount in with their

1210
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,048
tomato starts as a way to get them give

1211
00:45:38,608 --> 00:45:41,369
them a little boost I've always kind of

1212
00:45:40,048 --> 00:45:45,869
got the impression that's kind of like a

1213
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:49,108
like an old-school nutrient especially

1214
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:50,640
with you know lower-income farmers it's

1215
00:45:49,108 --> 00:45:54,179
it's something that they can afford to

1216
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:57,179
use that once dried is pretty stable and

1217
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:58,649
and and if you've already got a farm and

1218
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:01,289
farm animals and you're gonna slaughter

1219
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,608
them for your family this is a ready

1220
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:06,298
alternative or you know it's it's

1221
00:46:02,608 --> 00:46:08,519
readily there is is blood meal moving

1222
00:46:06,298 --> 00:46:10,619
more out of vogue because we've got

1223
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:15,269
other things that that do the same work

1224
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:17,039
but with more benefit you know it's hard

1225
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:19,349
for me to say on like an agricultural

1226
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,239
level but I just personally choose not

1227
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:23,309
to use it I'll pay a little bit more to

1228
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:26,519
use the fish meal and it's it's not all

1229
00:46:23,309 --> 00:46:28,798
that cheap either so it's just something

1230
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:30,389
that I don't personally like to use I

1231
00:46:28,798 --> 00:46:33,509
mean if we're if we're desperate for

1232
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:36,058
more nitrogen there's other sources like

1233
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:37,090
cover crops and nitrogen fixing legumes

1234
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,920
and things like that

1235
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:41,289
or you know fishmeal that we talked

1236
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,610
about or even alfalfa meal and some of

1237
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:44,860
these other plant meals will bring in a

1238
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:47,260
small percentage of nitrogen right on

1239
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:49,090
does it matter what the what type of

1240
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,550
blood it is like what what animal or is

1241
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,870
it just kind of all the same you know I

1242
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,700
haven't really delved into it that's a

1243
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:57,940
good question we get a 50-pound bag

1244
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:59,769
that's full of blood meal and I haven't

1245
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,460
gone beyond that with and honestly right

1246
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:02,559
on fair enough

1247
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:04,210
so so while we're on the farm let's talk

1248
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:05,889
about feather meal when I first read

1249
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:07,570
this I mean I had to go to Wikipedia and

1250
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:09,519
look it up because really gives it

1251
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:13,690
really feathers and and it appears to be

1252
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:15,940
yes yet another byproduct of the poultry

1253
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:17,920
industry this time now the cool thing

1254
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:21,250
about feather meal is it's a slow

1255
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,690
release nitrogen product so if you want

1256
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,190
nitrogen right away blood meal is going

1257
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:25,090
to give you that or fish meal but if you

1258
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,800
want something that's going to be

1259
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:29,289
released over a period of months because

1260
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,030
from an outdoor gardening perspective

1261
00:47:29,289 --> 00:47:32,829
nitrogen is something that's leached out

1262
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,870
of your soil every year when it rains it

1263
00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:36,579
it doesn't stick around in the soil so

1264
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:38,409
we have as a farmer or a gardener we

1265
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:40,329
have to add it every year so feather

1266
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:41,679
meal is great because you know you could

1267
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:43,179
put it in at being in the season and

1268
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:45,159
it'll be available slowly over a period

1269
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:47,710
of months rather than all at once right

1270
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:50,949
at the beginning of the crop cycle right

1271
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:53,170
on and it's just is it is it just is it

1272
00:47:50,949 --> 00:47:53,799
chicken feathers or is it many different

1273
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,950
types of birds

1274
00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:00,820
oh man Shango I don't I don't know all

1275
00:47:56,949 --> 00:48:02,739
these answers it's just a brown powder

1276
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,000
you can you wouldn't even know it was

1277
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:05,829
feather meal or it was made from

1278
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,780
feathers just looking at it has a little

1279
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:09,699
bit of an off odor but it's not it's not

1280
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,200
terribly unpleasant and you know I think

1281
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:14,409
the fact that you don't know as much

1282
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:16,389
about blood and feather meal as you know

1283
00:48:14,409 --> 00:48:18,009
the other things that we've talked about

1284
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:23,579
that you know a ton about I think that

1285
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:25,960
probably says something about the the

1286
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:28,840
likelihood of people wanting to choose

1287
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:31,059
this stuff you know it's like it may be

1288
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,400
low cost that may have been around for a

1289
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:35,590
while but not only is it you know

1290
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,990
farming by-product which you may or may

1291
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:40,809
not want to use in your grow at all but

1292
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:43,239
in most of these cases we've got new and

1293
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:46,029
better available things to use do you

1294
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:48,159
think that's a fair assumption yeah I

1295
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:49,600
mean I do still like feather meal and I

1296
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:50,460
will use a small amount of feather meal

1297
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,710
but

1298
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,389
blood meal and bone meal I would prefer

1299
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:56,730
to use fish products on and that's just

1300
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:58,319
a personal choice but they're you know

1301
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:00,809
they're out there and if you have a good

1302
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:02,070
cheap source of them by all means you

1303
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:06,150
should utilize that the plant doesn't

1304
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:08,370
care right on so so I live on an island

1305
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:09,809
and a lot of people like to be

1306
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:12,029
self-sufficient and don't want to bring

1307
00:49:09,809 --> 00:49:14,250
over things packaged and and I know a

1308
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:16,290
lot of people who are into probiotic are

1309
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:18,510
very much into being self-sufficient and

1310
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:20,039
brewing up their own stuff and it

1311
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:21,990
doesn't take long for people to realize

1312
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:24,509
that you know the rabbits that they keep

1313
00:49:21,989 --> 00:49:26,519
their poop is really great for their

1314
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:30,300
plants and then they start thinking

1315
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:32,039
about maybe the the straw filled with

1316
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,410
chicken poop from the chicken yard would

1317
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:36,480
be good for my plants too so let's take

1318
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:39,899
those individually for people who want

1319
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,960
to - you know derive their nutrients on

1320
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:46,400
their own property um how good of a

1321
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:49,170
choice is rabbit poop and chicken poop

1322
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,260
yes so as a general rule I like to break

1323
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:53,430
out animal manures based on what that

1324
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:56,670
animal likes to eat

1325
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:59,909
so in general herbivores tend to be

1326
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:02,670
safer compost or safer manures than

1327
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:06,119
carnivore omnivores so things like

1328
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:08,579
rabbits and chickens those horse for

1329
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:11,039
example those are all relatively safe

1330
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:14,250
they don't tend to be you tend to be

1331
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:17,400
able to use them much much more readily

1332
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:20,070
and like for example rabbit rabbit poop

1333
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,650
doesn't need to be composted now in

1334
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:25,110
general I like to compost all but all

1335
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:27,360
animal manures because it reduces or

1336
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:28,530
removes the risk of pathogens like E

1337
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,110
coli or salmonella

1338
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:33,930
but people have been using Ram rabbit

1339
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:37,860
manure raw directly on their plants for

1340
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:40,589
you know generations now without a lot

1341
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,570
of issues now one thing about chicken

1342
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:44,250
manure that you mentioned is chicken

1343
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:47,100
manure can can be hot and when they talk

1344
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:50,070
about a source of inure being hot

1345
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:52,650
not only can that be thermally hot as in

1346
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:55,289
temperature wise because those bacteria

1347
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:57,960
and microorganisms are reproducing so

1348
00:50:55,289 --> 00:51:00,000
rapidly as they break down that material

1349
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,139
that that manure it's an exothermic

1350
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,809
reaction which

1351
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:05,940
generates heat and as you may already

1352
00:51:03,809 --> 00:51:07,710
know like plants do not like a lot of

1353
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,869
high temperatures around their roots so

1354
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:12,510
putting that right into the soil I can

1355
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:14,519
be damaging for the plant in addition

1356
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:16,049
when they talk about burning with the

1357
00:51:14,518 --> 00:51:18,689
other thing that can occur is when you

1358
00:51:16,048 --> 00:51:22,108
put a high nitrogen source out like that

1359
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:25,108
it can the bacteria and microorganisms

1360
00:51:22,108 --> 00:51:26,969
can be more efficient at pulling and

1361
00:51:25,108 --> 00:51:29,429
consuming the nitrogen that is available

1362
00:51:26,969 --> 00:51:32,278
in that soil and so what they can do is

1363
00:51:29,429 --> 00:51:33,750
actually pull nitrogen from that soil

1364
00:51:32,278 --> 00:51:35,460
more efficiently than plant and then the

1365
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,889
plant can show nitrogen deficiencies

1366
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,568
even though there's a lot of nitrogen in

1367
00:51:37,889 --> 00:51:41,460
that soil right now make sense yeah it

1368
00:51:39,568 --> 00:51:44,099
does so running that backwards it sounds

1369
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:46,289
like the chicken poop would probably be

1370
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:50,039
better you know best serve the gardener

1371
00:51:46,289 --> 00:51:53,730
to to you know break out the the yard

1372
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:57,420
and then you know compost that for a

1373
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:59,909
little bit so so it can you know cool

1374
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:03,139
out and be a little more stable and use

1375
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:06,118
it that way and then for rabbit poop

1376
00:52:03,139 --> 00:52:09,268
potentially throw it on there as a top

1377
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:11,190
dress and then and then water over it

1378
00:52:09,268 --> 00:52:13,500
kind of like as a time-release thing

1379
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:17,309
those both sound like reasonable ways to

1380
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,989
use those definitely and the rabbit poop

1381
00:52:17,309 --> 00:52:20,970
is a lot easier to collect too because

1382
00:52:18,989 --> 00:52:23,429
the rabbits are typically living in

1383
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:25,469
cages with you know mesh or mesh bottom

1384
00:52:23,429 --> 00:52:28,889
so that that drops through with the

1385
00:52:25,469 --> 00:52:33,419
chicken poop what we do is we put all of

1386
00:52:28,889 --> 00:52:35,250
our chickens on our Buress chips which

1387
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,690
is essentially large wood chips so

1388
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,960
they're really really high in carbon so

1389
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:41,579
which balances out the high nitrogen

1390
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,099
relatively speaking of the chicken poop

1391
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:45,630
so that will compost right there it's

1392
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:47,789
called a deep litter method for chicken

1393
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:49,740
owners and that will slowly break down

1394
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:52,440
and then after a period of time will

1395
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:54,719
remove that sort of composted material

1396
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,298
and let it compost further before

1397
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:57,929
bringing it back in as a fertilizer or

1398
00:52:57,298 --> 00:52:59,608
nutrient

1399
00:52:57,929 --> 00:53:00,989
right on the deep litter method that's

1400
00:52:59,608 --> 00:53:03,480
really great thank you for that tad

1401
00:53:00,989 --> 00:53:05,459
right on so you know tad while we've got

1402
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,369
you here we might as well talk about

1403
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:12,088
human manure too you know some people do

1404
00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:13,528
use human feces with their plans and you

1405
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:14,449
know that grosses out a lot of people

1406
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:17,679
but the plot of

1407
00:53:14,449 --> 00:53:19,969
who use it swear by it so what say you

1408
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:22,730
you know I gotta say it grosses me out a

1409
00:53:19,969 --> 00:53:25,759
little bit too I have no problems with

1410
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:27,048
human manure I just don't like to use it

1411
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,299
on my edible plants and I would throw

1412
00:53:27,048 --> 00:53:31,099
cannabis in that category yeah I gotta

1413
00:53:29,298 --> 00:53:33,619
say there was a there's a funny story

1414
00:53:31,099 --> 00:53:36,109
there was this guy on icy Meg a while

1415
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:37,730
back that would post all of his food you

1416
00:53:36,108 --> 00:53:39,739
know he was like I had a hemp smoothie

1417
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:41,449
for lunch and then he would show his

1418
00:53:39,739 --> 00:53:44,509
plant growing and it was the saddest

1419
00:53:41,449 --> 00:53:46,009
looking plant but it was it was so funny

1420
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:48,770
all the comments on that thread it was

1421
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:51,290
it was like it was a good kick but you

1422
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:53,539
know honestly I personally choose not to

1423
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:55,730
use human manure just because of the

1424
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:57,440
higher risk of e.coli and some of these

1425
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:59,780
other pathogens like Salmonella and all

1426
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,639
seriousness so people can do it just

1427
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:03,589
fully fully compost the material that

1428
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:05,989
means you're heating it to 131 degrees

1429
00:54:03,588 --> 00:54:07,489
for at least three days you know you're

1430
00:54:05,989 --> 00:54:08,798
turning the pile it requires a lot more

1431
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:11,659
work to really remove those pathogens

1432
00:54:08,798 --> 00:54:14,690
right on we'll leave that for the for

1433
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:16,159
the strictly hardcore experimenters so

1434
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:18,079
so you know we've talked about a lot of

1435
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:20,719
the easy inputs today and one way or the

1436
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:23,480
another they're all feeding our NPK and

1437
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:26,328
and very possibly also our microbe

1438
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,010
communities you know a lot of people

1439
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:31,250
like to stick with just using plant

1440
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:33,619
inputs is there anything in this list

1441
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:36,829
today that we can't replace with some

1442
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:38,710
other plant you know I wouldn't say

1443
00:54:36,829 --> 00:54:42,079
there's anything that's irreplaceable I

1444
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:44,510
do like to use some animal and fish

1445
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,190
products just because it's a lot easier

1446
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:47,990
to get these especially the

1447
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:50,298
macronutrients the nitrogen and

1448
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:52,699
phosphorus specifically in high levels

1449
00:54:50,298 --> 00:54:54,949
but you are able to pick them up from

1450
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:58,399
plant sources now I don't like to take

1451
00:54:54,949 --> 00:54:59,899
it as far as the began explained animal

1452
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,180
will be walking in the woods and die in

1453
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,130
nature and then that animal will be

1454
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:05,838
consumed by microorganisms and break

1455
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:08,869
back down into the soil and to me that's

1456
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:10,308
a perfectly natural process and I think

1457
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:12,740
it's an important process that we need

1458
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:14,089
to recognize so to me animal byproducts

1459
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:16,489
are not bad you just need to look into

1460
00:55:14,088 --> 00:55:17,838
your sourcing of them when you're when

1461
00:55:16,489 --> 00:55:19,939
you're choosing to use them Yeah right

1462
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:21,650
on and you know this summer is the first

1463
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:23,420
year that I got into this stuff at all

1464
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:25,880
and I decided I just wanted to start

1465
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,650
simple so I started with insect frass

1466
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:31,160
worm castings

1467
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:33,590
in a liquid fish product and and I was

1468
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:35,599
really happy with the results and and I

1469
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:37,940
think that it's an easy way for people

1470
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:39,619
to intuit without thinking that they

1471
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:42,170
have to have all of the knowledge that

1472
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:44,150
we went through today I think you

1473
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:45,860
started with three really great products

1474
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:47,240
to kelp meal would be the other one I

1475
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:49,550
would recommend to people even though it

1476
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:51,079
doesn't fit into that poop category but

1477
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:52,640
one thing I forgot to mention about worm

1478
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:53,779
castings is if you ever see a plant

1479
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:55,579
that's just a little bit unhappy

1480
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,290
throwing a handful or two of worm

1481
00:55:55,579 --> 00:55:58,969
castings in there and watering it in a

1482
00:55:57,289 --> 00:56:01,460
lot of times and can correct these

1483
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:02,989
little minor minor issues you may have

1484
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,699
as a new grower and that's a great way

1485
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:07,339
to go my friend told me that worm

1486
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:09,319
castings is the chocolate cake of the

1487
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:11,120
plant nutrient world just like with

1488
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,350
humans no matter what's got you down if

1489
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,880
you have a little bit of chocolate cake

1490
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:16,730
you'll feel better that's how he feels

1491
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,349
about worm castings yeah I like that

1492
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:20,059
analogy I would even say it's healthier

1493
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:21,829
though - so you're not you're not

1494
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:23,900
putting on anything that's gonna be bad

1495
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:25,039
for the plant it's gonna ultimately you

1496
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,720
know increase its health

1497
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:28,699
unlike chocolate cake for us Yeah right

1498
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:29,899
