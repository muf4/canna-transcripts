1
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:08,269
hey there and welcome to the third

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,300
shaping fire sessions I am your host

3
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:12,919
from shaping fire Shango Lowe's our

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,769
first shaping fire session was with

5
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:18,169
Kevin Joe dree our second was with dr.

6
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:21,259
Ethan Russo and now our third one here

7
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:23,929
today starts with Jeff Lowen fells jeff

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,779
Lowen fells is a big proponent of the

9
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:29,509
soil food web and using living soil when

10
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:31,278
growing cannabis he is the author of the

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,920
trilogy of books which are kind of the

12
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:38,119
cornerstone for a lot of people of

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,548
cannabis living soil which is teeming

14
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:43,039
with microbes teeming with nutrients and

15
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:46,399
teeming with fungi and he also has got a

16
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:50,539
new book coming out on October 22nd in

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,460
2019 this year all on otto flowers and

18
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:56,359
so you can find links to all those books

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,978
down in the video description over the

20
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,350
next three weeks we're going to be

21
00:00:57,978 --> 00:01:02,988
publishing a series of interviews that

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,960
we did with jeff lone fells

23
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:07,519
on the soil food web and what's going on

24
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:09,709
inside your living soil when you're

25
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,599
growing cannabis there are a handful of

26
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:13,250
questions that I didn't think were you

27
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,469
know addressed properly enough in

28
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,599
cannabis and so I asked Jeff if I could

29
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:19,670
ask him these very specific questions

30
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,289
that we can all use answers to and he's

31
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,299
like yeah and I'm on it so we got

32
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,670
together and we recorded this series for

33
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:28,069
you and we hope you like it we want to

34
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,710
give special thanks to Patrick Smith and

35
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:31,969
green bicycles who is the sponsor for

36
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:34,059
this series

37
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:36,379
Kevin Joe Reed actually turned me on to

38
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,570
green bicycles one time when I was

39
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:40,280
visiting Wonderland nursery he's all

40
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:42,139
like man this is the compost tea we use

41
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,730
on all my farms it's awesome we rely on

42
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,129
it and I'm like hey that was good enough

43
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,540
for me so I picked up some and I've been

44
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:50,420
using it for a few years with great

45
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,760
results as well and Patrick Smith is a

46
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,978
really nice guy and so you know nice guy

the first video Jeff Lowen fells shaping

61
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:25,280
fire sessions number three

62
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,920
so Jeff yeah thank you so much for

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,629
joining us today you know one of the

64
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,389
things I wanted to start with is that

65
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:38,620
you know mulching cover crops and

66
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:41,439
topdressing

67
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,159
are all very popular for really good

68
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,770
reason right

69
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:48,400
but mulching sometimes we can run into

70
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:52,360
some problems because if we mulch soil

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,420
that is already unbalanced sometimes the

72
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,069
mulch can add that the the lack of

73
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:59,949
balance and make things even even worse

74
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:02,768
and so what I keep it by tying up

75
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:06,310
nutrients and so my question for you is

76
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:09,219
how can we best use mulch with cannabis

77
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,959
for for the best plants we can grow okay

78
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:13,650
well first let me go back and correct

79
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,780
what I think is sort of a misstatement

80
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,120
most people are really hung up on the

81
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,979
idea that if you have a mulch layer that

82
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,750
the soil microbes will go into the mulch

83
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:28,449
Rob the soil of all sorts of nutrients

84
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,060
as they as they use the energy that they

85
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:34,179
need to work up that mulch that's that's

86
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,739
you know ties up the nutrients in 30 you

87
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,200
know it does to a certain extent but

88
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,629
just at that layer the interface between

89
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:43,389
the mulch and the soil so it's really

90
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:44,979
not sucking up all of the nutrients out

91
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,048
of the soil and tying everything up it's

92
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:48,909
just that little layer it's it's not

93
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:51,549
like pH if I can digress just a little

94
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:53,680
bit we're concerned about pH but the

95
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,150
only area where pH really counts is

96
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,700
right around the rhizosphere right

97
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:01,060
around the root not on the surface who

98
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:03,219
cares what the pages within degrees and

99
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,590
it's the same thing with the mulch yeah

100
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:08,560
if you've got a layer of mulch you're

101
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,299
gonna lose a little bit of nutrient just

102
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,979
at that interface but down where the

103
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:15,069
roots are you're not gonna have a

104
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:17,349
problem so the question then becomes

105
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:20,829
what kind of mulch is the right kind of

106
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:23,770
mulch to use for cannabis and and I like

107
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:26,978
to use a mulch that that generates more

108
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:28,959
bacteria than fungus now this

109
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:31,629
conversation has been

110
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,250
going on for a while and I have been

111
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:35,800
told although I haven't spoken directly

112
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,810
with her that dr. lien thinks a little

113
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,079
bit more fungal that I'm suggesting

114
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:44,920
makes sense and as I think about it

115
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:47,859
I'm still on the bacterial side a green

116
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,259
wolf would be bacterial the the fungal

117
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,110
comes in for the plants that that take a

118
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:55,449
long time done to grow we were talking

119
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,090
although flowers those are quick those

120
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,289
are clearly bacterial to me if you've

121
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:04,589
got something that's got a lot of

122
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:08,650
Afghani in it that you know long-term

123
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:09,339
growth it takes six months a little bit

124
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:11,109
more

125
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:14,979
you always need some fungal in the soil

126
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,259
so the mulch that I like is is a is a

127
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,050
green mulch I'll use actual grass

128
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:22,029
clippings and straw and hay and you know

129
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,259
gotta worry about seeds obviously if I'm

130
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:29,139
going to be using my soil again and just

131
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:31,449
some leaves although in there but I

132
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:34,599
definitely mulch all my plants so some

133
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:36,849
people don't want to use their dead

134
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,920
leaves from the cannabis plant in the

135
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,629
soil right because they think oh it's

136
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,800
necrotic and there's something wrong

137
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:43,810
with it and now I'm putting it in my

138
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,639
soil whereas others are all like the

139
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,949
canvas plant already has the key

140
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:49,629
nutrients this makes the best mulch what

141
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,849
are your thoughts well I believe in

142
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:53,409
what's known as the law of return and

143
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,500
with the only reason why we fertilize

144
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,880
plants is because we harvest the stuff

145
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,389
that's supposed to fall down from the

146
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:03,850
plant decay and regenerate the soil uh

147
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:05,709
and you know so we take the flowers we

148
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:09,790
take we take you know the top sugar

149
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:11,649
leaves I am a big believer in letting

150
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,680
the rest of the plant including the

151
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:16,659
roots go into that soil and become part

152
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,920
of your soil mix I guess that I guess

153
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,470
that makes sense like a tree right

154
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,990
because without man's involvement or

155
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,760
human involvement the tree itself will

156
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,470
just drop it's leave and it provides its

157
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,699
own mulch for the next year yeah yeah I

158
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,560
mean it really is called the law

159
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:33,060
returned and I'm trying to I can

160
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,550
remember that even uh oh gosh

161
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,040
it'll come to me sometime but but now

162
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,579
back in the day one when NPK was

163
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,530
invented artificial manures etc etc they

164
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:45,120
realized that what was happening was we

165
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:48,809
were removing all of the great stuff

166
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,410
from the soil in fact this is why United

167
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:54,540
States manifest destiny was really all

168
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,220
about getting better soil because we

169
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,770
were removing all of the nutrients in

170
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,110
the soil not putting anything back that

171
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:03,839
only occurred when we came and started

172
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,370
taking stuff from the plants as they

173
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,469
continued to drop stuff they feed

174
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,329
themselves they continue to grow I like

175
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,360
to say nobody ever fertilizes the

176
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:15,060
Redwoods had to get that so yeah we

177
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,840
digress yeah cool thank you very much my

178
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,839
