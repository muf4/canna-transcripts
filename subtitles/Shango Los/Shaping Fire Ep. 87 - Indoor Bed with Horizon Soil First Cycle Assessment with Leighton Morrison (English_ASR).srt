2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,039
cultivating cannabis Under the Sun has

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,359
been my preference during the last 10

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,919
years my first years cultivating

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,640
cannabis it was my preference because I

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,399
absolutely believe that sun grown

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,839
cannabis has wider turpine and

8
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:25,518
cannabinoid profiles thus making it

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:28,278
excellent medicine that said I also know

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:30,320
Sun grown is leafier and living where I

11
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:34,000
live on Vashon Island in the Pacific

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,399
Northwest plants rarely finish outside

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,399
so outdoor plants may be superior in

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,759
many ways philosophically but in reality

15
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,920
where I live anything that takes more

16
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,519
than 50 days to bloom doesn't have a

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,359
chance to finish for those of you who

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,120
follow shaping fire you know that this

19
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,519
is one of the reasons I've become such a

20
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:55,358
proponent and supporter of autof flowers

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,239
I like that I can Harvest them fully

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,399
flowered in warm dry and sunny September

23
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:04,438
so about a year ago I decided I wanted

24
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,560
to try my hand at growing indoors it was

25
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,000
a struggle for me to decide because I

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,200
identify as a regeneratively minded

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,280
cannabis cultivator and struggled with

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,280
the idea of using electricity to power

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,079
my lights in the end I decided to buy an

30
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,079
exceptionally environmentally friendly

31
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:24,599
bios LED light and went forward growing

32
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:26,478
a 4x4 tent inside in hopes of growing my

33
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,879
own cannabis medicine with fully

34
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,719
finished flowers and the little tent

35
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,158
grow would also Act as a good

36
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:36,118
demonstration to teach from on Instagram

37
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:39,040
so I could help other patients I reached

38
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:41,399
out to soil biologist Leon Morrison and

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,640
asked him to guide me in setting up a

40
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:47,960
horizon style substrate as he outlined

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,840
in shaping Fire episode 54 on geology

42
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:53,199
and biomimicry he said sure and off I

43
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,880
went to try and build an indoor raised

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,039
bed using all of the regenerative and

45
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,280
living soil techniques I use every

46
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,200

fire living soil tent its mission to

49

78
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,680
him to set up an aquaculture at The

79
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,439

world-renowned biologist Dr Elaine Ingam

81
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,840
blending his aquaculture byproducts with

82
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,238
compost and worm castings to prove that

83
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,519
natural imputs could replace synthetics

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,799
in commercial cultivation Leighton

future cannabis project YouTube channel

95
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,119
one note both Leon and I lost loved ones

96
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,000
this week and this episode is a bit less

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,920
Jolly than most of the times that we're

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,120
together if we sound a bit off that's

99
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:02,399
why we're sad during today's episode we

100
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,719
will describe in detail the first cycle

101
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,000
of the shaping fire Horizon style indoor

102
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,318
raised bed during the first set we will

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,598
review how I set up the substrate

104
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:14,158
Horizons during the second set we will

105
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,839
discuss our soil tests the arrival of

106
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,879
the first pests and any risk of a

107
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,159
perched water table and then during the

108
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,918
third set we'll talk about ground covers

109
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,199
scrogging and growing mushrooms in the

110
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,240
substrate below the Canabis plants

111
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,720
welcome back to shaping fire

112
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,720
Leighton thanks Shango it's always a

113
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,280
pleasure to come back and and chop it up

114
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,360
with you right on and you know this is

115
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,159
kind of a different show right because

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,439
uh you know often when I have you on the

117
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,560
show to talk about something within your

118
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:45,439
expertise um you know I'm essentially

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,519
trying to draw out you know this this

120
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,519
this academic and practiced information

121
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,399
out of you but but today we're you know

122
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:56,159
you're here because you taught me you

123
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:58,239
know this this biomimicry style or what

124
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,880
people are call calling Horizon style

125
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,759
growing technique and um and I figured

126
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,918
if I was going to do a show where I kind

127
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,120
of did a debrief of how my first cycle

128
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,198
went then might as well have you here so

129
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,439
so thank you for both teaching me the

130
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,960
style and then coming back to help me

131
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,600
tell everybody what I did

132
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:19,719
wrong well thank you for uh being a

133
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:23,840
sacrifice sacrificial lamb today right

134
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,520
on all right so so you know the I want

135
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,560
to remind everybody before we get going

136
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,758
that the application of your strategy

137
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,560
can look a lot of different ways right

138
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,038
like you can plug in different soil

139
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,120
recipes into this model and it'll still

140
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:40,360
work great so so don't get hung up on my

141
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,240
own choices of specific inputs like for

142
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,680
example like you you can get nitrogen a

143
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,319
lot of different ways I personally have

144
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,840
had excellent success over the years

145
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,919
with dehydrated pigs blood that may not

146
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,719
be your preference though so don't get

147
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:57,318
hung up it doesn't matter like what your

148
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,639
inputs are to learn the substrate style

149
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,720
it's all about the division and the

150
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,759
percentages of clay silt sand organic

151
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,360
matter and that that's the Cornerstone

152
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,960
of this approach so like like during

153
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,919
this first set you're going to hear what

154
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:13,758
I use um but it may not be what you use

155
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,598
so so don't get too hung up on that um

156
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,840
so so let's start out by talking about

157
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:24,159
um uh how your um

158
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:29,079
biomimicry um Horizon style played out

159
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:34,280
in real terms for for my bed so I use a

160
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:39,240
grass Roots fabric pots 4x4 raised bed

161
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:42,758
in a 4x4 tent um in uh in the shaping

162
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:47,759
fire offices so so what that gives me is

163
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:51,919
an 18in soil depth with about you know 2

164
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,280
or three Ines of um hardwood matter on

165
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,719
top and we'll talk about that hardwood

166
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:59,918
matter uh later so so if you are working

167
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,160
in a container that's deeper than 18

168
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,519
Ines um your numbers are going to be a

169
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,639
little bit different than mine which is

170
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,318
why we're going to be giving you

171
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,400
percentages of these different areas so

172
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,520
so when we go through this remember

173
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:16,159
these numbers are based on my 18-in soil

174
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:18,439
depth from a Grassroots fabric pots 4x4

175
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,240
all right so with that said there are

176
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:24,800
there are three layers in a um Horizon

177
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,639
style bed the the top layer is the O

178
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:32,720
Horizon next down is the a horizon and

179
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:36,840
then under that is the E Horizon so so

180
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,680
if you take that 18 in the in in in in

181
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,038
Leighton style and by by the point L at

182
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,199
any point if I'm like saying this wrong

183
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,759
feel free to correct me well you did say

184
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,919
percentage and you really shouldn't you

185
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:51,080
should say fraction so basically the hor

186
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:54,240
horizonal soil system is based on a

187
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:58,038
seven-part system so your e Horizon is

188
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,360
17th your a horizon is 27th and your o

189
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:02,199
Horizon is 47th

190
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,879
so that's the easy way to break it up so

191
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,360
whatever your depth is divide it by

192
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:10,879
seven and and then you know use that as

193
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,960
a uh method to um building the the

194
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,599
proper depths fabulous so I took that

195
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:19,519
math and and Lon and I uh applied it to

196
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:22,759
the 18 in and so that ends up with an O

197
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:25,918
Horizon your top layer your o Horizon

198
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:30,038
for my bed is 10 in and so that's all

199
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:35,879
going to be organic matter and so um for

200
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:38,240
me I chose to use no till soil that from

201
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:42,439
pots that I've been using the last few

202
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:46,320
years and um and and and so it's it's

203
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:50,720
it's in quarters it's a quarter old soil

204
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:55,120
it's a quarter fish compost a quarter

205
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,278
pit moss and a quarter um Alliance soil

206
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,759
inoculant which which actually is a

207
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:05,120
product that um that lat makes which is

208
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:06,919
essentially a uh an incredibly living

209
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,278
soil would that be a fair thing to call

210
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:12,559
it well it's really just kind of um

211
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:16,039
organic matter that has been infused

212
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:17,919
with with fish biology and um soil

213
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:19,879
terrestrial biology you know it's just

214
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:24,240
basically I make this very biologically

215
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:29,039
Rich compost I strip it mechanically um

216
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,200
and add uh fish Brew uh bold flow um to

217
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,838
it as I'm stripping it so it once it

218
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,278
comes out of the stripping process then

219
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:38,560
I screen it out um to different um

220
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:41,320
coarseness and so the alliance is a very

221
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,000
coarse product so it's kind of like a

222
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,680
you know you fibrous compost but it's

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,120
incredibly biologically active so you

224
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,879
know if you want to get that from

225
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,078
Leighton you can and and it will

226
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,039
certainly help get your bed going but

227
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:58,278
theoretically if if you didn't want to

228
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,120
get something like that you could double

229
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:01,720
up on your

230
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,480
um you know your no till soil you're

231
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,480
bringing in from your outdoor pots and

232
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,039
then go with you know half soil a

233
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,000
quarter fish compost and a quarter pit

234
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:15,120
moss in my case because um I'm not a big

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
fan of using Pete Moss um because I

236
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,519
don't I don't I don't see it as being a

237
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,480
renewable resource and they destroy pit

238
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:26,000
bogs to get it so or Pete boogs rather

239
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,159
to get it so so I'm very happy with the

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,958
pit Moss which is made out of um uh uh

241
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:36,039
um uh organic uh paper and I find that

242
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,159
works really well so in my case I've got

243
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:42,679
a quarter my regen soil a quarter fish

244
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:44,919
compost a quarter pit moss and a quarter

245
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:49,439
of this uh super infused stuff from

246
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:51,278
Laton now let me ask you this um did you

247
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,399
get the grower grade or did you get the

248
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,480
cocoa

249
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,519
complete um of the pit Moss yeah I just

250
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,519
got this they have a few different

251
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,278
products yeah I just got this the uh I

252
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,839
forget actually the name of it probably

253
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:04,559
Growers but but but it's it's the strip

254
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,160
down stuff I got this stuff without any

255
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,719
added nutrition okay and so I wanted to

256
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:11,639
control that perfect great so so th

257
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,040
those are the major components and and

258
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,079
within that I also put my amendments

259
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,278
right um the Amendments like the

260
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:25,039
physical amount of them is so uh small

261
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:27,559
that it really doesn't um play a role in

262
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,719
the overall recipe as far as like like

263
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:30,958
how the soil is built the adding the

264
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,680
nutrition you know you could probably

265
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,439
hold it in you know in four hands right

266
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:39,759
so but for me I chose uh crushed oyster

267
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,560
shells uh Ali fish compost dehydrated

268
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:46,240
organic pigs blood of course dynamico

269
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:48,518
fungal inoculant uh pit moss and then uh

270
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,799
that supercharged supercharged soil

271
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:56,039
inoculant from Leighton so so so you

272
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:58,559
take that and you mix that all up and

273
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:04,199
that becomes what but what we're calling

274
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:06,879
here your organic matter um so so Leon

275
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,480
do you like how I describ that yeah no I

276
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,278
think you described it perfectly you

277
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,959
know it's it's basically you're building

278
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:14,838
a soiless medium or a super soil um you

279
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,638
know because you're adding the

280
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,560
Amendments we would tend to call that a

281
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,000
super soil over a soiless medium but

282
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,879
that's you know that's the bottom line

283
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,120
is you're you're you're still using a

284
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,600
traditional style of growing cannabis um

285
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,959
but you've also got those added benefits

286
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,120
of the e Horizon and the a horizon to

287
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,119
help mitigate moisture as well as

288
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,600
provide sand silt and Clay uh for the

289
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,039
organic or for the bio uh biology to

290
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,159
mine and and provide nutrient did you

291
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,078
intend to call this a soiless medium I

292
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:48,759
mean it's half soil um well no the top

293
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:52,359
the O Horizon is a traditional soiless

294
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:56,198
medium but isn't half of that like soil

295
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,360
like a quarter of it is my um my no till

296
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:01,399
soil from my pots and then another

297
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,639
quarter of it is the compost that you

298
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,320
make isn't doesn't that count as soil I

299
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,759
mean I always thought that soil less as

300
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,760
like quar and Pete and you know perlite

301
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,799
and all that stuff that actually isn't

302
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:17,039
soil correct and and you know I may have

303
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:21,120
misspoke because I don't really know

304
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:23,838
what your no till soil pot was like was

305
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,440
it Pete was it no it's none of that it

306
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:30,120
was it was like it was just um like

307
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,040
literally old soil that got originally

308
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,959
out of bags that was just like potting

309
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:38,879
soil so but then I I used it for five

310
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:41,119
years right so so it was it was like uh

311
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,559
bad soil gone good you know so it was

312
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,120
broken down yeah yeah totally so then

313
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,838
yes I would refer this to more as a soil

314
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,399
than a soil as medium although you do

315
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,399
have soil as medium components in it uh

316
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,000
yeah the pit Moss right correct and

317
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,720
compost because compost is not

318
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,120
soil eventually it'll break down to soil

319
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,160
but in in the beginning parts of the

320
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,519
composting process it's more of a

321
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,679
nutrient Rich uh material than it is per

322
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,320
se a soil but we can you know we don't

323
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,879
we don't need to get too crazy on the

324
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,440
finites all right so so that's that's

325
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:22,240
your top 10 in in when you're talking

326
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:25,040
about an 18in bed so so um so then your

327
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:29,799
next layer down is what's called your a

328
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:33,039
horizon and when using leighton's 7ths

329
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:36,278
model uh if you have an 18in bed this

330
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:41,480
next layer this a horizon is 5 in and

331
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:47,838
the a horizon is made up of uh 177% clay

332
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:51,519
133% silt 50% sand and then the last 20%

333
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:55,199
is another portion of the organic matter

334
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,560
mix that you made for the O Horizon so

335
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,240
when you're making the the organic

336
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:01,679
matter for your o Horizon you're going

337
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,039
to want to make you know enough to fill

338
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:08,359
up the O Horizon plus some extra to go

339
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:11,120
in the a horizon and then and then and

340
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,839
then at the end also I threw in a splash

341
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,440
of biochar I mean biochar is so potent

342
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,000
um you know I just like took a couple

343
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,240
handfuls and throw it threw it in there

344
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,159
so it was there but um you know it's um

345
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,639
it's such a small component of it one of

346
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:33,198
the crazy things about this is you know

347
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:36,360
since I was trying to make this bed as

348
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:39,240
regenerative as possible um with the

349
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,680
obvious uh exception of uh the fact that

350
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,759
it was indoors and I was using

351
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:46,559
electricity um I decided that I wanted

352
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:48,240
to Wildcraft all this stuff and um wow

353
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,638
depending on where you live your mileage

354
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,399
may vary trying to do that um the clay

355
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,000
was easy right as many of you know I

356
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,159
live on an island and then uh along the

357
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,879
outskirts of our Island along the

358
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:02,600
beaches um we have got all sorts of soil

359
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:04,919
erosion that is going into uh you know

360
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,040
the saltwater and so getting clay for me

361
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:08,799
was really easy I just I just went down

362
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,159
and there were big hunks of beautiful

363
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,599
clay that were just falling off the Clay

364
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:16,679
wall where you could see all the all the

365
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,920
layers of of Earth exposed from you know

366
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,799
the ocean water um eroding it so that

367
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,198
was that was great grabbing the clay was

368
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:27,439
easy heavy as hell but but easy to get

369
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,519
and then uh the sand was certainly easy

370
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,440
as well since I live on an island um I

371
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,240
could just collect some sand and when

372
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,120
you're doing only doing a 4x4 bed you're

373
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,440
hardly taking any you know it's like a

374
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,120
like 5 gallon bucket you know um the

375
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,000
hard part for me was this damn silt um

376
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,879
you know I I I understood from Leighton

377
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,519
that I'm I wanted to look for silt um

378
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:53,799
along uh running fresh water that was

379
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:56,240
heading towards um the salt water um

380
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,078
around the island and so I I looked at I

381
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,039
first I went to an estuary on the island

382
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:03,239
where the where the fresh water meets

383
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,519
the salt water and I grabbed a bunch of

384
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,279
that and I took it home and I gave it a

385
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:12,119
shake test in a mason jar and um and the

386
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,720
component of silt was very low Leon why

387
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:17,239
don't you explain how to do a uh a mason

388
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,318
jar Shake test for people who have never

389
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,400
done that sure it's it's a home or an at

390
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:27,720
home um textural test so basically you

391
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,679
fill a mason jar um 3/4 full of soil

392
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,480
then you add water till waterers just

393
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,240
above the top of the soil that you added

394
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,960
while still leaving an air space um then

395
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,120
you seal the lid Shake It Up set it down

396
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,720
and over the course of two days um

397
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:43,399
what'll happen is everything will settle

398
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,880
and the water will go clear and that's

399
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,400
the key you want that water to be clear

400
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,960
um and then you will see the layers the

401
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,280
first layer um the sand will settle out

402
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,360
the fastest um second the silt will

403
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,879
settle out and lastly the clay will

404
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,399
settle out and usually you'll get some

405
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,360
organic matter floating on the surface

406
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,519
of the water water or floating on just

407
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,719
on top of the clay layer so you

408
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,918
basically get sand so clay and organic

409
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,960
matter um ratios or percentages uh by

410
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,919
doing this um and so I I did this and

411
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,480
and and every time I took a sample it

412
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:17,520
was like almost all clay there was

413
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,279
hardly any silt and so so after I did

414
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,119
that and and was not getting a high

415
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,000
enough silt percentage where the the

416
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:26,599
fresh water was meeting the saltwater at

417
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
the Estuary I decided to work my way

418
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:32,399
backwards up that stream uh further up

419
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,798
so I'm like okay maybe instead of doing

420
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,038
Estuary maybe I should take it um from a

421
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:39,918
long stream right maybe maybe it'll be

422
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:41,599
more silt there and so I took another

423
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,880
sample there brought it home shook it up

424
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:47,719
let it sit for 2 days looked at it and

425
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,760
there was more silt but still not enough

426
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,000
where I thought that I was going to be

427
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:54,400
able to like divide it off to be able to

428
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,279
get 133% silt in my a horizon so I'm

429
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,798
like damn I still need more so then so

430
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:02,079
then I worked my way um up even further

431
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:04,879
fur um I I I was planning on going up as

432
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,759
far as a a freshwater Pond that was up

433
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,799
this stream but what I found was an

434
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:12,158
elbow in the Stream um where it was not

435
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:14,038
going straight downhill it came down and

436
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:18,200
it kind of like Jagged right and then it

437
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:22,119
continued down and in that elbow I found

438
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:26,798
silt so for whatever biomechanics re

439
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:28,879
reason that elbow held the silt better

440
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,440
than the other two places and when I

441
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,440
took it um you know it's it still wasn't

442
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,600
like 80% silt like I was hoping but it

443
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,038
was like 50% silt and that was like way

444
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:40,839
way better than anything else I had

445
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:44,158
gotten so I'm like fine we're just going

446
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:45,759
to call this good um and uh cuz it you

447
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:48,200
know it's always good to remember that

448
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,640
this while while we have goals we we

449
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,080
have we have benchmarks for we're trying

450
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,000
to hit um if if you can't hit the

451
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:57,480
benchmarks with what you have available

452
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,599
locally just freaking go for it and so I

453
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,240
did and um and and so that's where I

454
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,158
harvested um you know just a little bit

455
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,120
of silt because again this is only a 4x4

456
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:11,600
bed and I grabbed it and uh and then

457
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:14,678
added that as my 133% silt so I guess

458
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:18,959
technically in my math since I was using

459
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:23,679
material that was only 50% silt as my

460
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:26,840
133% silt I probably only have 7% silt

461
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,600
in my bed and um you know for better for

462
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:32,000
worse um and uh you know I didn't I

463
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:34,079
wasn't sure how to make up for that silt

464
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,599
and I don't think I did this right but I

465
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,519
actually tried to make up for some of

466
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:42,879
the silt by adding some volcanic aadama

467
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,319
clay from Japan that I had and and I'm

468
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,720
I'm not recommending you do that right

469
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,158
cuz bringing bringing clay from Japan

470
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,679
for this is like so environmentally a

471
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:53,799
bad idea um but I happen to already have

472
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,880
the stuff from when I was doing uh

473
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:58,119
aquariums back in the day and I'm all

474
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,360
like he this is a good use for it so um

475
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:04,000
so I put that in there so so before we

476
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:07,399
go on um is there any way that that

477
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,079
makes sense Leighton using aad volcanic

478
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,559
clay as a replacement for silt or is

479
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,359
that just like totally wrong no you know

480
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,798
there's

481
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:19,839
a technical challenge

482
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:23,158
to making a definitive difference

483
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:25,678
between silt and Clay um I try to stick

484
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:28,960
along the lines of that silt is organic

485
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,919
matter broken down uh about as far as it

486
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,679
can um without specialty um bacteria to

487
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:40,840
break it down further um Clay is more

488
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:44,278
like groundup rock um or ash from a

489
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:46,839
volcano so bottom line is though they're

490
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:49,440
the very very fine small particles that

491
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:52,240
have been pretty much broken down uh as

492
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,360
much as they can through natural

493
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,919
processes other than these really finite

494
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:00,599
special um bacteria that can continue to

495
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,278
break them down further um and make them

496
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:06,119
again uh plant available so that the

497
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:08,359
plant can uptake those minerals um and

498
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:11,399
then when the plant dies uh guess what

499
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:13,759
it goes back to silt so it gets

500
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,320
really uh complicated at that

501
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:19,679
microscopic level of what is what is a

502
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,319
clay playd what is a Sil particle um

503
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,278
traditional soil and

504
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:26,319
science has always measured these uh by

505
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:28,640
particle size and I think that's you

506
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,839
know again kind of archaic in this day

507
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,840
and age where we know that the clay

508
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,599
platelets are both positive and

509
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:39,399
negatively charged so that the top of

510
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:41,480
the clay platelet is is um positively

511
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,600
charged and the outer rim think of it as

512
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,480
a flying saucer the outer rim is

513
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:49,278
negatively charged so the negatively

514
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:52,720
charged Rim pulls positively charged

515
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:54,759
cations I and stores them so these are

516
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,759
nutrients um around the outside

517
00:22:54,759 --> 00:23:00,919
perimeter so silt doesn't do that um

518
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:03,240
silt is is generally negatively charged

519
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:06,159
um does not have a positive uh aspect

520
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:09,278
though it so and sand is is has no

521
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,880
charge so how do we Define these as

522
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:16,440
through particle size and not through um

523
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,400
characteristics of perhaps both weight

524
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,759
um and also um the ability to hold

525
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,759
certain nutrients so I you know again I

526
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,960
think that soil science has got to kind

527
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:29,119
of come up to speed with what we know as

528
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,640
far as um you know some of these more

529
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,918
advanced understandings of these

530
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,559
materials so it sounds to me that even

531
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,679
even though I used even though I used

532
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:40,678
that volcanic aadama clay like that's

533
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,480
cute and that filled up the place but it

534
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,759
really wasn't a silt replacement it was

535
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,200
just something else that probably helped

536
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,798
the bed and let me ask you a question

537
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,798
when you when you did your silt test

538
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:51,839
what was the other component was it clay

539
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,119
or was it

540
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,759
sand uh it was sand okay so so here

541
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,399
again you know you can use that

542
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,798
combination

543
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,919
um to understanding that okay of this

544
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:09,679
material I collected in the Stream uh

545
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:12,000
50% of it was sand 50% of it was silt so

546
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,440
now I just use more of that and don't

547
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,159
add any sand you see where I'm going

548
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,200
with this I do so that's you know again

549
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,080
you you have to do a little bit of math

550
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,480
and and apply some common sense but you

551
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:26,480
can get pretty close to these ratios

552
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:30,038
especially if you're using um this

553
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,120
textual uh at home test method to

554
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:35,278
determine exactly what your inputs are

555
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,038
and and then just kind of play with them

556
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:42,038
a little bit and and again I use the

557
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:44,398
ratio 17 clay 13 silt based on their

558
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:47,480
properties um so if you're off on your

559
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:49,599
ratios it's not the end of the world um

560
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,360
but again you know your goal is to try

561
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:55,038
to get as close as you can to that um

562
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:57,079
for biological processes so that you're

563
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,720
allowing the specific biology that

564
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,918
breaks clay down that does doesn't break

565
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,679
silt down and vice versa so you're just

566
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:07,480
providing all of these inputs for really

567
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:11,720
getting that advanced level of of uh

568
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:17,798
living um biology to have all of the

569
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:19,679
potential um tools and uh methods to to

570
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:21,200
function at high level and again you

571
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,200
know we haven't even started talking

572
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,080
about fungi uh because they also are

573
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,200
really important in breaking those

574
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:32,798
things down and pulling out uh nutrients

575
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,038
as well as you know providing bofilm to

576
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,679
make Aggregates out of them but we'll

577
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:40,640
get into that in a little bit so so the

578
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,640
last thing that's in this a horizon is

579
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,679
like that splash of biochar I just I

580
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,799
just put in three handfuls and um is

581
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:51,720
there a reason why the biochar goes in

582
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:54,519
the a horizon instead of in the top of

583
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,399
the O Horizon you know you can go in

584
00:25:54,519 --> 00:26:00,119
either place um generally I would

585
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:03,000
probably be more thrilled to throw it

586
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:05,278
into the O Horizon so that it's really

587
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,159
going to be like a little condominium

588
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,679
for for biology to set up shop in but in

589
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,880
the a horizon it's fine I mean the roots

590
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,679
are going to get down into the a anyway

591
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,120
so it's either way and and you know I

592
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,798
encourage people too to get real

593
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,439
creative with their Horizon there's no

594
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,918
reason why you can't put some you know

595
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,919
old hay or or some leaves that you've

596
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:26,038
collected or some Forest stuff in there

597
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,440
you know it's again diversity diversity

598
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:30,000
diversity I'm all about that and All

599
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,558
That Forest stuff is going to be

600
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,798
biologically active with local microbes

601
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:39,678
too so you know that's always an yeah

602
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:42,359
extra extra win okay so so so far we've

603
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,840
got the first top 10 in is the O Horizon

604
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:49,079
of organic matter and then next down is

605
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:51,519
the a horizon that is 5 in which is the

606
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,960
clay salt sand and a little bit more

607
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:57,319
organic matter and then on the bottom of

608
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:01,798
the bed the last 3 in is the E Horizon

609
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:05,079
which is sand and rocks and um and you

610
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:06,440
know you you could use bagged sand if

611
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:08,119
you know if you live in an urban

612
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,558
environment or something I'm lucky that

613
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:13,398
I just happened to live on an island and

614
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:17,678
so sand is everywhere and um and I loved

615
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:20,719
the idea that it came already living

616
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,919
with uh you know water-based imos that

617
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,720
also were oxygen tolerant since the the

618
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,038
the the water the tide goes up and down

619
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,480
right so um I grabbed a bit of sand from

620
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:35,278
the beach and then uh so so Leon why

621
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,960
don't you explain why you recommend the

622
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,960
Rocks should be

623
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,640
multicolored well every color um is

624
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,319
indicates a level of mineral um so the

625
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,120
different colors represent different

626
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:50,359
parts of the periodic table so the more

627
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:53,839
colors you get the more variety of those

628
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:57,119
minerals um are available for the micro

629
00:27:53,839 --> 00:28:00,119
Iz to mine um and you know something

630
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,278
else um that you said about bag sand

631
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:04,439
just be careful not to get play sand you

632
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:08,519
don't want the white fluffy stuff you

633
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:11,558
want coarse should be taupe color or

634
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:13,720
yellowish or brownish um that's the type

635
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:15,839
of sand you want not the white powdery

636
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,278
stuff that's important right on yeah

637
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,240
that white powdery stuff that's more

638
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,200
like overprocessed uh like white flour

639
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,519
you know right yeah you you want you

640
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,600
want chewy stuff and and I encourage

641
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:30,200
everybody to um take a 5 gallon bucket

642
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,639
and fill it half full of sand and then

643
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,720
take measurable gallons of water and

644
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,480
dump it into that bucket until you see

645
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,679
the water just going over the top of the

646
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,798
sand and then look at how many jugs you

647
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,278
used you will be blown away at how much

648
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:49,480
water coarse sand can actually

649
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:51,679
hold right on so so so so Leighton

650
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,240
explaining to me why having multicolored

651
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,880
rocks started me on a very difficult

652
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,440
process because I was down on the beach

653
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,559
and and I was token and I was looking at

654
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,038
all the colors of all the different

655
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:06,599
rocks on the beach and I'm like you know

656
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:09,319
I can I can collect these rocks and I'll

657
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:11,759
have like you know 15 different colors

658
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:14,639
this is going to be the the best bed

659
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:17,679
ever and so and so I started collecting

660
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,720
these rocks and um and then you know

661
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,679
Leighton had told me that uh if you can

662
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,480
break the Rocks open like crack the

663
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,080
Rocks because if you're if you're wild

664
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,240
crafting rocks um they have gotten SM

665
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:33,398
smooth on the outside and they don't

666
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,480
leech their minerals uh very very

667
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:37,000
conveniently and so he's all like you

668
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,558
know if you can hit it with a hammer and

669
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,880
break it open um you'll have the raw

670
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:44,759
interior so that the minerals can be

671
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,519
extracted well I was all excited about

672
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:50,640
that so so I started collecting rocks

673
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,480
and then I put them in a burlap bag and

674
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,880
then I took my sledgehammer to it to

675
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,640
break them open and then oh that was

676
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,559
great so I poured those into a 5 gallon

677
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,960
bucket and then I grabbed another

678
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,599
bag of burlap bag full and I hit that

679
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,798
with a sledgehammer and I did that for

680
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,439
like an hour got totally exhausted all

681
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:09,319
sore and I'm like all right I got my

682
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,240
damn rocks and I bring them in the house

683
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:13,079
and I put them in the bed and they were

684
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,919
like this little dribbling in the corner

685
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:19,199
of this big ass bed and I'm like oh [ __ ]

686
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:22,480
I have to do three in of the whole bed

687
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,558
of this and I'm like

688
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,558
no I'm like I'm I I do not have the

689
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:31,000
strength and the time and the life and

690
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:34,119
the muscle for this and so um what I

691
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,558
what I decided to do is um I did that

692
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:40,678
process like four more times so that

693
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:45,798
let's say like maybe an inch of the 3 in

694
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:50,840
was hand wildcrafted and hand broken up

695
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:53,679
rocks and then um then I went to the uh

696
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:55,278
the Landscaping store and and I bought

697
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,200
like I honestly don't know what the Rock

698
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,079
is anymore I forget but it was it was

699
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,440
just there like straight up gray

700
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:03,638
drainage rock that they use for

701
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,919
landscaping and I just poured bags of

702
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:12,319
that in there so um I say this a so you

703
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:14,360
can laugh at me but but but also to to

704
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:17,079
realize that you know we can only do

705
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:18,599
what we can do and uh when I realized

706
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:20,960
how much physical labor that was going

707
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:24,759
to be I just decided that you know what

708
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,079
having some natural rocks from the wild

709
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:28,558
environment that's great um but you know

710
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:31,000
what I'm going to have to to finish the

711
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,839
fill with what I can just go buy and

712
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,200
dump and that's what I did and I got

713
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:38,319
great results but um I just figured it

714
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,399
was worthwhile cuz if if you are going

715
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,918
to try to Wildcraft your

716
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,678
inputs you're bound to run into

717
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:47,278
something that's hard to find where you

718
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:49,600
live and just don't stress about it

719
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:52,200
right just just grab some stuff and move

720
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,959
on I agreed agreed there's no such thing

721
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,840
as perfection in nature so don't try to

722
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,360
be

723
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,839
perfect so it's really exciting when you

724
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:02,519
get to this next part and you um and you

725
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:04,720
get to put everything in the bed right

726
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:07,679
at this point in the process it was kind

727
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,240
of like um you know like uh you know if

728
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,720
you're if you're having you know a chef

729
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,839
night and you're making something

730
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,720
special at home you can use the the

731
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,839
French strategy of Mison place right

732
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,360
where you where you get all your

733
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,158
ingredients you cut everything up and

734
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:21,119
you put them in like little ramkin there

735
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,600
on your counter and then once all your

736
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,638
ingredients are set then you go and you

737
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,079
make your meal this is kind of Mison

738
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:30,079
place but for like soil science I went

739
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,119
ahead and I collected everything I got

740
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:36,038
everything ready and then the day came

741
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:38,479
that I made the bed now I want to put in

742
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,519
here something that I did not realize I

743
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,599
should have had until afterwards so I

744
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:46,599
don't have this in my bed but after I

745
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:51,119
made the bed leighton's all like oh you

746
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:53,319
should put a 4 in p 4 in PVC tube along

747
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,479
one of the corners so you can see how

748
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:57,158
much water's in the bottom and I'm like

749
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,278
what I'm not digging that corner back

750
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:03,639
out no and and so but but if I were to

751
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:07,000
do this again I would do this so so

752
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:09,599
Leighton would you explain in retrospect

753
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,679
why you know you recommended that I did

754
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:17,199
that because you couldn't get your hand

755
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:19,360
down between the liner and the tent so

756
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,399
there's no way for you to see other than

757
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:22,599
if you

758
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,638
overflow because you did put a liner

759
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:26,879
underneath there correct a rubber liner

760
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:28,759
yeah so the rubber liner serves as a way

761
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,720
to prevent

762
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:32,919
um any excess moisture from leaking out

763
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,120
around the bottom of your tent

764
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:39,278
unfortunately with the grassroot pots

765
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:41,319
they fit perfectly in a 4x4 tent with no

766
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:45,119
room for you to get your hand between

767
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:47,558
the liner the pot itself and the tent so

768
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,959
that's where I would suggest it to you

769
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:52,839
to to set that piece of pipe because and

770
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,919
it doesn't even have to be 4 in it can

771
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:58,519
be 1 in and you basically take two

772
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:01,399
styrofoam balls and a dowel and you drop

773
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:03,759
that styrofoam well you take a Styrofoam

774
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:06,319
ball put put the dowel into it so that

775
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:09,079
the ball stays on it and then take the

776
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:11,440
other one and slide it down till it's

777
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:13,320
about 8 or 10 inches above the bottom

778
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,079
one and then you just drop that whole

779
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,200
thing right into the tube and then as

780
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:18,839
you water that little dowel is going to

781
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,678
come up and you're going to be able to

782
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:25,078
determine exactly how much water is

783
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:27,200
being stored in your e Horizon and and

784
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,720
never flood it because you actually know

785
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:32,960
oh [ __ ] I've added 20 gallons to this

786
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:35,000
thing um it's not leaking out where's my

787
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,559
level and you'll see oh wow my level's

788
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,918
at 2 and half inches so it gives you a

789
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:42,199
way to monitor um just how much water is

790
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,158
actually being stored in your e or your

791
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,838
aquafer because that's basically what

792
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,039
you created is an

793
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,440
aquifer and I and I do recommend that

794
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:51,320
you do that and I'll and I'll use that

795
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,960
next time so I'm at the point now that

796
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:57,240
the only time that I can really check

797
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,760
how much water is in my e Horizon is

798
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:02,559
when I go to take a soil test and I dig

799
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,880
in deep I just go dig in extra deep all

800
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,799
the way down to my e Horizon and put my

801
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,000
hand there and see how much water is

802
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,200
there and you know that is not efficient

803
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,480
at all that's like you know testing my

804
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,078
water checking my water table once at

805
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,000
the beginning of a run and once at the

806
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,359
end of a run and twice a run you know

807
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,400
it's worked out for me so far but I do

808
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:26,519
wish that I had that that um that

809
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,960
vertical tube um just stuck in one of

810
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:30,838
the corners so I could check that out

811
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,720
yeah it just makes it easier yeah right

812
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:37,199
on so okay so uh so here we are at the

813
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:40,078
end of set one um we have gone through a

814
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:44,439
an explanation of the O Horizon the a

815
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,480
horizon the E Horizon both what I did

816
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,800
and more how to think about it right

817
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,240
because this is kind of an algorithm and

818
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,000
you know what you choose to use will

819
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:58,039
vary and the size of your bed is going

820
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
to be different so your um uh how your

821
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:00,920
how much you need to make to fill up

822
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,079
your

823
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,599
sevenths um is going to be different but

824
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,760
but more we're just trying to make sure

825
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,559
you understand the the the idea behind

826
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:14,960
it so you can play out this algorithm

827
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:16,440
for yourself so uh Leon anything else

828
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,880
you want to add to this before we go to

829
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,880
break no I think you covered it and and

830
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,960
again you know it's all about diversity

831
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,519
so you know colors are important

832
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,079
textures are important um using your

833
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,318
local resources is very important

834
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,680
um if you have to buy something you have

835
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:32,759
to buy something it's not the end of the

836
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:35,118
world but again you know you're looking

837
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,079
for uh if you're buying sand you want

838
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,318
very coarse sand so like masonary sand

839
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,039
um you know and as far as you know the

840
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:44,920
rocks and stuff one one piece I do want

841
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,519
to really kind of reiterate is that when

842
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,358
you're when you're putting those rocks

843
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:50,679
in there you don't have to fill all 2

844
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:53,078
and 1 half to three Ines in rock it can

845
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:55,399
be you know onethird rock and the rest

846
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:57,760
can be sand but make sure you wash the

847
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,240
sand down into the Rocks you don't want

848
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,800
to have any voids whatsoever if you have

849
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:03,358
voids then organic matter is going to

850
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,920
get down in there and it's going to go

851
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:09,838
Anor robic so the E Horizon really

852
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,838
functions as a what's called sand filter

853
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:15,639
so a sand filter is uh is generally used

854
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:18,159
in you know golf courses to move

855
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:22,118
groundwater around um they can also be

856
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:25,118
used in in zoos to separate um water

857
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:27,599
that has a lot of duck manure in it um

858
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,838
so it's it's a it's a technique that

859
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,480
that prevents organic matter or fine

860
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:35,480
particulate from getting down into that

861
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,039
um water layer so you're basically

862
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,318
separating fine particulate from water

863
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:43,119
itself and that's the beauty of the E is

864
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:44,838
that it acts as a as a sand filter and

865
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,440
and if you're interested in sand filters

866
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:48,880
I encourage you to go back to the

867
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,079
shaping Fire episode with um Steven

868
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,599
raisner about the water food web and how

869
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,599
to use aquaponics with living soil

870
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:59,400
systems we talk about that a little bit

871
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:00,838
there so oh and uh Leighton I wish you

872
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,639
would have told me I didn't have to have

873
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:05,838
three Ines of all rocks

874
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:07,679
man I think I missed that in my notes

875
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:09,759
when we originally talked so oh that's

876
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,919
all right it's all a learning process it

877
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,640
sure is so uh so we're going to take our

878
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,400
first short break and be right back you

879
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:18,889

[Music]

882
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:24,879
Morrison there are so many seed banks

883
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,318
nowadays that you really have options in

884
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,200
who to choose not only that if you pick

885
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:31,639
the wrong seed bank you could be in for

886
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:34,078
a really sketchy ride and that's only

887
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:35,719

00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,160
money but have no customer service I

908
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:27,159
invited hembra to advertise on shaping

better one of the reasons why no till

982
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,838
cannabis growing is so valued by Farmers

983
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,960
is because the mycelium networks in the

984
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:27,519
soil remain established from year to

985
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,199
year and we know these fungal networks

986
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:31,559
are essential because they are the

987
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:33,799
nutrient super highways that extend far

988
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:36,440
and wide in the substrate to feed your

989
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,200
plants the trouble with growing in New

990
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,079
Living soils or Blended cocoa substrates

991
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:43,960
is that it takes most of the plant's

992
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:47,160
life just to create these mycelium

993

highways dinico endom micral fungi

994

inoculant reduces that time and gets

995
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,079
your plant eating a wider array of

996
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:56,160
nutrients faster and it's three times

Los and my guest today is soil biologist

1033
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,679
Leighton Morrison so in the first set we

1034
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,480
talked um about

1035
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:34,598
um how the horizons are actually set up

1036
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:36,400
and the and the uh how much of each um

1037
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:41,200
in set two we're going to start talking

1038
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:43,599
about um how this uh soil act the uh

1039
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:46,199
some of the attributes that it showed

1040
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,559
and um right off the bat uh the first

1041
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:51,879
attribute that it showed was uh fungus

1042
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:55,160
knats and so um you know it's funny

1043
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:57,240
there is a u there's a Bro Science thing

1044
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:59,679
that you know is is actually you know

1045
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:03,078
pretty good in a lot of cases which is

1046
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:05,759
don't bring your soil from Outdoors

1047
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:08,400
indoors because when you bring in

1048
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,920
outdoor soil indoors you are bringing in

1049
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,160
a lot of variables you're bringing in

1050
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,440
potential pests you are prob you're all

1051
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:16,960
bringing in allies Predator allies as

1052
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,880
well but you're bringing in just like a

1053
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,960
lot of variables because um you don't

1054
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:26,838
know what's in it um but I really wanted

1055
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,280
to use my aged no till soil that I've

1056
00:45:26,838 --> 00:45:31,039
been have using in my pots and amending

1057
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,800
for like the last five or six years the

1058
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,159
soil is just absolutely freaking

1059
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,880
fantastic so I was clear that I was

1060
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:41,039
going to bring outdoor soil indoors and

1061
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,358
uh you know when I when I told that to a

1062
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:45,719
lot of my my peers they're like oh

1063
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,639
that's so dangerous and and yeah that it

1064
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:49,959
is dangerous but I was willing to go for

1065
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:53,879
it because I really wanted the living

1066
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:58,440
biology so um brought in the soil made

1067
00:45:53,880 --> 00:46:02,200
the O Horizon um put it on the uh the

1068
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:06,159
bed and then turned on my uh super sexy

1069
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:09,558
bios lighting LEDs and oh it took about

1070
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:14,879
24 hours for there to just be a sea of

1071
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:18,760
fungus gats they were everywhere and um

1072
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,400
you know it was a concern to see them

1073
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,359
but I also didn't freak the hell out I

1074
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:27,639
didn't have cannabis plants in there yet

1075
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:29,799
um I expected things to get really

1076
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:33,000
excited when I took them from a cold

1077
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,880
outdoor environment because this was um

1078
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,119
you know during a during the fall so a

1079
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,880
lot of the stuff had already gone to

1080
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:43,960
sleep or cyst it up and when I suddenly

1081
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:46,760
put it in a in a warm Full Spectrum 18

1082
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,440
hours of light environment like

1083
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:53,119
everything hatched all the all the bugs

1084
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,838
hatched their eggs or or similar and so

1085
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:59,240
I had all of these fungus snats and so

1086
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:01,599
I'm like okay um breathe and and let's

1087
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:04,479
call copert right um uh copert is where

1088
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,599
I get my beneficial insects from so I I

1089
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,119
called my uh copert rep and I said all

1090
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:10,359
right um I've got fungus gnats uh and a

1091
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,280
whole hell of a lot of them what can you

1092
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:15,719
send me and so after asking me a bunch

1093
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:21,960
of questions and stuff they decided on

1094
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:24,679
the um uh stro lops uh cius and um for

1095

00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:39,280
surface as evenly as you possibly can

1127
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,639

rejuvenate it's just a uh it's another

1130
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,559
one of the products uh that I make and

1131
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,960
it's just basically like an instant

1132
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:52,480
compost tea it's it's very very fine

1133
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,119
particulate that when you add to water

1134
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,240
just makes the water look you know dirty

1135
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,240
like chocolate it's got a lot of

1136
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:02,439
turbidity in it so um it's just an

1137
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:06,000
simple easy way to uh instantly make a

1138
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:08,079
very biologically diverse tea uh for

1139
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,280
situations like

1140
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:14,240
this and then you called me back and

1141
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,240
said what is this sorcery that you

1142
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:21,480
did it is true because like I I took I

1143
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:24,960
took the rejuvenate I added water I

1144
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:29,000
shook it up I evenly um applied it

1145
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:31,798
across the soil and and not 36 hours

1146
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,440
later there wasn't a single fungus KN

1147
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:37,199
none and I went from having like all the

1148
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,720
fungus knats in the world to having none

1149
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:42,199
of the fungus snats and I did and I

1150
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:45,239
actually did say what is this sorcery

1151
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:47,679
because something had changed and and at

1152
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:50,558
first I thought that perhaps there was

1153
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:54,039
something costic in it somehow to fungus

1154
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:57,920
knats and and um and I had done

1155
00:49:54,039 --> 00:50:00,079
something to the fungus like some of

1156
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,639
pesticide but why did all the fungus

1157
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:07,160
Nets actually go away well you you

1158
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:10,759
created a very um

1159
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:13,239
aggressive uh environment that that they

1160
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,559
became a food source very very quickly

1161
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:18,159
and you know in that Ru you're going to

1162
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:21,160
have all different types of nematodes um

1163
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:23,279
which is probably the best way to

1164
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:25,440
eradicate fungus snats not the not the

1165
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,079
little predatory mites um although they

1166
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,960
do help um the nematodes will work right

1167
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,880
in the soil and and just eat the eggs as

1168
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,000
fast as they can lay them so that's

1169
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,599
another little trick that um if you can

1170
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,960
get really good biocomplete or

1171
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:44,039
biologically Rich compost uh and you

1172
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:48,119
make a tea you're going to um create a a

1173
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:51,400
much more balanced environment where one

1174
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:54,640
thing can't outrun um the others uh it's

1175
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:57,160
just too competitive so so Leon you know

1176
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:59,118
uh I love your products no doubt um um

1177
00:50:57,159 --> 00:51:00,719
um but that being said you know not

1178
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,880
everybody's not is going to want to

1179
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:06,798
contact you and get your stuff so so I

1180
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:10,440
asked this question if somebody is is is

1181
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:14,920
the secret to it to just have really

1182
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:19,240
well finished biologically active

1183
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:23,680
compost and then make an

1184
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:25,959
unrated uh compost tea extract will that

1185
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:28,598
work in most cases even if it's not your

1186
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:33,119
product oh absolutely and and it goes

1187
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:36,079
back to how to make compost and so

1188
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,440
there's a lot of recipes out there but I

1189
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,760
like the real simple approach which is

1190
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,400
basically collect greens and Browns off

1191
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:46,240
your own property um I don't add manures

1192
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:49,160
I don't hit temperature um if it goes if

1193
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:51,199
it hits 115 I flip it because anytime

1194
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:53,920
you get over 120 you're losing

1195
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:56,679
biodiversity if you hit 130 you are in

1196
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,200
what's called a thermophilic uh process

1197
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:00,598
in other words everything is getting

1198
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:03,639
cooked off and when you get to that

1199
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:05,720
level it's going to take year if not two

1200
00:52:03,639 --> 00:52:09,118
for all that biology to naturally come

1201
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:11,879
back in um so a quick way to do this is

1202
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,920
to never let it get over 115 and you and

1203
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,119
that's fine as long as you're just using

1204
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,639
plants if you start playing with manur

1205
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:21,160
you're going to have problems so um

1206
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:24,039
basically I make vegan compost um

1207
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:27,558
collecting you know 1/3 greens one uh

1208
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:30,558
2/3 Browns and I make the the Browns and

1209
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:32,319
greens as diverse as I possibly can

1210
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:37,240
basically in the greens you're looking

1211
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:39,759
for endophytic biology so bio bio uh

1212
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:42,239
biology that lives inside the tissue of

1213
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:45,280
the plant um we know for sure that that

1214
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:49,039
biology can come out of that plant um

1215
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:52,079
and into your compost pile um if you put

1216
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:53,880
enough um enough of them in there and

1217
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,599
and again you're looking for diversity

1218
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,519
so I I'm picking little green shoots off

1219
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:01,160
all the plants that I can find and all

1220
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:04,039
different types and and flowers and and

1221
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:05,679
shrubs and you name it um and then the

1222
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:07,199
Browns is the same I'm looking for

1223
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:09,279
different types of wood chips different

1224
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:12,598
types of brown leaves different types of

1225
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,359
dead stocks of plants um and and using

1226
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:16,640
all of that to make this stuff and then

1227
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:18,719
it's just a matter of soaking it down

1228
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:20,199
like apply as much water as you possibly

1229
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,358
can till it's just running out of the

1230
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:25,078
bottom of it and then put a thermometer

1231
00:53:22,358 --> 00:53:27,400
in it watch and usually within 24 hours

1232
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:30,359
if you've Blended the greens and Browns

1233
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:33,599
appropriate within 24 48 hours you're

1234
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:37,239
going to see it heat up and if you do

1235
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:39,359
that and and then it goes to say 115 and

1236
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:41,959
then starts to cool

1237
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:44,358
off you have it all you got to do is

1238
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:47,440
take that stuff put it in a compound a 5

1239
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:50,880
gallon bucket with a lowspeed drill uh

1240
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:53,960
like a plaster or paint mixer and just

1241
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,000
you know throw you know a gallon of the

1242
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,079
compost in there uh fill it fill the

1243
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,960
rest you know half full of water and

1244
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:03,200
then blend it and then pour it on you

1245
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,679
you've just released all that biology so

1246
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:07,118
there's a trick for you to make your own

1247
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:11,679
inoculant at home fantastic dude thank

1248
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:14,838
you so in the end um the sorcery of

1249
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:18,558
getting rid of this fungus Nets was a um

1250
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:21,960
a wellmade compost that was filled with

1251
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:25,559
nematodes and other

1252
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:28,559
microbiology and when I put it um uh

1253
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:31,680
over the top of the soil suddenly there

1254
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:34,280
were all these predators of fungus Gat

1255
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:36,679
larvae and so you know their life cycle

1256
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,920
is very short and so it took a very

1257
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:41,679
short period of time for all of those

1258
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:44,720
little hungry micro microbiologist in

1259
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:48,279
the compost to go and eat the next uh

1260
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:52,439
couple generations of uh fungus snats

1261
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,440
and Zim Zam that's it

1262
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:59,159
sorcery all right thanks for explaining

1263
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:01,598
that so yeah yeah so moving on um uh

1264
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:03,719
I I don't know that you know a lot of

1265
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,760
times when I ask ask you questions I'm

1266
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:06,919
setting you up stuff that I actually

1267
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,440
understand you know and you know I'm

1268
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,960
asking you the question but I'm kind of

1269
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:13,280
asking it for the audience this is one

1270
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,159
that I'm going to be asking for me too

1271
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:21,839
cuz I I actually don't know your answer

1272
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:24,798
um when we explained um this uh whole

1273
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:27,880
process the the philosophy behind it in

1274
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:31,798
um uh the biome mimicry shaping Fire

1275
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:33,960
episode number 54 and then with all of

1276
00:55:31,798 --> 00:55:38,519
the uh companion materials that I was

1277
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:41,960
posting to Instagram of my own bed um

1278
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:44,199
some folks were were um commenting some

1279
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,519
concern that this was not going to work

1280
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:48,679
right that this was going to end up in a

1281
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:50,759
perched water table and um and it was

1282
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:52,598
interesting cuz like you know some of

1283
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,240
the some of the angry boys were all

1284
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:56,599
getting themselves all bent out of shape

1285
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,439
about it um whereas other people were

1286
00:55:56,599 --> 00:56:02,760
having like you know adult conversations

1287
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:05,280
and and they were all interesting and um

1288
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,720
and and in the end when I T when I came

1289
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,880
back to you and I said dude you know

1290
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:12,399
people are arguing on Instagram about

1291
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,720
this perched water table um you know is

1292
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,920
this going to be a problem and you're

1293
00:56:13,719 --> 00:56:17,838
like no no no no no this is a this is a

1294
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,079
misunderstanding and then you explained

1295
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:24,199
it to me and and and I still do not

1296
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:26,039
understand it so so I'm I'm I'm looking

1297
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:26,919
forward to hearing you explain it again

1298
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:29,480
so

1299
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,838
for for for those people who were con a

1300
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:34,679
either concerned about it creating a

1301
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:37,400
perched water table or B people who want

1302
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:40,440
to give this a try and their friends may

1303
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:42,880
give them hassle about a perched water

1304
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:45,000
table will you go through it uh in

1305
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,318
simple terms so that we can all

1306
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,679
understand why why this does not apply

1307
00:56:47,318 --> 00:56:51,519
to this particular Horizon style growing

1308
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:53,798
system that you've shared with us yeah

1309
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:58,000
absolutely Shango

1310
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:59,679
so I think it was in the 60s um soil

1311
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,760
Engineers were trying to figure out what

1312
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:06,879
the best way to build a high performance

1313
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:10,799
sports turf uh for both you know

1314
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:13,318
football baseball golf you name it and

1315
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:15,318
they actually created the perched water

1316
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:18,759
table and what it was was basically they

1317
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:22,000
put a liner down um and put a layer of

1318
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:25,160
gravel and then on top of that compacted

1319
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,440
sand down and then they rolled out their

1320
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:31,519
sod the reason they did this was because

1321
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:34,358
they wanted to have a surface like a

1322
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:36,318
putting green that you could walk across

1323
00:57:34,358 --> 00:57:38,440
but you could still roll a ball

1324
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:42,239
perfectly without having it bounce all

1325
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:45,679
over the place and also you needed to be

1326
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:47,399
able to walk across this um in case of a

1327
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:49,558
you know a heavy rain event without it

1328
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:52,400
turning to muck and

1329
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:55,880
so there's very very little organic

1330
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:59,039
matter and hardly any uh silt or clay in

1331
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:02,559
the types of uh high performance sports

1332
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:07,440
turf um so there's not a lot of of

1333
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:10,160
ability to store water or to um and an

1334
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,920
ability to get rid of it just as fast so

1335
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:13,838
goes back to that filling a bucket up

1336
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,318
with sand and and again I encourage

1337
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:19,480
people to do that and notice how much

1338
00:58:15,318 --> 00:58:21,239
water comes in it holds um and the other

1339
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,440
side of this if you take the bucket and

1340
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:25,838
cut the bottom out and then put it

1341
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,358
directly on soil and then fill the

1342
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:29,639
bucket get you know half full of sand

1343
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:31,960
and then add water come back a couple

1344
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:35,159
days later and that sand is still wet so

1345
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:39,079
it shows you how much um capillary

1346
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:40,920
action uh wicking that the sand can do

1347
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:42,440
so somewhere along the line some

1348
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:46,680
horticulturist

1349
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:49,240
or uh I don't know plant um

1350
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:51,919
Gardener um was talking about whether to

1351
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:56,118
put gravel or shards of clay in the

1352
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:59,318
bottom of their pot and somehow confus

1353
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:02,400
used the perched water table with with

1354
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:04,920
what happens in soilless mediums or

1355
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,039
potting mixes um in that environment and

1356
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,240
then that goes back to why I came up

1357
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:10,520
with the horizonal system for the

1358
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:13,159
Cannabis industry in the first place was

1359
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:15,838
because when you're using a potting mix

1360
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:17,598
the bottom is going to go Anor robic and

1361
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:20,078
the top is going to be hydrophobic and

1362
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:23,160
because it's a low tension soil the

1363
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:26,680
capillary action and the ability to Wick

1364
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:28,838
is not really there so uh

1365
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:30,960
that's that's the misnomer that's the

1366
00:59:28,838 --> 00:59:33,400
problem is that you know again somewhere

1367
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,639
along the line somebody said oh well if

1368
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,680
I throw gravel in the bottom of my pot

1369
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:40,000
that'll help me from from getting this

1370
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:42,078
anerobic environment and use the word

1371
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,679
perched water table when perched water

1372
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,839
table has nothing to do with potting

1373
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:49,558
soil it's really talking about how to

1374
00:59:46,838 --> 00:59:52,599
make a high- performance sports turf and

1375
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:56,119
again so when you're comparing a pot

1376
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:59,039
full of potting mix to a horizonal soil

1377
00:59:56,119 --> 01:00:01,280
system that's like looking at a tomato

1378
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:04,720
versus a cantaloupe that they're not

1379
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:08,039
even close so you know again do your

1380
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:10,279
homework um really read up on on where

1381
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:13,240
perched soil t uh perched water tables

1382
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:15,440
come from uh it was not from the

1383
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:17,479
Horticultural industry or the or the

1384
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:20,119
gardening industry um that's just

1385
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,798
somewhere someone along the line got

1386
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:23,760
took one term and applied it to

1387
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:26,119
something that's completely different I

1388
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,680
want to ask you about the you said that

1389
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:33,039
in in when people don't use an e Horizon

1390
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:36,719
at the bottom with sand and rocks um and

1391
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:40,000
and they're using um top to bottom a uh

1392
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:43,000
you know a soil um blend of some sort

1393
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,838
that the bottom of the of the container

1394
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,039
is going to go Anor robic and and is the

1395
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:50,719
idea that um the reason why it's going

1396
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:53,400
to go anerobic is because you've

1397
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:56,318
essentially got a pot that's entirely o

1398
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,720
Horizon there isn't O A and E Horizon

1399
01:00:56,318 --> 01:01:02,119
it's all just o rizon it's all organic

1400
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:04,959
matter and so when you water it um you

1401
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:06,599
know the water will go through and

1402
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,079
certainly there will be some mobility of

1403
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:11,640
water but really that water is going to

1404
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:14,760
collect at the bottom just like it does

1405
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:19,759
in any biology with a water table and

1406
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:22,440
and since you've got sitting water in in

1407
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,960
organic matter it just kind of rots

1408
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,358
which is why since we know this is how

1409
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:30,920
water

1410
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:34,000
performs in in in a horizon style living

1411
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:36,440
soil container we put sand and rocks at

1412
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,039
the bottom because they can hold the

1413
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:41,240
water from your watering they can hold

1414
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:43,400
the water without rotting is that the

1415
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:46,199
right idea correct correct and the a

1416
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:49,480
horizon will help because it's not low

1417
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:52,519
tension um it's actually hi tension soil

1418
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:55,358
um it will help uh to pull the water out

1419
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:56,440
of the Horizon and move it up into the O

1420
01:01:55,358 --> 01:02:01,078
Horizon

1421
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:03,760
as the top dries out and pulls the water

1422
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:05,278
up and so will you talk a little bit

1423
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:09,520
about that would you talk a little bit

1424
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:11,519
about water Mobility um we talked about

1425
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:14,759
on before you do that um we talked about

1426
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:17,440
this at length in the water and watering

1427
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,680
episode we did so if the idea of how to

1428
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,920
water your plants and how how to

1429
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:24,399
understand how water uh moves around in

1430
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,318
the container if you're like really

1431
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,240
nerding out about this go back to the

1432
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:30,838
shaping Fire episode with Leighton

1433
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:33,000
called water and watering because we go

1434
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:34,400
at this for like a half hour but for

1435
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,400
those of us who are you know just

1436
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,760
interested in indoor growing and and

1437
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:43,440
hearing this debrief on this on this

1438
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:43,440
regenerative tent please continue

1439
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:51,358
Leon so so water does a couple things

1440
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:55,400
right so you look at your um soiless

1441
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:58,759
medium your your compost your um pet or

1442
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:00,599
pit or um you know what whatever you're

1443
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:03,039
adding in there and you're going to get

1444
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:06,318
what's called fines so fines are really

1445
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:08,640
small particulate that when the water

1446
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:11,798
hits them the water will actually move

1447
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:14,598
them down in in the pot due to

1448
01:03:11,798 --> 01:03:17,358
gravitational forces so as all those

1449
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:19,519
fines move down to the bottom of the pot

1450
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:22,038
you end up making a swamp at the bottom

1451
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:24,759
of your pot um so now all of that water

1452
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:26,799
is being held by those fines um because

1453
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,799
they are high tension

1454
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:31,000
um whereas the rest of the fibers are

1455
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:32,880
more low tension and therefore you have

1456
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,920
more Iration you have the ability for

1457
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,880
roots to really push through that stuff

1458
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:40,559
very e easily which is why that's used

1459
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:42,559
to grow cannabis uh it was traditionally

1460
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,680
used and still is used to grow cannabis

1461
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:47,000
to this day um because it has that

1462
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:49,679
ability for if you feed the plant the

1463
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,920
roots are going to go crazy uh easily

1464
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:53,440
expand and and obviously you're going to

1465
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,159
see the effect at the top where the

1466
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,880
plant comes out of the ground so that

1467
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:02,679
being said that's why um you know these

1468
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:05,240
soiless mediums or super soils will have

1469
01:04:02,679 --> 01:04:07,000
that issue is that as you water you

1470
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:08,838
moving all the fines to the bottom where

1471
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,838
they're going to collect and and Compact

1472
01:04:08,838 --> 01:04:14,278
and and store water whereas with the

1473
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:16,199
horizontal system your sand filter will

1474
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:20,079
prevent any fines from getting down

1475
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:22,879
there um and will if your fines do move

1476
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:25,720
down from your o Horizon they're just

1477
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,798
going to naturally blend in with the a

1478
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:32,078
Horizon because it too is preventing

1479
01:04:27,798 --> 01:04:34,119
that easy uh ability for those fines to

1480
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,400
migrate through the soil system you know

1481
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:38,079
that's that's always been an issue in in

1482
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:41,000
engineering soils which I used to do

1483
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:43,640
quite a bit of well I still do um was

1484
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,358
preventing that fines from moving down

1485
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:48,159
and collecting um and then creating what

1486
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:51,798
would be considered uh you know an

1487
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:53,920
impervious surface or or layer where the

1488
01:04:51,798 --> 01:04:56,239
water can no longer move down it has to

1489
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,400
start moving laterally

1490
01:04:56,239 --> 01:05:01,399
um or horizontally and that's that again

1491
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:03,079
is is causing all kinds of problems um

1492
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:06,079
you really want everything to just move

1493
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:08,480
through and again that's why this system

1494
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,960
works so well is because it it functions

1495
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,199
both in ability to store water prevent

1496
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:16,119
it from going in Aerobic um while

1497
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:19,679
preventing the overall soil system from

1498
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:20,640
collapsing or or causing these um layers

1499
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:24,358
to build

1500
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,798
up fantastic thank you for that yeah so

1501
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:29,159
moving right along let's um let's let's

1502
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:31,440
move to start talking about soil tests

1503
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:33,679
now Leon so grab your soil test there so

1504
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,039
I got a couple things to say before we

1505
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,960
move into this

1506
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:40,079
topic so we're going to we're going to

1507
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,760
talk about soil tests for about I don't

1508
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,599
know the next 10 minutes or so probably

1509
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,359
end up being 15 but but this is going to

1510
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:48,278
be the last thing that we talk about

1511
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:50,639
here in set two so if we start talking

1512
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:53,318
about the soil tests and your eyes start

1513
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:55,078
to glaze over and uh don't don't just

1514
01:05:53,318 --> 01:05:56,759
leave the show cuz set three is really

1515
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:59,960
great uh set three we're going to be

1516
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:03,720
talking about um uh cover crops um how

1517
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:05,599
and how often to water scrogging and and

1518
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:07,159
mushrooms and companion plants right so

1519
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:09,119
third set's going to be really great but

1520
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:12,598
a lot of people um just are not

1521
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:15,760
interested with the details from from uh

1522
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:18,079
a soil report so so if we are about to

1523
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,760
lose you don't go anywhere just skip

1524
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,000
ahead to set three and and start

1525
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,079
listening again now for those of you who

1526
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,599
are interested in the soil test this is

1527
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:29,200
what we're going to do um uh if you want

1528
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:32,640
to see the soil test that Leon and I are

1529
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:35,558
talking about um you can find it on the

1530
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:38,920
um the page for this episode uh at

1531
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:40,119
shaping fire.com um that's easy uh and

1532
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,159
and then you know you could you could

1533
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:44,720
hit pause right now and go get that and

1534
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:46,920
then and then play along with us at home

1535
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:48,558
um or you can look at it afterwards but

1536
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:53,639
but just to be clear we're not going to

1537
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:56,559
go way in depth into the soil report um

1538
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:59,440
uh this is not a show about soil reports

1539
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:02,720
um but but Leighton is going to give his

1540
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,559
uh overview of it and and mention what

1541
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:06,759
stands out for him so we're going to

1542
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,880
kind of do this like cursory thing the

1543
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:12,119
goal of this is for us to not only

1544
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:15,200
encourage you to get soil tests um I

1545
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:17,119
really like Logan Labs um uh they are

1546
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:18,598
who I have used they are not a sponsor

1547
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,400
of the show and I don't get any money

1548
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:22,798
from them it's just who Leighton

1549
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,400
recommended uh back last year and I used

1550
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:26,318
them and they've been great so anyway if

1551
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,720
you're looking for a lab Logan lab is

1552
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:31,400
great um uh but we're going to this is

1553
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:35,759
all to inform a discussion we're going

1554
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:38,278
to have about um the beginning soil test

1555
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,960
and the ending soil test and how to

1556
01:07:38,278 --> 01:07:44,000
compare them all right so with that and

1557
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,559
with the soil report in hand um late in

1558
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,440
year you've got it in your hand now and

1559
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:50,640
so we're looking at the column uh that's

1560
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:54,880
labeled start so so what this is a test

1561
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:56,038
of is the test of the the bed after I

1562
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,519
built it

1563
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:01,079
and after I had been watering it for 3

1564
01:07:58,519 --> 01:08:03,239
weeks um just by itself so that

1565
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:05,559
everything the biology could start to

1566
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:09,959
get accustomed to this you know being

1567
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:13,160
indoors being in Horizon level um uh you

1568
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:15,679
know you know being under lights and and

1569
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:18,960
so uh so the why don't you explain to us

1570
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:21,519
what you see in uh soil test one which

1571
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:25,000
is essentially the before I grew

1572
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:27,279
cannabis in it test sure so um usually

1573
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,479
what I'll do is I'll start with ph um

1574
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:32,000
you're 6'4 that's you know fine that's

1575
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:36,000
not a big issue um then I'll bounce up

1576
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,039
to um total C uh exchange capacity which

1577
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,158
we would call

1578
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,719
C um here you're in the high 20s or mid

1579
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:44,000
20s which is

1580
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:45,960
fantastic um then we bounce down to

1581
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,719
organic matter we have a very high

1582
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:52,079
organic matter content 40.

1583
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:55,480
42% which is fantastic um and then I'll

1584
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:59,039
start looking down at um what's called

1585
01:08:55,479 --> 01:09:01,639
your um Trace Elements which are very

1586
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:03,039
very important um everything seems to be

1587
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:06,279
pretty much in range your iron's a

1588
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:07,640
little high no big deal um aluminum's a

1589
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:09,520
little high but again that's not going

1590
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:12,520
to be a problem unless you get into a

1591
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:15,239
low PH situation I'm look at your

1592
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:17,799
nitrates 356 that means there's a

1593
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:20,039
tremendous amount of natural organic n

1594
01:09:17,798 --> 01:09:22,719
available in this soil um that the

1595
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:25,838
biology can break down and release uh as

1596
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:28,119
a plant food um so that was all pretty

1597
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:30,479
good U then I'll bounce over to What's

1598
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:33,838
called the saturated Pace test which is

1599
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:36,559
probably one of the most important um

1600
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:39,359
aspects of looking at the soil and its

1601
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:41,798
ability to function so if you look down

1602
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:44,759
under percent you'll see calcium

1603
01:09:41,798 --> 01:09:46,759
magnesium potassium and sodium right so

1604
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:51,079
generally speaking that that ratio

1605
01:09:46,759 --> 01:09:55,679
should be calcium 75 magnesium 17

1606
01:09:51,079 --> 01:09:57,119
potassium 8 sodium zero um in this case

1607
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,920
you have low

1608
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:02,719
calcium um your magnesium is way too

1609
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:05,239
high and your potassium is a little hot

1610
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:08,560
um but look at your sodium 12 um so

1611
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:10,799
you're losing a lot of potential because

1612
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:14,000
that sodium is stuck on that cation

1613
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,840
exchange site instead of those primary

1614
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,640
minerals and we can talk a little bit

1615
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:21,960
more about where to get some of these uh

1616
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:25,360
wonderful new organic um products that

1617
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:28,198
are basically 4% calcium so if you have

1618
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:30,839
calcium and you add it you will bump

1619
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:34,158
potassium and sodium off the exchange

1620
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:36,520
site um uh calcium is is what we call a

1621
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:38,879
double bond so it has two positive

1622
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:41,480
charges and potassium and sodium only

1623
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,520
have one magnesium has two as well so

1624
01:10:41,479 --> 01:10:45,319
you have to be careful about Cal Mag

1625
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,520
it's so funny I was about to say I'm

1626
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:48,279
like it's so funny you're telling me I

1627
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:50,239
need to bump my calcium in my magnesium

1628
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:52,880
I'm like oh Jesus is the actual solution

1629
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:55,639
to this more cow

1630
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,359
mag cuz we all know I mean that that the

1631
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,280
joke right yeah right I know more

1632
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:00,719
cowbell right that was that was

1633
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:02,880
everybody in the Cannabis industry

1634
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,439
laughs about that because it's it's that

1635
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,199
was what people did was they just

1636
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:08,759
pounded it with freaking cow mag um and

1637
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:10,519
in this case if you put any more

1638
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,679
magnesium on here you're going to cause

1639
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:14,400
way more problems so you really just

1640
01:11:12,679 --> 01:11:16,600
want pure calcium and then you're going

1641
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:19,799
to let the plant work through the mag

1642
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:21,560
high magnesium and by the end of the Run

1643
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,079
um you'll see that that magnesium came

1644
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:27,360
down a little bit um and your calcium

1645
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:29,679
actually went up in end end1 report but

1646
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:30,839
anyway so that those are the those are

1647
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,359
the things and then underneath the

1648
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:35,319
percent I'm again looking at trace

1649
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:38,000
minerals um Trace elements so Trace

1650
01:11:35,319 --> 01:11:42,359
elements and um are are really really

1651
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:45,679
important for some of the finite plant

1652
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:49,639
processes so you know its ability to

1653
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:52,199
fight disease uh to accept sunlight um

1654
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:54,000
the ability to push nitrogen and calcium

1655
01:11:52,198 --> 01:11:55,759
through its whole system you know

1656
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,719
maldium is one of those really really

1657
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:01,600
important ones so again you know looking

1658
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:03,760
at at the the start um you know

1659
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,520
everything looked okay uh I don't see

1660
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:08,320
you know anything that really jumps out

1661
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,480
and scares me um toward the end of the

1662
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:13,319
Run um all of a sudden now we're we've

1663
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:15,158
lost uh a lot of nutrients so we'll

1664
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:17,840
we'll talk about that a little bit more

1665
01:12:15,158 --> 01:12:20,279
as things uh go forward no let's let's

1666
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,159
let's move right to that right now so so

1667
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:25,960
so you were looking at the start and so

1668
01:12:23,158 --> 01:12:28,079
I had a pretty good start I had I had a

1669
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:30,039
nice variety of nutrients and I was

1670
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:33,960
really happy with all the natural

1671
01:12:30,039 --> 01:12:35,880
organic matter um um that we had so so

1672
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:39,000
then you know I go and I do the run

1673
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:40,960
right I grew uh five plants in that t in

1674
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,920
that uh tent which we'll talk more about

1675
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:48,039
in um the next set but I grew I grew uh

1676
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:51,760
five plants um they uh they vegged for

1677
01:12:48,039 --> 01:12:54,560
um uh like four and a half weeks or so

1678
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:57,880
uh I did the flip um they and then I

1679
01:12:54,560 --> 01:13:02,600
grew uh varieties that were ready around

1680
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:05,319
week nine took nine weeks and so uh so

1681
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:07,840
here we were at the end I harvest and

1682
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:11,359
then I take another soil sample because

1683
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:14,000
I wanted to learn um how much nutrition

1684
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:17,799
um I should expect plants to use and I

1685
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:20,719
was also um planning on uh re amending

1686
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:23,520
before my next cycle so Leighton let's

1687
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:26,639
go through this again um what do you see

1688
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:30,000
in the soil report now after I've grown

1689
01:13:26,639 --> 01:13:32,719
a cycle of cannabis so look at organic

1690
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,880
matter percent it went down by four

1691
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:37,920
solid points a little bit more than four

1692
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:41,359
points then you bounc back up to cat

1693
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:44,158
exchange capacity that too dropped um

1694
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:46,920
pretty significantly you dropped by five

1695
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:49,559
plus points so what that indicates to me

1696
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:52,840
is that your organic matter was your

1697
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:55,719
primary source of cation exchange or the

1698
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:58,400
ability to store nutrients in your soil

1699
01:13:55,719 --> 01:14:00,399
so in that regard you know I would

1700
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:02,719
encourage you to top dress with a little

1701
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:05,279
bit more compost um so that you're

1702
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:07,439
putting those exchange sites back into

1703
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:12,800
play because there as they get broken

1704
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:15,759
down from compost to silt you're losing

1705
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,520
um the positive charges um that would

1706
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,960
have been holding those nutrients so

1707
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,800
that's that's one interesting thing but

1708
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,480
but what the drops that you're seeing

1709
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,360
though even even though you know we do

1710
01:14:23,479 --> 01:14:29,119
want to replenish and that's the whole

1711
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:33,238
point of re amending um these are drops

1712
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:36,279
that would be typical and expected after

1713
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:39,279
growing a cycle of cannabis exactly

1714
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:41,439
exactly but this is giving you exactly

1715
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:43,719
what you're missing if you're you know

1716
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:45,158
if you're paying attention to it I like

1717
01:14:43,719 --> 01:14:47,600
that it's also showing that the system

1718
01:14:45,158 --> 01:14:49,158
is functioning right oh yeah it's not

1719
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,039
like oh I grew plants and now

1720
01:14:49,158 --> 01:14:52,879
everything's out of whack it's like oh

1721
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:55,960
no this is what we would expect if you

1722
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,960
grew a proper living soil plant mhm and

1723
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:59,600
but it also gives you the direction on

1724
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:02,560
what you need to make sure that you're

1725
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,199
putting back into play um and again you

1726
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,639
know people get so overwhelmed at

1727
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:08,638
looking at these reports and it's like

1728
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:10,719
no you don't need all of this um this

1729
01:15:08,639 --> 01:15:14,239
would be for someone who's you know very

1730
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:16,639
very uh heavy into soil science really

1731
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:21,079
all you're looking at is exchange

1732
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:25,039
capacity organic matter Trace elements

1733
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:29,119
and then your um your true um saturated

1734
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:33,198
paste percentage like if if you look at

1735
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:36,319
um like for instance the soluble cat I

1736
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:39,839
right it says calcium is up at

1737
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:42,960
62 magnesium at 41 potassium at 41

1738
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,920
sodium at 25 then you drop down to

1739
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,880
percentage they're not they don't match

1740
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:50,039
up they're not even close so that's

1741
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:53,000
where you have to understand that that

1742
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:56,079
soluble means that it's potentially

1743
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,520
plant available whereas

1744
01:15:56,079 --> 01:16:01,319
um the percent actually represents

1745
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:03,840
what's being held on the cation exchange

1746
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:06,679
sites which which are a better think of

1747
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:10,039
it as a battery for your soil so I mean

1748
01:16:06,679 --> 01:16:13,319
look at your soluble cats uh calcium at

1749
01:16:10,039 --> 01:16:15,079
start was 62 which is great and at the

1750
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:18,679
end

1751
01:16:15,079 --> 01:16:21,920
4.5 that means you got you gobbled up a

1752
01:16:18,679 --> 01:16:23,679
tremendous amount of calcium in that run

1753
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,119
but then you drop down to percent you

1754
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:29,880
look at calcium and it's

1755
01:16:26,119 --> 01:16:33,639
3564 and it actually went up to

1756
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:36,600
39.96 so what that says is that as the

1757
01:16:33,639 --> 01:16:38,440
calcium that was in the soluble cation

1758
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:41,199
or or plant

1759
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:44,879
available um some of that fell down and

1760
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:46,799
attached to the cation exchange sites so

1761
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,639
so that's a good thing and look at your

1762
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:52,880
magnesium your magnesium after at the

1763
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:55,639
end was dropped all the way down to 25.6

1764
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:57,359
2 which again is like the system is

1765
01:16:55,639 --> 01:16:58,920
functioning it's it's going in the right

1766
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:02,000
direction it's balancing it out

1767
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:02,960
balancing itself out um potassium went

1768
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,560
from

1769
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:09,800
12.34 all the way down to

1770
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:11,159
4.24 and worse the sodium was at 12.6

1771
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:15,920
went up to

1772
01:17:11,158 --> 01:17:18,119
3.1 uh8 so that indicates to me that

1773
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:21,520
perhaps you either have high levels of

1774
01:17:18,119 --> 01:17:25,359
salt in your water um that you're using

1775
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:29,320
to water the plant um or you used a

1776
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:31,039
nutrient that had a salt base so you

1777
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:33,920
know we talk about mineral salts versus

1778
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:36,800
organic nutrients right there's still

1779
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:39,600
going to be salts in organic nutrients

1780
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:41,400
um the organic nutrients are harder to

1781
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,280
break down which is why you need a

1782
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:47,119
tremendous amount of um good biological

1783
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:51,000
diversity um to make those available but

1784
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:53,519
as the biology pulls things off it's

1785
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,520
going to leave behind the salts and this

1786
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,239
is where it goes back to oh flush

1787
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:00,679
flushing is a good thing using excess

1788
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:02,559
water or I used to call all I said it

1789
01:18:00,679 --> 01:18:06,158
originally as oh just waterboard that

1790
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:10,039
[ __ ] you hated it this is true and

1791
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:13,638
forced me to rename it into a rain event

1792
01:18:10,039 --> 01:18:15,600
Heavy Rain event Heavy Rain event so

1793
01:18:13,639 --> 01:18:18,119
bottom line in this in this situation

1794
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:20,840
what I'd probably recommend is that you

1795
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:23,000
do a a major rain event at the end of

1796
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:25,960
the cycle so that you push those salts

1797
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,639
down uh into the into the E Horizon

1798
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:30,600
where they can naturally build up down

1799
01:18:27,639 --> 01:18:32,960
there and and that won't cause a problem

1800
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,840
um so that's you know that's kind of the

1801
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,319
the the gist and the interesting things

1802
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:38,199
that that have happened all right so

1803
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:41,158
before before you move on on you said a

1804
01:18:38,198 --> 01:18:44,479
whole bunch of provocative stuff so so

1805
01:18:41,158 --> 01:18:47,000
let's start with um H the how much

1806
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:50,079
sodium there is now what I would like to

1807
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:54,920
understand is when uh when we look at

1808
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:58,359
the the cation uh exchange section it

1809
01:18:54,920 --> 01:19:00,000
says that the sodium started at 181 and

1810
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:02,759
finished at

1811
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,439
117 so that looks like the sodium

1812
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:07,039
decreased and and when we originally

1813
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:10,198
talked about it you said aha this shows

1814
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:13,000
that there were no added salts in your

1815
01:19:10,198 --> 01:19:14,879
um in your inputs and I was all happy

1816
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,479
right cuz I'm not using you know

1817
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,920
salt-based bottles and stuff and and and

1818
01:19:17,479 --> 01:19:21,718
you said yeah you're not adding any

1819
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:25,000
salts but then but then when we look at

1820
01:19:21,719 --> 01:19:26,719
the the the soluble cat I where where

1821
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,119
you're where you're having us look that

1822
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:32,880
they excuse me the percent it went up

1823
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:35,880
how come it looks like sodium went down

1824
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:39,560
in the cat section but the percentage

1825
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:40,359
went up they seem to be um contrasting

1826
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,840
in their

1827
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:46,519
indications well no actually they're not

1828
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:49,039
see soluble means that it's mobile or

1829
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:53,120
available and percentage means it's

1830
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:55,840
bound to a cat exchange site so it goes

1831
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:58,158
back to think of that clay platelet as a

1832
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:00,440
little flying saucer and around the

1833
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:03,198
outside of that Flying Saucer is 100

1834
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:06,638
parking spots um that's that's your

1835
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:09,000
battery you got a 100 little pieces of

1836
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:12,560
these primary nutrients calcium

1837
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:16,439
magnesium pottassium and sodium so when

1838
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:19,320
the sodium started in in soluble cats at

1839
01:20:16,439 --> 01:20:22,519
25.2 three and dropped all the way to

1840
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:24,759
3.91 during the cycle well they went

1841
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:26,880
somewhere right they went down to

1842
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:28,800
percentage those those solubles those

1843
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,880
those salts that were released are now

1844
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:35,079
stuck on your uh cat or stuck on your

1845
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:36,840
clay platelet um and being stored and we

1846
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:38,679
we don't want them stored there we we

1847
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,760
want them mobile and we want them moving

1848
01:20:38,679 --> 01:20:42,319
we want to get rid of them or or let

1849
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:46,079
them naturally break down because there

1850
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:50,079
are some uh bacteria that can uh

1851
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:52,158
actually start breaking salt apart so

1852
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:54,279
that being said they just moved they

1853
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:58,000
went from one place to another place you

1854
01:20:54,279 --> 01:21:00,880
follow me I do I do so all sodium is not

1855
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,719
the same on the test um again you're

1856
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,600
looking at what's being stored the

1857
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:08,840
percent is what's being stored on the C

1858
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:10,960
exchange site and the soluble cats are

1859
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:13,239
the ones that are more Mobile in the

1860
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,880
soil so they they can they can move they

1861
01:21:13,238 --> 01:21:16,959
either can get used up very quickly or

1862
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:20,719
they can wash through the soil profile

1863
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:23,880
all right fantastic so um so let's move

1864
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:26,639
on to our our third soil report that

1865
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:28,800
we're going to hit fast so this is this

1866
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:32,359
is where things get a little iffy my

1867
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:35,440
dear listener um so um I guess I'm kind

1868
01:21:32,359 --> 01:21:38,359
of thrown myself under the bus here um

1869
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:40,960
so after seeing this uh report the

1870
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:44,920
second one uh showing me how much

1871
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:46,920
nutrition I used um I told Leighton that

1872
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:51,359
uh I was a big fan I I continue to be a

1873
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:54,719
good fan of the um the kiss Organics um

1874
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:59,439
nutrient pack and uh Tad has put a lot

1875
01:21:54,719 --> 01:22:02,679
effort into um making a a wide ranging

1876
01:21:59,439 --> 01:22:05,479
Blended amendment that you can just buy

1877
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:08,359
a bucket of and and add to your soil us

1878
01:22:05,479 --> 01:22:10,678
as Amendment and it it will just amend

1879
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:13,319
like all your different categories and

1880
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:15,960
it just makes things really simple also

1881
01:22:13,319 --> 01:22:18,439
if you're an ultra nerd for this um they

1882
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:21,520
Tad at kiss Organics they will also

1883
01:22:18,439 --> 01:22:23,079
custom blend you a nutrient pack as well

1884
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,360
and he actually offered that to do that

1885
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:27,158
for me but I said you know dude I want

1886
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:28,479
to I want to practice with what what's

1887
01:22:27,158 --> 01:22:30,319
bought right off the shelf I don't want

1888
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:32,399
to get the custom stuff but I will let

1889
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:34,639
people know that that's available so

1890
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:36,638
that's why I'm telling you so so what I

1891
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:41,880
did is I I followed the the directions

1892
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:46,279
on the label and um I added my 18 cups

1893
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:48,480
of uh of of nutrient pack uh to the top

1894
01:22:46,279 --> 01:22:52,198
and I watered it in and then I covered

1895
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:55,359
it with some um uh from another some

1896
01:22:52,198 --> 01:22:58,439
more soil from uh from outside

1897
01:22:55,359 --> 01:23:00,359
and um watered it in and kind of walked

1898
01:22:58,439 --> 01:23:03,960
away from it I figured okay you know I'm

1899
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:06,319
doing a fall Harvest of my outdoor um

1900
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:10,520
you know I can just let this soil sit

1901
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:12,439
for a while and um and just let it you

1902
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:14,880
know just water it in right just just I

1903
01:23:12,439 --> 01:23:16,759
don't know let it do biology and so I

1904
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,359
was about 3 days into that and I and I

1905
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:21,520
called Leighton to let him know that I

1906
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:23,359
had done this and he was like oh dude

1907
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,719
you can't you can't just let the bed sit

1908
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:26,799
there and I'm like well what do you mean

1909
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:28,039
and he's all like well are the lights

1910
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,159
off I'm like well yeah the lights are

1911
01:23:28,039 --> 01:23:33,800
off I want to save money he's like yeah

1912
01:23:30,158 --> 01:23:37,158
he's all like the the bed is alive

1913
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:39,600
because of the light and if you turn off

1914
01:23:37,158 --> 01:23:42,119
the light and if there are no plants in

1915
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:44,719
the bed you are just kind of like

1916
01:23:42,119 --> 01:23:47,920
choking all of the biology off and and

1917
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:50,600
it's not going to be cycling and ready

1918
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:53,960
when you transplant in plants and I'm

1919
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:56,960
like whoa mind blown and and so I

1920
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:59,399
realized that I needed to plant the bed

1921
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,800
so that plants would grow so that when I

1922
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:04,238
was ready to replant it you know and

1923
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:06,880
focus more on it in a few weeks after we

1924
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:10,119
Harvest it outdoor so the pl the the bed

1925
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:13,039
would be ready to go and so I'm like oh

1926
01:24:10,119 --> 01:24:14,719
so I turned back on the lights um you

1927
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:16,158
know not at full power but you know

1928
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:18,600
enough that the bed was going to get

1929
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:23,198
lights and and I put in a bunch of

1930
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:25,039
flowers and onions and strawberries and

1931
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:26,839
um chives

1932
01:24:25,039 --> 01:24:30,479
and uh you know just a whole bunch of

1933
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:32,079
things and uh basil I just like bought

1934
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:34,359
that living basil from the store and

1935
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:36,039
threw that in there and so you know

1936
01:24:34,359 --> 01:24:37,559
these were all temporary plants these

1937
01:24:36,039 --> 01:24:39,679
weren't plants that I was going to keep

1938
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:43,360
very long but they were all plants that

1939
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:46,639
I was going to grow and then chop and

1940
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:49,359
then cover with uh more soil and then

1941
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:51,440
and then plant my Canabis in 3 weeks

1942
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:53,198
when I was done with Harvest so that's

1943
01:24:51,439 --> 01:24:55,079
what I did and it was actually really

1944
01:24:53,198 --> 01:24:56,678
cool and and for those of you who follow

1945
01:24:55,079 --> 01:24:58,760
on the Instagram you got to see all the

1946
01:24:56,679 --> 01:25:01,480
pictures of these you know you know

1947
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:04,039
beautiful strawberry blonde colula and

1948
01:25:01,479 --> 01:25:05,718
the the pink dandelions and the

1949
01:25:04,039 --> 01:25:07,840
strawberries I was eating out of there

1950
01:25:05,719 --> 01:25:10,399
and the onions it was really great to be

1951
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:13,319
producing food for myself out of this

1952
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:17,839
indoor tent so that was all really cool

1953
01:25:13,319 --> 01:25:20,439
however it was time to get a um another

1954
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:23,279
soil test right cuz I wanted to see and

1955
01:25:20,439 --> 01:25:24,839
and and ensure that the that the

1956
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:26,519
Amendments that I had used used had

1957
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:29,319
brought up my numbers again and I was

1958
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:31,719
ready to grow cannabis so I took my test

1959
01:25:29,319 --> 01:25:33,599
I sent it into Logan Labs I got it back

1960
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:36,079
and I was disappointed cuz the numbers

1961
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:39,639
were lower than I expected but I had

1962
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:42,198
done everything right and so um I went

1963
01:25:39,639 --> 01:25:44,118
back to Lon and I'm all like Leighton

1964
01:25:42,198 --> 01:25:46,399
you know why aren't these numbers higher

1965
01:25:44,118 --> 01:25:48,920
you know I know this product works it ra

1966
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:52,399
it's raised my numbers before but it

1967
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:54,960
didn't this time and he's all like well

1968
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:56,799
you were growing plants in there right

1969
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,279
and I'm like oh yeah I got great food

1970
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,360
and pl and he's like dude they were

1971
01:25:58,279 --> 01:26:03,960
taking up more of your nutrition it's

1972
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:05,920
not like the beds there stopping its

1973
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:08,439
uptake of nutrition just because you

1974
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:13,399
didn't have cannabis plants in there and

1975
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:16,359
I went oh and so I had both amended the

1976
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:20,439
bed waited a while because I was busy

1977
01:26:16,359 --> 01:26:23,279
doing other things and then tested it

1978
01:26:20,439 --> 01:26:26,319
and I had used up most if not all of the

1979
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:29,559
Amendments that I had put in there um 3

1980
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:31,880
months earlier and so this was a life

1981
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:33,880
lesson for me and so um I have to

1982
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:36,560
remember that all these companion plants

1983
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:38,440
I'm using are are actively pulling on

1984
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,520
the nutrition as well and like you know

1985
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:44,039
in retrospect that's like totally

1986
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:46,800
obvious um so so looking at my time

1987
01:26:44,039 --> 01:26:48,920
frame Leon um what do you think the time

1988
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:52,400
frame should be

1989
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:56,199
between like you end the cycle I take

1990
01:26:52,399 --> 01:27:00,399
the test I get back my results I add my

1991
01:26:56,198 --> 01:27:03,000
nutrient pack how long should I

1992
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:05,399
wait like how long should I be watering

1993
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:09,158
in those amendments and let them settle

1994
01:27:05,399 --> 01:27:12,079
before I replant with cannabis plants

1995
01:27:09,158 --> 01:27:13,799
and um uh I guess that's the question

1996
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:16,439
how long should I water that stuff in

1997
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:18,639
before I put in the cannabis plants well

1998
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:20,919
I mean again you're you're continuing to

1999
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:22,880
grow plants throughout the cycle so even

2000
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:24,960
though it's not cannabis now it's called

2001
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:27,118
a a resting bit where you've got you

2002
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,760
know other plants in there that are are

2003
01:27:27,118 --> 01:27:32,439
you know keeping the soil the living

2004
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:36,159
soil system alive so you really want

2005
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:38,638
to um again if you're going to plant in

2006
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:41,319
three weeks you know take another soil

2007
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:43,359
test and and now you again you'll know

2008
01:27:41,319 --> 01:27:46,198
what your companions or your foods that

2009
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:49,920
you grew in there um have taken out or

2010
01:27:46,198 --> 01:27:51,399
or be proactive and understand that your

2011
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,279
your numbers are going to continue to go

2012
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:56,479
down I mean if you look at like

2013
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:59,479
primaries nitrate and aluminum in the

2014
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:01,919
beginning of the cycle you know you were

2015
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:04,000
at

2016
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:09,039
3656 for

2017
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:11,719
nitrat uh and ammonia was at um 6.2 at

2018
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:14,760
the end of the cycle you were down to

2019
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:18,399
89.5 in the nitrate and

2020
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:21,159
0.008 in the uh ammonium and then bounce

2021
01:28:18,399 --> 01:28:26,238
over to the one that you just

2022
01:28:21,158 --> 01:28:28,319
took um and your nitrates are at 18.2 so

2023
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:29,839
they've continued to go down and your

2024
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:34,799
ammonia is

2025
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:37,159
AT3 so you really need uh a good source

2026
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:39,400
of nitrogen in this thing bad like you

2027
01:28:37,158 --> 01:28:41,319
know I don't know how much pigs plugged

2028
01:28:39,399 --> 01:28:43,638
you tend to use

2029
01:28:41,319 --> 01:28:46,399
traditionally but I would say whatever

2030
01:28:43,639 --> 01:28:48,760
you were using you need to double it for

2031
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:50,839
now to get these numbers back up to

2032
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:53,000
where they need to be so and that and

2033
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:54,960
that's true with the maldium um as I

2034
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:59,000
pointed out before you know that's down

2035
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:03,399
to less than 0.02 and that's a critical

2036
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:05,719
um trace for um you know plant function

2037
01:29:03,399 --> 01:29:09,399
so again you know these are giving you

2038
01:29:05,719 --> 01:29:12,439
things that you need to know as tools um

2039
01:29:09,399 --> 01:29:13,719
how how best to amend next um again

2040
01:29:12,439 --> 01:29:17,158
you're going to need a good source of

2041
01:29:13,719 --> 01:29:19,079
calcium um you could use a slow release

2042
01:29:17,158 --> 01:29:22,319
uh you know oyster shell

2043
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:24,800
flour um or you could use like a liquid

2044
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:28,319
calcium Source like horta

2045
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:30,560
which is an organic uh 4% calcium that's

2046
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:32,238
also acts as a nitrogen now this gets

2047
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:34,159
really complex so I'm not going to go

2048
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:37,039
down this rabbit hole but the

2049
01:29:34,158 --> 01:29:40,319
interaction between calcium and nitrogen

2050
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:43,439
is a really interesting one and not one

2051
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:45,679
that is often talked about um if you

2052
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:49,359
look back at some of Rudolph Steiner's

2053
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:51,520
work in the 20s he talks about um these

2054
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:54,039
in forms that don't really make sense

2055
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:56,159
he's talking about ethereal and

2056
01:29:54,039 --> 01:29:57,920
terrestrial planes and it's really what

2057
01:29:56,158 --> 01:30:00,479
he's talking about is nitrogen and

2058
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:02,560
calcium and the relationship they have

2059
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:05,118
so those would be the the starting

2060
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:08,880
points um that I would really encourage

2061
01:30:05,118 --> 01:30:12,279
you to uh focus on I mean uh soluble

2062
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:15,039
calcium went from 62 down to 4.5 after

2063
01:30:12,279 --> 01:30:20,920
the end of the Run um with your most

2064
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:22,519
recent test um your calcium went back up

2065
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:24,560
to

2066
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:26,960
37.5 H so

2067
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:29,440
obviously whatever you amended had a

2068
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,560
good source of of calcium but again

2069
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:32,919
you're going to you're going to want

2070
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,239
more I mean in the percentages stuck on

2071
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:37,199
your cat exchange site remember that

2072
01:30:35,238 --> 01:30:40,079
that number I just gave you for calcium

2073
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:41,719
was soluble so it's Mobile in the it

2074
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:44,639
it's one of the nutrients that you've

2075
01:30:41,719 --> 01:30:46,920
added whereas if you look down on your

2076
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:51,039
um your percentages your cat exchange

2077
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:51,039
sites you're down to 31.947692

2078
01:30:54,118 --> 01:30:59,679
ability to store those store that stuff

2079
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,880
uh on a on a a cat an exchange site so

2080
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:04,920
that's why it's really important that

2081
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:08,118
you get a more mobile liquid uh source

2082
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:11,840
of calcium to help to to bump off the

2083
01:31:08,118 --> 01:31:13,920
pottassium which is 27 way too high bump

2084
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:16,480
the sodium off which is

2085
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,039
11.41 so that good calcium liquid

2086
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:20,638
calcium source is really going to help

2087
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:24,238
you a lot in in getting this this bed

2088
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:27,118
back to a wonderful or a um a good good

2089
01:31:24,238 --> 01:31:28,599
place for for the next run so so I think

2090
01:31:27,118 --> 01:31:30,039
the the main lesson that I've learned

2091
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:35,960
from this

2092
01:31:30,039 --> 01:31:38,399
is uh number one uh don't do your soil

2093
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:40,719
test until you're ready to transplant

2094
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:44,079
your cannabis plants and put them in

2095
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:46,639
there because after you have done you

2096
01:31:44,079 --> 01:31:48,840
you you do your test and then you do

2097
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:52,199
your amendments and then you add your

2098
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:55,880
plants whereas what I did is I did my

2099
01:31:52,198 --> 01:31:58,638
test did my amendments and then I waited

2100
01:31:55,880 --> 01:32:01,199
a month with resting plants in there

2101
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:04,319
that was eating up nutrition and

2102
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:07,118
throwing me back off balance and then I

2103
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:09,039
went to then I went to add my plants and

2104
01:32:07,118 --> 01:32:11,439
it was no longer as robust as I wanted

2105
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:14,880
it to be and at that point I needed to

2106
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:17,359
do another test and then re amend so I

2107
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:20,239
screwed myself with that resting period

2108
01:32:17,359 --> 01:32:22,960
like and like certainly I Have I Lost

2109
01:32:20,238 --> 01:32:24,759
You Know yield per year as well and I

2110
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:28,118
don't think I'll do that resting period

2111
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:30,039
again yeah I would say that you know the

2112
01:32:28,118 --> 01:32:32,759
the interesting thing was that you you

2113
01:32:30,039 --> 01:32:34,279
saw what what the goal is you saw what

2114
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:36,679
you started with and you saw what you

2115
01:32:34,279 --> 01:32:38,599
ended with and so I agree with you I

2116
01:32:36,679 --> 01:32:40,960
think that starting and getting that

2117
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:42,960
test is critical and then once you're

2118
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,920
ready to plant your cannabis plants like

2119
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,000
two to three weeks three to four weeks

2120
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:49,079
before you're ready to plant your

2121
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,840
cannabis plants then do your ending test

2122
01:32:49,079 --> 01:32:52,920
because you had that resting period

2123
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:55,400
where you those the onions and those

2124
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:58,000
other um cover crops and companion

2125
01:32:55,399 --> 01:32:59,960
plants gobbled up more nutrients so I

2126
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,880
think that you know I'm glad you did

2127
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:03,158
this because you're really seeing what's

2128
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:06,279
happening here and even though you

2129
01:33:03,158 --> 01:33:10,879
amended you still lost more nutrient so

2130
01:33:06,279 --> 01:33:12,599
again you know lesson learned start test

2131
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:15,440
and just be you know three weeks to four

2132
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:16,840
weeks before planting the next run

2133
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:18,839
that's when you want to do your your

2134
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:20,840
ending test so that you can figure out

2135
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:23,119
what you need to put in play uh for the

2136
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:26,079
next run and again you know even if the

2137
01:33:23,118 --> 01:33:30,118
nutrients are are you know like organic

2138
01:33:26,079 --> 01:33:33,238
form again like a an oyster meal flour

2139
01:33:30,118 --> 01:33:35,839
uh or you know feather meal or whatever

2140
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:38,039
um that you're putting in into play you

2141
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:39,920
can plant right after that you you don't

2142
01:33:38,039 --> 01:33:42,238
have What's called the cook down phase

2143
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,920
which is what super soils do is they you

2144
01:33:42,238 --> 01:33:45,839
know they basically blend you all these

2145
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:47,800
high nutrients and then they say don't

2146
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,480
use it right away because you're going

2147
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:51,480
to burn your plant if you try to plant

2148
01:33:49,479 --> 01:33:53,879
in it you got to let it cook off and

2149
01:33:51,479 --> 01:33:56,678
basically what's happening is you you're

2150
01:33:53,880 --> 01:34:00,679
going into a thermophilic process where

2151
01:33:56,679 --> 01:34:04,039
organic and nitrogen and carbon are

2152
01:34:00,679 --> 01:34:06,960
being eaten and broken down and you're

2153
01:34:04,039 --> 01:34:09,158
releasing ammonia um which is another

2154
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:12,198
form of nitrogen because they've they've

2155
01:34:09,158 --> 01:34:15,879
broken it apart um as a gas so you're

2156
01:34:12,198 --> 01:34:18,238
losing you're losing nutrient value um

2157
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:20,800
in that process but if you again if you

2158
01:34:18,238 --> 01:34:25,238
don't allow the biology to break it down

2159
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:28,119
or or Bust it into uh more uh usable

2160
01:34:25,238 --> 01:34:30,198
pieces then it's going to kill your plan

2161
01:34:28,118 --> 01:34:33,158
so you have to do that but in in the

2162
01:34:30,198 --> 01:34:36,359
case of your situation where you're just

2163
01:34:33,158 --> 01:34:38,679
amending with with hard organic

2164
01:34:36,359 --> 01:34:41,079
nutrients um other than the pig's blood

2165
01:34:38,679 --> 01:34:42,760
that's a little different um these

2166
01:34:41,079 --> 01:34:44,439
nutrients are going to stay in play in

2167
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:47,320
the soil for a longer period of time

2168
01:34:44,439 --> 01:34:49,519
they're not they're not soluble um but

2169
01:34:47,319 --> 01:34:51,479
they're not they're not mobile either

2170
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:54,080
they're they're they're bound up in in

2171
01:34:51,479 --> 01:34:56,559
their um in their raw form which makes

2172
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:58,760
him kind of slow release yes exactly

2173
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:01,520
till the biology breaks him down and and

2174
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:03,079
that's good because the plant will

2175
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,520
actually say ah you know I don't need

2176
01:35:03,079 --> 01:35:07,359
any of that right now so I'm not going

2177
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:09,920
to feed this exate for this bacteria to

2178
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:12,079
break that down but I will when I come

2179
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:14,239
to a point in the in my growth cycle

2180
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:16,000
where I need it then I'll release exit

2181
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:18,039
dates I'll grow out those bacterials and

2182
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,079
I'll mine that source of

2183
01:35:18,039 --> 01:35:23,000
nutrient right on all right well thank

2184
01:35:21,079 --> 01:35:25,679
you for going through that that that

2185
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:28,359
arduous report situation with me uh

2186
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:30,118
Leighton and um so let's go ahead and

2187
01:35:28,359 --> 01:35:32,039
take our last break and when we come

2188
01:35:30,118 --> 01:35:34,920
back we're going to start talking about

2189
01:35:32,039 --> 01:35:37,800
um uh some a little less technical stuff

2190
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:41,319
like uh like cover crops and scrogging

2191
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:43,480
you are listening to shaping fire uh and

2192
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:45,389
my guest today is soil biologist Leon

2193
01:35:43,479 --> 01:35:46,678
Morrison we'll be right

2194
01:35:45,390 --> 01:35:48,719

2250
01:37:48,198 --> 01:37:52,479
for years organic cultivators have been

2251
01:37:50,679 --> 01:37:54,920
looking for a replacement for using Pete

2252
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:56,839
Moss Pete Moss has long been the go-to

2253
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:58,880
soil amendment for water retention in

2254
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:01,039
container growing but organic Growers

2255
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:03,159
know that Pete Moss is an unsustainable

2256
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:04,760
resource and the mining of Pete bogs

2257
01:38:03,158 --> 01:38:07,158
destroys habitat and releases

2258
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:09,000
sequestered carbon but Pete Moss works

2259
01:38:07,158 --> 01:38:10,839
so well that many have continued to use

2260
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,920
it but now there's finally a

2261
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:14,920
revolutionary replacement for Pete Moss

2262
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:18,000
that shares the same benefits while also

2263
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:20,399
being sustainable pit Moss sounds and

2264
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,679
acts like Pete Moss but instead of being

2265
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:24,519
mined from fragile ecosystems it

2266
01:38:22,679 --> 01:38:26,920
actually is made from upcycled organic

2267
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:28,400
paper and tree bark pit Moss is

2268
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:30,480
excellent at retaining water in your

2269
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:32,960
substrate and creating air pockets and

2270

Tiny living environments for microbes

2271
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:37,399

2274
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:43,960
sourced pit Moss is the result of

2275
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:47,118
decades long research into the use of

2276
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:49,480
recycled paper fibers pit Moss has the

2277

fluffy nature of Pete Moss and handles

2278
01:38:49,479 --> 01:38:55,559
exactly the same and like Pete Moss pit

back you are listening to shaping fire I

2340
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:28,320
am your host Shango Los and my guest

2341
01:41:26,439 --> 01:41:31,000
today is soil biologist Leighton

2342
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:34,039
Morrison so Leighton here we are third

2343
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:35,960
set bringing it all on home so the first

2344
01:41:34,039 --> 01:41:39,639
thing I want to point out is how many

2345
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:41,599
plants to grow in this environment and

2346
01:41:39,639 --> 01:41:44,560
you know with all of the nutrition with

2347
01:41:41,599 --> 01:41:47,719
us being able to add more if we want to

2348
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:49,560
it's not really the um the the amount of

2349
01:41:47,719 --> 01:41:51,480
nutrition that is going to be limiting

2350
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,920
the number of plants we could have

2351
01:41:51,479 --> 01:41:56,519
what's going to end up limiting it is

2352
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:58,679
the space we're going to have um and so

2353
01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:02,199
against all of the good opinion I got

2354
01:41:58,679 --> 01:42:06,000
from all of my friends um I grew five

2355
01:42:02,198 --> 01:42:07,919
plants in a 4x4 tent and everybody's all

2356
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,880
like what the hell are you doing this is

2357
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:15,560
just going to overgrow the tent so bad

2358
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:19,480
and for me I was more interested in um

2359
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:21,560
uh flavor variety than necessarily like

2360
01:42:19,479 --> 01:42:23,198
yield right I wanted I wanted to grow

2361
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:25,320
five different tastes five different

2362
01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:26,638
flavors just for my own head cuz like

2363
01:42:25,319 --> 01:42:29,158
I'm not growing the stuff to sell I'm

2364
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:30,960
just growing the stuff to smoke and so

2365
01:42:29,158 --> 01:42:32,960
while I while I understood that five

2366
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:34,520
plants was probably going to impact my

2367
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:36,760
yield because the plants are be

2368
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:39,080
competing I didn't really care all that

2369
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:40,960
much but I do agree five plants is too

2370
01:42:39,079 --> 01:42:43,679
many it was just too many they were

2371
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:45,840
growing on top of each other um and so I

2372
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:48,279
was growing a lot of plant matter that

2373
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:50,800
never finished because it had other

2374
01:42:48,279 --> 01:42:52,479
plants growing over the top of it

2375
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:59,840
especially because one of them was the

2376
01:42:52,479 --> 01:43:02,959
bot o G and the b o g the uh G GMO um um

2377
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:05,920
uh cherry pie cross from Nick ryen it is

2378
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:08,760
a beast it turned my tent into a

2379
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:10,960
freaking cage match and it just wanted

2380
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:13,639
to overgrow everything else so I had to

2381
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:16,439
continually trim it down during veg and

2382
01:43:13,639 --> 01:43:19,639
then even after um flower it was just

2383
01:43:16,439 --> 01:43:21,279
trying to climb over everything so I've

2384
01:43:19,639 --> 01:43:24,760
kind of learned my lesson and I'm going

2385
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:26,559
down to four plants um for this for this

2386
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:28,639
next round which is pro still probably

2387
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:31,239
too many but again I want the flavors

2388
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:34,199
and I'm going to scrog it so if I fail

2389
01:43:31,238 --> 01:43:37,158
again so be it so let's talk about uh

2390
01:43:34,198 --> 01:43:40,118
cover crops so the the cover crops that

2391
01:43:37,158 --> 01:43:44,439
I liked uh the most is uh primarily for

2392
01:43:40,118 --> 01:43:47,479
cover crops I use dondra Rens which is a

2393
01:43:44,439 --> 01:43:49,879
a very short about 1 in ground cover

2394
01:43:47,479 --> 01:43:53,198
it's a green plant and it's commonly

2395
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:54,880
used in between the bricks of fancy

2396
01:43:53,198 --> 01:43:58,479
driveways you know sometimes they have

2397
01:43:54,880 --> 01:44:00,319
those ornamental uh you know paav bricks

2398
01:43:58,479 --> 01:44:02,319
and uh and you know so you can drive

2399
01:44:00,319 --> 01:44:04,319
your car on your driveway but then you

2400
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:06,079
know there's this beautiful pattern and

2401
01:44:04,319 --> 01:44:08,519
so they're very resilient they hold

2402
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:11,198
their own water and you know they just

2403
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:13,920
grow thousands of these individuated

2404
01:44:11,198 --> 01:44:16,158
plants so so that's pretty cool and I

2405
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:17,760
also did everbearing alpine strawberries

2406
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:19,879
because I wanted to be able to eat from

2407
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:21,760
them I you you did some flowers

2408
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:25,560
including pink dandelions and strawberry

2409
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:28,800
blond Cula and it was just fun right the

2410
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:30,679
thing and the thing though um that I was

2411
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:32,920
not planning on though was when the

2412
01:44:30,679 --> 01:44:35,840
scrog filled up but before we start

2413
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:39,118
talking trash about about how the scrog

2414
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:41,719
um acted on the cover crops Leon will

2415
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:44,559
you please explain the importance of

2416
01:44:41,719 --> 01:44:47,399
companion planting from the perspective

2417
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:49,440
of number one uh the various roots of

2418
01:44:47,399 --> 01:44:53,039
the plants talking to each other and

2419
01:44:49,439 --> 01:44:54,879
then number two helping fight um the

2420
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:58,519
surface from becoming

2421
01:44:54,880 --> 01:45:01,400
hydrophobic absolutely um so yeah the

2422
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:04,520
the cover crops are are amazing in their

2423
01:45:01,399 --> 01:45:06,519
in the regard that they um create a

2424
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:10,199
microclimate right on the surface of the

2425
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:12,080
soil so the soil's not getting dried out

2426
01:45:10,198 --> 01:45:14,719
due to the wind that's you know the air

2427
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:17,198
moving that you have in the tent um and

2428
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:19,520
it's also preventing the the lights from

2429
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:21,879
from cooking the the biology on the

2430
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,280
surface of the soil um and it's it's

2431
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:25,560
literally as the water evaporates it's

2432
01:45:24,279 --> 01:45:28,719
hitting the bottom of these little

2433
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:30,599
leaves and then dripping back down onto

2434
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:35,319
the soil again so in many ways you're

2435
01:45:30,599 --> 01:45:38,000
you're allowing a natural little um

2436
01:45:35,319 --> 01:45:39,960
microecosystem to occur um right at the

2437
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,479
surface soil now now what's going on

2438
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:43,679
underneath the soil is even more

2439
01:45:41,479 --> 01:45:45,759
important because yeah everything is

2440
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:49,840
communicating especially if you have uh

2441
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:51,840
micro isy fungi um the amount of work

2442
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:55,440
there's some amazing things that we were

2443
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:58,279
learning uh at an incredibly Fast Pace

2444
01:45:55,439 --> 01:46:00,559
about micro isy and some of these other

2445
01:45:58,279 --> 01:46:02,960
plant interactions and how they

2446
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:06,960
communicate with each other through the

2447
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:09,039
movement of of um different chemistry

2448
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:12,000
that's that's happening in in the micro

2449
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:14,359
iy uh we now know that there's certain

2450
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,439
bacteria that will actually enter into

2451
01:46:14,359 --> 01:46:19,839
the micro isy and transfer from to

2452
01:46:17,439 --> 01:46:23,279
different plants um and also on the

2453
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:26,000
outside is is a super highway of of all

2454
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:28,359
kinds of you know bacteria as well as

2455
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:31,039
Predators you know like amibas and

2456
01:46:28,359 --> 01:46:33,359
auletes so you know again there's just

2457
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:36,000
like whole think of it as the internet

2458
01:46:33,359 --> 01:46:39,039
like a whole web um that is being

2459
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:42,479
provide that's providing transportation

2460
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:45,399
of both nutrient mineral and biology

2461
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:48,000
back and forth between these plants um

2462
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:53,839
so yeah that that interaction between

2463
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:54,960
roots and um biology uh is is critical

2464
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:58,400
for

2465
01:46:54,960 --> 01:47:00,560
for let me ask you this did you have any

2466
01:46:58,399 --> 01:47:04,238
pests even though you had that tent

2467
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:08,119
packed with with plants no I actually

2468
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:13,439
didn't have any pests um sorry

2469
01:47:08,118 --> 01:47:15,399
um uh none of them during the actual uh

2470
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:17,919
Growing Experience right like if if if

2471
01:47:15,399 --> 01:47:21,158
you asked me the day that I ended I

2472
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:24,440
would have said I had no pest pressure

2473
01:47:21,158 --> 01:47:27,598
and I tribute that in my head mostly to

2474
01:47:24,439 --> 01:47:31,079
the fact that um I I worked with my

2475
01:47:27,599 --> 01:47:34,599
consultant from uh Cobert uh beneficial

2476
01:47:31,079 --> 01:47:38,479
insects and I placed beneficial insects

2477
01:47:34,599 --> 01:47:41,480
in the tent that were preventatives and

2478
01:47:38,479 --> 01:47:45,919
so I assumed that that is why I got

2479
01:47:41,479 --> 01:47:48,319
through this run with no pests that said

2480
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:54,359
when I went through and I harvested and

2481
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:59,118
I went through and I um trimmed I found

2482
01:47:54,359 --> 01:48:00,839
two sunleaves that were face to face

2483
01:47:59,118 --> 01:48:03,639
with a slight slit you know like

2484
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:06,199
normally where you'll see like

2485
01:48:03,639 --> 01:48:09,679
um uh spiders living you know like a

2486
01:48:06,198 --> 01:48:11,638
little Hut and I found like maybe a

2487
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:13,000
hundred aphids in there and I was

2488
01:48:11,639 --> 01:48:15,199
startled I'm like where the hell did

2489
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:17,639
these aphids come from I didn't see them

2490
01:48:15,198 --> 01:48:20,919
anywhere else in the tent but they had

2491
01:48:17,639 --> 01:48:23,279
set up a home just in in between these

2492
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:25,079
two leaves and so technically there were

2493
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:29,679
pests there but they but there was like

2494
01:48:25,079 --> 01:48:31,760
nearly No Pest pressure why I do not

2495
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:34,118
understand well I would attribute that

2496
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:36,360
to a healthy biological system and and

2497
01:48:34,118 --> 01:48:39,399
healthy plants that are are strong and

2498
01:48:36,359 --> 01:48:42,519
resistant um yeah they went sense too

2499
01:48:39,399 --> 01:48:45,000
because the a the place where they grew

2500
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:46,760
it was in between two leaves from one of

2501
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:50,158
the plants that was suffering by being

2502
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:53,840
overgrown by the bicket OG there you go

2503
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:57,399
there you go so they'll find a place

2504
01:48:53,840 --> 01:49:00,319
that's weakest and then try to you know

2505
01:48:57,399 --> 01:49:02,839
grow out in in that place and then you

2506
01:49:00,319 --> 01:49:05,079
know get a population big enough that

2507
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:09,520
they can attack other healthier plants

2508
01:49:05,079 --> 01:49:12,158
but again you know if plant Health um if

2509
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:15,520
the plants are healthy enough they will

2510
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:20,319
deter pests and I think in many ways you

2511
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:22,280
had that because of the way you grew um

2512
01:49:20,319 --> 01:49:23,679
the level of biology that you had in

2513
01:49:22,279 --> 01:49:25,719
there because because of what happened

2514
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:28,560
with the uh fungus knats I mean that was

2515
01:49:25,719 --> 01:49:31,840
a real indicator that you put in a very

2516
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:33,840
diverse inoculant that's present now and

2517
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:36,000
we'll see it again in in this next run

2518
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:39,279
and let me ask you another hard question

2519
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,560
how how did your plants turn out oh they

2520
01:49:39,279 --> 01:49:43,238
were the best plants that I've ever

2521
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:46,920
grown in my life period I mean on one

2522
01:49:43,238 --> 01:49:49,279
hand duh because outside in the Pacific

2523
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:51,599
Northwest where I live we start to get

2524
01:49:49,279 --> 01:49:54,399
cold and rains the last week of

2525
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:57,159
September first week of October and most

2526
01:49:54,399 --> 01:49:59,638
8 week plants need to go at least until

2527
01:49:57,158 --> 01:50:02,879
the middle of October here and so we

2528
01:49:59,639 --> 01:50:05,359
don't finish outdoor plants really um

2529
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:08,000
you know Coastal Pacific Northwest and

2530
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:12,319
so all of the plants need two more weeks

2531
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:13,639
when we pull them but so so um as as my

2532
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:15,759
friend Johnny told me the other day he

2533
01:50:13,639 --> 01:50:18,118
said oh so when you grew indoor it's the

2534
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:21,480
first time that you grew finished plants

2535
01:50:18,118 --> 01:50:24,279
and I'm like uh yeah I guess so and so

2536
01:50:21,479 --> 01:50:29,000
so they were they were beautiful

2537
01:50:24,279 --> 01:50:32,158
colorful uh dense uh a a complex tarpine

2538
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:34,039
profile um there there weren't there

2539
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:37,598
wasn't much pest pressure or like

2540
01:50:34,039 --> 01:50:39,920
chewing of leaves or they they were they

2541
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:42,960
were like an Olympic team um and they

2542
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:44,880
tasted freaking incredible so um it was

2543
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:47,359
a it was a wild

2544
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:49,239
success I'm happy to hear that my friend

2545
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:52,238
yeah I mean again it just it goes to

2546
01:50:49,238 --> 01:50:56,399
show that if you do the right things um

2547
01:50:52,238 --> 01:51:00,839
and you look at the bigger picture then

2548
01:50:56,399 --> 01:51:04,679
you're going to have uh a a better uh

2549
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:06,679
more Rich plant because you've had the

2550
01:51:04,679 --> 01:51:08,520
biology and you have the diversity and

2551
01:51:06,679 --> 01:51:11,719
you have all the components that that

2552
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:14,199
the that everything needs to function

2553
01:51:11,719 --> 01:51:15,960
properly so you know kudos to you I'm

2554
01:51:14,198 --> 01:51:18,559
glad you had such a great run can't wait

2555
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:20,399
to taste it yeah right on and and and I

2556
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:22,760
of course appreciate your your help on

2557
01:51:20,399 --> 01:51:25,439
all of this um so let's let's talk about

2558
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:27,000
the cover crop and then SE SE into

2559
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:29,399
talking about scrog because there's one

2560
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:32,000
thing I want to say um I talk often

2561
01:51:29,399 --> 01:51:34,479
about um I really like pink dandelions

2562
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:37,118
they're an heirloom flower that just has

2563
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:40,959
become popular because Baker Creek seeds

2564
01:51:37,118 --> 01:51:42,960
um uh is is putting it out now and um if

2565
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:44,880
if you if if you do go and you're like

2566
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,158
oh pink dandelion that sounds great and

2567
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:48,599
like you go buy a pack of seeds for

2568
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:50,799
three bucks uh you know just make sure

2569
01:51:48,599 --> 01:51:53,520
that you don't let them go to seed when

2570
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:56,079
you are in flour because uh it

2571
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:59,159
absolutely sucks to have those little

2572
01:51:56,078 --> 01:52:00,599
white puffs of dandelion seeds floating

2573
01:51:59,158 --> 01:52:03,799
around in the tent and getting in your

2574
01:52:00,599 --> 01:52:06,039
sticky flowers that is not a win and so

2575
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:08,719
what I do is I just let them grow up and

2576
01:52:06,039 --> 01:52:11,399
they look cool during veg and then

2577
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:13,359
anything that goes to seed during veg I

2578
01:52:11,399 --> 01:52:15,439
like grab those seeds and I harvest them

2579
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:19,158
and I share them with my friends but if

2580
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:21,638
anything goes to seed during um flour I

2581
01:52:19,158 --> 01:52:23,759
just go ahead and pull off the the seeds

2582
01:52:21,639 --> 01:52:25,639
before before before they fully form

2583
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:29,039
because I'm not willing to risk that

2584
01:52:25,639 --> 01:52:31,199
just for some um you know for for some

2585
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:34,399
beautiful flowers like like I know which

2586
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:35,678
flowers I'm growing you know um so so

2587
01:52:34,399 --> 01:52:38,198
then the second thing I want to talk

2588
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:40,399
about is the experience that I had um

2589
01:52:38,198 --> 01:52:42,238
using the scrog and and this was

2590
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:46,000
actually probably the biggest challenge

2591
01:52:42,238 --> 01:52:48,839
I had during the cycle so so I I had the

2592
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,479
plants grow up um I started um uh

2593
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:53,400
weaving them through the scrog

2594
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:55,439
everything's great um they start

2595
01:52:53,399 --> 01:52:59,559
competing for space

2596
01:52:55,439 --> 01:53:02,719
excessively and and and and what I found

2597
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:05,079
was because the plants were so strong

2598
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:08,078
and because I so fully filled in the

2599
01:53:05,078 --> 01:53:12,439
scrog what happened was it cut off the

2600
01:53:08,078 --> 01:53:14,158
light to the soil down below and up

2601
01:53:12,439 --> 01:53:16,279
until this point you know I had the

2602
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:19,479
whole bottom filled with all these green

2603
01:53:16,279 --> 01:53:21,639
plants the dondra and flowers and alpine

2604
01:53:19,479 --> 01:53:23,638
strawberries and all this great stuff

2605
01:53:21,639 --> 01:53:26,279
well when the light got cut off from an

2606
01:53:23,639 --> 01:53:28,679
effectively done scrog all those plants

2607
01:53:26,279 --> 01:53:30,759
below started to suffer the dichondra

2608
01:53:28,679 --> 01:53:34,199
started to pull back the strawberries

2609
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:37,560
pulled back um it it started not looking

2610
01:53:34,198 --> 01:53:39,759
happy down there and so I realized that

2611
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:43,320
I was I was starting to experience big

2612
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:45,800
gaps of exposed um soil top and I don't

2613
01:53:43,319 --> 01:53:48,759
want that cuz when you have bare exposed

2614
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:52,520
soil um you no longer have that little

2615
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:54,840
Amazonian buffer of weather uh in the in

2616
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:57,520
the inch above the soil from the dondra

2617
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:59,239
Rens and strawberries and and with that

2618
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:01,239
bare soil you can start getting

2619
01:53:59,238 --> 01:54:04,000
something hydrophobic right so I'd be

2620
01:54:01,238 --> 01:54:06,078
watering the top and the water just kind

2621
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,800
of like slides off the side of the bed

2622
01:54:06,078 --> 01:54:11,078
and goes down the side and it doesn't go

2623
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:14,000
into the soil and so I'm like [ __ ] I I

2624
01:54:11,078 --> 01:54:16,880
don't know what I'm going to do and so

2625
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:19,158
um after after asking around to to

2626
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:20,719
Leighton and and and and some of my

2627
01:54:19,158 --> 01:54:24,638
other friends I realized that what I

2628
01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:28,880
wanted to do was to replace that green

2629
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:32,639
mulch that green um tops uh cover crop

2630
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:35,960
um with wood chips and and I'm like all

2631
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:37,760
right because if I used wood chips then

2632
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:40,439
I could grow mushrooms and I was very

2633
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:42,079
excited I I I grow you know a variety of

2634
01:54:40,439 --> 01:54:46,118
mushrooms and I'm like oh my God how

2635
01:54:42,078 --> 01:54:48,359
cool would it be to be able to grow um

2636
01:54:46,118 --> 01:54:50,880
uh uh cooking mushrooms culinary

2637
01:54:48,359 --> 01:54:55,238
mushrooms below my cannabis in the in

2638
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:57,560
the shady area so so what I did is I um

2639
01:54:55,238 --> 01:54:59,678
you know I didn't really have good

2640
01:54:57,560 --> 01:55:01,840
access to wood chips but because I live

2641
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:06,078
on an island with lots of artists I was

2642
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:07,679
able to find really nice

2643
01:55:06,078 --> 01:55:11,880
hardwood

2644
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:14,118
um like refu from Woodworkers on the

2645
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:16,359
island who make like bowls and utensils

2646
01:55:14,118 --> 01:55:22,319
and things like that really nice organic

2647
01:55:16,359 --> 01:55:26,198
Alder and and Oak and um U madone and

2648
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:31,319
and other other Hardwoods um that uh

2649
01:55:26,198 --> 01:55:32,759
Maple and uh and and use those and that

2650
01:55:31,319 --> 01:55:34,439
that worked out really well and I was

2651
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:36,440
able to get those and it was kind of fun

2652
01:55:34,439 --> 01:55:39,158
cuz they're all in curly cues as well so

2653
01:55:36,439 --> 01:55:41,158
they look festive and so I got a a

2654
01:55:39,158 --> 01:55:43,598
couple huge bags of that just gifted to

2655
01:55:41,158 --> 01:55:48,198
me from uh artist on the island and I

2656
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:51,599
put that on top and so essentially I I I

2657
01:55:48,198 --> 01:55:54,719
just uh choked out the rest of the way

2658
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:56,760
um all of the cover crops um and but

2659
01:55:54,719 --> 01:56:00,039
before I put that down I reached out to

2660
01:55:56,760 --> 01:56:03,079
my buddy Seth from Ready Set shroom and

2661
01:56:00,039 --> 01:56:06,679
um and I got some uh golden oyster um

2662
01:56:03,078 --> 01:56:10,719
and I got some winec cap uh inoculated

2663
01:56:06,679 --> 01:56:12,800
um uh you know sawdust and stuff and um

2664
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:15,439
and and he shipped those up to me and I

2665
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:17,719
put those down so that when I put down

2666
01:56:15,439 --> 01:56:22,719
these Hardwoods on top of it um

2667
01:56:17,719 --> 01:56:25,399
eventually those mushrooms um uh occupy

2668
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:27,599
the hardwood and and I got some edible

2669
01:56:25,399 --> 01:56:29,359
mushrooms so that part of it was cool

2670
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:31,840
but the part the part I would like you

2671
01:56:29,359 --> 01:56:34,639
to speak to Lon is that a lot of people

2672
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:37,920
were really concerned for me that I had

2673
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:40,039
put air quotes wood chips on top because

2674
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:43,359
they said that the wood chips were going

2675
01:56:40,039 --> 01:56:46,319
to steal nitrogen from the

2676
01:56:43,359 --> 01:56:48,920
substrate and that concerned me and so

2677
01:56:46,319 --> 01:56:51,439
when I told you about it um you

2678
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:53,639
explained to me that what they're

2679
01:56:51,439 --> 01:56:57,198
talking about what that biology is

2680
01:56:53,639 --> 01:56:58,679
between wood chips nitrogen and the soil

2681
01:56:57,198 --> 01:57:00,479
but then you also explained why this

2682
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:02,920
wasn't going to happen with these cured

2683
01:57:00,479 --> 01:57:05,399
hardwood bits that I was using so will

2684
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:07,880
you go through that for all of us oh

2685
01:57:05,399 --> 01:57:09,759
absolutely so in the living plant we

2686
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:11,760
talked a little bit earlier about

2687
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:14,239
endites um so there's all different

2688
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:19,079
types of biology and what happens when

2689
01:57:14,238 --> 01:57:22,238
you take fresh green um trees branches

2690
01:57:19,078 --> 01:57:23,359
whatever um and you chip them up um

2691
01:57:22,238 --> 01:57:25,959
they're going to go through the

2692
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:28,839
thermophilic process um they're going to

2693
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:31,399
start breaking nitrogen down breaking

2694
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:33,560
carbon down and heating up and that's

2695
01:57:31,399 --> 01:57:36,439
that's where you have a problem because

2696
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:36,440
basically those

2697
01:57:42,479 --> 01:57:48,319
thermopyle to break down carbon so

2698
01:57:45,639 --> 01:57:51,719
that's where fresh new chips are

2699
01:57:48,319 --> 01:57:54,719
absolutely problematic um old AG chips

2700
01:57:51,719 --> 01:57:57,800
that are uh Punky no problem curly

2701
01:57:54,719 --> 01:58:03,198
Hardwoods no problem they've been cured

2702
01:57:57,800 --> 01:58:06,039
uh kilm dried um you know left to uh or

2703
01:58:03,198 --> 01:58:09,198
I should say not left but processed so

2704
01:58:06,039 --> 01:58:12,519
that they don't warp and twist um so

2705
01:58:09,198 --> 01:58:14,479
again it's not even comparable um to

2706
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:17,360
what people would think of as fresh wood

2707
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:21,000
chips it's it's it's old wood it's it

2708
01:58:17,359 --> 01:58:22,960
has gone through uh very much a um

2709
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,840
pasteurizing process

2710
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:28,599
um so that it's usable

2711
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:30,480
wood this pasteurizing process removes

2712
01:58:28,599 --> 01:58:32,560
much of the water from it because

2713
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:35,399
they're dried out and cured and so

2714
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:37,320
without that water component yes they

2715
01:58:35,399 --> 01:58:38,960
will break down but they don't break

2716
01:58:37,319 --> 01:58:41,599
down in the same way so they're not

2717
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:44,118
going to be stealing nitrogen perfectly

2718
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:47,760
said perfectly said all right cool well

2719
01:58:44,118 --> 01:58:49,399
thanks for thanks for hitting that so um

2720
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:51,840
so so here we are we talked about the

2721
01:58:49,399 --> 01:58:55,039
scrog the scrog was very effective and

2722
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:57,840
when you use a scrog properly um uh it

2723
01:58:55,039 --> 01:59:00,840
essentially created every nug on the

2724
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:02,840
plant was a cola which I was astonished

2725
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:06,599
to see for the first time and I will now

2726
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:09,920
scrog everything like forever and so um

2727
01:59:06,599 --> 01:59:13,000
and and and so um I recommend that you

2728
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:15,158
consider scrogging if you have not so so

2729
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,920
so Leon this brings us to the the the

2730
01:59:15,158 --> 01:59:18,679
end of third set and this is everything

2731
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:22,319
we wanted to talk about today doing kind

2732
01:59:18,679 --> 01:59:26,560
of like this debrief from from the bed

2733
01:59:22,319 --> 01:59:28,198
um uh you know you have you know been

2734
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:29,760
assistant quarterback on this project

2735
01:59:28,198 --> 01:59:32,000
from me you know you've you you've

2736
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:35,159
you've taught me and you have um you

2737
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:37,520
know you know caught me from making

2738
01:59:35,158 --> 01:59:41,679
mistakes um I'm going to I'm going to

2739
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:44,320
kind of like just kind of put myself um

2740
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:47,399
at your mercy I guess and and just say

2741
01:59:44,319 --> 01:59:49,439
from from what you have seen um is there

2742
01:59:47,399 --> 01:59:51,559
anything that we haven't talked about

2743
01:59:49,439 --> 01:59:55,399
today that that either you know

2744
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:57,880
somewhere between I didn't do right or

2745
01:59:55,399 --> 02:00:00,198
or I could have done better that we

2746
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:03,719
haven't talked about and so and so you

2747
02:00:00,198 --> 02:00:06,519
know don't don't be shy I I I know I'm

2748
02:00:03,719 --> 02:00:10,000
learning so so was there anything else

2749
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:14,199
that stands out for you that we should

2750
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:18,238
mention I would have loved to see um you

2751
02:00:14,198 --> 02:00:21,319
make a uh biological compost there um

2752
02:00:18,238 --> 02:00:23,519
using your plant matter your leaves

2753
02:00:21,319 --> 02:00:25,439
everything that you've pulled off um as

2754
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:28,960
well as combining it with some stuff

2755
02:00:25,439 --> 02:00:31,078
outside and instead of using just all

2756
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:33,359
wood hardwood shavings I'd have loved

2757
02:00:31,078 --> 02:00:36,639
you to mix those hardwood shavings in

2758
02:00:33,359 --> 02:00:40,559
with um that biologically Rich compost

2759
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:42,279
that you made um that would be the only

2760
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:44,520
thing that I could really complain about

2761
02:00:42,279 --> 02:00:46,519
because I think you know based on our

2762
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:48,679
conversations um you did all of the

2763
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:50,639
steps you know correctly and again you

2764
02:00:48,679 --> 02:00:52,920
know nothing's perfect in nature so we

2765
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:55,118
don't have to try to be perfect perfect

2766
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:57,279
um your combinations of of materials

2767
02:00:55,118 --> 02:01:01,479
your effort I mean I loved the fact that

2768
02:00:57,279 --> 02:01:03,118
you smashed rocks I I I I love when you

2769
02:01:01,479 --> 02:01:05,359
called me and said I'm just going to get

2770
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:07,359
stone and bust rocks up and then day

2771
02:01:05,359 --> 02:01:10,078
later you called me back oh my God you

2772
02:01:07,359 --> 02:01:10,078
didn't warn

2773
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:16,119
me yeah so you know and and I'll

2774
02:01:13,719 --> 02:01:18,880
reiterate why you want Jagged edges the

2775
02:01:16,118 --> 02:01:23,039
more Jagged edges there are there's more

2776
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:25,599
surface area for the biology to grow out

2777
02:01:23,039 --> 02:01:28,399
its bofilm and begin to break that rock

2778
02:01:25,599 --> 02:01:31,039
down and when it's smooth it's basically

2779
02:01:28,399 --> 02:01:33,799
polished so that's the problem is the

2780
02:01:31,039 --> 02:01:35,960
polish doesn't really allow them to set

2781
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:38,800
up in those tiny little crevices and

2782
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:41,118
pores and little tiny micr cracks that

2783
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:43,679
that would have been um you know a

2784
02:01:41,118 --> 02:01:45,238
jagged edge so th though that was pretty

2785
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:47,480
much you know the only pieces of the

2786
02:01:45,238 --> 02:01:48,799
puzzle that I think um you know I just

2787
02:01:47,479 --> 02:01:51,359
want to make sure the listeners

2788
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,719
understand the reasons why um that that

2789
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:54,598
I encourage you to make your own

2790
02:01:52,719 --> 02:01:56,760
biological compost so this biological

2791
02:01:54,599 --> 02:01:59,920
compost are you what's it made out of is

2792
02:01:56,760 --> 02:02:01,840
it are were you did you mean like I like

2793
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:03,520
the parts of the cannabis plants that

2794
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:05,560
were not the flowers you would have

2795
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:09,239
liked to have seen me biologically

2796
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:11,320
compost the the sun leaves and the stem

2797
02:02:09,238 --> 02:02:13,839
and like all the other biological Parts

2798
02:02:11,319 --> 02:02:16,279
like after harvest is that your point

2799
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:17,960
yep get after harvest every time you

2800
02:02:16,279 --> 02:02:21,238
should be taking anything that you're

2801
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:23,520
not keeping and blend it with local

2802
02:02:21,238 --> 02:02:26,718
greens and Browns to the ratios we

2803
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:28,440
talked about um and get it as soaking

2804
02:02:26,719 --> 02:02:31,760
wet as you possibly can make a nice

2805
02:02:28,439 --> 02:02:34,598
little pile of it um get a compost

2806
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:37,480
thermometer monitor it um once you get

2807
02:02:34,599 --> 02:02:38,920
over the thermophilic process in other

2808
02:02:37,479 --> 02:02:41,439
words once it hits a temperature and

2809
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:42,599
then starts going down as soon as it

2810
02:02:41,439 --> 02:02:44,359
goes down

2811
02:02:42,599 --> 02:02:47,880
to

2812
02:02:44,359 --> 02:02:52,439
100° throw a whole bunch of seeds on it

2813
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:55,480
and let those seeds grow and put mile of

2814
02:02:52,439 --> 02:02:56,519
rizosphere throughout that compost pile

2815
02:02:55,479 --> 02:02:58,359
everyone's like oh you're you're

2816
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:00,400
stealing nutrients no you're not you're

2817
02:02:58,359 --> 02:03:03,279
growing out biology which is what you

2818
02:03:00,399 --> 02:03:05,000
really want and everything that grows

2819
02:03:03,279 --> 02:03:08,039
there is going to die there and fall

2820
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:11,719
back down and make you more compost so

2821
02:03:08,039 --> 02:03:14,198
that is the trick to really getting a

2822
02:03:11,719 --> 02:03:16,840
very biologically Rich compost that you

2823
02:03:14,198 --> 02:03:19,759
can use as a top dress because we lost

2824
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:22,800
you lost cadine exchange sites you lost

2825
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:25,480
organic matter uh between start and the

2826
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:28,320
the very end results so you need to put

2827
02:03:25,479 --> 02:03:30,879
that back in play so chips are great as

2828
02:03:28,319 --> 02:03:33,359
a as a way to keep that

2829
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:36,960
microclimate um in in the top of the

2830
02:03:33,359 --> 02:03:38,639
soil but it's also um it's not going to

2831
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:40,920
give you the the kind of nutrition and

2832
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:44,000
biology that a compost would have done

2833
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:46,719
in the same place right on fair enough

2834
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,279
so Leon thank you so much like let's see

2835
02:03:46,719 --> 02:03:50,118
I got a couple layers of thank you thank

2836
02:03:48,279 --> 02:03:53,599
you very much for taking your time with

2837
02:03:50,118 --> 02:03:56,078
me today and doing this this debrief of

2838
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:58,840
what the first cycle was like and and

2839
02:03:56,078 --> 02:04:00,279
how we thought our way through it cuz

2840
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:03,199
really we're not we're not really trying

2841
02:04:00,279 --> 02:04:06,118
to teach a specific recipe that you have

2842
02:04:03,198 --> 02:04:10,319
to use every time we're trying to share

2843
02:04:06,118 --> 02:04:13,839
a perspective of how these Horizons work

2844
02:04:10,319 --> 02:04:17,000
um indoors so that we can uh

2845
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:20,400
biomimicry um as much of the natural

2846
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:22,520
systems from the outdoors indoors um so

2847
02:04:20,399 --> 02:04:24,439
so so thank you for you know joining me

2848
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:26,079
for the show today but then also brother

2849
02:04:24,439 --> 02:04:28,759
thank you for spending your time with me

2850
02:04:26,078 --> 02:04:31,479
on this project you know the hours of

2851
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:33,679
phone calls and me calling you cuz I was

2852
02:04:31,479 --> 02:04:35,479
upset cuz something wasn't working right

2853
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:39,440
and you essentially just you know making

2854
02:04:35,479 --> 02:04:42,638
sure that I didn't like run my ship into

2855
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:44,198
an iceberg and so I I greatly appreciate

2856
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:46,599
both your experience and your

2857
02:04:44,198 --> 02:04:48,799
willingness to play with me oh it's my

2858
02:04:46,599 --> 02:04:50,440
pleasure Shango it was my pleasure and

2859
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:53,119
and I'm glad that there's another more

2860
02:04:50,439 --> 02:04:56,238
public example of this I get a lot of

2861
02:04:53,118 --> 02:04:58,598
thank yous and and DMS and texts and

2862
02:04:56,238 --> 02:05:01,598
emails about this and how it's made

2863
02:04:58,599 --> 02:05:04,199
people's lives um so much easier because

2864
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:06,400
you're not you're not fighting the plant

2865
02:05:04,198 --> 02:05:09,118
you're you're letting the plant guide

2866
02:05:06,399 --> 02:05:11,558
you and you're just participating in its

2867
02:05:09,118 --> 02:05:15,719
life which is you know that's kind of

2868
02:05:11,559 --> 02:05:18,239
the way nature works we we don't well

2869
02:05:15,719 --> 02:05:21,359
humans have tried to fight nature since

2870
02:05:18,238 --> 02:05:22,238
you know we got started expanding but in

2871
02:05:21,359 --> 02:05:24,118
reality

2872
02:05:22,238 --> 02:05:26,519
we were just stewards of the planet

2873
02:05:24,118 --> 02:05:28,719
before we you know got crazy and and you

2874
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:31,520
know just started expanding like you

2875
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:34,319
know or breeding like you know rabbits

2876
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:36,040
so um that's kind of why you know I

2877
02:05:34,319 --> 02:05:37,719
think so many people have thanked me is

2878
02:05:36,039 --> 02:05:40,399
because it's it's made their watering

2879
02:05:37,719 --> 02:05:42,920
practic is easier um they're they've got

2880
02:05:40,399 --> 02:05:44,799
healthier plants um the biological

2881
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:46,920
diversity is is much greater so

2882
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:48,480
therefore the Expressions that we're all

2883
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:51,639
looking for those you know second and

2884
02:05:48,479 --> 02:05:54,558
tertiary metabolites um are are are more

2885
02:05:51,639 --> 02:05:56,520
potent or or more expressed and you know

2886
02:05:54,559 --> 02:05:59,920
that's that's it I mean it's again
