2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,280
humans have been burning cannabis since

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,320
our earliest relationship with it cave

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,239
evidence shows that early humans would

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,640
take whole cannabis plants and put them

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,980
on small fires and caves and essentially

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,439
Hot Box the cave and then they would

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,960
have a mystical experience and done with

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,539
the right intentions we still can

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,760
we love smoking cannabis because the

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,679
lungs provide a speedy and efficient way

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,320
to get cannabinoids into our blood and

13
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:37,799
into our brain that's why smoking comes

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,140
on faster than any other method hell yes

15
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:43,078
there are at least two strong reasons to

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,140
consider vaporizers though the first is

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,939
that not everyone has lungs of Steel and

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,520
the longer we smoke hot plant material

19
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:53,218
and tar the more impact our lungs take

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,260
over the years there are also folks who

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,079
have other respiratory diseases like

22
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,899
COPD where cannabis smoking can be used

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,399
as a medicine but smoking anything at

24
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,978
all is impossible

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,560
for asthmatics like myself and other

26
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:09,599
folks with respiratory issues vaporizers

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,060
create a fun and effective method for us

28
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,099
to be able to use cannabis

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,200
the second strong reason to consider

30
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,298
vaporizers is how much improved The

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,340
Taste can be to be able to enjoy

32
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,840
cannabis flour without all the burning

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,020
plant material getting in the way of the

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,359
terpene profile is a great thing many of

35
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:30,780
us love the intense flavors of Dab Oil

36
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,640
without the plant as contaminant vaping

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,219
flowers is similar in that we are

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,900
inhaling the resin of the flower without

39
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,118
taking in all the burnt plant

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,680
particulate and tar that gets in the way

41
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,719
of true flavor

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,939
you've likely heard me talk about

43
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,700
cannabis from an asthmatic perspective

44
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:50,219
before both here on the podcast and on

45
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,759
the shaping fire YouTube channel as well

46
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:56,158
on shaping Fire episode 36 on cannabis

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,438
and breathing with Robert Litman we

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,960
discussed how best to inhale cannabis to

49
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:04,319
preserve your lungs how to incorporate

50
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,118
cannabis into asthma and COPD care and

51
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,118
we address the long time myth that

52
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:11,459
holding your hits gets you higher

53
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:12,900
spoiler is hypoxia not THC that makes

54
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,420
you feel higher

55
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,760
today's episode is a blend of cannabis

56
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:19,559
medicine ideas and cannabis engineering

57
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,359

you are listening to shapingfire and I'm

79
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:04,259
your host shangolos

80
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,318
my guest today is aerospace engineer

81
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:10,439
Mark Lewis Mark is a lifelong engineer

82
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,238
of systems machines and organizations he

83
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,098
has been an aerospace engineer for

84
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,120
Hughes space and Communications in Los

85
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:17,518
Angeles

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,959
looking for new challenges Mark joined

87
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,180
the Peace Corps and went into the

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,580
jungles of Fiji to teach science and

89
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,739
help with revitalizing schools there

90
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,360
this experience profoundly shaped his

91
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,700
views on the critical impact that

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,099
education plays in society which led him

93
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,318
to commit 15 years to improving K-12

94
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:36,539
education and becoming the Statewide

95
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,560
policy director for stem education in

96
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,199
Oregon

97
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,539
most recently though Mark Lewis is again

98
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,639
an engineer and inventor of Novel

99
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:47,280
vaporization devices for cannabis

100
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,500
products through his company Pearl Labs

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,140
his award-winning designs have been

102
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,840
honored by the 2022 course 77 Design

103
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:57,598
Awards and selected as the 2022 best

104
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,759
design vaporizer by Enigma

105
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,738
I discovered Mark through his first in

106
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,959
product class vaporizer invention called

107
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,719
the Neo the Neo can be used with any

108
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,158
pipe or bong or rig imagine lighting

109
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,438
your cannabis with a lighter like we

110
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,419
always have turning it upside down but

111
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,759
instead that lighter gives off really

112
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,459
intense radiant heat instead of flame

113
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,858
you just put his Vape later over your

114
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,060
flour or oil and it vaporizes there

115
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,279
isn't anything like it on the market

116
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,439
then I love mine but Mark is not here to

117
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,599
talk about his company at all today you

118
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,060
know I don't do company person or

119
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,100
product profiles on shaping fire we do

120
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,439
topics topics that you're interested in

121
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,540
so Marcus here is my science and

122
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,040
engineering expert to break down the

123
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,400
science and engineering behind modern

124
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,020
vaporizers without talking about his own

125
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:44,879
during the first set today we will

126
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:46,620
discuss why cannabis enthusiasts Vape

127
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,360
we'll talk about the advantages and

128
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,280
disadvantages and the differences

129
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,400
between burning cannabis flowers and oil

130
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,500
versus vaporizing them the second set is

131
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,239
devoted to engineering we will look at

132
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,160
the three families of vaporizer

133
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,139
technology that make up nearly all the

134
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,360
vaporizers available and then compare

135
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,120
and contrast them we will look at them

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,120
twice once for flower and once for oil

137
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,620
it's a big set with a lot of details you

138
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,019
will pretty much understand everything

139
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,660
you need to know about Vapes as a toker

140
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:17,879
after that the third set is short and we

141
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,699
focus specifically on the boiling point

142
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:23,100
myth that conflates evaporation and

143
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,600
boiling they are not the same and it

144
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,039
really impacts your experience with

145
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,259
vaporizers

146
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:30,538
welcome to shaping fire mark

147
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,038
so happy to be here Shango thanks for

148
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,899
having me on the show excellent all

149
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:35,939
right let's dive right into it you know

150
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:38,399
a lot of people

151
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,620
um feel kind of uh motivated and nearly

152
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,560
religious about their vaporizers once

153
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,478
they start using them but um you know a

154
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,538
lot of people don't understand the why

155
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,219
of vaporizers yet because in reality

156
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:52,620
vaporizers aren't used a ton in the

157
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,720
scene yet people are still mostly you

158
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,759
know lighting their cannabis with fire

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,039
and you know humans have been burning

160
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,680
cannabis with fire for thousands of

161
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:04,079
years to like great effect so let's

162
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,538
start by talking about the advantages uh

163
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,599
cannabis enthusiasts are after when they

164
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:11,399
start using a vape device instead of

165
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,860
combustion will you tell us a little bit

166
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:16,138
about those advantages yeah absolutely

167
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,319
well I think first and foremost there's

168
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:23,519
the health aspect right so anytime you

169
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,959
are actually combusting as the people on

170
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,680
the west coast and now the East Coast

171
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,918
know uh the detrimental effects of the

172
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,379
wildfires on their lungs and their eyes

173
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:37,818
you know smoke carries a lot of harmful

174
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:41,699
products in it the ash the soot the tars

175
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:45,660
and so first and foremost the process of

176
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:47,900
vaporization removes a lot of those or

177
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,500
almost all of those detrimental

178
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:55,379
compounds from what you're inhaling so

179
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,899
by and large they are healthier than

180
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,579
than smoking they're also more

181
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:03,198
efficacious there's been some research

182
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:07,439
studies uh about vaporizing flower

183
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:10,319
versus smoking it and how much is

184
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,478
bioavailable how much of the medicinals

185
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,060
and the active ingredients get absorbed

186
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:18,418
into your bloodstream it's it's much

187
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:21,180
higher than than smoking so there's the

188
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:25,680
bioavailability of the compounds which

189
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:28,199
is also very effective and then I think

190
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,418
the the smell is one of the things that

191
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,180
you know well personally I love the

192
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:35,698
smell of you know cannabis being

193
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,160
combusted uh but it's a little powerful

194
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:41,520
for some in it and it lingers because

195
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,979
the smells the smoke actually gets onto

196
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:48,478
your clothes or onto your into your room

197
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:50,519
so so the smell of a vapor vaporizers

198
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,860
um tends to be a quite a bit more

199
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,978
discreet

200
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,979
yeah and then if you're talking about

201
00:07:54,978 --> 00:08:00,899
the vape pens the cartridges then those

202
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:04,079
are very very discreet and very

203
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:07,439
convenient for people to use it's really

204
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:11,038
been a benefit to cannabis uh portable

205
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:14,819
vaporizers that they became popular the

206
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:18,300
same time as nicotine vaporizers because

207
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:21,419
people are so used to people busting out

208
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:24,780
nicotine vaporizers that I can pull out

209
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:26,519
my travel vaporizer anywhere and unless

210
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:28,679
they're close enough to smell the exhale

211
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,338
they you know people around me have no

212
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,778
idea so that's been a real you know

213
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:36,719
Advantage for all of us who you know

214
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:39,059
attend events or or even just walk along

215
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,180
the street yeah that's a real Boon for

216
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:44,579
sure yeah um so let's let's talk about

217
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,259
um the the advantage also to people

218
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,300
who've got pre-existing conditions like

219
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:51,059
me you know I like like you know people

220
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:53,879
who listen to this show often know that

221
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:57,000
that I have very severe asthma and

222
00:08:53,879 --> 00:09:00,179
because I have a respiratory condition I

223
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,100
have to be gentle on my lungs and you

224
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:05,278
know I still smoke joints but like I I

225
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,139
know after I've smoked a joint right

226
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,000
um yeah and like you know

227
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,379
um when when you go when I go to events

228
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,899
like you know Emerald cup or something

229
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,338
where you know you gotta puff tough the

230
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,799
whole weekend

231
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,200
um you know I really feel that

232
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,159
um for several days afterwards and and

233
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,879
for for many people with asthma or COPD

234
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:31,620
if we want to inhale our cannabis

235
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:34,500
um vaporizers are a uh fantastic option

236
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,560
um because it's so less harsh on our

237
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,539
lungs yeah absolutely yeah it's missing

238
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:42,838
all those Ash particles that that Lodge

239
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:44,819
into your your lungs um yeah and and

240
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,740
certainly the heavier tars and oils are

241
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,839
also removed from it so it's it's much

242
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,339
much easier on on your lungs you know

243
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,620
when people when people talk about like

244
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,240
the the the

245
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,000
unhealthy aspects of smoking almost

246
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,500
everybody just goes to cancer right but

247
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,899
it's it's interesting to hear you

248
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,299
delineate that you know the the the the

249
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:07,080
bits of smoke and the particles in the

250
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:09,359
smoke and um the tars and all of those

251
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,060
things on their own have their own kind

252
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,620
of impacts even if they don't eventually

253
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:17,159
lead to cancer

254
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,839
yeah for sure and and I try to really

255
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:23,159
avoid

256
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,959
um you know uh criticizing people who

257
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:26,159
who smoke because I I don't think there

258
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,018
should be any sort of judgment and

259
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,879
there's so much Social stigma around

260
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,759
smoking these days that I don't think

261
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,980
that's the reason why not to smoke I

262
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:37,259
think it's really you know from a health

263
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,860
and taste and and the bioavailability

264
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:43,200
for me you know I it's uh it's a much

265
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,600
more complex experience than smoking

266
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,399
yeah and and we'll get to it later but

267
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,459
it's also a different high too so it is

268
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,320
completely yeah um so but we also need

269
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:55,679
to be fair right because even though

270
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,560
vape's still uh even though Vapes are so

271
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:01,559
improved for people's lungs

272
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,479
um it's not without its challenges right

273
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,799
um it's still heated air we're still in

274
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,120
we're still inhaling superheated air

275
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,778
yeah by the time

276
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,000
um it well compared to smoke uh which

277
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:17,759
you know you can can reach temperatures

278
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,980
you're inhaling well right at the Embers

279
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,039
you're you're talking you know over a

280
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,539
thousand degrees uh at the Ember but uh

281
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,458
you know if you're smoking a joint

282
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:28,740
you're you're looking at five six

283
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:31,979
hundred degrees uh in your mouth and

284
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:35,220
with vaporizers you're you're well down

285
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,579
into you know the hundreds uh you know

286
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,860
into the low hundreds you know 180 200

287
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,479
degrees at the most I would think by the

288
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,399
time it enters your mouth I have not

289
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,420
done put a thermocouple in my mouth to

290
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:51,120
measure that paper but uh yeah it's I

291
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:53,699
don't experience that that uh lung

292
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,679
irritation from heat all right so then

293
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,720
so then maybe I'm misattributing you

294
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,639
know so like I talk about vaporizers a

295
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,459
lot with just like regular heads right

296
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,439
not usually with Scientists like you and

297
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:06,239
we so you know it's it's not uncommon

298
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,339
for somebody to say oh my gosh I've been

299
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,759
I've been hit getting my vape so much

300
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:14,760
that my lungs feel crispy all right so

301
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:18,059
what do you have any suggestion on what

302
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:20,879
uh what is the attribute of a vaporizer

303
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:23,278
that might make my lungs feel crispy

304
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,838
especially if it's a flower Vape like

305
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,419
you know my old school packs or

306
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,100
something

307
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:31,860
yeah to make your lungs feel crispy

308
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,040
you're well uh we're gonna get into I

309
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,300
think some of the the the

310
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:38,099
things that are happening out of at a

311
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:39,719
micro level but

312
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,899
um if you're really toasting your herbs

313
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,899
strongly you probably are

314
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:49,220
um uh changing the nature of the

315
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:53,639
terpenes and the cannabinoids into other

316
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:56,519
thicker oils that can reside then in

317
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,560
your lungs and have that heavy feel to

318
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,778
it and then certainly with cartridge

319
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,359
based

320
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:07,439
vaporizers the carrier oils make a big

321
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,480
difference and we think we know the

322
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,639
background around the ivali Scara a

323
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,240
couple of years ago with the vitamin E

324
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,240
acetate

325
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:19,200
um and that's exactly what was happening

326
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,539
right is is the carrier oils were were

327
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,820
impacting your lung experience

328
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,439
I think it's also fair if we're going to

329
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,860
be talking about the downsides of vaping

330
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:33,360
generally to talk about what a uh you

331
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:36,139
know plastic battery waste and trash

332
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,480
from packaging nightmare cartridges are

333
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:41,399
it's such a drag and you know

334
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,459
um for years I I mean I'm not sure if

335
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:46,320
cartridges have solved this yet but for

336
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:48,500
years I would have a little Ziploc with

337
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,839
you know partially

338
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,519
finished Vape cartridges that just had

339
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,320
all of this waste in there and I wasn't

340
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,539
even going to be able to get the oil out

341
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,560
anymore and it just seemed so wasteful

342
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:03,120
like like doob tubes right yeah for sure

343
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,819
yeah

344
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,980
um uh and then uh I guess we also have

345
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,220
to be careful about

346
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,100
um you know the terpenes for either oil

347
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,560
Vapes or for

348
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,700
um you know even I guess that would be

349
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,419
the only kind because people don't

350
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,860
really add Terps to flour I hope but

351
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:24,599
um you know we don't really there really

352
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,959
aren't a lot of studies on what it is

353
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,480
what it means to to vape

354
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:33,599
the amount of terpenes that are common

355
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,759
in an oil and

356
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,000
um you know terpenes are by their very

357
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,458
nature caustic and it'll it we won't

358
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,698
know until it's too late if it's

359
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:46,500
actually unhealthy to do that and um I'm

360
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:48,719
sure you've come across that a lot as as

361
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,839
you have done your research

362
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,920
yeah well I never recommend that people

363
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,899
add pure terpenes uh to

364
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:02,458
um anything that they're smoking or or

365
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:06,120
vaporizing uh because they are solvents

366
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:07,739
right so if you think about uh you know

367
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,100
limonene

368
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,299
um it's it's a wonderful solvent it

369
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,920
helps clean your hands it can get

370
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:15,599
stickers off it can do all sorts of

371
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,979
wonderful things

372
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:23,060
um but when you're when you experience

373
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:26,339
terpenes and and we've you know group

374
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:29,338
you grow up smelling flowers right your

375
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,680
entire life and the history of humanity

376
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:33,899
we've had a very rich interaction with

377
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,259
with terpenes in a very beneficial way

378
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:41,639
so in very small amounts

379
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:43,740
terpenes are phenomenal right so keeping

380
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,159
keeping as close to Nature as possible

381
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,440
is is kind of my rule right on so so

382
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:51,240
let's talk about that right because

383
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,100
um it's interesting because if we're

384
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,639
talking this idea of keeping it as close

385
00:15:53,100 --> 00:16:00,180
to Nature and you know if if we humans

386
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,278
are you know a a thing of Nature and we

387
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:05,278
are a part of Nature and we are not

388
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:07,620
excluded from nature the way that we

389
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:10,679
have been using this natural plant with

390
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,139
cannabis for thousands of years have

391
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,299
been you know by fire you know going

392
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:17,519
into the you know pulling out the plant

393
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:20,039
and and going into the cave and putting

394
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,560
it on the fire and filling up the cave

395
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:25,259
with smoke and and you know then then

396
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,000
learning to you know craft little pipes

397
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:28,919
when we could control the fire better

398
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,440
and and then of course you know

399
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,719
eventually developing hash so we're so

400
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,360
we're able to store it better and and

401
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,399
not burn and combust as much of the

402
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,419
plant material

403
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:45,240
um and and you know so many of us love

404
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:48,299
that profound Good Taste of of

405
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,120
combusting you know quality herb that

406
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:54,419
has been grown and cured

407
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:58,139
um properly and and then yet at the same

408
00:16:54,419 --> 00:17:01,559
time as we start to use vaporizers now

409
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:04,859
I'm enjoying the same plant in an

410
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:06,500
entirely different way

411
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:10,318
um that's giving me a different

412
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:12,179
experience of the terpenes and and we'll

413
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,578
we'll talk more about the the science

414
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,679
aspects of it later on

415
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:18,000
um but but it's it's it's an entirely

416
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,339
different taste where there's there's

417
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,859
almost a needed transition period when

418
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:25,558
somebody goes from flower to vaporizing

419
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,779
because it is so different would you

420
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,359
describe the difference

421
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:33,599
um in in taste experience I guess

422
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:35,939
between combusting and vaporizing the

423
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,339
same flour

424
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,259
wow

425
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:43,558
that's not hard

426
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:46,259
um well I I would concur I uh first and

427
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:50,220
foremost with the experience of and

428
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:53,160
rituals of uh consuming a nice joint or

429
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,259
or your pipe or your bong I think we

430
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,440
have

431
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:59,759
learned to

432
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,720
manage our experiences with those

433
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,400
devices and with combusting by

434
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,839
um

435
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,059
you know that we we get a certain

436
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,339
feedback that helps us can you know

437
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:13,918
manage our experience and when you're

438
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:15,959
shifting over to for example flower

439
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,059
vaporization

440
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,100
um the feedback that you're getting is

441
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:23,700
is much much different your lungs are

442
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:26,579
not experiencing that intense hypoxia

443
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,720
you know the the uh you know

444
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:32,879
constriction and the lack of oxygen

445
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:38,220
instead you're taking a deep breath

446
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:40,440
um of a vapor that is rich in uh the

447
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:44,339
cannabinoids as well as the terpenoids

448
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:47,820
and it's it's it feels gentler but that

449
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:49,619
can be deceptive as well because uh as I

450
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:52,379
mentioned earlier it can get you higher

451
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:55,019
so you have to you have to learn to

452
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,299
manage your feedback differently

453
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:59,819
with vaporizers than you do with with

454
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:01,859
our traditional modes of consumption I I

455
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:04,019
like that uh use of the word feedback

456
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:05,339
because I would say the number one

457
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:07,139
complaint that I've heard from people

458
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:11,699
who are just starting

459
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:14,340
um uh using non-cartridge vaporizers is

460
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:20,340
that like did I did I get a hit you know

461
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:22,859
because the the hits with a low temp

462
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:25,319
um you know handheld vaporizer I mean

463
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:28,279
heck even some of the desktop ones uh

464
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:32,159
it's it it feels

465
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:33,960
the inhale feels so much thinner

466
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,600
um and it's weird because so many people

467
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,700
who are developing vaporizers and then

468
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:40,439
because we people keep asking for them

469
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,960
we want vaporizers that will give us

470
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,080
clouds right right right and like in

471
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:50,579
like clouds are an aesthetic experience

472
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:52,678
uh of of both feeling a good hit like

473
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:55,019
like feedback you were talking about and

474
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:58,080
also the satisfaction of exhaling and

475
00:19:55,019 --> 00:20:00,119
seeing this Cloud right which which

476
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,918
traditionally is is part of the

477
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,538
satisfaction from taking a bong rip

478
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,580
right totally

479
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:07,140
um so would you talk a little bit about

480
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:10,319
why

481
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,520
um you know why that hit is is thinner

482
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,960
and I guess you kind of already

483
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,500
addressed that because there's there's

484
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,480
not as much particular in there I guess

485
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,980
I would like you to talk to more like um

486
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,679
uh

487
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,160
are we missing anything from that

488
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:29,640
thinner Feeling Hit

489
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,600
I don't think so from my perspective I

490
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,840
think

491
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:36,119
um you again when when you have smoke

492
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:39,178
and it has the Ash and particulates and

493
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:42,000
stuff in there your lungs constrict and

494
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:46,140
so you get that intensity

495
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,440
um a feeling of of an of being a little

496
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:52,919
more intense because you're you're your

497
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,500
lungs are responding to uh these things

498
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:58,559
that you know are contaminants

499
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:02,099
um from its perspective uh whereas when

500
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:05,160
you're vaporizing flour uh then your

501
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:07,678
lungs are are not feeling that uh

502
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,320
intensity of invasion you're you're

503
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,660
getting things that it recognizes and

504
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,939
they're binding to the abioli and then

505
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,700
being moved into your uh into your

506
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,919
bloodstream and so

507
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,019
um so that's one aspect of it to the

508
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,280
clouds I think that is a learned

509
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:28,619
feedback that we are judging in our

510
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,359
experience based on these clouds but at

511
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:33,959
the same time your your lungs can only

512
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:37,500
absorb so many compounds at a time so

513
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,779
anything that you're exhaling with a

514
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,759
vaporizer you're exhaling those active

515
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:44,279
ingredients if you're seeing a cloud

516
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,859
that's kind of wasted byproducts because

517
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,839
you your lungs haven't taken them up and

518
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:50,699
and delivered them to your bloodstream

519
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,859
so that's that's another way of thinking

520
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,740
about it and at the same time there's

521
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:58,619
always been a a bit of theater in in

522
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,720
cannabis right and so we enjoy that as

523
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:02,279
part of the social aspects yeah that's

524
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,600
that's really true

525
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:08,399
um all right so uh if

526
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:10,319
all right I've got two sides of this

527
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,940
coin and so I'm gonna give you the coin

528
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,099
and then you can approach it however you

529
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,360
want all right on on one side of the

530
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:18,359
coin

531
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,759
um you know we're taking these uh these

532
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,779
these thinner hits I'll say

533
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:27,298
um and and you know you say sometimes

534
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:29,759
they they'll actually get us higher

535
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:31,918
right but then on the other side of that

536
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,740
coin are many people when they first

537
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,360
start vaping they feel like one hit is

538
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,400
not as satisfying for them and they

539
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,079
don't get as high and so they're all

540
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,220
like well you know I need to take like

541
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:48,259
you know two hits uh or three hits of my

542
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:52,620
my flower vaporizer to get the same

543
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:55,619
feedback as I would from my bong

544
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:57,959
um but then also some days you just go

545
00:22:55,619 --> 00:23:00,418
and you have you know one hit of the

546
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,720
vaporizer and you've got this like

547
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:07,380
really like Speedy bright sativa kind of

548
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,720
high even potentially from you know a

549
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,059
non-equatorial plan right that something

550
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,860
that's that's more mercy and Rich so so

551
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:17,700
what I'd like you to kind of just speak

552
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:19,379
to is this idea of of the hits being

553
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,440
thinner and so we have to take more of

554
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,900
them and yet the misnomer in that that

555
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,779
like we actually can get get wicked high

556
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,120
wicked fast from vaporizers too like

557
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:33,178
like how like as somebody who studies

558
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:35,339
the technology and the and and the user

559
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:37,798
experience how do you kind of resolve

560
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:40,379
those because they're all true right

561
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:45,058
yeah they're all they're all true uh

562
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:47,580
yeah so for the same let's let's put

563
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:48,839
some boundaries on on before we go with

564
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:52,678
this

565
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:56,639
um so for the same amount of herb

566
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:59,580
um I will claim and I think research

567
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,100
backs me up on this that you will get

568
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:04,500
higher if you completely vaporize the

569
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:08,459
same amount of herb

570
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,259
um as smoking but it's over as you

571
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,579
mentioned over

572
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:17,460
far more hits I guess maybe you know

573
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:19,859
double or triple the hits so that's one

574
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,579
aspect of it

575
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:23,339
um

576
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:26,399
yeah and yet paradoxically it's it's

577
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:29,519
more effective so uh the where I'm

578
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,080
actually going is when you first load a

579
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,139
fresh Bowl

580
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:36,619
um with a vaporizer uh you we haven't

581
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,520
talked about decarbing it yet and

582
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:41,699
decarboxylation doesn't take place

583
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:45,359
immediately like it does with fire and

584
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:48,600
so your early pulls are going to

585
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:53,658
evaporate some of the thca without

586
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:56,939
necessarily converting it to THC and so

587
00:24:53,659 --> 00:25:00,840
yes your first couple of poles are

588
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:03,659
probably going to feel a little thinner

589
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:06,779
and maybe not affect you but that third

590
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:11,340
fourth fifth sixth are going to be fully

591
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:13,139
decarbed and and a lot more intense

592
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:16,079
oh that's so obvious but I have never

593
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,580
thought of that before huh that's really

594
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,339
interesting so

595
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:23,579
so I hear that two different ways number

596
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:26,418
one I like it because if my first hits

597
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:30,720
are going to be offering me more thca

598
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:33,840
cbga cbda then my ladder hits that means

599
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,940
I'm going to get all these acid forms of

600
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:39,178
the plant which are healthy and good for

601
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:41,960
me yep but the longer it stays in the

602
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:45,538
vaporization chamber the heating chamber

603
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,840
the the cannabinoids will be changing to

604
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:53,400
the non-acid versions and so I'm getting

605
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:55,500
a perhaps a wider array of that and and

606
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,620
for for and for the listeners who are

607
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,298
not um familiar with

608
00:25:57,619 --> 00:26:02,939
decarboxylation

609
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:05,220
essentially what you need to do to make

610
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,558
THC and intoxicant is that you have to

611
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,960
heat it to a certain point that changes

612
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:11,639
changes it from an acid to a non-acid

613
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,319
and you know when we normally smoke

614
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,980
bowls or

615
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:18,839
um smoke joints there's so much fire in

616
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,538
in that joint that it happens instantly

617
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,579
but as Mark was talking about earlier

618
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:25,558
we're not we're not burning at a

619
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:28,199
thousand degrees we're talking about

620
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:31,019
more like a couple hundred and so that

621
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,360
process doesn't happen instantly

622
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:35,339
um so then the second thing I'm thinking

623
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:38,158
not only am I happy about getting all

624
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:40,980
these acid forms of the cannabinoids on

625
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,539
the flip side if I'm dollar conscious

626
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,900
that's going to really annoy the hell

627
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:48,298
out of me because I could see that as

628
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:50,519
wasting cannabinoids because if I'm if

629
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:53,099
I'm money conscious and I'm trying to

630
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:55,980
get you know the most bang for my buck I

631
00:26:53,099 --> 00:27:00,480
want to get high I actually will be

632
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:02,640
disappointed that I'm smoking THC a

633
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,500
um like the first hitter too so it

634
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,220
really it really is different um

635
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:10,380
consumer to Consumer yeah I think

636
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,179
um I I have never experienced

637
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,179
disappointment uh with flower

638
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:19,500
vaporization I'll just say Shango

639
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:21,600
um and uh your through vaporization and

640
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,819
again when we get into the mechanics of

641
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,918
of different kinds of modes of

642
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:28,079
vaporization

643
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,840
um you know we can see how they'll

644
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:34,619
behave differently but uh

645
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:36,418
often you unlike with fire when you're

646
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,699
combusting you've got a lot of side

647
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:41,520
stream you've got a lot of wastage and

648
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:44,278
with many vaporizers

649
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:47,759
um certainly the the more reputable ones

650
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:51,440
uh you're not heat actually heating the

651
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:55,740
Cannabis when you're not inhaling and so

652
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:58,679
the your bowl goes a lot lot longer and

653
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,679
from an efficiency standpoint you're the

654
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,538
over the overall amount of product that

655
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,120
you are going to be purchasing in a

656
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:09,298
month to manage your health and

657
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:11,579
well-being is likely to drop

658
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:14,460
significantly

659
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:16,678
I see so it's a it's a much more complex

660
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,980
algorithm that I was giving credit to

661
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,320
and also as far as like the wastage goes

662
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,620
um it's it's

663
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:29,158
uh it's always noticed how much smaller

664
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:32,158
the heating compartments are on uh

665
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:34,559
vaporizers as they are like from your

666
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,840
hand blown glass slides that can take

667
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,639
you know a thumb size gram nug in it

668
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:40,619
right and then you go over to your vape

669
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,778
and it's asking you to take like you

670
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:45,178
know one seventh of that or yeah one

671
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:47,038
tenth of that and then and then grind it

672
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:49,220
and then put it in there it it it

673
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,240
usually looks like a

674
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,980
opposity is I think that's the right use

675
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,200
of that word it looks like such a small

676
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,480
amount of weed um but then and then but

677
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,220
then you know still gets you high and so

678
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,599
it's it's confusing it's less weed it

679
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,000
gets you high but you need to take more

680
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:05,699
hits and you're getting a lot more thca

681
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,679
but over time you're you're wasting less

682
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,679
so it's actually budgetary smart yes

683
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:18,599
oh man all right so

684
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,058
um all right so let's let's wrap this up

685
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:22,859
so I wanted to start this first set with

686
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:25,859
um you know conversations about you know

687
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:27,959
the why of It kind of generally but um

688
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:29,759

689

break and then when we come back we're

692
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,399
gonna get into a more serious discussion

693
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:41,640
about uh the engineering behind

694
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:44,038

award-winning cannabis seeds that come

707
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,659
from the analytical breeding program of

708
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:12,839
Seth and Eric Crawford who founded

their high THC seeds are extraordinary

716
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:35,159
in that they will start to flower at 16

717
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:37,200
and a half hours of daylight instead of

718
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:40,320
the typical 14 and a half hours of

719
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,240
daylight that means in most regions your

720
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,519
plants will start to flower outdoors in

721

the middle of July instead of the middle

722
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,319
of August which means these photo period

723

and are in the process of fundraising

832
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,520

welcome back you are listening to

853
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:49,439
shapingfire I am your host shangolos and

854
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:52,199
my guest today is aerospace engineer

855
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,619
Mark Lewis so during the first set we

856
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:58,739
talked about why we Vape what the in

857
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:00,059
cannabis enthusiasts experience is and

858
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,739
you know some of the some of the

859
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:03,659
challenges and work throughs for those

860
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:06,539
but we're going to get into more the

861
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:09,679
nitty-gritty of the engineering behind

862
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:13,320
um both flour and oil vaporizers now

863
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:15,539
both so that you can you know just be a

864
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,859
little deeper on this this very

865
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:19,380
important aspect of the you know

866
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:22,319
cannabis culture but also this should

867
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:24,960
help provide a bit of a you know a

868
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,700
Shopping Guide for you as you

869
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,619
um you know as you learn about the the

870
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:30,480
different types of vaporizers and and

871
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:32,820
you can figure out what what you might

872
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,400
be interested in uh should you decide to

873
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,838
pick one up so Mark you know you know

874
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,599
there's a lot of different approaches

875
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,578
designing vaporizers and there are so

876
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,780
many coming out on the market all the

877
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,160
time now

878
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:47,880
um and and we're going to talk about

879
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:50,279
flower Vapes and first and then vaping

880
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,619
oil second because because they really

881
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,500
are like different things so so let's

882
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:58,079
talk about flower Vapes so like do

883
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,300
flower Vapes fall neatly into a few

884
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,039
different categories so that we can kind

885
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,780
of bunch them up and talk about them or

886
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:06,420
is there so much for a variability

887
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,320
modeled a model that we have to like

888
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,820
take them one by one God help us

889
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:14,940
well not all vaporizers are created

890
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:17,640
equal for sure Shango um and when it

891
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,519
comes to flower vaporizers there are two

892
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:22,858
primary categories uh and those are

893
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:26,519
convection based vaporizers and

894
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:28,559
conduction based vaporizers now anyone

895
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:30,780
who stood around a campfire has also

896
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,239
experienced radiant heat before and

897
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:36,060
that's you know heat transfer at a

898
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:38,939
distance if you will and

899
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:42,000
um some vaporizers uh might include that

900
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:45,059
and that is certainly a an effect that

901
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,679
uh impacts sort of the the internal

902
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:51,838
working of of a vaporizer

903
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:55,199
to summarize you know just briefly the

904
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,940
differentiation between the two modes

905
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,098
um honestly I'm going to encourage you

906
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,139
to not be necessarily that brief right

907
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:03,000
like we don't necessarily need to do a

908
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:04,980
dissertation but this conduction versus

909
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,920
Convent convection thing that I think

910
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:11,579
that you're about to wade into like this

911
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,619
is key right so right so so so take your

912
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:14,940
time so that we can all pick up on this

913
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,440
because just the fact that conduction

914
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,900
and convection are so similar

915
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,420
immediately confuses people right out of

916
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,920
the gates and so so like so like take

917
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,180
your time because I think this is this

918
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,320
is a chunky bit

919
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:31,440
sure sure okay well you know in short

920
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:35,579
conduction is a heat transfer through

921
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,858
touch right so if you are a conduction

922
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:40,619
based vaporizer has an oven it has a

923
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:43,019
chamber uh either made of metal or

924
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:46,440
ceramic and you place your Herb in in

925
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:48,059
that and the vaporizer heats up that

926
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,400
oven

927
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:52,920
um and so your herb is being heated

928
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,920
through the from the walls of that

929
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,559
little oven of that chamber and that's

930
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,900
conduction so it's being heated largely

931
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:03,659
by touch

932
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:05,820
a convection-based vaporizer is sort of

933
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:09,239
like a convection oven or an air fryer

934
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:10,760
you're heating up the air and then that

935
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:13,858
is being

936
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,720
transported or pulled or pushed through

937
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:19,679
your herb

938
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:23,519
um and that hot air then extracts uh or

939
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:26,480
evaporates the various compounds

940
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:30,358
so conduction is actually your flower

941
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,099
touching the heating piece and

942
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:36,119
convection is

943
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:38,338
somewhere up the up the chamber the the

944
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:41,000
the air is being heated and then you're

945
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:43,619
sucking that hot heat towards the flower

946
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,900
and the heat is touching the flower

947
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:48,059
instead of the metal or the ceramic

948
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,579
right the air is flowing through the hot

949
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:52,920
air is flowing through and evaporating

950
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:55,619
the compounds the volatile compounds

951
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,119
okay and then the Third Kind was radiant

952
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:59,338
where

953
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,579
um there is there is uh some kind of

954
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:05,820
device that's that's uh itself just hot

955
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:08,460
and you're I'm putting it in in general

956
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:12,480
proximity but it's not it's it's neither

957
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:14,220
touching the flower nor far away right

958
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,338
okay

959
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:21,259
um so can you give us a little bit of

960
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:25,500
explanation on the conduction convection

961
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:27,540
timeline because you know I know that

962
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,400
generally speaking people consider one

963
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:31,079
better than the other but but I would

964
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,200
like you to just kind of

965
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:38,160
um explain the the beginning of

966
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:39,299
vaporizers design what was first and

967
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:41,699
then and then how they've kind of

968
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,280
evolved and and while not everybody

969
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:47,159
likes the same kind of vaporizers kind

970
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,560
of where the people are responding in

971
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:52,019
the market

972
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:55,380
yeah I think the earliest vaporizers

973
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:57,239
that I'm aware of are are certainly

974
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,700
um you know they played around in the

975
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:03,539
70s with with heat guns

976
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:06,779
um and uh you know just delivering the

977
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:08,460
hot air uh that evolved to some of the

978
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,960
whip-based

979
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,079
um vaporizers like the vapor Brothers

980
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:17,280
the early boxes with uh I still have my

981
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:19,500
vapor Robert's box man yeah and uh you

982
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,660
know Bert there he's he's a wizard he's

983
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,280
one of the grandfathers of of uh

984
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:25,500
vaporizers he's a really good guy

985
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,660
understands all of this

986
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,858
um those were were largely convection

987
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:30,358
based

988
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:33,539
um vaporizers so they were heating the

989
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:37,199
air and it was flowing through your herb

990
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:40,980
um now when it started to move to more

991
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:44,939
portable uh kind of devices it's a lot

992
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:49,440
easier to manufacture in small you know

993
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:52,380
compact designs uh to engineer a

994
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,099
conduction based vaporizer so to heat up

995
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:58,500
the oven throw your Herb in that oven

996
00:41:55,099 --> 00:42:00,539
something on the market a cup some of

997
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,960
them ones like the packs

998
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:05,338
um is is largely a conduction based

999
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,139
vaporizer

1000
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:09,480
and so how we want how we'll picture

1001
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:11,159
that is that all of these various

1002
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,639
vaporizers where it's got some kind of

1003
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:16,858
little lid and uh you put your flower in

1004
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,319
there and it's it's actually you know

1005
00:42:16,858 --> 00:42:21,779
touching it against

1006
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,059
um steel or ceramic and then you're

1007
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,560
putting the top back on

1008
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:27,259
um they all kind of fall in the same

1009
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:30,358
category no matter what they look like

1010
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:32,640
uh there's a sizable portion

1011
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:37,619
um but there's others on the markets

1012
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:39,838
that are hybrids and and do a lot of the

1013
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:42,358
heating of the air you know the crafty

1014
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:46,259
and mighty by stores and Beckle

1015
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:48,598
um they will you know keep the air but

1016
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:51,780
there's also a conduction component to

1017
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:53,760
their design so some of the heat you

1018
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,519
know is transmitted up to the walls of

1019
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,800
the chamber as well so they're both

1020
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:01,259
introducing hot air as well as

1021
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,339
conduction from the sides

1022
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:07,500
um and trying to then get an even uh

1023
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:10,279
vaporization of all the products that's

1024
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:13,019
a good point for me to not be over

1025
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,319
generalizing and and make it look like

1026
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:17,039
they're these are really such

1027
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:20,338
um

1028
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:22,139
separated Solutions because because

1029
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:25,500
you're right you know like everybody is

1030
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:28,440
in is inventing and trying to find the

1031
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:31,260
the technology blend that works best for

1032
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,240
their product and and and so anybody

1033
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:35,940
who's gonna buy one make sure you

1034
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:38,159
understand the one that you want to get

1035
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:40,858
directly and not you know just something

1036
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,299
very general that you you know that you

1037
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:44,900
read generally about conduction or

1038
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,980
whatever right right

1039
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,119
I'm all right I interrupted you please

1040
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,900
continue

1041
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:53,160
uh well I was going to say just to to

1042
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:56,880
highlight some of the differences when

1043
00:43:53,159 --> 00:44:00,838
you actually have a hot

1044
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,640
um hot material touching your herb you

1045
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:06,000
have a danger of burning it right

1046
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:07,858
because they have to compensate by

1047
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,800
delivering a lot more thermal energy

1048
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:15,179
through the walls in order to have it

1049
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,400
then cook if you will the herb that's in

1050
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:20,940
the middle of the chamber so you have a

1051
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,619
much higher likelihood of over roasting

1052
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,318
um your herb and getting that kind of

1053
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:27,180
burnt popcorn taste that some people

1054
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:30,420
complain about I do not care for the

1055
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:32,539
toasty no no I'm a light roast kind of

1056
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:35,700
guy

1057
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:38,338
uh so so you so if if you're going to

1058
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:41,818
get um you know more of an opportunity

1059
00:44:38,338 --> 00:44:44,099
of the toastiness with conduction

1060
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:48,239
um uh you would not get that with

1061
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:51,119
convection because the heated air is

1062
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:53,338
coming in contact with your the entirety

1063
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:57,000
of your flower mass at the same time

1064
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:59,880
right uh correct um well it's it's

1065
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,460
impacting the the wherever the inlet

1066
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,519
side is it's getting a blast of the

1067
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:08,338
heated air you know first that that

1068
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:10,619
particular part of the herb is going to

1069
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:13,380
get the heat blast first but then it's

1070
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:17,039
going to be pulled through uh your herb

1071
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:20,160
now in a convection based vaporizer you

1072
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:23,219
can also pump up the power so much that

1073
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:25,139
uh you do you know over roast it as well

1074
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:27,239
so if you're up at combustion level

1075
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:29,400
temperatures for that air it will

1076
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:31,979
certainly combust on you

1077
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,079
but most vaporizers try to avoid that

1078
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,240
well you would really need to have your

1079
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,380
temp like really cranked up at that you

1080
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:39,838
would have to have it cranked up yeah

1081
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:41,818
yeah all right so let's go back to your

1082
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,199
timeline that you're giving us

1083
00:45:41,818 --> 00:45:45,239
um you know you gave you talked to us

1084
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,399
about the Box Vapes and then the you

1085
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:49,559
know the first I'll say real

1086
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,599
breakthrough

1087
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:53,519
um you know to the consumer Market Vape

1088
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,440
of the packs

1089
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:57,059
um and then and then things continue on

1090
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,980
to Convention so please please pick it

1091
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:01,078
up

1092
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:02,579
uh yeah well I think a lot of the things

1093
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:06,539
that you're seeing on the market now are

1094
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:11,220
variations of a very similar approach

1095
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:13,980
um a lot of vaporizers are trying to

1096
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:17,699
um portray flexibility uh through

1097
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:19,740
incorporation of different uh apps

1098
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:21,318
um you know so that you can control the

1099
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:25,379
the temperature settings

1100
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:27,779
and we can talk about you know whether

1101
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:31,079
or not they can actually do that or not

1102
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:33,900
um most vaporizers uh are able to you

1103
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:35,818
can set a particular setting and Vary

1104
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,920
those with an app or directly through

1105
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:39,358
the button control let's go ahead and

1106
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,380
have that conversation now because I was

1107
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,659
going to ask you that in two questions

1108
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,640
anyway you know these these temp

1109
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:46,920
controls and I know we're kind of like

1110
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:49,618
talking about the entirety of the market

1111
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,019
so that's not really fair but generally

1112
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:54,420
speaking are these temp controls to be

1113
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:56,639
believed because

1114
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,099
um you know unless I'm paying a good

1115
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,719
penny you know for a vape and you know

1116
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:03,660
getting like a you know stores in Bickel

1117
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,939
or something I'm pretty I'm pretty

1118
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:07,559
suspicious of these these temperatures

1119
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,000
that I'm being told that they're heating

1120
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:10,559
at for anything that I'm paying under

1121
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,019
200 bucks for

1122
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:14,338
yeah I I think you're right to be

1123
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:17,099
suspicious

1124
00:47:14,338 --> 00:47:19,139
um on that for a couple of reasons

1125
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:22,740
um some don't actually use a

1126
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:24,858
thermocouple you know a a a a sensor

1127
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:28,500
that feeds back the actual temperature

1128
00:47:24,858 --> 00:47:30,299
and then moreover I think that the

1129
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,579
biggest thing is well think about a

1130
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,260
regular oven you heat it to 350 degrees

1131
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:36,180
but as soon as you open the door to put

1132
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:39,359
your cookies in

1133
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:42,118
um then it drops a considerable amount

1134
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:45,239
and the same with a vaporizer so as soon

1135
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:47,099
it might heat it to a steady state but

1136
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:50,338
as soon as you start pulling cool air in

1137
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:53,099
that's going to vary the the actual

1138
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:55,920
temperature of the airflow and the vapor

1139
00:47:53,099 --> 00:48:00,900
that you're experiencing now the good

1140
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:03,838
side of the temperature settings that on

1141
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:07,318
a particular vaporizer is that you will

1142
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:10,619
probably get relative consistency from

1143
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:14,699
one session to another regardless

1144
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:17,700
of whether it's actually true so so that

1145
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:20,219
can still be a very very beneficial kind

1146
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:22,318
of attribute to a vaporizer so that you

1147
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:23,939
can be able to dial in the experience

1148
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:24,838
that you want from one session to

1149
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,059
another

1150
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:29,039
right on I buy that I think that makes a

1151
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:30,779
lot of sense so so even though on some

1152
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,880
of the Lesser

1153
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:36,240
um expensive Vapes

1154
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:39,240
the uh the temps maybe not be accurate

1155
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,318
to you know the number that they say it

1156
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:42,000
is

1157
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:44,519
um but at least it's going to be same

1158
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,280
from session to session so once you find

1159
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:48,539
out you know where you like it

1160
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,240
um it'll be able to hit that Mark

1161
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:53,039
consistently yeah yeah that makes a lot

1162
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:55,739
of sense I like that

1163
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:57,059
um so let's talk about the the grinding

1164
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:59,759
part right

1165
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:05,219
um so you know historically a lot of

1166
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:08,280
people don't um grind flour for a bowl

1167
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:11,039
um uh many people will grind flour to

1168
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:13,079
roll a joint though my mentor hated

1169
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:15,838
Grinders and believed it always had to

1170
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:17,940
be done by scissors

1171
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:20,818
um but I think that was because

1172
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:22,200
um he was always collecting seeds so I'm

1173
00:49:20,818 --> 00:49:24,719
not sure about that

1174
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:28,439
um but but when it comes to you know

1175
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:32,459
grinding you know every book that you

1176
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:35,400
get with your vaporizer says to grind

1177
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:38,400
the flower hour so you get a more even

1178
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:43,139
experience will you speak to that

1179
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:47,760
um yeah uh I really don't like Grinders

1180
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:49,679
but it's true uh on on well there's pros

1181
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,260
and cons let's just say yeah break it

1182
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:54,559
down tell us let's break it down uh when

1183
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:57,000
you actually grind your herb you are

1184
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:01,679
changing the particle side and making

1185
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:04,139
some uniform consistency in the uh when

1186
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:06,838
you pack your material into your

1187
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:09,900
vaporizer and so that can be very

1188
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:12,539
beneficial to get Even Flow similar to

1189
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,880
grinding coffee right you can't make

1190
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:17,279
coffee with whole beans you know you

1191
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,800
have to have to grind it and for

1192
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:24,540
different coffee makers you grind it to

1193
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:27,740
different sizes so it's a similar analog

1194
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:30,599
for for flower vaporizers too

1195
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:31,818
grinding will certainly give you that

1196
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:35,460
consistency

1197
00:50:31,818 --> 00:50:38,159
of the of the pack if you will or the

1198
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:40,460
puck as I call it because it comes out

1199
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:45,000
as a puck once you've used it

1200
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:47,579
but I don't really like the what happens

1201
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,099
to my trichomes I don't want to go

1202
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:54,420
chasing after Keef and then reintroduce

1203
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:58,440
it to the bowl so I prefer actually to

1204
00:50:54,420 --> 00:51:00,900
chop my my herb directly in into the

1205
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,880
chamber or to the Bowl when you say chop

1206
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,519
do you mean like uh like finger

1207
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,599
separation or scissors I actually just

1208
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:12,599
use fingers to pluck small you know a

1209
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:16,019
small size and then I I have a have a

1210
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:19,079
tiny little sharp knife that that I poke

1211
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:21,539
it with and and tease it around and and

1212
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:23,339
get it to a fairly uniform consistency

1213
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:25,800
so that's that's my method but everybody

1214
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:28,739
has their own kind of method but I like

1215
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:31,559
to keep my trichomes with the rest of my

1216
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:33,118
herb yeah and and I guess some of that

1217
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:34,619
also depends on what kind of a grinder

1218
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,480
you're using right totally if you're not

1219
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:38,579
using the kief attachment

1220
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,679
um it stays with it the part about the

1221
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:43,619
Grinders that I haven't really cared for

1222
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:45,960
is is the smearing of all the trichomes

1223
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:48,539
and absolutely and then like cleaning

1224
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,639
cleaning them off of the grinder you

1225
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:52,440
know if you know back back when I was

1226
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:54,598
you know younger that seemed like a lot

1227
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,700
of waste I mean it still seems like a

1228
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:58,800
lot of waste but I have I have plenty of

1229
00:51:56,699 --> 00:52:03,239
weed now you know I'm like when I was

1230
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:06,240
younger totally and um but uh for me the

1231
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:07,558
the main advantage of the grind is to

1232
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:12,239
get that

1233
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:16,559
um nice even pull and to know that I am

1234
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:19,379
not wasting the the trichomes that are

1235
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,839
um on the interior of the little budlets

1236
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:24,960
let's say that are in there

1237
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:28,558
um am I correct in my assumption that

1238
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:32,099
the the hot air

1239
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:35,599
and the conductive walls of the oven

1240
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:39,300
neither of those will vaporize

1241
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:43,818
a trichome that is caught on the

1242
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:47,519
interior of a dense Bud little piece

1243
00:52:43,818 --> 00:52:51,239
uh yes in general

1244
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:54,119
um the it really depends on the size

1245
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:55,439
right of of what you're dealing with

1246
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:56,880
there

1247
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,500
um

1248
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:03,720
I would say that uh yes it's it's more

1249
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:06,119
efficient to to actually grind your herb

1250
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:08,578
and to be able to access those internal

1251
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:10,980
trichomes I'll just leave it at that

1252
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:13,019
yeah this is clearly personal preference

1253
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:15,420
right right so so you you gave good

1254
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:17,519
reasons why you're you know on your side

1255
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,920
and and I did as well and you and I all

1256
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:21,960
both have plenty of weed but somebody

1257
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,358
else whose decision Matrix might be

1258
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:26,280
slightly different well I want them to

1259
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:28,739
be able to get the information they need

1260
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:31,019
to totally totally I know lots of people

1261
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:33,719
have opinions who who I need more than

1262
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:34,920
just their opinion because I I want to I

1263
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:36,959
want to kind of understand the whole

1264
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,659
area so I can make my opinion right

1265
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,940
right what I tend to do I mean again

1266
00:53:39,659 --> 00:53:43,920
this is my personal preferences you know

1267
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:46,019
when you have those small nuggets you

1268
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,079
are correct that the the internal

1269
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:51,960
trichomesy don't immediately

1270
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:55,260
um aren't accessible to to the hot air

1271
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:57,780
um uh what I tend to do is is open the

1272
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:01,319
chamber back up and crush it and then

1273
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:02,460
release all of those things once once

1274
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:05,519
you've hit it a couple times and it's

1275
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:08,579
dry then it's dried and it will then

1276
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:11,400
fall apart readily and you yeah and then

1277
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:13,980
you've got your even distribution then

1278
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,420
of particles and it's uh more efficient

1279
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:18,300
right on the next thing I was going to

1280
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:21,300
ask you was the recommendation that most

1281
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:24,539
of these these companies have to stir

1282
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:26,400
and uh and so you know usually somewhere

1283
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:29,940
around I don't know hit four or five

1284
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,700
they say oh pop pop it open and give it

1285
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:35,220
a little stir and oh my God it just

1286
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:38,098
kills me how often I see somebody using

1287
00:54:35,219 --> 00:54:39,719
a pen with ink on the end to do that and

1288
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:41,220
I'm all like you're not even thinking

1289
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:43,858
about what you're putting on your herb

1290
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:45,480
dude but it's way too common but anyway

1291
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:49,259
then they then they close it up and

1292
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:52,199
continue on and um you know do you think

1293
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:57,000
that stirring is is effective yeah yeah

1294
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:57,659
definitely almost all vaporizers have

1295
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,059
um

1296
00:54:57,659 --> 00:55:02,279
you know with the airflow going through

1297
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:04,559
you're not going to get even heating of

1298
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:07,019
of your herbs so stirring it just means

1299
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,839
you're you're moving the sort of the

1300
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:12,179
unspent particles around moving the oils

1301
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:14,818
around so that they can be efficiently

1302
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:16,980
vaporized so I I strongly encourage

1303
00:55:14,818 --> 00:55:19,019
stirring if you want to get the most out

1304
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:21,719
of your herb if you're feeling kind of

1305
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:23,818
lazy and and you have got a you know an

1306
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:25,919
abundance of herb available then you

1307
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:27,599
know whatever you want right on if

1308
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,680
you're feeling if you're feeling lazy or

1309
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,900
wealthy

1310
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:32,578
um right so so at what point would you

1311
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,920
recommend the stirring

1312
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:37,500
um I usually stir when I when I taste

1313
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,720
the toast for the first time but I also

1314
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,159
suspect that I'm I'm one hit late at

1315
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:44,699
that point

1316
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:47,399
yeah uh it really is a personal

1317
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:50,639
preference so you can stir every pole

1318
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:54,180
which is a pain in the butt but

1319
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:54,838
um yeah every three or four poles you

1320
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:57,000
know

1321
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:58,980
I've never tried Ever every pull I had

1322
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,079
like that that sounds like so much work

1323
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,480
but I should I should do it for the

1324
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:05,880
experience for sure so that I can weigh

1325
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,610
all this properly yeah I would never do

1326
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,260
it every pull

1327
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:12,000
[Laughter]

1328
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:15,960
um you you know we talked on the first

1329
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:19,079
set about how um you know Cloud hits are

1330
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:22,019
different with Vapes and yet sometimes

1331
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:24,900
you do pull clouds and sometimes you do

1332
00:56:22,019 --> 00:56:26,338
pull bigger flavorful hits even if there

1333
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:29,960
is no cloud

1334
00:56:26,338 --> 00:56:32,219
and um in my experience whatever

1335
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:35,760
cloudness I'm going to get from a

1336
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:38,219
vaporizer is improved with stirring

1337
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,940
what are your thoughts yeah I can see

1338
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:42,058
that

1339
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:45,300
yeah and again I think that once you're

1340
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:46,260
into pull two or three you've

1341
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,019
um

1342
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:52,740
you know you you have decarbed you have

1343
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:54,838
warmed the bowl you have removed any uh

1344
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:57,299
of the residual

1345
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:59,219
um sort of moisture in the herb and and

1346
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:01,619
so they just it just becomes the whole

1347
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:04,500
system becomes a lot more efficient you

1348
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:08,519
know three or four poles in and so you

1349
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:11,760
are going to get uh more you know bigger

1350
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:15,358
clouds more easily at that point all

1351
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,740
right so um so let's let's move on

1352
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:18,299
unless you've got anything else to say

1353
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:21,358
here let's move on to oil Vapes yeah

1354
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:23,280
well let me talk just briefly about a

1355
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:25,259
couple of couple of other things

1356
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,819
um here one is that we haven't talked

1357
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:29,460
about sort of the exhaust what happens

1358
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:32,519
to the vapor after it's moved through

1359
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:34,980
your herb and

1360
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:38,940
um frequently another thing to look at

1361
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:44,119
in a vaporizer is how much accumulates

1362
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:46,980
you know in that Vapor pathway some some

1363
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:48,660
vaporizers on the market said I'm not

1364
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:52,019
going to call them out but you know

1365
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:54,420
claim for an all glass pathway well

1366
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:57,539
glass it actually is is a fairly

1367
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:59,818
conductive material it tends to be cool

1368
00:57:57,539 --> 00:58:02,338
so we we have this perception that we

1369
00:57:59,818 --> 00:58:05,159
want to cool The Vapor well once we cool

1370
00:58:02,338 --> 00:58:09,179
The Vapor you've got those oils that are

1371
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:11,759
then condensing in that pathway and the

1372
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:15,239
way you can tell you know sort of how

1373
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:18,140
efficient the vaporizer is is how much

1374
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:21,239
Gunk you have to clean out and how often

1375
00:58:18,139 --> 00:58:23,759
so another sort of buying decision is to

1376
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:25,259
look at you know just how much uh you

1377
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,020
know what happens to the vapor after it

1378
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:30,720
goes through the herb are you having to

1379
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:32,460
frequently clean it well then that's not

1380
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:34,618
really you're not getting the maximum

1381
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:38,039
benefit from your vapor

1382
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:40,260
so I wanted to say that and then one of

1383
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:43,440
the other sort of controversies or

1384
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:46,799
questions that are out there is is how

1385
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,519
how much do you pack in your chamber you

1386
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:53,400
know how do you press it down do you

1387
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:54,659
crush it how dense do you do you pack it

1388
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,420
in

1389
00:58:54,659 --> 00:59:00,960
um and my take on this from a sort of

1390
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:03,539
Aeronautics science kind of direction is

1391
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,280
that for convection base so the ones

1392
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:08,880
that are using the hot air for a

1393
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:12,119
convection based vaporizer Tamp it down

1394
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,220
so press it down and compress it it's

1395
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:17,640
similar to what you do with an espresso

1396
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:20,759
shot you're removing any

1397
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:22,739
um sort of easy channels for the air to

1398
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:26,160
flow past your herb rather than through

1399
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:27,899
it and air will always find the path of

1400
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:30,179
least resistance so if you have those

1401
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:32,460
channels and the larger buds in there

1402
00:59:30,179 --> 00:59:35,118
then it's going to flow past rather than

1403
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:38,880
through your herbs so definitely

1404
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:41,280
compress it down and it creates what's

1405
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,519
known as back pressure which is similar

1406
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,319
to a carb cap on a dab rig it lowers the

1407
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:47,699
pressure

1408
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:50,699
right there at the herb and it will

1409
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:52,858
vaporize more efficiently wow I'm really

1410
00:59:50,699 --> 00:59:54,779
glad that you went back for that

1411
00:59:52,858 --> 00:59:57,000
um not only is that interesting but I do

1412
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:59,280
it wrong you know I noticed that earlier

1413
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,739
when you said um you know when you take

1414
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,839
the puck out of your Vape right right

1415
01:00:01,739 --> 01:00:06,118
and I'm all like I'm like man I don't I

1416
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:10,099
don't I don't have pucks it's just like

1417
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:15,240
it just comes out as like slightly brown

1418
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:17,519
ground up weed still you know and and in

1419
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:21,779
my head I I wanted to leave a little

1420
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:25,079
breathing room so that the hot air could

1421
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:26,880
easily be be drawn through it but now I

1422
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:30,119
understand from your analysis that that

1423
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:33,180
I'm doing it exactly wrong because by my

1424
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:34,740
leaving it somewhat loose in there even

1425
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:38,039
though that does make it easier for the

1426
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:41,578
stirring uh step that um

1427
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:45,539
that I am Crea I'm allowing easy Vapor

1428
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:48,480
paths that that will be preferred by the

1429
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:50,400
physics of the inhalation when really I

1430
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,920
want to press it down so that there's

1431
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,599
all these multitude of variety of pads

1432
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,838
that are being taken

1433
01:00:54,599 --> 01:01:00,660
for a convection based vaporizer so for

1434
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:04,500
for a conduction based vaporizer or like

1435
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:05,879
a dynavap which is the really Innovative

1436
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:09,239
design right

1437
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:12,119
um yeah they're look like I mean they

1438
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:13,979
they replicate the the notion of smoking

1439
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:17,099
so it's like a it's a smoke like

1440
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:19,980
experience right but there are largely a

1441
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:22,500
conduction based of you know vaporizer

1442
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:25,559
in in that regard the metal heats up

1443
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:27,179
right for for a for something like that

1444
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:30,119
or the packs

1445
01:01:27,179 --> 01:01:33,179
um which many people have I would say a

1446
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:35,760
looser pack is probably better because

1447
01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:37,500
you're heating from the walls so how

1448
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,960
does the heat then transfer if it's

1449
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:42,599
really dense the heat is not going to be

1450
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:46,260
transported through your herb because

1451
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:48,838
your herb itself is has low conductivity

1452
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:50,579
wood and plants they don't conduct heat

1453
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:53,219
very well

1454
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:54,599
um whereas then the air that's moving

1455
01:01:53,219 --> 01:01:56,939
through there you want it to circulate

1456
01:01:54,599 --> 01:02:00,480
right and and the heat to then move into

1457
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:02,460
the center of of that chamber so for a

1458
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,500
conduction based vaporizer I would pack

1459
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:06,720
it a little more loosely

1460
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,519
you know it's interesting to to hit on

1461
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:12,959
the dynavap one more time

1462
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:15,960
um uh I I have owned one and the one I

1463
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,760
have I've only ever used it with uh my

1464
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,740
butane torch right and that's an

1465
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,020
interesting experience to hear the

1466
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:23,459
little crack sound and then and then

1467
01:02:22,019 --> 01:02:25,199
know that it's time to take your hit all

1468
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:27,119
that's very interesting I'm not a super

1469
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:28,500
big fan of using the Torches in general

1470
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:31,440
though right

1471
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:34,318
um but then my buddy Michael you know he

1472
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,599
came over and he is like a total dynavap

1473
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:39,000
like Fanboy like he well actually he

1474
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:40,859
kind of is just like a vaporizing

1475
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,260
scientist actually he you know until

1476
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:46,440
until I met you he pretty much knew more

1477
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:48,660
than anybody I knew about him and um and

1478
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:51,240
so he got this uh he got this desktop

1479
01:02:48,659 --> 01:02:53,098
thing that dynavap has got where it's

1480
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:56,519
like you plug it in and you can just

1481
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:58,680
kind of put the pipe into it and and it

1482
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:03,298
acts kind of like um

1483
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:05,279
it transfers electric energy to it and

1484
01:03:03,298 --> 01:03:07,619
it's very convenient like an e-nail is

1485
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,540
and then and then you just take it out

1486
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:11,400
and you hit it and it's it's so much

1487
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:15,058
more elegant and it's it's interesting

1488
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:17,099
that it is a product that has multiple

1489
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:19,500
um heating mechanisms because really

1490
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:23,298
that's pretty uncommon to have multiple

1491
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:26,280
heating mechanisms for one Vape system

1492
01:03:23,298 --> 01:03:28,139
yeah I I really am impressed with the

1493
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,599
sort of the engineering background of of

1494
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:32,098
the dynavap and what they're doing I I

1495
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:35,338
believe that's an induction based

1496
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:37,559
heating sort of block that you you drop

1497
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:41,000
it in and so it uses induction to then

1498
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:43,140
heat it up to the perfect temperature so

1499
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
uh I think that's pretty fantastic

1500
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:47,578
excellent all right are you ready to

1501
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,858
move on to oil now sure all right so so

1502
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:52,019
as kind of like a bridge Place let's

1503
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:55,259
just give a little bit of a shout out to

1504
01:03:52,019 --> 01:03:58,318
those flower vaporizers who really

1505
01:03:55,260 --> 01:04:01,140
really want to be oil vaporizers too and

1506
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:03,960
so so um you know they will they will

1507
01:04:01,139 --> 01:04:06,298
have like little Solutions like um you

1508
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,220
know oh I've got a little cup and you

1509
01:04:06,298 --> 01:04:10,318
can you know you can take your oil and

1510
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:13,019
put it in the cup and then drop it into

1511
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:15,058
the flour chamber or

1512
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:17,460
um or or you know we've we've got this

1513
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:18,720
you know specialty screen or a sponge

1514
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,519
you can put your oil in that and then

1515
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:24,058
we'll put it into the flour vaporizer

1516
01:04:20,519 --> 01:04:26,599
and and you know those can

1517
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:29,160
um that people can definitely find

1518
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:31,680
Effectiveness with those but I think

1519
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:36,179
that across the board it's really hard

1520
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:38,578
to make one vaporizer that's best for

1521
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:39,838
all solutions and and like if you only

1522
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:42,000
if you're only going to buy one and you

1523
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:43,619
need one that does both that's like

1524
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,619
there are definitely some good Solutions

1525
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:48,720
out there but um you know going all the

1526
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:50,880
way back to the the original Pax like

1527
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:52,618
little cup that was in there you know I

1528
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,900
I got mine assuming that it was going to

1529
01:04:52,619 --> 01:04:58,200
be an oil vape and a flower Vape but

1530
01:04:54,900 --> 01:05:00,539
that little that that little cup just

1531
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:02,639
it didn't really work out over time no

1532
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:04,739
it didn't really work right yeah totally

1533
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:07,739
so so what are your thoughts on on these

1534
01:05:04,739 --> 01:05:12,298
Vapes that try to straddle well I think

1535
01:05:07,739 --> 01:05:15,358
that when it comes to vaporization

1536
01:05:12,298 --> 01:05:18,719
um of an oil it's all about trying to

1537
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:20,219
maximize your surface area and so when

1538
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:23,639
we're dealing with flour it's great

1539
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:25,919
because the flower fibers uh Wick the

1540
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:29,219
oils and distribute them across the

1541
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:32,700
across the fibers and it's pretty easy

1542
01:05:29,219 --> 01:05:35,578
so one way of experiencing oils or

1543
01:05:32,699 --> 01:05:38,219
concentrates would be to just drop it on

1544
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:40,019
or mix it in with your with your flour

1545
01:05:38,219 --> 01:05:43,139
and and that can be a pretty effective

1546
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:44,759
way of using the flour vaporizers to

1547
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:47,519
experience oil but then you've got a mix

1548
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:49,559
and you're not getting that Purity

1549
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:52,920
um that a lot of people who dab are

1550
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:56,940
seeking from from their extracts

1551
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:58,920
and so the um just I'm gonna do a little

1552
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:01,500
bit on the because I spent a couple of

1553
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:05,940
years trying to find a solution to this

1554
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:08,039
yeah with oils and most of the

1555
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:12,539
vaporizers the flower vaporizes in the

1556
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:14,880
market use a stainless steel kind of

1557
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:16,980
Brillo pad if you will

1558
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,980
um they it's just a bunch of stainless

1559
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:22,858
steel wire that's been compressed into a

1560
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:25,338
little you know shaped puck or disc that

1561
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:29,880
then gets dropped into the the chamber

1562
01:06:25,338 --> 01:06:34,199
the challenge with that is that metal

1563
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:37,318
will warm up and not reach the

1564
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:40,259
vaporization temperatures very readily

1565
01:06:37,318 --> 01:06:43,500
so while it's warming up your thick oil

1566
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:45,720
or concentrate your wax or shatter is

1567
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:50,298
going to start melting and it's going to

1568
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:52,500
travel along that along those wires and

1569
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:54,239
oftentimes before you reach the

1570
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:56,818
vaporization station temperatures it's

1571
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:58,618
going to start flowing into the rest of

1572
01:06:56,818 --> 01:07:00,318
your unit and you're getting get that

1573
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:06,420
Gunk everywhere

1574
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:09,719
so no most most that try to do both are

1575
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:11,760
are not very effective how many of us

1576
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:15,298
have had that experience early in our

1577
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:17,099
token career where we try to put you

1578
01:07:15,298 --> 01:07:21,358
know a ball of bubble hash or something

1579
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:22,859
into our bong with uh with a screen and

1580
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:24,960
and we're warming it up and as we're

1581
01:07:22,858 --> 01:07:27,719
warming it up we're seeing it like slide

1582
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:30,240
down the slide on the glass and you're

1583
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:33,659
like you're like I only got one hit off

1584
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:36,618
of that and now it's all like now yeah

1585
01:07:33,659 --> 01:07:39,899
it's all inside of the bong oh yeah

1586
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:41,220
that's disappointing but a similar I

1587
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:42,838
mean that's exactly what's happening

1588
01:07:41,219 --> 01:07:45,358
inside the vaporizer and then you end up

1589
01:07:42,838 --> 01:07:48,420
having to clean it out and and that's no

1590
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:49,500
fun nobody likes doing dishes yeah very

1591
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:50,700
good point

1592
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,440
um all right so let's talk more about

1593
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:54,419
like oil vaping solutions that are

1594
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:56,099
specifically leave for it let this

1595
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:58,079
really isn't going to be a long show on

1596
01:07:56,099 --> 01:07:59,338
carts right but but let's do talk about

1597
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,079
just

1598
01:07:59,338 --> 01:08:02,578
um the idea behind the carts and how

1599
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:05,818
they function

1600
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:07,798
um uh but carts could be like their own

1601
01:08:05,818 --> 01:08:10,019
show you know so right so if you would

1602
01:08:07,798 --> 01:08:13,139
just explain the mechanics of carts um

1603
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:17,479
that'll be great yeah I mean basically

1604
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:19,858
you have uh carts are are a very

1605
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:22,439
interesting and efficient right um

1606
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:26,279
they're very convenient uh the oil

1607
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:28,379
basically is uh you know is in the

1608
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:30,000
cartridge and then there's a heating

1609
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:32,579
element

1610
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,119
um oftentimes there's a wick or a

1611
01:08:32,579 --> 01:08:38,519
wicking mechanism to make sure that the

1612
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:39,679
oil gets transferred to the to that

1613
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:46,400
heating element

1614
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:49,500
or to a hot ceramic that then uh locally

1615
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:54,119
basically boils the oil

1616
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:58,500
um locally and so that then uh that

1617
01:08:54,119 --> 01:09:00,119
Vapor then is transmitted and uh you

1618
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,859
know through the mouthpiece and

1619
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:04,880
aerosolized

1620
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:08,579
um one thing I learned recently is that

1621
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:12,119
uh part of the design of of many

1622
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:14,579
cartridges is actually to introduce uh

1623
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:18,838
an external they have little air holes

1624
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:22,140
and that is to make sure that the vapor

1625
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:26,219
is less dense

1626
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:28,380
um and that it coalesces back into an

1627
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:30,779
aerosol rather than staying in fine

1628
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:33,659
particulate form and that was always

1629
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:35,640
that fascinated me part of that is to

1630
01:09:33,659 --> 01:09:38,039
increase sort of the cloud production

1631
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:40,319
but also to make it a little easier on

1632
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:43,819
your lungs and to cool it a little bit

1633
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,819
before it enters your lungs

1634
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:48,960
um you know as as far you know we're

1635
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:51,179
really going to focus on on non-cart

1636
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,798
Vapes but but since we're right here I

1637
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:56,460
think that it's important for us to say

1638
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:58,560
you know whatever your preference is in

1639
01:09:56,460 --> 01:10:00,779
you know what you want in your Vape like

1640
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,000
you know I'm a big fan of hash rosin

1641
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:04,979
personally but I certainly have got

1642
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,819
respected friends who like properly

1643
01:10:04,979 --> 01:10:12,238
purged BHO for flavor and you know

1644
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:14,519
there's there's a wide range of of what

1645
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:17,459
you can put in the Vape the only thing I

1646
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:19,560
want to be clear on is to know your

1647
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:22,859
Source because there is a lot of garbage

1648
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:24,780
that can be put in the Vapes um and and

1649
01:10:22,859 --> 01:10:27,059
it was weird in the early days people

1650
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:28,920
didn't really know what was best to put

1651
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:33,179
in The Vape so people tried everything

1652
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:35,579
from you know coconut oil to vegetable

1653
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:37,739
glycerin all these different things and

1654
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:40,679
and and God help us we made it through

1655
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:44,158
and and so now we know mostly we we

1656
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:47,158
don't want to be you know adding

1657
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:47,158
non-cannabis

1658
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:52,880
constituents

1659
01:10:49,738 --> 01:10:56,879
um but then

1660
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:59,819
the ones in them in the licensed Market

1661
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,920
are often so expensive for lots of

1662
01:10:59,819 --> 01:11:04,799
people that that they tend to buy them

1663
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,420
cheaper in the unlicensed market and

1664
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,539
then we're back to the problem of oh god

1665
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:11,579
what the hell's in it right and so um

1666
01:11:09,539 --> 01:11:14,039
you know whatever whatever your oil

1667
01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:16,559
preference dear listener

1668
01:11:14,039 --> 01:11:18,179
um you know know your Source because we

1669
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:20,640
want we don't want you to get you know

1670
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:23,219
some kind of serious lung issue from uh

1671
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,440
from using some sketchy stuff right and

1672
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:27,658
and to for from a functionality

1673
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:31,259
perspective you have to have something

1674
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:36,599
added to the cannabis oil or it won't

1675
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:39,619
flow well right so there's a a degree of

1676
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:42,960
of flow that that enters into the design

1677
01:11:39,619 --> 01:11:46,319
and requires something to kind of cut or

1678
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:48,300
thin the oil to make it function

1679
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:50,819
properly

1680
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:52,860
now one of the go ahead

1681
01:11:50,819 --> 01:11:54,960
is that always the case though because I

1682
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:57,479
really thought that the the like the big

1683
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:01,739
breakthrough in the last like 18 months

1684
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:04,139
is people being able to press hash rosin

1685
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:06,899
at a viscosity

1686
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:10,079
um that they can put him in these these

1687
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:12,719
new Vapes and not have to have any

1688
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:15,658
adulterant at all to it and I I thought

1689
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:18,779
that was true is that not accurate I I

1690
01:12:15,658 --> 01:12:21,238
don't know Shango okay yeah yeah I don't

1691
01:12:18,779 --> 01:12:23,880
I I haven't seen those designs yet

1692
01:12:21,238 --> 01:12:26,039
um and that's exciting if it is

1693
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:29,039
um one of the cautions that I would say

1694
01:12:26,039 --> 01:12:32,399
for people with uh the cartridge based

1695
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:34,019
vaporizers because at least I

1696
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:37,079
experienced this

1697
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:39,659
um and that is that throat burn

1698
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:42,840
um that often happens and and it's easy

1699
01:12:39,658 --> 01:12:45,119
to think that that's temperature but I I

1700
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,679
don't believe that that's what's really

1701
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:49,859
happening

1702
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:52,739
um any time that you drop let's say uh

1703
01:12:49,859 --> 01:12:55,799
if you've done in Chinese cooking or or

1704
01:12:52,738 --> 01:12:58,500
dropped you know hot oil onto or oil

1705
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:02,699
onto a really hot pan that's like red

1706
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:04,679
hot right uh you get

1707
01:13:02,698 --> 01:13:07,859
um a lot of

1708
01:13:04,679 --> 01:13:10,500
you convert those oils fairly rapidly

1709
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:12,619
into other compounds that are thicker

1710
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:15,779
and are

1711
01:13:12,619 --> 01:13:19,500
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons you

1712
01:13:15,779 --> 01:13:22,139
know they become worse they become bad

1713
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:26,039
[ __ ] you know is is really what happens

1714
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:27,480
there so anytime you're really putting

1715
01:13:26,039 --> 01:13:31,738
the oil in the presence of something

1716
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:33,839
that's super hot it's going to alter the

1717
01:13:31,738 --> 01:13:37,799
chemical structures of those compounds

1718
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:39,719
and so that's what I believe the throat

1719
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,619
burn is due to

1720
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:43,739
um

1721
01:13:40,619 --> 01:13:46,140
at least that's my my my armchair

1722
01:13:43,738 --> 01:13:48,959
science background on that I'll take it

1723
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:50,640
and also damn if that's true that that

1724
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,619
explains why so many people have turned

1725
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,840
away from cartridges and gone to some of

1726
01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:56,340
these other Solutions

1727
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,020
um like the puffco peak which we're

1728
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:59,520
going to talk about in a second but but

1729
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:03,840
before we do

1730
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:05,280
um so do you consider an email vaping or

1731
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,199
combustion

1732
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:11,460
I would sell it's it's a form of

1733
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:13,139
vaporization yeah right yeah and I was

1734
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:15,899
wondering if it had to do with like the

1735
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:19,560
temp because you know certainly we we do

1736
01:14:15,899 --> 01:14:22,500
we we do see smoke from it right and and

1737
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:25,140
but we don't ever see fire

1738
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,760
um and so I was kind of of this idea

1739
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:28,800
myself because I've used an email for

1740
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,719
years that that at my lower temperatures

1741
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,060
is a vaporizer but at higher

1742
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,859
temperatures it's combustion but that

1743
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:36,739
might be like the most non-science thing

1744
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:40,259
I've said today

1745
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:42,599
well if you're experiencing again you

1746
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:45,179
can alter the chemical composition

1747
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,039
without it being combustion so at high

1748
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:49,980
temperatures when you pass the smoke

1749
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:53,279
point of an oil you start altering the

1750
01:14:49,979 --> 01:14:56,039
chemical composition and that can feel

1751
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:58,559
like combustion right

1752
01:14:56,039 --> 01:15:02,479
um it's a it's a harsher effect and so

1753
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,480
when your nail is is super hot

1754
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:08,579
largely it will lead to that kind of uh

1755
01:15:06,658 --> 01:15:11,099
thing so there's been a lot of movement

1756
01:15:08,579 --> 01:15:13,920
to the to the cold start dabbing or low

1757
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:17,000
temperature dabbing and enails have

1758
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:19,859
certainly helped that quite a bit

1759
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:23,880
to dial in the the temperatures more

1760
01:15:19,859 --> 01:15:25,559
precisely right on um so um so we're

1761
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:29,420
gonna next let's talk about the the

1762
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:32,940
puffco peak which um you know stands out

1763
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:36,480
as being you know one of the most

1764
01:15:32,939 --> 01:15:39,719
cherished uh instruments

1765
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:42,178
um you know in the oil Community you

1766
01:15:39,719 --> 01:15:43,980
know it's it's uh it's convenience and

1767
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:46,920
and the fact that you you know you were

1768
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:49,979
talking about the um

1769
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,060
oh surface area right right and one of

1770
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:52,799
the great things is that they've got

1771
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:54,480
these you know their bowls are great and

1772
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,940
they're pretty evenly heated throughout

1773
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:58,799
it and so you've got a lot of space at

1774
01:15:56,939 --> 01:15:59,939
once that's in contact with the oil at

1775
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,219
the same time

1776
01:15:59,939 --> 01:16:03,599
and and you know I also want to be clear

1777
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:05,579
that you know puffco is not like a

1778
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,340
sponsor or anything you know other

1779
01:16:05,579 --> 01:16:10,279
people like the focus uh Carta right so

1780
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:13,860
like I'm talking more about the design

1781
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:17,039
where it looks like a bong and and

1782
01:16:13,859 --> 01:16:19,139
you've got this this wide bowl and and

1783
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:21,779
then it's heated and then when you put

1784
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:24,360
your concentrate on there

1785
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:26,698
um you're you're gonna get a a large

1786
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:28,019
Vapor hit at once because of all the

1787
01:16:26,698 --> 01:16:30,299
surface area

1788
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:31,739
um do you like how I'm explaining the

1789
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:34,679
science behind that is that is that how

1790
01:16:31,738 --> 01:16:36,539
you see it too yeah yeah I have not had

1791
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:39,960
a ton of experience with the puffco but

1792
01:16:36,539 --> 01:16:43,319
it's you know sexy AF right I mean it is

1793
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:46,380
it is you know let's face it it hits all

1794
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:48,779
the right uh notes I think for for being

1795
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:50,520
a fantastic product and

1796
01:16:48,779 --> 01:16:52,500
um you know and it and it can really

1797
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:55,140
deliver for those people who want that

1798
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:57,300
experience so yeah it's pretty

1799
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:59,520
revolutionary from an email perspective

1800
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:01,440
and you know they got a lot of crap over

1801
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,120
in in the early years because there

1802
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:06,419
there were some models that went out

1803
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:07,800
with some you know failing components

1804
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:10,079
which they've they've I guess they've

1805
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,179
figured out over the years because

1806
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:14,460
I haven't heard people complete compare

1807
01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:16,760
complain about that anymore but um have

1808
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:20,219
you ever seen the the the the the

1809
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:23,219
specialty puffco Peak

1810
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:24,960
um hand blown and and made glass

1811
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:26,460
trophies that they use for Emerald cup

1812
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,920
the last few years since they started

1813
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:30,840
sponsoring them no I haven't oh my God

1814
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:33,480
they're absolutely beautiful

1815
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:35,219
um uh I wish I could plug the artist who

1816
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:36,658
does such a great job on them or maybe

1817
01:17:35,219 --> 01:17:38,698
they change them from year to year but

1818
01:17:36,658 --> 01:17:40,799
anyway if uh that's great you know for

1819
01:17:38,698 --> 01:17:44,279
those who those who like puffcos and

1820
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:46,320
they also like ostentatious pieces you

1821
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:47,460
know you know search for the for the

1822
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:49,079
emerald cup

1823
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:51,719
um

1824
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:53,899
Awards I've seen some great wood ones

1825
01:17:51,719 --> 01:17:57,719
online where people are making some

1826
01:17:53,899 --> 01:18:00,179
gorgeous Wood Pipes that uh that then

1827
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:01,739
the Carter fits in and yeah yeah those

1828
01:18:00,179 --> 01:18:04,199
are gorgeous so you can have that

1829
01:18:01,738 --> 01:18:07,559
smoking like experience but then enjoy

1830
01:18:04,198 --> 01:18:11,698
your your extracts so this whole family

1831
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:14,219
of uh of pipes like the puffco peak and

1832
01:18:11,698 --> 01:18:16,979
the Carta these all would fall into the

1833
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:19,920
conduction category right because

1834
01:18:16,979 --> 01:18:21,599
um that that ceramic Bowl that's being

1835
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:24,480
heated and then we're putting our Dab

1836
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:27,659
Oil on it that is a direct application

1837
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:30,599
of heat correct correct correct yeah

1838
01:18:27,658 --> 01:18:32,579
cool um do you have any do you have

1839
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,560
anything else to say about that like

1840
01:18:32,579 --> 01:18:37,500
that that type of design before we move

1841
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:40,340
forward no I think that well I I always

1842
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:43,020
have something to say I suppose go ahead

1843
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:45,300
yeah yeah I think

1844
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:48,600
um again look at at the waste product

1845
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:51,239
right so what's left in in the bowl when

1846
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:53,640
you're done uh and that can tell you a

1847
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:55,559
little bit about Clues to the to the

1848
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:57,420
chemistry that's happening

1849
01:18:55,560 --> 01:19:00,239
um during the process of vaporization so

1850
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:01,980
when you're left with you know dark uh

1851
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:04,738
resiny

1852
01:19:01,979 --> 01:19:08,039
um substances uh then you you haven't

1853
01:19:04,738 --> 01:19:09,959
completely vaporized them and you may

1854
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:12,539
have altered the chemistry just like

1855
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:14,939
when uh in a cartridge that's near the

1856
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:18,658
end of life the oil has changed from a

1857
01:19:14,939 --> 01:19:22,859
maybe a light honey to a really darker

1858
01:19:18,658 --> 01:19:24,719
uh blend because you've altered the oils

1859
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:28,079
um and you're left with some of that

1860
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:32,399
heavier kind of uh compounds in there

1861
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:35,519
does that's interesting how what is left

1862
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:37,799
um depending on what is left uh can say

1863
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,780
something about your temperature choice

1864
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:43,020
but it can also say something about

1865
01:19:39,779 --> 01:19:46,619
what's in the oil true

1866
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:49,560
um so other other than the

1867
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:51,238
the under combusted dark oil that you're

1868
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:54,900
talking about what what else might we

1869
01:19:51,238 --> 01:19:58,939
find in remaining in the bowl

1870
01:19:54,899 --> 01:19:58,939
that we would want to be aware of

1871
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:04,198
um well you're not having any plant

1872
01:20:00,899 --> 01:20:07,019
matter so what you've got are largely

1873
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:09,919
just different oil compounds

1874
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:14,100
um when you uh

1875
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:15,840
when the changes happen to terpenes and

1876
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,420
Dr strangen from Portland State

1877
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:21,179
University has done some interesting

1878
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:24,239
research on on dabs and sort of the

1879
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:26,100
byproducts of of conventional dabbing

1880
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:28,559
techniques this doesn't apply to low

1881
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:30,440
temperature dabbing but for high

1882
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:33,360
temperature dabs

1883
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:36,658
there's you know a

1884
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:39,599
but there's a great word pyrolytic but

1885
01:20:36,658 --> 01:20:41,219
literally means fire changed and

1886
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,320
thermolytic is probably the more

1887
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:46,198
accurate thing the the oils then break

1888
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:47,519
down into those Benzene rings and these

1889
01:20:46,198 --> 01:20:50,460
other

1890
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:54,000
um you know hydrocarbons that have been

1891
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:57,480
shown to be present in in uh you know

1892
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:00,300
cigarette smokes and be uh you know

1893
01:20:57,479 --> 01:21:03,359
cancer-causing compounds

1894
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:06,840
so I'm not saying that that's what is in

1895
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:09,658
there but there is a likelihood of of

1896
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:11,760
finding those kinds of of compounds in

1897
01:21:09,658 --> 01:21:15,179
that remaining

1898
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,619
goo goo yeah thank you I was trying to

1899
01:21:15,179 --> 01:21:18,719
think of the right thing it is goo it's

1900
01:21:16,619 --> 01:21:21,179
Gunk yeah it's gross um and it's a

1901
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:24,539
really um good encouragement for us that

1902
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:27,359
when we do get a new vaporizer to um

1903
01:21:24,539 --> 01:21:30,060
really spend some time getting to know

1904
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:32,639
um the different temperature points so

1905
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:34,560
that we can you know really find the

1906
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:37,440
right temperature for how we like to

1907
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:39,000
smoke so that we're we're not having

1908
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:42,000
that much much

1909
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:44,399
um you know uh residue and that we're

1910
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,640
not tempted to smoke it once it's become

1911
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:53,519
Gunk we wanna we wanna heat it properly

1912
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:55,199
so uh we get to inhale it pre-gunk yeah

1913
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,640
yeah definitely

1914
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:58,619
um you know for anybody making a

1915
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:01,140
selection of a of a vaporizer it really

1916
01:21:58,619 --> 01:22:03,840
comes down to your preferences right uh

1917
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:05,760
you know how much do you value the

1918
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:08,579
discreetness there's a time and a place

1919
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,320
you know for a for a vape pen that's you

1920
01:22:08,579 --> 01:22:14,819
know nothing else is going to to

1921
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:16,859
actually fill that that need for you and

1922
01:22:14,819 --> 01:22:19,799
then how much of an Enthusiast are you

1923
01:22:16,859 --> 01:22:23,279
are you concerned about preserving Terps

1924
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:25,679
are you looking for the full kind of a

1925
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:28,500
more relaxed ritualized experience which

1926
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:30,719
some of those will give you or are you

1927
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:34,319
looking for something that's a little

1928
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:35,880
faster and if you actually I don't know

1929
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:38,158
about you but I really don't want to

1930
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:42,239
interact with my phone to then control

1931
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:44,039
my control my vaporizer right interact

1932
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:46,019
with my phone enough so it really it

1933
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:47,519
does take you out of it does take you

1934
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:48,840
out of being present but I also have to

1935
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,239
capture the fact that I've never done

1936
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:53,760
that yet so I I look forward to having

1937
01:22:51,238 --> 01:22:55,939
that there you go yeah so how much is

1938
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,860
the technology

1939
01:22:55,939 --> 01:23:00,960
enhancing your experience or is your

1940
01:22:58,859 --> 01:23:02,939
technology getting in the way of your

1941
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:05,399
experience is it is it becoming part of

1942
01:23:02,939 --> 01:23:08,279
the focus of your experience or not yeah

1943
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:09,779
to me an ideal product kind of Fades

1944
01:23:08,279 --> 01:23:12,719
into the background and you don't have

1945
01:23:09,779 --> 01:23:15,479
to think about it too much right on well

1946
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:19,079
said all right so uh let's bring an end

1947
01:23:15,479 --> 01:23:21,119
to this uh rather long set and go to our

1948
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:22,738
commercial break uh you are listening to

1949
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:24,179
shaping fire oh and let me make sure you

1950
01:23:22,738 --> 01:23:25,559
that you come back because because if

1951
01:23:24,179 --> 01:23:26,760
that was a long set for you you might be

1952
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:28,199
like thinking about taking off but don't

1953
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,460
go anywhere because we're talking about

1954
01:23:28,198 --> 01:23:31,859
something really important in the third

1955
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:33,840
set we are talking about boiling point

1956
01:23:31,859 --> 01:23:36,839
myths and the difference between

1957
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,940
evaporation versus boiling so make sure

1958
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:40,500

2079
01:27:54,539 --> 01:27:58,619
my guest today is aerospace engineer

2080
01:27:56,158 --> 01:28:00,899
Mark Lewis so here's the big finish

2081
01:27:58,619 --> 01:28:02,519
during the first set we talked about why

2082
01:28:00,899 --> 01:28:04,859
we vape and what the customer

2083
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:06,840
experiences the consumer experiences and

2084
01:28:04,859 --> 01:28:09,299
and why so many people are attracted to

2085
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:12,119
vaping during the second set we went in

2086
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:15,060
depth into the vaporizer Technologies as

2087
01:28:12,119 --> 01:28:18,059
as they are right now and a whole bunch

2088
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:20,840
of strategies for for you know getting a

2089
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:23,340
vape in your hands that fits your

2090
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:25,980
smoking preferences because they really

2091
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:27,239
are a personal device well here in set

2092
01:28:25,979 --> 01:28:29,638
three we're going to finish up with a

2093
01:28:27,238 --> 01:28:31,079
discussion of uh evaporation versus

2094
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:34,579
boiling

2095
01:28:31,079 --> 01:28:37,760
um because you know uh if if the primary

2096
01:28:34,579 --> 01:28:40,920
physics that we want to have happen is

2097
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:43,520
the cannabinoids and terpenes and the

2098
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:46,199
rest of the resin components to be

2099
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:48,840
vaporized and then inhaled into our

2100
01:28:46,198 --> 01:28:51,178
lungs it really does matter what their

2101
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:55,380
volatility levels are are and whether

2102
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:58,319
we're evaporating or boiling and in our

2103
01:28:55,380 --> 01:29:01,139
scene on Instagram or on Reddit you know

2104
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:03,539
it's very common to see these little

2105
01:29:01,139 --> 01:29:06,179
charts that show all of the volatility

2106
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:09,179
points for different terpenes and

2107
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:10,920
cannabinoids and and we feel like that

2108
01:29:09,179 --> 01:29:13,440
empowers us

2109
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:16,199
um but Mark you've written this great

2110
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:19,859
blog on your website

2111
01:29:16,198 --> 01:29:22,319
um that explains how that belief is not

2112
01:29:19,859 --> 01:29:25,198
quite right and and then people are

2113
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:28,859
using that information and the the

2114
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:30,899
thermostats on our on our vaporizers in

2115
01:29:28,859 --> 01:29:33,599
in ways that aren't maybe getting the

2116
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:35,698
results that they're looking for so so I

2117
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:38,159
guess I guess let's let's slide into

2118
01:29:35,698 --> 01:29:40,799
this by by talking about these charts

2119
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:44,158
that exist and and what their

2120
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:46,260
limitations are that you see as as a

2121
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:49,500
engineer

2122
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:54,239
yeah yeah thanks Django I appreciate

2123
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:56,100
that um the uh I'm fascinated by these

2124
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:57,658
boiling point charts and when I first

2125
01:29:56,100 --> 01:30:01,079
saw them I was like oh that's really

2126
01:29:57,658 --> 01:30:04,019
cool and oh these vaporizers are are

2127
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:06,840
saying that I can dial in you know a

2128
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:10,500
particular terpene if I've you know if I

2129
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:12,179
dilate it to 349 degrees Fahrenheit I

2130
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:16,139
will get limonene you know because

2131
01:30:12,179 --> 01:30:18,600
that's the boiling point of limonene and

2132
01:30:16,139 --> 01:30:20,940
um you know that's just not true it's

2133
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:24,719
the bottom line of that

2134
01:30:20,939 --> 01:30:27,000
um as you as you look deeper into it uh

2135
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:28,260
you know those those may be the boiling

2136
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,619
points

2137
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:33,539
um boiling points are notoriously

2138
01:30:31,619 --> 01:30:36,779
difficult to actually measure so there's

2139
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:39,000
boiling ranges uh most scientists use

2140
01:30:36,779 --> 01:30:41,279
boiling ranges rather than a particular

2141
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,800
boiling point because it's pressure

2142
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:46,139
dependent and and there's other aspects

2143
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:48,000
of the purity of the sample and all of

2144
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:50,279
these other things that that lead to

2145
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,039
boiling or not boiling

2146
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:55,319
um so there's that but that's not as

2147
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:57,960
relevant as the other aspects here the

2148
01:30:55,319 --> 01:31:01,559
the great thing about the charts is that

2149
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:05,279
it gives you some relative volatility of

2150
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:09,900
the compound so by volatility how easy

2151
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:13,800
is it to go from a liquid to a vapor so

2152
01:31:09,899 --> 01:31:14,779
something that's super volatile at room

2153
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:18,719
temperature

2154
01:31:14,779 --> 01:31:21,599
will evaporate really rapidly think of

2155
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:24,179
rubbing alcohol for example so that's a

2156
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:28,079
pretty volatile compound whereas as

2157
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:31,079
water is not a very volatile compound it

2158
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:33,719
takes a little bit more work to get

2159
01:31:31,079 --> 01:31:36,779
those molecules into their into their

2160
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:38,698
gaseous form so those boiling point

2161
01:31:36,779 --> 01:31:40,559
charts are are great to understand some

2162
01:31:38,698 --> 01:31:44,119
relative volatility but they're they

2163
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:48,840
don't tell the entire story if you will

2164
01:31:44,119 --> 01:31:51,899
so so do they have any value to us as

2165
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:54,900
people who are consuming cannabis with

2166
01:31:51,899 --> 01:31:56,939
vaporizers like like if there if there

2167
01:31:54,899 --> 01:32:00,119
might be some

2168
01:31:56,939 --> 01:32:03,059
you know maybe not inaccuracies in them

2169
01:32:00,119 --> 01:32:04,260
but some contextual things that are

2170
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:06,239
missing

2171
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:08,579
can they be useful to us at all how

2172
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:12,119
could we use them to our benefit or or

2173
01:32:08,579 --> 01:32:14,039
is it is it is just not useful

2174
01:32:12,119 --> 01:32:15,899
no they're they are useful in

2175
01:32:14,039 --> 01:32:17,760
understanding sort of the relative

2176
01:32:15,899 --> 01:32:21,179
nature of these different compounds so

2177
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:23,940
what we've got in cannabis uh is this

2178
01:32:21,179 --> 01:32:26,579
wonderful bouquet of of different

2179
01:32:23,939 --> 01:32:28,559
aromatics and flavonoids and

2180
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:32,639
cannabinoids

2181
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:34,860
um that are in this mixture and it's

2182
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:38,219
helpful to maybe think about it as a

2183
01:32:34,859 --> 01:32:40,679
perfume and in that perfume there's

2184
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:42,719
these top notes that are lighter they're

2185
01:32:40,679 --> 01:32:45,539
the citrusy notes they're you know

2186
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:47,639
they're if you think about that in terms

2187
01:32:45,539 --> 01:32:49,920
of a perfume there's there's your top

2188
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:52,679
notes your mid notes and your bass notes

2189
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:54,179
now if you put on your cologne or your

2190
01:32:52,679 --> 01:32:55,800
perfume

2191
01:32:54,179 --> 01:32:58,980
um you know right away you're getting

2192
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,960
those earlier notes as part of the

2193
01:32:58,979 --> 01:33:03,479
mixture

2194
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:06,658
they're more dominant but you're still

2195
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:10,339
getting the bass notes and those smells

2196
01:33:06,658 --> 01:33:13,859
as the perfume evaporates off of you

2197
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:16,920
but the mixture later on an hour later

2198
01:33:13,859 --> 01:33:18,960
is going to maybe be less on the top

2199
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:20,579
notes and more dominant with the mid

2200
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:23,219
notes but your bass notes are still

2201
01:33:20,579 --> 01:33:26,039
there as well and then later on into the

2202
01:33:23,219 --> 01:33:28,139
evening you know a lot of your top notes

2203
01:33:26,039 --> 01:33:31,439
have all evaporated your midnotes

2204
01:33:28,139 --> 01:33:33,480
there's less of them and your base notes

2205
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:37,319
then are the dominant smell that you

2206
01:33:33,479 --> 01:33:40,879
will smell and similarly that happens

2207
01:33:37,319 --> 01:33:43,619
more rapidly with vaporization

2208
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:47,340
particularly flower vaporization is that

2209
01:33:43,619 --> 01:33:50,300
you are for a particular power setting

2210
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:53,060
on your on your vaporizer

2211
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:57,179
you are going to get a different mixture

2212
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:58,920
of of those compounds and your second

2213
01:33:57,179 --> 01:34:00,119
pole will be slightly different your

2214
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,980
third pull will be slightly different

2215
01:34:00,119 --> 01:34:04,139
your fourth pole will be more different

2216
01:34:01,979 --> 01:34:06,738
and throughout your session with a

2217
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:10,619
particular Bowl

2218
01:34:06,738 --> 01:34:13,259
you're going to be left then at the end

2219
01:34:10,619 --> 01:34:15,380
with some of the heavier more difficult

2220
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:17,699
to volatize

2221
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:19,560
compounds but they'll still be present

2222
01:34:17,698 --> 01:34:22,138
you know that sounds fun but also

2223
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:25,260
frustrating right because I I want all

2224
01:34:22,139 --> 01:34:27,119
of it at the same time but but my mind

2225
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:31,980
suggests that the way that I would get

2226
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:35,519
them all at the same time is if I am uh

2227
01:34:31,979 --> 01:34:37,259
using a really hot setting which would

2228
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:41,159
then also give me a satisfying Cloud

2229
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:44,280
perhaps but but what I'm doing is I'm

2230
01:34:41,158 --> 01:34:46,859
like wrecking probably the more volatile

2231
01:34:44,279 --> 01:34:49,380
ones in order to get the more base ones

2232
01:34:46,859 --> 01:34:51,839
and even though in my head I'm thinking

2233
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:53,460
oh if I if I Scorch it at this higher

2234
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,840
temperature I'll get i'll get all the

2235
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:56,880
good stuff at once

2236
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:57,900
that that isn't really how it plays out

2237
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:01,739
is it

2238
01:34:57,899 --> 01:35:03,738
uh yes and no I mean if you if you crank

2239
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:07,019
up the heat you're going to

2240
01:35:03,738 --> 01:35:10,379
volatize more rapidly right

2241
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:12,960
um so you're going to get uh

2242
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:14,819
you're it's still gonna happen in a

2243
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,260
similar way your your your lighter

2244
01:35:14,819 --> 01:35:17,939
compounds are going to evaporate more

2245
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:20,820
rapidly it's just going to be on a

2246
01:35:17,939 --> 01:35:23,460
compressed time scale and so the

2247
01:35:20,819 --> 01:35:26,579
benefits of of those who choose to do

2248
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:29,158
low temperature vaporization is that it

2249
01:35:26,579 --> 01:35:31,979
spreads out that extraction if you will

2250
01:35:29,158 --> 01:35:35,819
over over time and so you're able to

2251
01:35:31,979 --> 01:35:38,519
taste and experience the subtleties

2252
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:41,599
um you know in a different way again if

2253
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:45,260
if I have a medical condition that I'm

2254
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:48,420
treating uh and I and I need that rapid

2255
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:50,940
onset then you know by all means Crank

2256
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:52,260
It Up what would be the what would be

2257
01:35:50,939 --> 01:35:54,059
the temper that you would recommend

2258
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:57,659
temperature you would recommend if

2259
01:35:54,060 --> 01:36:00,480
somebody's goal is to uh get as much as

2260
01:35:57,658 --> 01:36:03,960
they can out of it you know teaching

2261
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:07,738
tasting you know uniform in you know

2262
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:11,039
just a hit or two yeah well I I would

2263
01:36:07,738 --> 01:36:12,539
you know personally I'm I'm so you

2264
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:14,460
wouldn't recommend that personally I

2265
01:36:12,539 --> 01:36:17,279
wouldn't recommend that I think you get

2266
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:20,698
a lot more out of your cannabis through

2267
01:36:17,279 --> 01:36:22,859
a lower I I started out there Shango uh

2268
01:36:20,698 --> 01:36:25,859
when I first started exploring

2269
01:36:22,859 --> 01:36:27,960
vaporization and I wanted to you know

2270
01:36:25,859 --> 01:36:30,420
ratchet it up to that pre-combustion

2271
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:33,960
point right so that I had that heavy

2272
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:35,760
roast I I felt you know got the feedback

2273
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:37,500
that was more familiar to me like

2274
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:40,500
smoking

2275
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:42,779
um and honestly I you know over the last

2276
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:44,880
couple of years I consistently start

2277
01:36:42,779 --> 01:36:47,519
dialing it back farther and farther and

2278
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:49,859
farther and it extends my session a

2279
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:53,699
little bit but my enjoyment level goes

2280
01:36:49,859 --> 01:36:56,759
way up uh I don't approach with the bowl

2281
01:36:53,698 --> 01:37:00,238
there's a point in your bowl where you

2282
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:03,480
start to experience a a bite and and

2283
01:37:00,238 --> 01:37:05,939
that's when I cash out and

2284
01:37:03,479 --> 01:37:08,519
uh if you're up in that pre-combustion

2285
01:37:05,939 --> 01:37:11,658
zone where you're at you know

2286
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:15,480
temperatures around 400 or or greater

2287
01:37:11,658 --> 01:37:18,839
you're going to get to that bite a lot

2288
01:37:15,479 --> 01:37:21,059
faster and to me then I'm wasting

2289
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:22,560
products because I didn't experience all

2290
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:27,440
all of the joy that the rest of the

2291
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:27,440
compounds were were offering me

2292
01:37:27,539 --> 01:37:32,100
um I think that that speaks to a really

2293
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:35,039
important point and can probably be like

2294
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:38,400
a theme for the show which is

2295
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:41,579
um part of choosing to use a vaporizer

2296
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:44,519
for your consumption involves

2297
01:37:41,579 --> 01:37:46,859
um having a different experience than

2298
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:50,040
combustion because vaporizing is never

2299
01:37:46,859 --> 01:37:53,939
going to be combustion and so part of

2300
01:37:50,039 --> 01:37:56,340
becoming a regular vaporizer is is

2301
01:37:53,939 --> 01:37:57,539
learning to smoke in new ways for

2302
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:59,880
example

2303
01:37:57,539 --> 01:38:02,639
um you know people who are fans of the

2304
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:06,840
cold start where where you you warm up

2305
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:09,420
the tool already loaded and and and the

2306
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:11,579
the Dab Oil slowly increases and you're

2307
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:13,679
and you're taking hits as it's warming

2308
01:38:11,579 --> 01:38:17,219
up working its way all the way up you

2309
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:21,359
your your sesh has significantly

2310
01:38:17,219 --> 01:38:23,399
expanded in the time and also

2311
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:27,019
um your every hit that you take is going

2312
01:38:23,399 --> 01:38:30,179
to be different but

2313
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:34,260
that that evolution of the hits is

2314
01:38:30,179 --> 01:38:36,239
itself a a different experience and

2315
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:38,639
enjoyable experience a connoisseurs

2316
01:38:36,238 --> 01:38:42,000
experience that you that you don't get

2317
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:43,560
with with a joint yeah it's it's slowing

2318
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,779
it down a little bit

2319
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:48,239
um uh which I think we've lost a little

2320
01:38:45,779 --> 01:38:54,198
bit in in our cannabis consumption right

2321
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:57,658
keep the foreplay in cannabis I love it

2322
01:38:54,198 --> 01:38:59,759
yeah well it it's uh leaning into I mean

2323
01:38:57,658 --> 01:39:01,859
we don't do shots of alcohol anymore

2324
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:05,520
after college I mean maybe occasionally

2325
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:08,219
but uh to me it's it's more like sipping

2326
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:10,139
a fine cocktail or a whiskey rather than

2327
01:39:08,219 --> 01:39:13,859
you know slamming it back and not just

2328
01:39:10,139 --> 01:39:16,619
going after the end result again no

2329
01:39:13,859 --> 01:39:18,779
judgment because you know that that was

2330
01:39:16,619 --> 01:39:20,219
a large part of my life for a while

2331
01:39:18,779 --> 01:39:21,539
um and as we've talked about throughout

2332
01:39:20,219 --> 01:39:22,859
the show this whole show is about

2333
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:24,300
personal preference right yeah

2334
01:39:22,859 --> 01:39:26,519
absolutely so we're not trying to judge

2335
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:29,520
anybody no not at all not at all it's

2336
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:32,100
just be open-minded to experiencing

2337
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:36,300
cannabis differently and I think that's

2338
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:39,300
what vaporization offers you is this you

2339
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:43,500
know a really different way to enjoy

2340
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:45,900
really high quality cannabis and uh I'm

2341
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:47,579
blessed and you're blessed and others

2342
01:39:45,899 --> 01:39:50,158
out there are blessed to live in places

2343
01:39:47,579 --> 01:39:53,760
where they have really conscientious

2344
01:39:50,158 --> 01:39:59,819
cultivators who are creating these

2345
01:39:53,760 --> 01:40:01,739
amazing terp Rich uh varietals that I

2346
01:39:59,819 --> 01:40:04,799
think deserve to be experienced in their

2347
01:40:01,738 --> 01:40:07,019
fullest and for me flower vaporization

2348
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:10,020
is a way for for me to taste and

2349
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:12,659
experience that complexity that the

2350
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:15,960
plant has to offer and and the high is

2351
01:40:12,658 --> 01:40:18,000
different than than combusting

2352
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:20,219
well that you know that that's a really

2353
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,899
great ending to the show there mark you

2354
01:40:20,219 --> 01:40:24,119
know I was going to ask you if if there

2355
01:40:21,899 --> 01:40:26,099
are any more boiling point myths that

2356
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:27,779
you wanted to point out and so I am

2357
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:29,159
because I don't you may you may have

2358
01:40:27,779 --> 01:40:30,899
something else that you want to bring to

2359
01:40:29,158 --> 01:40:32,819
the table before we wrap up but that was

2360
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:34,379
that was beautiful uh do you have any

2361
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:36,299
other boiling appointments that you want

2362
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:39,840
to bring up before we end the show well

2363
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:42,300
the well the only real thing is is that

2364
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:45,300
um the mechanism is not really boiling

2365
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:48,380
which is internal to a fluid it's it's

2366
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:51,360
better to think about it as evaporation

2367
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:52,980
and just a rapid evaporation rather than

2368
01:40:51,359 --> 01:40:55,319
than a boiling

2369
01:40:52,979 --> 01:40:57,599
I see so so the charts that point out

2370
01:40:55,319 --> 01:41:00,658
the boiling point they may be

2371
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:03,239
scientifically accurate but but really

2372
01:41:00,658 --> 01:41:05,579
because evaporation starts before

2373
01:41:03,238 --> 01:41:07,799
boiling we're back to

2374
01:41:05,579 --> 01:41:11,039
um you pointing out that it really is

2375
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:13,739
more of a range and it is a range that

2376
01:41:11,039 --> 01:41:17,219
every time we take a hit

2377
01:41:13,738 --> 01:41:19,919
um we're going to cool the the heating

2378
01:41:17,219 --> 01:41:22,439
element to some degree and so we're just

2379
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,060
going to be whatever temperature we we

2380
01:41:22,439 --> 01:41:25,979
pick we're actually just going to be

2381
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:28,380
kind of cycling up and down in that

2382
01:41:25,979 --> 01:41:31,019
General neighborhood yeah some devices

2383
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:33,600
warm up faster and and compensate but

2384
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:35,400
but largely yeah you're you're doing

2385
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,139
that kind of cycling

2386
01:41:35,399 --> 01:41:39,118
um back and forth the boiling points

2387
01:41:37,139 --> 01:41:41,940
again give you the relative how how

2388
01:41:39,118 --> 01:41:43,380
you're going to experience uh that bowl

2389
01:41:41,939 --> 01:41:45,419
I guess

2390
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:47,460
excellent well Mark thank you so much

2391
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:50,639
for being a guest on shaping fire you

2392
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:53,698
know um I've been a fan

2393
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:56,219
um of vaporizers for years and you know

2394
01:41:53,698 --> 01:41:59,460
I but I've never actually like studied

2395
01:41:56,219 --> 01:42:01,800
them very hard and and as I said in the

2396
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:05,639
introduction you know when I met you you

2397
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:07,500
had the actual scientific answers for

2398
01:42:05,639 --> 01:42:09,960
for the questions that I had had for

2399
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:11,880
years and and it was funny because you

2400
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:15,539
know what our first phone call was over

2401
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:18,118
an hour and um and I was like so excited

2402
01:42:15,539 --> 01:42:20,279
to hear you cross applying all this

2403
01:42:18,118 --> 01:42:22,319
vaporization

2404
01:42:20,279 --> 01:42:25,139
um all these vaporization questions I

2405
01:42:22,319 --> 01:42:27,899
had to to you know aeronautical

2406
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:29,940
Aeronautical Engineering and and rocket

2407
01:42:27,899 --> 01:42:32,579
science I was all like oh I have finally

2408
01:42:29,939 --> 01:42:33,899
found my person for for The Vaping show

2409
01:42:32,579 --> 01:42:36,238
so

2410
01:42:33,899 --> 01:42:38,399
um so I really appreciate you

2411
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:39,839
um you know uh coming over and hanging

2412
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:42,359
out with us on shaping fire for a little

2413
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:45,119
while and and um you know sharing your

2414
01:42:42,359 --> 01:42:48,238
expertise and also you know kind of

2415
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:50,460
taking it out of the heady super science

2416
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:52,919
vocabulary that you and I used on our

2417
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:56,039
first phone call and and kind of put it

2418
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:57,779
in layman's turns terms today so that we

2419
01:42:56,039 --> 01:43:00,238
could do a show that would be open to

2420
01:42:57,779 --> 01:43:02,639
everybody so so I I appreciate your

2421
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:05,339
knowledge and your ability to make that

2422
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:07,679
knowledge accessible to all sorts of

2423
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:09,779
different kind of cannabis enthusiasts

2424
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:11,399
well thank you so much Shango and thank

2425
01:43:09,779 --> 01:43:14,399
you for all that you have done over the

2426
01:43:11,399 --> 01:43:16,138
years to really educate consumers about

2427
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:18,420
this wonderful plant and and other

2428
01:43:16,139 --> 01:43:21,000
plants that are out there

2429
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:23,460
um it you've been a part of my own

2430
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,560
educational journey and your guests have

2431
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:27,179
been uh part of that journey and I just

2432
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:29,039
want to do a shout out to all of those

2433
01:43:27,179 --> 01:43:31,739
people in the Cannabis space who are

2434
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:35,519
helping to educate others and to

2435
01:43:31,738 --> 01:43:38,279
demythify this industry because the more

2436
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:40,800
we can demythify it the more we can move

2437
01:43:38,279 --> 01:43:43,139
beyond the stigma and and start really

2438
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:46,440
celebrating what the plant has to offer

2439
01:43:43,139 --> 01:43:50,579
us fabulous all right dear listener um

2440
01:43:46,439 --> 01:43:52,799
if you want to uh learn more from Mark

2441
01:43:50,579 --> 01:43:55,920
um I highly recommend that you check out

2442
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:58,500
his website where he has got a handful

2443
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:00,779
of blog entries that are very

2444
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:02,880
