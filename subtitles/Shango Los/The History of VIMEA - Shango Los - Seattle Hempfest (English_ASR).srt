1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
I sell now let's talk about actual

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,240
Island yeah okay yeah I thought you were

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,609
gonna go that way

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,960
I guess I said now there we go so so I'm

5
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:15,509
changgil oh so I'm the founder of the

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,480
Vashon Island Marijuana ignores Alliance

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,519
and the community organizing that I was

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,949
responsible for him is a little

9
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,160
different than what you've heard so far

10
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:29,429
I realized that back when Washington

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,410
State still had medical we had about 156

12
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:33,149
producers of various summer growers

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,250
summer value-added products like edibles

14
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,439
and things like that but everyone worked

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,628
independently because most of them were

16
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,949
prohibition-era growers and you know as

17
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:44,189
we all know prohibition-era growers

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,500
don't tend to come out of shadows very

19
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,149
easily and connect when they take a

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,950
little encouragement and that's what I

21
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,039
decided I wanted to do because all of

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,320
our growers and and edibles makers we're

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,090
working as if they had to to make the

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,649
entire change themselves they were

25
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,820
selling their products locally and

26
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,070
because everyone was selling their

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,618
products locally the prices were

28
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,599
incredibly low on Vashon Island but the

29
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:09,840
growers were barely making subsistence

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:12,269
level income and so what I did is I I

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,100
formed our first Trade Organization and

32
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,170
brought the growers together and said

33
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,118
hey listen I'm gonna go ahead and make

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,950
relationships for you with Medical

35
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,430
dispensaries over throughout the state

36
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,890
and you can pool your flower and then

37
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,420
we'll create a channel for them to go to

38
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,579
the Medical dispensaries and oh yeah

39
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,989
will you'll be making twice as much as

40
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:33,059
you're making now and they're all like

41
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:34,949
we like your business plan you know and

42
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,810
and then we realize that if we if we

43
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,629
bring together the growers they can bulk

44
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,280
purchase living soil so now living soil

45
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,049
is now at a price that they can afford

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,879
and that was great and then

47
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,649
all right we really want to do probiotic

48
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,500
nutrients but but they're so expensive

49
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,900
you know and then the you know the the

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,489
crappy salt nutrients are cheap and so

51
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,660
sometimes we have to use that but we

52
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,579
don't really want you some like well

53
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,890
let's get everybody together who wants

54
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,900
to do probiotic nutrients and that's by

55
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,900
the book so we did that and so what we

56
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:07,980
did is we took a community of a hundred

57
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,939
and fifty some producers and pulled them

58
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,649
into one

59
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:12,990
so they for the first time began to

60
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,969
speak with one voice and we were able to

61
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,040
start getting coverage in the newspaper

62
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:19,530
as an organization and create the

63
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,870
conversation that growers are people to

64
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,870
growers don't need to be on the fringe

65
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,599
being a grower and creating medicine for

66
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,430
people is an honourable role to play in

67
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,759
the community and not something that we

68
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,800
need to tolerate so so unfortunately you

69
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,810
know it's July of last year the state

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,180
dismantled the medical marijuana

71
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,740
industry of the state and unfortunately

72
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,710
you know the state really turned their

73
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,900
back on all of these grass roots

74
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,730
entrepreneurs that came out of the

75
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,950
shadows and decided okay we will

76
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:52,609
participate with you in this experiment

77
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:55,259
of medical marijuana in Washington and

78
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,430
unfortunately since very few of those

79
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,609
people were allowed to make the

80
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,930
transition to the commercial market

81
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,270
almost all of these businesses were

82
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,400
pushed out of business by the state and

83
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,140
I think that's a shame it put these fees

84
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,090
these parents in the position of I

85
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,889
either need to decide to keep the income

86
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,360
from the business

87
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:14,879
I've been doing for the last you know

88
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,610
five ten years and being illegal or I

89
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,560
need to give up the income and you know

90
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,260
what we've done with you know the kids

91
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,959
extra summer camp and all the extra

92
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:27,239
things that come with being able to have

93
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,699
a successful business so unfortunately

94
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,550
we had to pivot at that point because we

95
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,609
went from 156 producers on the island to

96
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,140
floor and wobbles for producers are

97
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,260
still excellent and we're proud of them

98
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:42,568
than 502 that leaves 152 other families

99
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:44,549
that had their businesses crushed so we

100
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:46,530
pivoted to becoming more of a patient

101
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,870
and a patient and community outreach

102
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,519
organization and we host fantastic

103
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,739
speakers meetings that bring in people

104
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,239
from all over where we talk about

105
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,340
cannabis health and technique the two

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,739
points I wanted you to make sure you get

107
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,229
from this is number one look for a

108
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,030
reason to pull people together we didn't

109
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:04,518
have an organization and the growers

110
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,900
didn't think they needed an organization

111
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,489
until we thought about why don't we pull

112
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,099
everybody together so that we have more

113
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,319
strength together and then second when

114
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,719
the Washington State bureaucracy killed

115
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,579
our market we pivoted to become patient

116
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:19,798
outreach so that we could still keep

117
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,299
coming together and just keep exerting

118
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,560
influence so those are the two things

119
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:24,560
that I want to point out Thanks
