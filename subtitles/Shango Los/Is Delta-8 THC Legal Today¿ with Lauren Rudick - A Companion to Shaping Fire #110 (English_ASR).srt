1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,318
hi there friends this video you're about

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,320
to watch is a companion video for

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:11,679
shaping Fire episode 110 with special

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,000
guest Ethan Russo all about the

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,679
scientific aspects of Delta 8 THC I

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,800
figured it was kind of hard to focus

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,198
only on the medicinal aspects of Delta

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,760
hthc when there is so much discussion

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,359
about the legal aspects of whether or

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,400
not Delta 8 THC is actually legal from

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,000
the US farm bill or not and I'm not a

12
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:33,839
legal expert so I went and I got you one

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,960
we're very happy that Kos science um had

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,000
a webinar last week that included a

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,640
section on the legality of Delta 8 and

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,960
their guest attorney Lauren Ruck has

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,520
graciously offered her part of the

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,280
webinar um to you so that you can check

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,960
it out um at the time this was a paid

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,198
webinar and so they're they're willing

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,399
to pull out this little piece for you so

22
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,719
that you can get a really good solid

23
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,280
understanding of the legality or

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,280
illegality of Delta 8 THC so thank you

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,478
to Kos science and especially thank you

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,680
for attorney Lauren Ruck for sharing

27
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,679

wide variety of cases and uh after her

31
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:29,000
mom used cannabis uh to address terminal

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,040
illness Lauren uh became a cannabis

been a driving force in legalization in

43
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,640
the state of New York welcome Lauren

44
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:02,718
thank you so much um Ethan Anisha I'm so

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,200
happy to be here and to you know share a

46
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,319
stage with you I guess we're going back

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,000
to when Ethan and I first met in 2019 I

48
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,719
had the opportunity to be his moderator

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,598
at the emerald cup and it's been a

50
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,199
tremendous working collaboration since

51
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:17,039
then so very happy to be here um and you

52
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:21,518
know excited to discuss all matters d8

53
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:25,439
um legal matters um okay um Julie you

54
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:29,039
gonna share the screen there we go

55
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:30,878
okay all right um so as Ethan described

56
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,400
in far greater detail and using actual

57
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,840
science um d8 is a psychoactive

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,480
intoxicating cannaboid that occurs

59
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,840
naturally in cannabis plants um

60
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:40,119
including cannabis that meets the

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,360
definition of hemp and we'll get into

62
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,840
that in a little bit um albeit in very

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,640
small quantities um as most of you

64
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,640
probably know distribution of medical

65
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,958
and Adult Ed cannabis is supposed to be

66
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,318
limited to intrastate activity meaning

67
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,878
no Interstate Comm Commerce um and sold

68
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:57,318
strictly in medical or adult use retail

69
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,719
dispensaries um yet Delta 8 can be found

70
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:00,238
almost anywhere you can order it through

71
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,199
the mail you can purchase it at a local

72
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,480
Wellness store even at gas stations or

73
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,439
Big Chain grossers so probably wondering

74
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,919
how that's possible um and it's because

75
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:11,919
most d8 does come from hemp and um hemp

76
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:14,079
is federally legal right um so I really

77
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,958
wish it was that simple um go on to the

78
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,959
next slide Julie

79
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,000
please um okay so as of today there is

80
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:25,759
virtually no consistency in application

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,280
or enforcement between federal and state

82
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,359
law or between and among the various

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,239
States regarding hemp derived cannaboids

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,879
incl clud and especially Delta 8 um as

85
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,400
I'll explain in a bit there does seem to

86
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:36,959
be some legal precedent providing

87
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,080
stability in this area literally

88
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,840
evolving in real time case decided just

89
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,200
last week or the week before so I'll

90
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,920
talk about that in a little bit um but

91
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,359
first I want to take a quick step back

92
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,719
uh to give you a very basic

93
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,159
understanding of the legal framework of

94
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:54,878
hemp under the 2018 farm bill um so the

95
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:57,039
2018 Farm Bill defined hemp to include

96
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:59,318
all derivatives extracts cannaboids

97
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,400
isomers acids salts and salts of isomer

98
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:04,119
with a Delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol

99
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,360
concentration of not more than 3% on a

100
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,959
dry weight basis so they're really

101
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,280
referring to hemp biomass or floral

102
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,840
material when they talk about that dry

103
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,438
weight basis um hemp if it meets this

104
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,319
definition is excluded from the

105
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,040
definition of marijuana which is

106
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:18,519
classified as a schedule one substance

107
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,160
under the federal Controlled Substances

108
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,720
Act um yet THC including those naturally

109
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,840
occurring in the cannabis plant as well

110
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,520
as their synthetic equivalence were made

111
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,638
controlled schedule one substances um so

112
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,000
right away we have this immediate

113
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,199
tension and conflict with respect to

114
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,079
hemp derived THC and the courts and the

115
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,919
daa are publicly grappling with this

116
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:40,279
issue um most delta8 on the market as

117
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,279
Ethan noted is not naturally occurring

118
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,198
um rather most de8 on the market has

119
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:46,679
been converted or synthesized from CBD

120
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,560
um and this is critical because while

121
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,560
the DEA consistently maintains that

122
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,680
cannaboids which naturally derive from

123
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,079
hemp are hemp and are thus Exempted from

124
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,478
the CSA uh the DEA feels very

125
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,959
differently about cannabinoids that have

126
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,319
been synthesized or chemically treated

127
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,638
go on to the next

128
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,399
slide okay so the DEA has taken you know

129
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,918
a pretty strong position on the matter

130
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,719
um according to the DEA the synthesizing

131
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,240
process renders this otherwise legal

132
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,639
substance illegal um in mid August of

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,600
2020 the DEA promulgated an interim

134
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,199
final rule which purports to classify as

135
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,960
a schedule one substance all synthetic

136
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,680
tetrahydrocannabinols so this includes

137
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:27,239
THC thcb thca and Delta 8 um in various

138
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,120
letters and correspondence issued by the

139
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,840
DEA in 2021 uh regarding programs in

140
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,918
Alabama and Florida uh DEA maintained

141
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:36,519
that synthetic cannaboids including hemp

142
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,639
derived delta8 that was converted from

143
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:42,038
CBD is illegal under the CSA yet hemp

144
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,000
derived THC that met the D9

145
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:47,159
concentration 3% total THC or less are

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,639
not so now looking at some of the final

147
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,520
finished products not just the floral

148
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,600
material or the biomass um and then most

149
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,000
recently while indicating that new rules

150
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,280
are coming um you know in February of

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,478
2023 DEA reiterated that Delta 8 that

152
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,239
has been converted from CBD is in fact a

153
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:06,240
controlled substance so following the

154
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,079
dea's line of reasoning if the DEA

155
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,240
naturally occurs in hemp and that hemp

156
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,879
was grown in a 2018 Farm Bill State the

157
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,759
legal inquiry can stop as naturally

158
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,918
occurring cannaboids are clearly exempt

159
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,319
from the CSA pursuant to the 2018 farm

160
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,439
bill but if the d8 has been converted

161
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,000
from CBD the legal status is far less

162
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,918
clear um and then anyone who's

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,360
considering Distributing Delta 8 of

164
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,038
course is going to turn on your appetite

165
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
for risk um so now I want to talk a

166
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,639
little bit about state laws um if you

167
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,160
could go to the next slide great um so

168
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,120
even after resolving this matter from a

169
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,160
federal perspective we have to now turn

170
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,199
to state law and as with everything

171
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,960
involving cannabis state laws differ on

172
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,598
how to treat d8 and until very recently

173
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,519
the state was for states the trend was

174
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:47,918
for states to come down very hard on on

175
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,159
Delta 8 um so legal status really does

176
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,598
vary from Gray to outright

177
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,439
illegal um some states which had not yet

178
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:56,199
operated under the 2018 Farm Bill have

179
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,160
not updated their definitions of hemp to

180
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,960
include isomer derivatives extracts and

181
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,039
or canabo um so Delta 8 very unclear as

182
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,918
to the legal status in those States um

183
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,120
other states deem any form of THC a

184
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,799
controlled substance um some states such

185
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,000
as in New York regulate d8 specifically

186
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,199
um many states simply follow the FDA

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,160
particularly when it comes to the

188
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,879
inclusion of cannaboids including hemp

189
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,479
Drive cannaboids in food and beverage

190
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,280
products and we know the FDA follows the

191
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,839
DEA so a little bit of a circular

192
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:25,878
argument there um and still no analyst

193
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,239
that no analysis of uh hemp derived

194
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,400
cannabinoids would be complete without

195
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,759
considering the federal analog Act of 19

196
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:34,318
86 um d8 could be considered an analog

197
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,240
because it shares structures similar to

198
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,000
schedule one drugs or because the actual

199
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,918
intended effect is substantially similar

200
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,759
to or in some instances greater than a

201
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,159
schedule one drug lots of basis to

202
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,598
consider whether Delta H should be

203
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,400
regulated like THC if you're

204
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,519
sufficiently confused it's okay so our

205
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,239
most legal experts um all of this

206
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,878
confusion was sure to spark lawsuits and

207
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,519
the wave has certainly decidedly begun

208
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,639
um so multiple States including New York

209
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,120
Arkansas Alabama Oklahoma Oregon have

210
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,000
passed laws that restrict or otherwise

211
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,918
render illegal production and sale of

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,199
delta8 products um of Delta eight

213
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,000
generally and products that contain

214
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,520
Delta 8 and the lawsuits have begun to

215
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,680
try to take those laws down after the

216
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,758
next slide

217
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,439
please okay so um perhaps our federal

218
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,000
court system will resolve this tension

219
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,120
um starting with a decision earlier this

220
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,639
month uh the case is styled Biogen

221
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,639
versus Sanders it was brought in federal

222
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,319
court in the eastern distri district of

223
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,759
Arkansas um the plaintiffs were Biogen

224
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,919
of um LLC of fville a drippers vape shop

225
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,360
of green Brier the cigarette store of

226
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:34,519
Colorado doing business as Smoker

227
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,759
Friendly and Sky Marketing Corp of Texas

228
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,278
doing business as Hometown hero um this

229
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,038
was a big win because what the

230
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:42,158
plaintiffs ultimately do did was

231
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:43,679
preclude enforcement of this law on the

232
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,519
night before the law was supposed to

233
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,399
take effect so it was a very big uh

234
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,080
legal deal um this lawsuit named the

235
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,320
governor Sarah hucke Sanders the

236
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,920
Attorney General of the state the

237
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,600
directors of the Arkansas Department of

238
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:55,719
Finance and admin the Tobacco Control

239
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Board the State Department of

240
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,120
Agriculture the state plant board and

241
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,759
the 28 Prosecuting attorneys as the of

242
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,399
the state as defendants so they named

243
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,078
everybody who has any impact or any

244
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,078
finger on the pulse of the enforcement

245
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,319
and administration of this law in

246
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:11,838
Arkansas um the plaintiff sought an

247
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,640
injunction prohibiting enforcement of

248
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,519
this bill um the bill criminalized all

249
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,399
hemp products produced as a result of

250
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,200
synthetic chemical process and any other

251
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,639
psychoactive substance that was derived

252
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,480
there from um the plaintiffs did argue

253
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,240
that the Act was preempted by the 2018

254
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,839
farm bill and that the act's provisions

255
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,039
were unconstitutionally vague and

256
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,600
ambiguous um and the court agreed um and

257
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,319
entered in a junction barring the state

258
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,360
from enforcing the ACT um in its ruling

259
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,360
the court made a series of

260
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,320
pronouncements which they do apply only

261
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,079
to the law in Arkansas but they could

262
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,760
nonetheless establish a precedent upon

263
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:45,639
which all similar prohibitive State

264
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,319
programs could be invalidated um so to

265
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:49,439
this end the Court ruled that the ACT is

266
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,720
preempted by federal law a concept known

267
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,880
as conflict preemption because Arkansas

268
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,680
has already joined the 2018 farm bill

269
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,278
and the 2018 Farm Bill does not limit

270
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,120
its application to Method by which

271
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,879
derivatives extracts and cannaboids are

272
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,679
produced as long as the downstream

273
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,278
products result from plants that contain

274
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:08,120
less than 3% THC they are legal hemp um

275
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:10,278
very important here the state did reject

276
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,200
any notion of testing based upon a post

277
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:14,360
decarbo decarbox silation method um this

278
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,879
is something that has been profer by

279
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,519
various states in the DEA um as this

280
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,120
reads qualifiers into the definition of

281
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,720
hemp beyond that was what was intended

282
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,959
by the 2018 farm

283
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,200
bill um the court also found that the

284
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:28,278
Act was preempted by federal law on a a

285
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,920
concept known as Express preemption um

286
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:31,480
so Al those States are in fact allowed

287
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,159
to regulate the production growing and

288
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,959
cultivation of hemp more strictly than

289
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,679
federal law they cannot restrict

290
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,599
interstate commerce of hemp products

291
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,799
including hemp derived products if those

292
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,320
products derive from lawful hemp so here

293
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,599
the ACT um in Arkansas would have

294
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,920
precluded Commerce of hemp derived

295
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,079
delta8 products that were lawfully

296
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,719
produced in other states and then the

297
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:50,919
court found that the Act was vague and

298
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,480
thus void you know laws can be very ill

299
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:53,759
conceived um but the court found that

300
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,440
the Act contained terms that would

301
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,679
confuse even an exceptionally

302
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,000
intelligent reader um to this end the

303
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,958
Act contained terms like Contin

304
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
continuous Transportation synthetic

305
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,599
substances psychotic psychoactive

306
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,120
substance none of which were actually

307
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,079
defined in the statute um the ACT also

308
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,560
made references to dangers of misuse

309
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:12,799
risks to the public all of which are

310
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,518
highly subjective um so this was hardly

311
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,159
a basis upon which the court felt

312
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,560
wielding criminal sanctions or criminal

313
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,199
penalties was appropriate go on to the

314
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,679
next slide so still thinking about

315
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,079
Distributing d8 maybe um you know if

316
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,599
you're thinking about a distribution

317
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:28,638
strategy that involves Delta 8 and you

318
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,720
want to mitigate legal exposure you know

319
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,240
know science um make sure you really

320
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,240
want to spend your resources on a

321
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,519
product that as Ethan said likely only

322
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,320
exists owing to Federal illegality of

323
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,679
cannabis um you definitely want to

324
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,639
retain an attorney who is expert and

325
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,679
fluent in hemp regulation these laws are

326
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,799
changing on a weekly sometimes daily

327
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,759
basis analysis that we've done in one

328
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:49,240
state a month ago likely to be stale so

329
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,559
you really got to keep up with with the

330
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,159
with the regulations as they change um

331
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,559
and don't just rely on your lawyers you

332
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:56,719
have to become an expert in all matters

333
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,638
hemp um we're expecting a new iteration

334
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,240
of the farm bill this year um this could

335
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,799
resolve all outstanding matters

336
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,360
regarding intoxicating cannaboids

337
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,159
regardless of their hemp derived or

338
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,759
cannabis derived um so you got to be

339
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,759
your own expert um you have to retain

340
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,078
attorneys and you have to have an

341
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,639
ongoing dialogue um because any

342
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,439
distribution strategy has to be very

343
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,680
flexible and adaptable we would

344
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,399
recommend maintaining low production

345
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:18,838
runs giving how quickly the regulatory

346
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,399
landscape changes in this area um we

347
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,160
would recommend strong representations

348
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,519
and warranties in written contracts

349
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,039
where was the hemp grone how the

350
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,919
products were produced how to shift the

351
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,319
risk of Regulatory Compliance what

352
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:31,319
happens if somebody gets hurt and then

353
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,560
be sure to seek indemnification because

354
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,720
um you know of course representations

355
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,000
and warranties are very little if you

356
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,120
don't have legal recourse to enforce

357
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,879
them um so those are my practice

358
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,278
pointers uh to the extent that anyone is

359
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,078
interested in engaging in the d8 uh

360
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,399
space even after hearing um Ethan's

361
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,519
presentation and knowing that there are

362
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,839
really far Superior Products out there

363
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:49,159
um so thank you for staying with me I

364
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,600
know the science is far sexier than the

365
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:53,120
legal technicalities um and ultimately

366
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,759
while this legal exercise is somewhat

367
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,360
thrilling for us lawyers um we do

368
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:58,000
continue to strive for consistency and

369
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,440
application we're looking for Clear

370
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,360
rules that are easy to to follow that

371
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,360
are rooted in actual science of course

372
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,680
not racial animosity or any desire to

373
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,839
suppress political speech which is how

374
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,759
cannabis wound up on the Controlled

375
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:12,079
Substances Act in the first instance um

376
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:13,679
so ultimately um we just really need to

377
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,799
stay on top of Delta 8 the distribution

378
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,399
of Delta 8 and and decide for ourselves

379
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,439
whether this is you know a cannaboid and

380
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,879
product that we want to continue

381
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,920
promoting as we see further

382
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,919
liberalization of cannabis

383
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,920
generally and that's

384
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,759
it
