2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,309
there is no doubt that after sheer

3
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:13,910
curiosity the most common reason people

4
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:15,899
become interested in cannabis is pain

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,210
pain is terrible

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,399
it interrupts our lives occupies our

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,730
minds and emotions and becomes the boss

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:26,038
of everything pain takes the last of our

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,528
will to do things limits our activities

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,050
and is emotionally crushing as it

11
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,549
repeats incessantly that things are out

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,239
of our control

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:38,218
and that we are living in a broken body

14
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:40,979
all the drugs commonly prescribed by

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,679
Western doctors offer little help cost a

16
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:46,140
great deal and in the end often leave us

17
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,488
craving and addicted physically which

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,759
just adds to our feeling of

19
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:52,948
powerlessness it doesn't matter if you

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,920
have carpal tunnel a broken back an

21
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:57,030
incurable disease are just too sore from

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,640
working in the garden

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,448
pain limits us and weighs on us

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,118
emotionally but prior to Prohibition the

25
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:08,548
American pharmacopoeia was filled with

26
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,549
uses for cannabis to fight a variety of

27
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,618
pain humans have been using cannabis for

28
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,700
pain and discomfort for generations and

29
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:19,829
it worked but now that prohibition is

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,570
unraveling we have access to cannabis

31
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,239
medicine like never before

32
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:26,849
it is incredibly safe far safer than

33
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,629
prescriptions and can be grown and

34
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:32,219

marketing investment to shaping fire for

59
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,640
only a fraction of what it would cost

60
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,590
you to attend just one convention you

61
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,259
can advertise for nearly a year on

62
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,000
shaping fire it has been a busy few

63
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:32,739
weeks as other companies have reached

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,780
out to shaping fire because their whole

65
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,060
year of customer outreach events were

66
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,090
just canceled and they are scrambling

67
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,129
for new ways to reach their customers

68
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,170
the audience for shaping fire is made up

69
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:46,750

entrepreneurs and home growers and you

71
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,819

in Portland Oregon today we're going to

96
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,329
talk about transitioning from using

97
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:57,549
opioids to cannabis for treating pain

98
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,739
well welcome to the show 80 Thank You

99
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:00,939
Shango it's so great to be here I really

100
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,219
appreciate you sharing some of your

101
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:06,579
valuable time with us I know that even

102
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:08,650
during a pandemic you are busy busy busy

103
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,219
so thank you so much for joining us you

104
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,780
bet

105
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:12,669
so let's get right into it you know

106
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,389
since we're going to be talking a lot

107
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:19,358
about how opiates and cannabis moderate

108
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:21,788
the experience of pain I think we should

109
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,729
probably get all on the same page about

110
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:26,240
what pain

111
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:28,520
is and how we experience it biologically

112
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,949
so so let's start with that what's going

113
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:35,649
on physically in the brain that senses

114
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:38,629
pain sure pain is a very useful

115
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:42,259
phenomenon it is a feedback system that

116
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:45,829
our body uses to keep us alive if we

117
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:47,599
didn't have pain we wouldn't know that

118
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:49,609
we were encountering things in our

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,800
environment that are potentially

120
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,860
hazardous to our tissue into our lives

121
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,980
so a great example of this is people who

122
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,410
have a congenital insensitivity to pain

123
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,210
so that is you know they can walk over

124
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,740
coals and they can break their arm and

125
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:06,049
they can you know burn their hands and

126
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,000
have absolutely no idea and these

127
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,860
individuals end up living very short

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,870
lives because we actually need that

129
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,770
feedback from our environment to protect

130
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:18,680
our tissue in our lives so pain is the

131
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:21,979
phenomenon where our central nervous

132
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,980
system our brain registers noxious

133
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,920
information from our environment now

134
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,840
that's all well and good but there are a

135
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,350
lot of conditions under which that

136
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:36,409
system goes haywire so for instance you

137
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:40,040
know if you have an individual with an

138
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,650
amputee that individual can often end up

139
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,090
developing phantom limb pain that is

140
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:48,799
they have pain in the absence of the

141
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:53,060
biological thing that the pain is trying

142
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,910
to protect so that example tells us that

143
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,980
there's something more than just you

144
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,070
have nerves out in your fingertips and

145
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,450
in your arms and in your skin which are

146
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:04,879
transferring information about the

147
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:07,039
environment into the spinal cord and

148
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,259
that signal is being sent up to the

149
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,840
brain and the brain is putting together

150
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:15,740
a picture of what the environment is

151
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:20,509
like so it's more complex than you know

152
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:22,699
merely a sensory system that is

153
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:25,789
integrating information inside of our

154
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:29,420
brain the brain really has a powerful

155
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:31,730
role in constructing what the

156
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:35,030
environment and what the body is going

157
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,330
through so pain although it is a useful

158
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:39,000
thing

159
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,169
it also can really go haywire and there

160
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,240
a lot of those things that go wrong

161
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,069
happen at the level of the brain not

162
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,100
necessarily at the level of the tissue

163
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:50,639
that phantom limb example that you gave

164
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:54,439
I find extraordinarily interesting it

165
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:59,129
has been explained to me before that

166
00:06:54,439 --> 00:07:02,939
that pain is it takes place in the brain

167
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:04,980
and you know I normally find that to be

168
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:08,339
kind of a semantic difference that's not

169
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,189
incredibly helpful to patients but but

170
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:14,939
it is very interesting when talking

171
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:18,300
about secession of pain with opiates and

172
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:21,120
cannabis and yet occasionally I'll come

173
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,910
across a healthcare worker who says no

174
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,699
describing that pain is in the brain is

175
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:29,670
very helpful to for patients because it

176
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:32,579
allows them to have an understanding

177
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:36,060
that they can manage their pain with

178
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:40,109
thought and perspective and with drugs

179
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:43,290
instead of they are a victim to their

180
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,330
hip or whatever right really complex

181
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:48,660
thing it really is and you're absolutely

182
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:50,129
true that pain does take place in the

183
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,220
brain and we have you know a whole

184
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:55,379
network of you know brain structures

185
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,790
that are involved in constructing that

186
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:01,649
picture for us and you know when I was

187
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:04,860
our early postdoc my first year as a

188
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:07,859
postdoc in Sydney I went to a talk that

189
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,400
was given by a number of folks who were

190
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,290
involved in clinical pain work and at

191
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,959
the time Australia was really cutting

192
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:18,060
edge in their view of pain because they

193
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,629
actually gave chronic pain its own

194
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,420
disease category like pain is a disease

195
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:27,629
chronic pain is a disease and that still

196
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,550
doesn't really have you know chronic

197
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:32,789
pain doesn't have that kind of

198
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,960
recognition here in North America and so

199
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:38,250
I'm at this talk as you know budding

200
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,889
pharmacologist and physiologist you know

201
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,539
my job was to measure neurotransmitter

202
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:45,649
release that was being released from

203
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,909
neurons and brain slices hard hard core

204
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:48,639
physiology and pharmacology you know

205
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:50,919
drugs in

206
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,899
acting with the brain receptors and then

207
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:56,679
you know change is happening in neuron

208
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:59,350
activity and I'm watching this talk and

209
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:01,359
I'm seeing these patients and I'm

210
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,649
hearing them describe their lives and

211
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,100
how they're able to have these

212
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:08,319
absolutely debilitating injuries and yet

213
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,690
they wake up every day and they say yeah

214
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,550
you know my pains at about an eighth

215
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,380
today you know sitting here in front of

216
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:16,539
you in this chair and you're like why

217
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:19,450
how how can you be physically

218
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:22,809
registering so much bodily sensation and

219
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:26,290
yet totally nonplussed just completely

220
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:28,869
fine with it and you know from from this

221
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:32,379
talk I really began to understand that

222
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:36,220
the cognitive component of coping with

223
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:40,960
pain walking with pain living beside

224
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:43,690
pain that ability resides wholly in our

225
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:47,230
brain that is totally within our control

226
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:50,500
and it really is you know a testament to

227
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:54,009
the the power of our thought the power

228
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:57,840
of our cognition and our attention what

229
00:09:54,009 --> 00:10:00,789
we pay attention to grows and magnifies

230
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,649
and it's not that you necessarily turn

231
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:05,259
your attention away from the pain

232
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:08,110
although you know that is one coping

233
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:12,220
strategy there it's more shifting your

234
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:13,870
your attention to something else so you

235
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,310
know and as a pharmacologist I'm like

236
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:19,990
well what the heck am i doing you know

237
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:22,449
what is my better pain therapies make

238
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,940
better drugs and and you know all we

239
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,830
need is is meditation and coping

240
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:30,480
strategies and cognitive behavioral

241
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:33,850
therapy and biofeedback what okay I quit

242
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,769
so you're absolutely right you know pain

243
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,649
lives in the brain and we have an

244
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:41,259
enormous amount of power and control

245
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:44,019
over it if we can learn the tools to

246
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:46,210
harness it you know we'll talk a lot

247
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,949
more about cannabis as a distracting

248
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:52,389
later on but I want to double down on

249
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:54,940
your experience with the the mental the

250
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:56,949
powerful mental capabilities of pain

251
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,390
patients you know I'm very grateful that

252
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:02,320
I haven't had a lot of pain in my

253
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:05,710
except when I had an injury and rotated

254
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,300
my l5 and was in like a hysterical

255
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,160
amount of pain more than I'd ever been

256
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,379
in my life where I was just like

257
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:15,309
squirming on the doctor's table because

258
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:20,409
my mind was was just all I was all

259
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:22,839
bright and when I meet patients through

260
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:24,309
you know teaching about canvas medicine

261
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,190
and traveling forward and everything and

262
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:29,109
and I meet these folks and and like you

263
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,750
said they you know they're having an

264
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:35,050
eight day but they are presenting

265
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,899
themselves as calm cool and collected at

266
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:40,449
the talk or whatever and then you know

267
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:42,220
we get together kind of like on the side

268
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,170
and we sit next to each other and we

269
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,930
talk and and I'm trying to understand

270
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:48,789
the nature of their pain so I can make

271
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:50,679
some sort of recommendation to them

272
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:55,089
because that's what they're there for

273
00:11:50,679 --> 00:12:00,370
and the more we talk about it

274
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:02,830
it brings them mentally away from their

275
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,570
I don't know let's say meditative life

276
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:08,500
where they're just they're focusing on

277
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:10,780
the doing nosov life and intentionally

278
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,379
distracting themselves from the pain but

279
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:17,769
as they describe it more in detail you

280
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:20,950
can see the the defense's coming down

281
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:23,889
and you know very often by the time

282
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,710
we're done understanding the nature of

283
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:29,649
their pain they are shaking and in tears

284
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:33,340
and the only thing that's changed is

285
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:35,110
that part of us doing you know what we

286
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,600
were there to do was they needed to let

287
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,970
down their guard and be vulnerable for a

288
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,610
moment and when they let down their

289
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,820
guard I got to truly see the pain

290
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,710
expressed through them and you know it's

291
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,950
very difficult as somebody who's trying

292
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,450
to help somebody to not get like like

293
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,040
sucked in to that experience of

294
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,190
compassion with them and start crying -

295
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:59,740
right I got to tell you working with

296
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,440
pain patients and getting to know them

297
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:06,340
and being one for a while and in a small

298
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,990
way really has given me a huge respect

299
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,290
for people who deal with chronic pain

300
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:13,299
every day ABB's

301
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:16,750
there's a couple of things in there that

302
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:19,208
I want to unpack one of which is that

303
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,649
attention right so when you're when

304
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:23,289
you're paying attention and you're

305
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:26,009
really digging in and looking at it and

306
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:28,778
describing it and putting words to it

307
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:32,828
I'm gonna talk about that and then I

308
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:35,919
also let's let's start there so in that

309
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:38,159
attention I worked with a fibromyalgia

310
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:42,458
patient once who told me you know I

311
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:44,439
noticed that on my worst pain days those

312
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:47,859
were the days I was taking my opioids

313
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,110
and I I couldn't tell if you know I was

314
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:53,259
taking the opioids because it was my

315
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,539
worst pain day or if my pain was worse

316
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:58,360
because I was spending so much time

317
00:13:55,539 --> 00:14:00,599
thinking about should I take a half a

318
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,509
pill or should I take a whole pill today

319
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:08,350
so just the body scan the physical body

320
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:11,679
scan of looking for the pain that's what

321
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,570
makes the pain real right so she was

322
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,189
going through her process of waking up

323
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,560
in the morning and doing her body scan

324
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:21,040
and just by paying attention to it

325
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:23,768
that's what fed the need for her pain

326
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:30,370
relievers gosh so that makes total sense

327
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:32,500
and it's so sad to doing that

328
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:36,519
this morning right waking up and going

329
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,470
oh boy is it gonna be today and and

330
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,570
really going in and looking for it and

331
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:44,410
digging into those things you know and

332
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:46,180
if you're over 35 you can you can find

333
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:48,309
that within your body if you really want

334
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:50,109
to there's some spot that ails all of us

335
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:54,159
cuz you know that's what it's like to

336
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:56,289
have a body but the other component that

337
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,909
you talk about is that emotional

338
00:14:56,289 --> 00:15:02,828
component of pain so my colleagues and I

339
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:05,828
Wash U and st. Louis we put out a paper

340
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:07,629
in the journal neuron last year and it

341
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:10,139
was in mice and and some of it was in

342
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:13,750
rats but what we demonstrated is that

343
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:16,439
the physical the bodily sensation of

344
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:20,528
pain and the emotional or affective

345
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:23,640
component of pain are inseparable they

346
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:27,269
are two symptoms of the same

347
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:30,360
that are being driven by this this

348
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:32,820
little network in the brain so you know

349
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,360
we have been going about treating pain

350
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:38,278
from the bodily you know sensation of it

351
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,860
for many decades you know that's the

352
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:43,500
whole reason that opioids exists as

353
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,320
you've been trying to anesthetize the

354
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:50,100
physical sensations of pain with this

355
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,310
drug but our work demonstrates that you

356
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,800
can't just ignore the emotional

357
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:58,828
component of pain because it is

358
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,599
literally wrapped up in the exact same

359
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:02,609
brain areas and the exact same

360
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,639
mechanisms that are happening with the

361
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:08,190
bodily sensations of pain and we see

362
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,409
this you know like roughly 80 plus

363
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,750
percent of patients with chronic pain

364
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:16,049
also experience some kind of mood

365
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:19,409
disorder like anxiety depression or both

366
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:21,449
so it's no surprise that you know people

367
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:24,199
who are in chronic pain also have

368
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,670
depression because that is literally the

369
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,550
manifestation of chronic pain it has

370
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:32,789
both a bodily component and an emotional

371
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:35,549
component so whatever we do to treat

372
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:38,669
pain chronic pain we have to think of

373
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:40,469
the organism holistically we have to

374
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:42,539
think of the emotional well-being as

375
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:45,899
well as the physical well-being of the

376
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:48,958
body well I really like the fact that

377
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:52,679
you are you focus so much on the

378
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:55,319
vocabulary of pain as well and it's it's

379
00:16:52,679 --> 00:17:00,120
interesting people who are new to their

380
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:02,940
pain they often struggle to describe it

381
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,919
because you know luckily up to this

382
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,759
point in their life they haven't had to

383
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,890
describe it

384
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,588
whereas people who have had lifelong

385
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,449
pain you know they can they can describe

386
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:13,948
it on a number chart and they've got all

387
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,870
these different flavors of it it's like

388
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:19,140
it's they've got like a Crayola box

389
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:21,389
you know descriptors so so let's let's

390
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,030
talk about that for a moment because so

391
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:27,270
often people who are coming to cannabis

392
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:29,879
for pain one of the challenges that they

393
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:32,190
have is delineating between the types of

394
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,980
pain either for themselves like in their

395
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,390
pain Journal or to the doctor and we

396
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,349
know that there are different types of

397
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,360
pain right there's that there

398
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:42,000
a big difference between the the sharp

399
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:46,219
and stabby pain from a fresh fractured

400
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,380
fracture versus the kind of like

401
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,179
mind-boggling everywhere experience when

402
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:55,620
you're having a flare-up of rheumatoid

403
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:58,590
arthritis right so so I don't I don't

404
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:03,689
actually know anything about this part

405
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:06,769
of the process what do you use as a as I

406
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:10,140
guess a range of how to describe pain

407
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:14,490
well you know you're right in that no

408
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:17,520
one's pain is is like anyone else's

409
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,470
right so it seems important to think

410
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,900
about like is this throbbing is it

411
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,400
stabbing and in the clinic those kinds

412
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,590
of things are really useful from a

413
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,380
diagnosis perspective because you can

414
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:30,058
say AHA this is these kinds of

415
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,190
descriptors would indicate an

416
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,950
inflammatory condition which means we

417
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:37,400
need to treat it in this way versus oh

418
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:41,340
those kinds of district descriptors

419
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:43,440
indicate some kind of neuropathy so some

420
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:46,859
kind of damage to the nerves or some

421
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,850
kind of problem with the transmission of

422
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:53,399
the nerve signals so so those kinds of

423
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:56,339
pain are better treated with these

424
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,169
modalities so that kind of vocabulary is

425
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:02,240
really important in the clinic for

426
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:05,850
diagnosing a path forward for treatment

427
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,159
however on the other hand you know I

428
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:11,189
tend to make the argument that you know

429
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,350
once you've gotten past that initial you

430
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,330
know diagnosis stage and you know what

431
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:17,668
kind of pain you're dealing with you

432
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:20,879
know then it doesn't really matter

433
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:23,640
because it's all subjective it's all

434
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,000
only happening to you inside of your own

435
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,038
brain from your perspective and no one's

436
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,529
pain is similar you know you can have

437
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:35,940
two individuals who have the exact same

438
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:39,538
injury like a rib fracture right same

439
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,850
rib same spot and yet their descriptions

440
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,890
of the pain how much the pain bothers

441
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:47,668
them how that pain interferes with their

442
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:49,200
life it's all totally different and so

443
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:51,570
yes on the one hand

444
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,730
being able to have words for your

445
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:56,129
experience is really helpful and it's

446
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,500
also when you're in a community setting

447
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,600
and you're you're getting support from

448
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,460
other people who have the same kind of

449
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,969
ailment that you do it's really

450
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,950
validating to hear oh yes that's exactly

451
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,079
what I feel and it's so comforting to

452
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:13,080
know that another human being feels what

453
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:15,240
I feel but on the other hand it's

454
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:18,148
totally subjective and irrelevant

455
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:22,048
because all that matters is how you feel

456
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:25,018
and so if you're feeling bad in any way

457
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:27,269
whatever those bad words are then then

458
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:29,190
that's a starting point for how can we

459
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:31,259
start feeling better how can we shift

460
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,960
the attention the conversation the

461
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:35,819
treatment the therapy your day how can

462
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,308
we shift all of that so that whatever

463
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:40,678
descriptors you're using you start to

464
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:43,079
feel better let's follow up on that

465
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,470
because it is so common your I like your

466
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:48,960
example of the the same disc dislocated

467
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:52,169
rib in the same place and two people

468
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:57,210
will have different experiences of pain

469
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:59,720
it is so incredibly common that the

470
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:02,669
person who's experiencing more pain

471
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,278
whereas other people experience less

472
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:07,440
pain are written off as being a wuss

473
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:10,048
like they can't handle it later they're

474
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,230
immature they're being a baby about it

475
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:16,648
and I always think that invalidating

476
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:18,889
somebody else's pain is is not

477
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:22,229
legitimate and and certainly there are

478
00:21:18,888 --> 00:21:24,298
situations where we want to encourage

479
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,190
someone to not focus on their pain which

480
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:30,298
is a different thing but but in

481
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:33,269
validating a patient having their pain

482
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:35,788
invalidated by friends family or even a

483
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:37,019
health practitioner is just wrong and I

484
00:21:35,788 --> 00:21:39,960
just want to hear what you have to say

485
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:42,359
about that I mean to me like the perfect

486
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,710
example is like the hysterical woman

487
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:49,408
right how many hundreds of years you

488
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:52,980
know women do experience more chronic

489
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:55,409
pain and women have more you know

490
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:58,259
painful things that are associated with

491
00:21:55,409 --> 00:22:00,990
childbirth and reproduction hormonal

492
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:01,929
imbalance and for many hundreds of years

493
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,999
that way

494
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:06,600
completely invalidated and we were seen

495
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:10,389
as the weaker sex and you know we were

496
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:13,719
shunned by you know psychotherapists and

497
00:22:10,388 --> 00:22:16,658
you know the the it's that that to me is

498
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,118
like the most extreme extreme example of

499
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:22,269
totally invalidating someone else's

500
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:25,118
experience and I feel very grateful that

501
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:29,589
now we live in a time where you know we

502
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:32,678
are slowly being able to recognize that

503
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:36,189
each individual's reality has as much

504
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:38,528
value as anyone else's reality you know

505
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:40,808
I I'm really inspired by like my

506
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:42,730
undergrad you know students who come

507
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:44,798
through the laboratory and these are

508
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,288
like privileged white kids who go to a

509
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,908
private school and yet at the same time

510
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:50,798
they go oh I'm sorry I can't talk about

511
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:53,440
that that's a trigger for me you know

512
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:56,558
and everyone respects that like wow like

513
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:00,190
this is a next evolution in humanity

514
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:02,470
we're talking about here so so I I'm

515
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,379
really encouraged by you know this idea

516
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,600
that we're all coming to accept that if

517
00:23:05,378 --> 00:23:11,109
this is real for you then it's real for

518
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:13,118
you right on so I imagine that you know

519
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:16,209
you know you know in a paint in a

520
00:23:13,118 --> 00:23:18,819
chronic pain textbook in the school

521
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,249
there's a chapter on the different types

522
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:23,200
of pain and you know if there's there's

523
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:25,089
a there's a section on inflammation and

524
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,409
there's a section on nerve damage and

525
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:32,648
you know you study chronic pain

526
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:34,690
intensely and for years and so will you

527
00:23:32,648 --> 00:23:38,349
give us a general understanding of the

528
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:40,298
different categories of chronic pain yes

529
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:42,490
certainly for me they fall into three

530
00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:44,740
big buckets which to of what you

531
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:47,618
mentioned already you know the

532
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:50,048
inflammatory pain the neuropathic pain

533
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:52,329
so that is you know some kind of damage

534
00:23:50,048 --> 00:23:54,819
or dysfunction in the nervous system

535
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:56,730
that is causing pain and then we have

536
00:23:54,819 --> 00:24:00,368
this other weird one which is like this

537
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:03,278
mysterious you know sort of central pain

538
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:05,859
something like fibromyalgia where you

539
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:08,859
can't really pin down exactly what's

540
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:11,528
going wrong with any particular part of

541
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:14,439
the physical biology of the organism and

542
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:16,839
yet the organism is still reporting

543
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,700
that they're in severe pain so that

544
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,918
they're those are the three broad

545
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,750
categories that inflammatory the

546
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,110
neuropathic and then the centralized

547
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:28,839
pain and there there can be a lot of

548
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:31,269
transition from either inflammatory pain

549
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:33,308
to central pain or neuropathic pain to

550
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:36,370
central pain you know for instance where

551
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:37,898
you have an injury that totally resolves

552
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:41,288
you know there's some kind of you know

553
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:43,268
car accident or work-related injury the

554
00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:45,788
injury is totally resolved and yet the

555
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:49,450
brain for potentially the rest of its

556
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:51,220
life still keeps registering some kind

557
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,259
of discomfort so there can be a

558
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:57,190
transition from one of those two types

559
00:24:53,259 --> 00:25:00,099
to centralized pain there is also there

560
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:02,740
tends to be an inflammatory component to

561
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:04,808
even neuropathic pain especially in the

562
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,798
early days of the development of

563
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:10,359
neuropathic pain so for instance

564
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:14,918
chemotherapy induced neuropathy so

565
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:16,569
people who often survive cancer will you

566
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:18,700
know though beat their cancer but

567
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:20,740
they'll be stuck with this neuropathic

568
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,950
pain that was induced by the

569
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:26,500
chemotherapeutic drugs attacking the

570
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,360
central nervous system or nervous system

571
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,128
so when I say peripheral that's

572
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:31,898
everything outside of the brain and

573
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:34,418
spinal cord and central nervous system

574
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:36,819
is the brain and spinal cord itself so

575
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:39,220
you know chemo drugs will attack the

576
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:42,028
nerves throughout the body and leave the

577
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:45,069
cancer survivor' with this lifelong pain

578
00:25:42,028 --> 00:25:46,839
but in the very early days of the

579
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:49,058
development of chemotherapy induced

580
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:51,158
neuropathy there is an inflammatory

581
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:55,480
component right those chemotherapeutic

582
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:58,000
drugs pull in the brain's immune system

583
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,460
or I'm sorry the body's immune system in

584
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,089
all of our processes that we have for

585
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:07,720
fighting off pathogens and the it

586
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:10,269
recruits our inflammatory processes to

587
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,329
start the damage to the nerves so

588
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:14,980
although yes you can sort of put things

589
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:17,199
roughly into these buckets of

590
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:20,919
inflammatory pain where you have all of

591
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:24,460
these you know the the body recruits

592
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:27,549
certain molecules to draw blood and draw

593
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:30,429
attention to you know some in

594
00:26:27,548 --> 00:26:34,888
dating process or pathogen you get

595
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:38,889
swelling you know you know edema redness

596
00:26:34,888 --> 00:26:40,928
soreness there's more fluid and joints

597
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:43,238
for instance so there's all of those

598
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:45,070
like that's a very molecular process

599
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:48,730
where there's just a whole lot of like

600
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:51,069
molecules you know flying around going

601
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,079
crazy doing their jobs hustling and

602
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:56,109
bustling to try and keep this organism

603
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:59,079
alive to the extent that it is you know

604
00:26:56,109 --> 00:27:01,479
somewhat maladaptive you know we have so

605
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:03,548
much of the body trying to protect

606
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,069
itself that it is actually you know

607
00:27:03,548 --> 00:27:08,710
really painful for the person who has

608
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:11,558
the body so you know that although you

609
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:14,319
can put you know in inflammation in its

610
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:16,898
own bucket there is largely an implement

611
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:19,689
and inflammatory component to

612
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:22,238
neuropathic pain and then either one of

613
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:24,369
those things can develop into a central

614
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:27,009
pain once the inflammation has gone away

615
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:29,648
once the nerve has totally regenerated

616
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:32,440
or you know whatever other neuropathic

617
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:34,928
thing might have happened alright good

618
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,080
so I'm gonna let's change directions a

619
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:40,330
little bit now that we have established

620
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:43,778
you know what what playing field we are

621
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:47,888
on with pain and that pain is

622
00:27:43,778 --> 00:27:50,739
experienced in the brain let's talk

623
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:52,298
about opioids themselves and so we're

624
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:54,720
not gonna spend a whole lot of time

625
00:27:52,298 --> 00:27:57,999
talking about the you know the

626
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,528
pharmacology of opioids because that's

627
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:02,108
that's not really what we're about I

628
00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:04,419
think everybody who's here and listening

629
00:28:02,108 --> 00:28:07,658
has already made the decision that that

630
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:11,049
they already want to move away from from

631
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:15,039
opioids so however if we're talking

632
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:16,269
about replacing opioids with cannabis we

633
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,999
certainly need to have an understanding

634
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:21,909
of what opioids do what their method of

635
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:26,259
action is so that later on in the show

636
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:30,970
we can compare that to cannabis so would

637
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:34,179
you give us an understanding of what

638
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:37,269
opioids are doing and why there is a

639
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:38,080
belief that that decreases pain yeah you

640
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:40,028
bet

641
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,249
you know I think that you're right

642
00:28:40,028 --> 00:28:44,378
you know a lot of your listeners are

643
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:46,389
here and a lot of Americans and

644
00:28:44,378 --> 00:28:49,418
Canadians and people all over the world

645
00:28:46,388 --> 00:28:51,668
are interested in cannabis because it is

646
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:54,549
so obvious that you know opioids are

647
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:57,038
nasty drugs and that is true

648
00:28:54,548 --> 00:29:01,019
you know we clearly have a huge overdose

649
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:05,618
epidemic on our hands however their

650
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:08,048
opioids are really good drugs under very

651
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:10,769
few conditions you know like the whole

652
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:13,808
reason they exist is because they are

653
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:15,729
profoundly good at turning off the

654
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:18,579
bodily sensations of pain they're

655
00:29:15,729 --> 00:29:21,879
profoundly good it's sort of you know

656
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:24,999
somewhat anesthetizing the the body and

657
00:29:21,878 --> 00:29:28,778
and not allowing it to experience the

658
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:30,639
physical you know sensations of pain so

659
00:29:28,778 --> 00:29:34,028
they are really good at that because

660
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:36,638
they act in the brain itself to shut off

661
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:39,038
the sensations of pain that are coming

662
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:41,019
in through the spinal cord so if you can

663
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,329
imagine all of your nerves are like

664
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:45,038
little tiny highways of information and

665
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:47,288
all those highways are headed in one

666
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:50,108
direction and that is into the spinal

667
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:52,479
cord and that spinal cord it becomes

668
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:54,728
like this central hub like that's the

669
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:57,069
the main highway and all of the

670
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:59,229
information coming through those tiny

671
00:29:57,069 --> 00:30:00,668
little you know arteries are coming

672
00:29:59,229 --> 00:30:03,580
through this central highway of

673
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:06,159
information and then you know going into

674
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:09,999
the headquarters which is the brain and

675
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:13,299
so opioids shut off the sensation of

676
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:15,788
pain at the headquarters and so my

677
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:17,979
academic work has always been focused on

678
00:30:15,788 --> 00:30:21,548
one particular brain area called the

679
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:24,338
periaqueductal gray and this really is

680
00:30:21,548 --> 00:30:27,308
the brain's pain headquarters because it

681
00:30:24,338 --> 00:30:30,368
is if you if you put an opioid directly

682
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:33,038
into the periaqueductal gray or the PA G

683
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:37,238
if you put an opioid there you shut off

684
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:40,118
pain throughout the entire body and if

685
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:43,088
you put opioids everywhere else but you

686
00:30:40,118 --> 00:30:45,608
block them only in this brain area then

687
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:49,329
you don't get any pain relief at all and

688
00:30:45,608 --> 00:30:51,129
so we know that this is a critical

689
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:53,740
component in you

690
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,900
the controlling or modulating the

691
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,940
sensation of pain throughout the entire

692
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,340
organism this tiny little brain area

693
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,200
it's fascinating what's really

694
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:05,349
interesting about this brain area also

695
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,558
is that it's where the body or the brain

696
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:11,288
develops tolerance to opioids as well so

697
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,538
again if you repeatedly give the brain

698
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:16,179
you know just this Phe region if you

699
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:18,640
repeatedly give it opioids it will

700
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:20,890
develop tolerance but if you block

701
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,020
opioids here but continue to give the

702
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:25,630
whole rest of the body opioids the

703
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:28,210
organism never develops tolerance so

704
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:29,740
this is a really critical brain region

705
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,779
and we'll talk more about it you know

706
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:34,798
when we get to the cannabinoid control

707
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:37,240
of our pain but opioids bind to

708
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:40,000
receptors in this brain region so you

709
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,490
can think of it as a lock and a key so

710
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,798
these locks these receptors are studying

711
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,929
the outside of our neurons so just

712
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,538
little padlocks you know waiting for

713
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:52,120
their keys to come floating by and those

714
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:54,788
keys the drugs the opioids themselves

715
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:57,308
come and they float along and they lock

716
00:31:54,788 --> 00:32:02,460
into the binding sites on these proteins

717
00:31:57,308 --> 00:32:05,200
and they turn on certain intracellular

718
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,929
signaling Cascades so these are

719
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,750
molecules that once they become

720
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:13,090
activated by the binding of the opioids

721
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,919
to these proteins they go off and they

722
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:16,689
do some other job they control

723
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:18,820
neurotransmitter release they turn on

724
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:21,038
genes you know they control other

725
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:25,418
proteins it's a whole very sophisticated

726
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:29,529
set of you know intracellular and you

727
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:33,250
know between cellular communications so

728
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:35,230
the sum total of all of those like you

729
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,269
know hundreds of thousands of millions

730
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,849
of little you know protein protein

731
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:42,579
interactions the sum total of that is

732
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:45,548
the organism not experiencing pain

733
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:50,678
because it has been shut off at the

734
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:54,339
level of the brain itself Wow eighty

735
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:56,769
that was awesome that was that was the

736
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:58,808
best explanation I have ever heard I I

737
00:32:56,769 --> 00:33:01,000
don't know if you you know I mean I know

738
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:02,918
you've got a PhD and at some point you

739
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,170
probably had to teach classes you're

740
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:06,690
probably an awesome

741
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:08,670
well thank you I really enjoy being in

742
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,980
the classroom but you know I feel like

743
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:14,880
you know conversations like ours where

744
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,069
we get to talk to the label a person I I

745
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,170
think that's equally important yeah well

746
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:24,230
did it's a very that explanation was a

747
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:28,560
very nice balance of of using accurate

748
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:31,910
scientific let's say like how it

749
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:34,349
actually works while also using

750
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:36,090
vocabulary that we're all familiar with

751
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:39,599
so that you don't sound like a textbook

752
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:41,579
so that's great so so um so let's use

753
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:44,129
let's use me for a strawman for a minute

754
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:45,809
because that your description opioids

755
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,390
actually sound like they'd be really

756
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:50,579
effective right like like listening to

757
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:53,160
your description I'm like well hell

758
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:55,109
maybe these actually work you know am i

759
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:58,800
is this all this trash I've been talking

760
00:33:55,109 --> 00:34:00,569
about opioids not justified and the

761
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,609
problem is actually more the abuse than

762
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:04,529
the fact that they don't work but in my

763
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:05,789
own personal experience and like I said

764
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:10,648
earlier I haven't had a lot of

765
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:14,668
experience with pain but but after I had

766
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:19,980
my ACL surgery after after a skiing

767
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:21,779
accident they gave me opioids to help

768
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,030
with the pain and I'm like you know as a

769
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,220
psycho not I'm really good I'm gonna get

770
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:29,730
to try something new you know and so I

771
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:32,639
used it and and my experience was is it

772
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:36,179
really did not do anything to help with

773
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:39,960
the pain but it made me feel like the

774
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:41,880
pain was maybe down the hallway and so

775
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,570
it kind of distanced me from the pain a

776
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,200
little bit

777
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:48,300
and I certainly found it to be a bit of

778
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:51,750
a fun distracted like it was it was a

779
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:54,659
novel mind state that was interesting

780
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:57,539
but after after the first day I'm like

781
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:59,849
you know I I don't really it's not

782
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:01,889
helping right and and mostly it made me

783
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:09,239
stupid for everything else I wanted to

784
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:14,159
do so is my experience typical or is my

785
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:17,279
experience you know more fringe I think

786
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:19,469
that it might be a little bit of both

787
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,329
you know when you asked the question

788
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:23,459
like hey you know edu made this sound

789
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:27,960
phenomenal and these are really powerful

790
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:31,019
drugs yes that's true however you have

791
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,358
to keep in mind that the PA G is not the

792
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:36,269
only place where these opioid receptors

793
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:38,369
live they live on lots of other brain

794
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:41,309
structures and they live in lots of

795
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:44,369
other important places in our bodies for

796
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:47,069
instance in the brainstem the area

797
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:48,990
that's like our old evolutionary lizard

798
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:51,088
brain the thing that keeps us you know

799
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:54,659
ticking automatically keeps our

800
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:57,119
breathing going that's that's the area

801
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:59,358
where you also have opioid receptors and

802
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,309
if they get hit over the head too hard

803
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:05,639
they will shut down your breathing and

804
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:08,099
that's how people die so respiratory

805
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:09,929
depression is you know essentially what

806
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,180
happens in an overdose people's

807
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:15,389
breathing rate slows down so much that

808
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:17,338
it stops entirely and that process is

809
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:19,949
controlled by the brainstem by the same

810
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:22,529
receptors so the same receptors that are

811
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:24,838
in your PA G turning off you know pain

812
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,700
for your whole body are also in your

813
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:29,909
brainstem controlling your breathing

814
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:31,980
rate and so it's not only those two

815
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:34,409
areas but you know like you said I

816
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,659
stopped taking these drugs after my ACL

817
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:39,149
tear because I felt stupid they were

818
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:41,699
making me dumb and the reason for that

819
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:44,519
is these receptors are also in your

820
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,989
prefrontal cortex all of your brain

821
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:47,969
regions that are used for making

822
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:50,818
decisions and you know like being a

823
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:52,739
functional human if you turn off all the

824
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:54,750
brain activity at the level of the

825
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:56,029
opioid receptor there then of course

826
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,559
you're gonna get some cognitive

827
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,599
impairment and this is something that we

828
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,180
unfortunately don't talk enough about

829
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:05,039
with the opioids you know like I was

830
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:07,710
testifying in the State House in

831
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:11,338
Jefferson City in Missouri one time and

832
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,510
you know one of the chairmen was asking

833
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:14,308
me well what about all the cognitive

834
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,349
impairment you know that comes from

835
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:18,480
cannabis and you know like people you

836
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:20,039
know driving Ojai and all of this stuff

837
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,679
that they were you know worried about

838
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:24,449
I'm like well no one ever talks about

839
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,000
like how many people in this courtroom

840
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:29,139
right now took an opioid before they got

841
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,989
in their car and drove 60 miles

842
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:33,460
get here you know like this this element

843
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:35,618
of cognitive impairment that you're

844
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:39,068
talking about is a very real side effect

845
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:41,528
of opioids so you know opioids would be

846
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:43,449
great drugs if they only acted on the

847
00:37:41,528 --> 00:37:45,010
descending pain pathway but they have

848
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:47,558
all of these other unintended

849
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:49,390
consequences constipation respiratory

850
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:52,180
depression cognitive impairment

851
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:53,980
addiction because they're binding to

852
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:56,108
receptors that are not just in the

853
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:59,619
brain's pain pathway but they're binding

854
00:37:56,108 --> 00:38:01,538
to the receptors indiscriminantly so you

855
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:04,180
know especially that last component the

856
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:06,339
addiction component opioids are better

857
00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:08,500
than any other substance at totally

858
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:12,190
hijacking the brain regions that are

859
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:14,048
involved in reward and reinforcement so

860
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:16,838
those are very fundamental brain

861
00:38:14,048 --> 00:38:19,210
processes where you know if something

862
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:19,960
activates this circuitry this reward

863
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,358
circuitry

864
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,389
you know the perception at the level of

865
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:27,159
the organism is ooh that was good I

866
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:29,608
should do that again

867
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:32,739
right so that's the reward and the

868
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:35,139
reinforcement is you know continuing to

869
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:39,848
engage in that behavior because of the

870
00:38:35,139 --> 00:38:42,670
reward so opioids are particularly good

871
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:45,940
at hijacking those processes so that the

872
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:48,970
opioids feel better and over time become

873
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:51,818
more important than anything else that

874
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:53,858
activates that system naturally you know

875
00:38:51,818 --> 00:38:56,920
the opioids become more important than

876
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:59,288
food opioids become more important than

877
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,329
lasting relationships opioids become

878
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:03,250
more important than you know what your

879
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:05,798
neighbors think of you opioids become

880
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:08,108
more important than your job so you know

881
00:39:05,798 --> 00:39:11,108
that's where all of these unintended

882
00:39:08,108 --> 00:39:13,480
consequences happen from pain control is

883
00:39:11,108 --> 00:39:15,909
that you know the opioids aren't just

884
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,650
binding to the brains pain receptors

885
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:19,358
they're binding to all the receptors

886
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:22,539
that control all of these other very

887
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:25,659
important processes well now now you've

888
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:28,089
like totally unraveled all the all the

889
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:29,469
impressiveness I had earlier for it

890
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:32,619
because now it just sounds like a messy

891
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:36,368
drug totally it is it's a super messy

892
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:40,568
drug so before we go to our first

893
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:43,000
commercial break you know people started

894
00:39:40,568 --> 00:39:46,929
turning against opioids or at least

895
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,570
in publicly in the media when people

896
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:52,239
started getting an understanding of the

897
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:56,370
the level of abuse in our country and

898
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:59,289
how quickly people were moving from

899
00:39:56,369 --> 00:40:01,150
pharmaceuticals to street drugs because

900
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:03,009
they were more affordable and in many

901
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,440
places more accessible since you don't

902
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:07,600
need a prescription and you know so so

903
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,139
people realize that our country has got

904
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,380
a chronic addiction problem with opiates

905
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:17,529
but then that seems to have created an

906
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:20,289
environment where some in the medical

907
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:22,150
establishment have finally kind of taken

908
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:25,449
the risk of saying oh yeah and they

909
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:27,550
don't really work and you know you you

910
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:29,349
really have to dig for that it's not

911
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,480
usually something that's in the first

912
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:34,000
paragraph or the first couple paragraphs

913
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,800
with an article it's like down in like

914
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,760
paragraph ten right and they said oh and

915
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:42,970
by the way you know is it true that that

916
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,720
the medical establishment is starting to

917
00:40:42,969 --> 00:40:50,980
kind of turn away from the efficacy of

918
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:53,949
opioids I think finally yes you know I

919
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,990
think for a very very very long time

920
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:59,019
there were you know like us fringe

921
00:40:55,989 --> 00:41:02,049
weirdos you know scientists on the side

922
00:40:59,019 --> 00:41:05,199
saying hey opioids cause hyperalgesia

923
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:08,620
that means they make pain worse you know

924
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:10,299
hey opioids actually you know like all

925
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:12,429
of these other negative side effects

926
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,280
they outweigh the benefits but you know

927
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:17,589
like our little fringe voices that are

928
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,820
you know clearly based on the evidence

929
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:21,579
that we've been collecting for a long

930
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:24,430
time our voices you know don't matter

931
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:26,860
much in the face of you know really hot

932
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:28,769
pharmaceutical reps and you know like

933
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:32,019
lobbyists with a lot of money and

934
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:35,019
doctors who don't have the time to

935
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:35,800
devote to you know being skeptical and

936
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:38,559
digging through the literature

937
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,210
themselves and they're relying on you

938
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,940
know the standard of practice from their

939
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:44,858
clinic and the recommendations of the

940
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,079
American Pain Society and

941
00:41:44,858 --> 00:41:49,449
relying on these pharmaceutical reps to

942
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:51,009
give them the best tools to do their job

943
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:53,710
in the shortest amount of time possible

944
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:56,949
because they only have an average of 13

945
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:59,679
minutes with each patient so so yeah I

946
00:41:56,949 --> 00:42:02,528
think for a long time you know we knew

947
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:05,288
that opioids weren't effective you know

948
00:42:02,528 --> 00:42:07,659
over the long term that their side

949
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:09,430
effects outweighed their benefits we

950
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:11,798
knew that there were you know some

951
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:15,068
fundamental pharmacological problems

952
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:17,548
with them you know from the basic

953
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:20,528
neuroscientists knew that you know

954
00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:23,259
oxycodone at the molecular level is no

955
00:42:20,528 --> 00:42:26,469
different than heroin and yet you know

956
00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:29,650
it took a crisis of this magnitude to

957
00:42:26,469 --> 00:42:31,568
wake everybody up to the reality that it

958
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:34,509
doesn't matter you know if you're using

959
00:42:31,568 --> 00:42:36,880
heroin or if you're using oxycodone the

960
00:42:34,509 --> 00:42:39,579
results are the same your body becomes

961
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,099
physically dependent and you know you

962
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:43,930
you have to have some other strategy if

963
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:46,028
you want to have a sustainable and

964
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:48,848
healthy management of chronic pain over

965
00:42:46,028 --> 00:42:51,039
the long term well that sounds like a

966
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:52,900
perfect place to end our first set thank

967
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:54,940
you 80 so we're gonna take a short break

968
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,980
and rewrite be right back you are

969
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:59,230
listening to shaping fire and my guest

970
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:02,920
today is cannabis pharmacologist a tea

971
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:04,539
ray in times like these when so many

972
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,999
cannabis companies are growing their

973
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:09,519
flower in gigantic warehouses and fields

974
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:11,588
using synthetic nutrients it is good to

975
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:13,959
know that there are authentic California

976
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:16,150
heritage growers using natural farming

977
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,119
techniques and sunshine to cultivate

978
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:20,619
cannabis flowers for you California has

979
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,480
produced the best cannabis in the world

980
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:25,059
for generations and the idea that

981
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,219
massively scaled industrial cannabis

982
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:29,650
production could produce the same

983
00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:33,429
quality as small-batch lovingly

984
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:35,349
cultivated flowers is just silly moon

985
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:37,690
time medicinals is located in Humboldt

986
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:40,210
County on the lush South Fork of the eel

987
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:42,999
River watershed in the epicenter of the

988
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:45,489
American cannabis Heartland moon time

989
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:47,738
medicinals grows under bright California

990
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:50,139
Sun in greenhouses using only natural

991
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:53,048
farming techniques like google culture

992
00:43:50,139 --> 00:43:56,409
compost teas whole food fertilisers and

Mendocino California cannabis breeder

1015
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:56,689
called mandelbrot is one of these people

1016
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:58,789
Mandelbrot was also known as Roz truth

1017
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:00,619
and his cultivars are known as the

1018

world-famous gasoline scented terpene

1020
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:07,879
profile back in the day when it was

1021
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,460
really hard to find quality genetics and

1022
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,530
education Mandelbrot was advocating for

1023
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,358
organic growing techniques and providing

1024
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:16,090
exceptional seeds that would sell out as

1025
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:18,858
soon as they hit the shelves

1026
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:21,829
Mandelbrot lived too short of life dying

1027
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:24,108
in 2015 but while he was with us he

1028
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:27,259
created several connoisseur level canvas

1029
00:45:24,108 --> 00:45:31,130

1030

00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:44,780
grow or to smoke Mandelbrot's creations

1036
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,369
excel in every category and that's why

1037

00:48:37,608 --> 00:48:40,880
shaping fire I'm your host

1112
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:44,179
Shengo Louis and our guest this week is

1113
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,980
cannabis pharmacologist a tier 8 so

1114
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:47,750
during the first set we made sure that

1115
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:51,608
we were all on the same page about what

1116
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:55,789
pain is how it functions in the body and

1117
00:48:51,608 --> 00:48:58,130
what opiates are attempting to do in in

1118
00:48:55,789 --> 00:49:00,010
providing some relief but we're all here

1119
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:01,789
because we want options other than

1120
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:05,270
opioids and so that's what we're going

1121
00:49:01,789 --> 00:49:09,970
to go to in this set so so a tea I know

1122
00:49:05,269 --> 00:49:15,190
that you're you have an expertise in how

1123
00:49:09,969 --> 00:49:18,618
cannabinoids function in the brain and

1124
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:21,048
specifically decreasing the experience

1125
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:24,170
of pain and so I think that I just want

1126
00:49:21,048 --> 00:49:26,750
to start just by kind of like tossing

1127
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:30,349
you the mic if you will and saying you

1128
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:33,380
know what are the main methods or or

1129
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:35,660
modes of operations that some of the

1130
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:39,380
cannabinoids that we are familiar with

1131
00:49:35,659 --> 00:49:42,500
at this point are acting in the brain to

1132
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,778
provide relief in different ways than

1133
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:47,710
opioids yeah you bet

1134
00:49:44,778 --> 00:49:50,630
so let's start with how they're similar

1135
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:53,420
so you know before the break we talked

1136
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:56,539
about the mechanisms by which opioids

1137
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:58,369
relieve pain so they bind to you know

1138
00:49:56,539 --> 00:50:00,470
this area of the brain that i've focused

1139
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:03,680
on my entire career the phe

1140
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:05,750
periaqueductal gray so opioids float

1141
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,328
along and they bind to their receptors

1142
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:10,730
like locks fitting or keys fitting into

1143
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:14,329
their locks and cannabinoids work

1144
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:15,349
especially Delta 9 THC THC works in the

1145
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:18,769
exact same way

1146
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:21,109
THC floats along into the PA G and binds

1147
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:23,239
to its receptors studded along the

1148
00:50:21,108 --> 00:50:25,759
outside of these neurons and what's

1149
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:28,098
really fascinating is that the MU opioid

1150
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,309
receptor which is the primary pain

1151
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:33,859
relieving target and the cb1 cannabinoid

1152
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:36,650
receptor they are cousins

1153
00:50:33,858 --> 00:50:38,598
they're both g-protein coupled receptors

1154
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:41,329
that's the kind of protein they are they

1155
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:44,028
have an extremely similar structure and

1156
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:46,759
an almost identical function so they're

1157
00:50:44,028 --> 00:50:49,400
both coupled the inside inside of the

1158
00:50:46,759 --> 00:50:53,449
cell they talked to the same sets of

1159
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:55,220
messengers GI geo proteins so both of

1160
00:50:53,449 --> 00:50:56,538
the you can imagine you know on the left

1161
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,368
hand and the right hand you have the

1162
00:50:56,539 --> 00:51:00,470
mute opioid and the cb1 cannabinoid

1163
00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:02,269
receptor both sitting there like locks

1164
00:51:00,469 --> 00:51:04,909
waiting for their keys to come along

1165
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:06,588
when those keys bind the locks changed

1166
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:08,358
shape a little bit and then release

1167
00:51:06,588 --> 00:51:10,639
their messengers and those messengers

1168
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:12,619
are identical isn't that fascinating

1169
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:16,489
yeah that's totally cool I had no idea

1170
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:19,338
yeah same brain region same kind of

1171
00:51:16,489 --> 00:51:21,289
protein same second messaging system and

1172
00:51:19,338 --> 00:51:22,338
the result is also the same you know he

1173
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:25,069
have you have a change in

1174
00:51:22,338 --> 00:51:27,139
neurotransmitter release and a change in

1175
00:51:25,068 --> 00:51:30,558
the descending control of pain and

1176
00:51:27,139 --> 00:51:33,739
that's really the primary way that Delta

1177
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:35,778
9 THC relieves pain it's it's acting in

1178
00:51:33,739 --> 00:51:38,210
the exact same place by the exact same

1179
00:51:35,778 --> 00:51:48,498
way that opioids are working the

1180
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:50,539
difference is everything else don't just

1181
00:51:48,498 --> 00:51:52,728
live in the Phe they live in lots of

1182
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:55,839
other brain areas and in the brainstem

1183
00:51:52,728 --> 00:51:58,788
and you know inside you know the viscera

1184
00:51:55,838 --> 00:52:02,389
inside your you know your internal organ

1185
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:05,809
cavity and cb1 cannabinoid receptors are

1186
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:09,588
also everywhere else but what's really

1187
00:52:05,809 --> 00:52:12,528
fascinating is that somehow by

1188
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:16,159
activating the cb1 receptor with Delta 9

1189
00:52:12,528 --> 00:52:18,650
THC yes you still get some activation of

1190
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:20,719
the reward pathway just like the opioids

1191
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:23,479
you know you have this that that's what

1192
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:25,909
causes mirth and euphoria that's what is

1193
00:52:23,478 --> 00:52:28,968
rewarding and reinforcing about cannabis

1194
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:31,489
its Delta 9 THC binding to cb1 receptors

1195
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:34,729
in the brain's reward pathway however

1196
00:52:31,489 --> 00:52:37,099
the difference is that it doesn't hijack

1197
00:52:34,728 --> 00:52:39,460
the brain's reward pathway in the way

1198
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:43,278
that opioids do it doesn't prioritize

1199
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:46,429
cannabis or THC over everything else in

1200
00:52:43,278 --> 00:52:48,889
life it also doesn't bind to those

1201
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:52,109
receptors in the brain stem which

1202
00:52:48,889 --> 00:52:54,359
control respiration that's why you know

1203
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:56,940
you can't have a lethal overdose from

1204
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:59,640
respiratory depression from THC is

1205
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,289
because that's just not how it works

1206
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:04,679
it doesn't it doesn't have anything to

1207
00:53:01,289 --> 00:53:07,860
do with respiration so so yeah that the

1208
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:10,379
mechanisms fundamentally are identical

1209
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:13,470
to how opioids work in terms of you know

1210
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:15,869
turning off the pain signal at the level

1211
00:53:13,469 --> 00:53:19,259
of the Phe the brains pain headquarters

1212
00:53:15,869 --> 00:53:21,449
but the differences lie in everything

1213
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:24,390
else the other really interesting thing

1214
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:28,439
about the cb1 receptor in particular it

1215
00:53:24,389 --> 00:53:32,279
is that it is the most ubiquitously

1216
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:35,700
expressed g-protein in the entire brain

1217
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:37,560
what I mean by that is if you you know

1218
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:40,619
we're to die all of these receptors

1219
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:43,769
green and then zoom in and try and find

1220
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:46,409
where they are they look like stars in

1221
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:49,469
the sky they're literally everywhere

1222
00:53:46,409 --> 00:53:52,019
it's almost impossible to find a brain

1223
00:53:49,469 --> 00:53:54,869
tissue that doesn't have some level of

1224
00:53:52,019 --> 00:53:57,329
expression of the cb1 receptor and that

1225
00:53:54,869 --> 00:54:00,569
says less about you know what the brain

1226
00:53:57,329 --> 00:54:03,269
is doing in response to THC but it says

1227
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:07,920
more about how important the cb1

1228
00:54:03,269 --> 00:54:10,800
receptor is in evolution how if it is if

1229
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,769
it's on every single neuron in our brain

1230
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:17,280
pretty much what is it doing there why

1231
00:54:13,769 --> 00:54:20,759
is it there and so you know the role

1232
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:24,000
that that receptor plays in our everyday

1233
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:27,270
function is huge you know we have

1234
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,119
endogenous cannabinoids you know like

1235
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:32,519
two AG and an and amide and a whole you

1236
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:34,859
know set of cousins that are similar and

1237
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:37,469
those little molecules have very

1238
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:40,470
important jobs in regulating our brain

1239
00:54:37,469 --> 00:54:42,929
activity which regulates all of our

1240
00:54:40,469 --> 00:54:45,139
homeostatic processes all of the

1241
00:54:42,929 --> 00:54:48,319
processes that keep us alive our

1242
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:51,299
metabolism our circadian rhythm our

1243
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:55,230
responses to stress our ability to

1244
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:57,900
relieve our own pain so the cb1 receptor

1245
00:54:55,230 --> 00:55:01,650
has an incredibly important role in all

1246
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:03,720
of those homeostatic processes so for

1247
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,349
whatever reason you know evolution has

1248
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:06,899
set it

1249
00:55:04,349 --> 00:55:09,690
to where if you you know stimulate them

1250
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:12,059
you opioid receptor you end up with some

1251
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:14,639
pretty gnarly consequences and if you

1252
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:17,190
stimulate the cb1 receptor you end up

1253
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:19,529
with you know kind of a balance of what

1254
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:22,530
could potentially be some you know risky

1255
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:24,420
things but mostly innocuous things like

1256
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:28,380
relieving pain and experiencing mirth

1257
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:30,090
and euphoria well first of all it's it's

1258
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:33,539
so nice to hear somebody actually used

1259
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:36,120
the word mirth hi I haven't heard that

1260
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:41,429
word in a long time I probably you know

1261
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:46,670
only read it so I like that so so it's

1262
00:55:41,429 --> 00:55:50,009
it's remarkable how many of the same

1263
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:52,740
plays I'll say that Delta 9 THC has

1264
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:57,000
that's in common with the opioids and

1265
00:55:52,739 --> 00:56:00,299
somehow it's also equally as messy and

1266
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:06,030
and not as targeted but it's the fact

1267
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:07,590
that when Delta 9 THC is being messy

1268
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:10,769
it's not causing all these other

1269
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:14,780
freaking problems that opioids do and so

1270
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:17,400
it's it's more it's more benignly messy

1271
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:20,910
yeah and you know what's even crazier

1272
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:23,789
about that Shango is it gets even

1273
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:27,509
Messier and because it gets even Messier

1274
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:30,960
it becomes even safer so what I mean by

1275
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:34,080
that is you know we we are capable of

1276
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:37,380
ingesting you know Delta 9 THC by itself

1277
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:39,840
and that ends up not to be a very

1278
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,880
enjoyable process unless you're like a

1279
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:44,760
daily diver and that's your thing great

1280
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:47,340
but that's that's very few people who

1281
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,860
really enjoy totally overloading their

1282
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:52,650
brains you know solely with dial to 9

1283
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:54,900
THC for most human beings if they

1284
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:57,059
consume THC by itself it ends up you

1285
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,220
know especially once you get up and over

1286
00:56:57,059 --> 00:57:03,659
a certain dose it ends up not being

1287
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:06,509
super fun and so part of the safety and

1288
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:09,899
part of the tolerability of cannabis is

1289
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:12,930
that Delta 9 THC isn't acting alone it's

1290
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:15,539
being consumed with scores of other

1291
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:17,449
biologically active molecules like

1292
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:19,279
cannabidiol

1293
00:57:17,449 --> 00:57:21,858
all of the terpenes and all of these

1294
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:25,099
flavonoids and alcohol or sorry

1295
00:57:21,858 --> 00:57:27,500
aldehydes and esters all of these other

1296
00:57:25,099 --> 00:57:31,309
molecules that are all working together

1297
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:32,690
to make a really messy thing that you

1298
00:57:31,309 --> 00:57:34,460
know because you have all these

1299
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:36,349
molecules which are competing for

1300
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:38,929
binding sites some of them are

1301
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:41,720
activating processes while others are

1302
00:57:38,929 --> 00:57:44,449
simultaneously turning things down what

1303
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:48,169
you end up with is a really buffered

1304
00:57:44,449 --> 00:57:51,259
effect so if you could imagine you know

1305
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:53,630
I I love music and I think about the

1306
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:56,000
world from the perspective of audition

1307
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:58,880
mostly and if you think about if you

1308
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,539
have a tone a pure tone I want you to

1309
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,510
imagine like B that gets really old

1310
00:58:02,539 --> 00:58:07,960
really fast it's not particularly

1311
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:09,349
pleasant and that's like literally a

1312
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,990
one-trick pony

1313
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:14,720
right it has one job it does one thing

1314
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:17,000
and that's what you know an opioid does

1315
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:19,699
or that's what Delta 9 THC does by

1316
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,920
itself is just one note but then if you

1317
00:58:19,699 --> 00:58:23,449
start adding in all these other tones

1318
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,700
and layering it with all these other

1319
00:58:23,449 --> 00:58:28,338
things what you end up with is white

1320
00:58:25,699 --> 00:58:33,019
noise which is what we use to put babies

1321
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:35,480
to sleep right so that buffered effect

1322
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:37,639
when you have that principal component

1323
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,858
in there doing its job very important

1324
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:42,949
job relieving pain activating cb1

1325
00:58:39,858 --> 00:58:44,858
receptors in the PG but you add in all

1326
00:58:42,949 --> 00:58:47,989
these other molecules which are also

1327
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:51,170
promiscuous then you end up with this

1328
00:58:47,989 --> 00:58:53,179
really buffered effect and the sum total

1329
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:55,670
of all of those different molecules

1330
00:58:53,179 --> 00:58:58,568
doing their jobs at the same time is

1331
00:58:55,670 --> 00:59:02,240
that you have a very tolerable

1332
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:04,338
experience so you know Ethan Ethan Bruce

1333
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:06,769
oh very frequently you know has

1334
00:59:04,338 --> 00:59:09,349
championed the idea of the entourage

1335
00:59:06,769 --> 00:59:11,480
effect or the ensemble effect which is

1336
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:14,059
that these molecules work better

1337
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:17,059
together than they do in isolation and

1338
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:19,130
you know from my perspective the

1339
00:59:17,059 --> 00:59:21,920
principal component driving the

1340
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:25,880
entourage effect is just tolerability

1341
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:28,920
you are able to reap the medical

1342
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:31,590
benefits of cannabis because it is sim

1343
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:34,380
Limor tolerable not necessarily that

1344
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:37,170
it's more effective but that it is more

1345
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:39,119
tolerable and that tolerability comes

1346
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:41,820
from this buffered effect of all of

1347
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:44,969
these molecules acting at once that's

1348
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:46,650
great all right so we let's go let's

1349
00:59:44,969 --> 00:59:48,839
circle around and go back to the top of

1350
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:52,590
the slide again so you just took us on

1351
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:57,120
this explanatory trip of Delta 9 THC and

1352
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:59,400
how it works on pain but as I often tell

1353
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:02,219
patients we have to start over now and

1354
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:05,460
talk about cannabidiol because it's not

1355
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:07,679
just that cannabis helps pain it's that

1356
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:10,349
cannabis helps pain in multiple

1357
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:13,469
different ways and we really have to

1358
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:15,480
treat them independently so so let's go

1359
01:00:13,469 --> 01:00:17,129
back to the top of the slide and and and

1360
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:21,780
and would you go through the same

1361
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:25,920
process with cannabidiol CBD sure

1362
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:30,150
so CBD is a lot more complicated so

1363
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:33,180
there are at least 14 plus known

1364
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:36,180
mechanisms of action of CBD in the

1365
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:38,460
central nervous system so delta 9 it's

1366
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:41,549
pretty straightforward it is a you know

1367
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:45,079
partial agonist at the cb1 receptor and

1368
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:47,700
that's that's largely it but cannabidiol

1369
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:50,909
especially it you know a range of doses

1370
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:54,119
does lots of different things you know

1371
01:00:50,909 --> 01:00:58,799
is it's actually a partial allosteric

1372
01:00:54,119 --> 01:01:01,739
modulator a pam at both the MU and delta

1373
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:04,710
opioid receptors so what that does is

1374
01:01:01,739 --> 01:01:08,369
you know it puts the receptor in a

1375
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:11,579
position where is more receptive to the

1376
01:01:08,369 --> 01:01:13,739
endogenous opioids that are there so

1377
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:15,409
just like our body produces in an amide

1378
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:17,909
in to EEG our body also produces

1379
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:20,519
endorphins and kathleen's and lots of

1380
01:01:17,909 --> 01:01:24,049
other peptides that naturally act at our

1381
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:27,059
body's opioid receptors so cannabidiol

1382
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:28,830
binds to the mule opioid receptor the

1383
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:32,000
primary pain relieving target in the

1384
01:01:28,829 --> 01:01:36,179
brain to make it more receptive and

1385
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:39,269
activatable by its endogenous peptides

1386
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:41,460
like the endogenous opioids so that's at

1387
01:01:39,269 --> 01:01:42,329
least one mechanism of action that CBD

1388
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,679
could pretend

1389
01:01:42,329 --> 01:01:46,409
we be having in the central nervous

1390
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:48,989
system however I think that the the more

1391
01:01:46,409 --> 01:01:51,319
profound and direct effect that CBD is

1392
01:01:48,989 --> 01:01:54,869
having is it is a profoundly

1393
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:57,090
anti-inflammatory agent as is THC as our

1394
01:01:54,869 --> 01:01:59,429
lots of the other molecules that are

1395
01:01:57,090 --> 01:02:01,620
found in the cannabis plant so this is

1396
01:01:59,429 --> 01:02:03,029
especially why when we have patients who

1397
01:02:01,619 --> 01:02:05,190
are suffering from some kind of

1398
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:07,170
inflammatory condition

1399
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:09,420
cannabidiol alone or in combination

1400
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:10,940
especially in combination with you know

1401
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,740
these other molecules from the plant

1402
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:15,710
it's profoundly effective because it is

1403
01:02:13,739 --> 01:02:19,139
directly acting at those

1404
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:22,590
anti-inflammatory you know pathways so

1405
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:24,929
you know I myself have seen you know the

1406
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:27,510
knuckles of patients with rheumatoid

1407
01:02:24,929 --> 01:02:30,449
arthritis and literally their only thing

1408
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:32,490
that they engage in is putting a topical

1409
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:35,369
on their knuckles you know every couple

1410
01:02:32,489 --> 01:02:37,709
of hours every single day and you know

1411
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:39,389
you don't have to be a Rheumatologist to

1412
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:44,429
look at someone's hands ago oh wow yeah

1413
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:46,589
you look better so so I think that you

1414
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:49,079
know especially for patients who have an

1415
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:50,940
inflammatory component to their pain and

1416
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:52,920
we talked earlier about how even

1417
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:55,139
neuropathic patients you know people

1418
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:57,389
with neuropathic pain often there is an

1419
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:59,909
inflammatory component to neuropathic

1420
01:02:57,389 --> 01:03:02,699
pain so wherever you have any kind of

1421
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:05,849
inflammatory you know thing going on

1422
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:07,529
cannabidiol is going to be an ally you

1423
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:09,690
know especially if you're consuming it

1424
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:13,650
in a whole plant preparation you know I

1425
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:17,360
I tend to refer to type three and hemp

1426
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:19,769
cannabis as the you know nature's

1427
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:23,340
multivitamin for inflammation you know

1428
01:03:19,769 --> 01:03:25,800
it truly is you know so much better to

1429
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:28,320
take 12 active ingredients that are

1430
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:31,680
fighting inflammation from 12 different

1431
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:33,990
pathways than just one ibuprofen that

1432
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:36,239
does you know anti-inflammation from one

1433
01:03:33,989 --> 01:03:38,909
pathway alone because you know they're

1434
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:41,939
just in inflammation there are lots of

1435
01:03:38,909 --> 01:03:44,940
different kinds of processes and lots of

1436
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:46,980
different kinds of molecules involved so

1437
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,769
you know if you imagine a construction

1438
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,510
site you have all of all of these people

1439
01:03:49,769 --> 01:03:54,840
who are buzzing around you know and from

1440
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:56,100
a 30,000 foot view you you have a bunch

1441
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,720
of construction workers

1442
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:59,819
but when you really dive down in there

1443
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:01,829
you've got the welding guy you've got

1444
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:03,360
the plumber you've got the electrician

1445
01:04:01,829 --> 01:04:05,369
you've got the concrete person you have

1446
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,960
the engineer you know and so all of

1447
01:04:05,369 --> 01:04:08,699
these people yeah they have different

1448
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,880
roles but they're all contributing to

1449
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:14,159
this this main effect so it's the same

1450
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,740
thing with inflammation yeah the the the

1451
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:18,059
main effect is inflammation but there

1452
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:20,399
are all these different molecules

1453
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:23,009
involved in that process and so if

1454
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:25,019
you're able to you know knock out every

1455
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:27,270
one of those rolls that's contributing

1456
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:28,769
to inflammation you know then then

1457
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:30,780
you're clearly going to have a better

1458
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:31,880
outcome than if you're only going after

1459
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:33,900
the electrician

1460
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:37,590
all right let's let's talk about a

1461
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:40,260
minute about how fast this CBD works

1462
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:44,250
because there are two different ways of

1463
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:48,270
thinking about CBD helping pain the

1464
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:50,280
first is that you know I've got a you

1465
01:04:48,269 --> 01:04:54,320
know whole plant CBD tincture in front

1466
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:57,360
of me and I take it and what will the

1467
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:59,550
cannabinoids do for me right now in this

1468
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:01,289
moment and you know lasting for the next

1469
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:06,510
you know three hours shall we say which

1470
01:05:01,289 --> 01:05:08,309
is usual efficacy for CBD or any

1471
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:10,050
cannabinoid but then there's this that

1472
01:05:08,309 --> 01:05:12,920
then there's this the second mode which

1473
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:15,030
is people are taking CBD to simply

1474
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:18,269
supplement their endocannabinoid system

1475
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:20,390
and strengthen it because a properly

1476
01:05:18,269 --> 01:05:25,730
functioning endocannabinoid system

1477
01:05:20,389 --> 01:05:29,190
itself turns down the volume of pain and

1478
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:34,050
you know helps with the homeostasis of

1479
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:36,179
all these different key body functions

1480
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:39,630
that when they come back into balance

1481
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:41,129
our experience and likelihood of pain is

1482
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:42,750
decreased but that's something you know

1483
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:45,510
the building up of an endocannabinoid

1484
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:48,360
system is something where you need to be

1485
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:51,780
taking whole plants CBD for a few weeks

1486
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:54,320
before it's really starting to to work

1487
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:57,510
on the endocannabinoid system as a whole

1488
01:05:54,320 --> 01:06:02,660
so would you tease out the differences

1489
01:05:57,510 --> 01:06:05,750
in the patient experience of taking CBD

1490
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:10,399
about whether or not the patient can

1491
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:15,289
take whole plant CBD now and get

1492
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:18,590
benefits now versus taking CBD now but

1493
01:06:15,289 --> 01:06:20,900
will taking it every day for the benefit

1494
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:24,320
of my endocannabinoid system in the

1495
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:27,970
future to decrease my pain man Shango

1496
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,970
we're gonna need another 90 minutes

1497
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:35,690
first of all I want to say that I really

1498
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:38,299
like to have evidence-based

1499
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:40,610
conversations and frankly there's very

1500
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:45,230
little evidence that CBD does anything

1501
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:46,849
acutely especially at the common doses

1502
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:48,320
that people typically take you know

1503
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:50,569
they're like oh I have my you know like

1504
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:53,660
whatever five milligrams in my soda in

1505
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:57,019
the morning every day that that that

1506
01:06:53,659 --> 01:06:58,489
probably does nothing except make

1507
01:06:57,019 --> 01:07:00,530
someone feel better

1508
01:06:58,489 --> 01:07:02,419
via the placebo effect or the

1509
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:05,540
expectation that it's going to do

1510
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:09,019
something which I am not at all

1511
01:07:05,539 --> 01:07:11,989
knocking I love a drug that does

1512
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:12,320
absolutely nothing except make you feel

1513
01:07:11,989 --> 01:07:15,559
better

1514
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:17,809
so there's that component we are taking

1515
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:19,909
this thing empowering ourselves taking

1516
01:07:17,809 --> 01:07:21,889
our health into our own hands expecting

1517
01:07:19,909 --> 01:07:23,719
it to help us expecting it to make us

1518
01:07:21,889 --> 01:07:26,569
feel better and lo and behold it does

1519
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:28,939
that's because our brain is profoundly

1520
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:30,950
powerful at creating that experience for

1521
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:33,530
ourselves so I think that that's

1522
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:35,509
probably the most immediate benefit that

1523
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:37,970
someone could get acutely from taking

1524
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:39,620
any dose of cannabidiol is that the

1525
01:07:37,969 --> 01:07:42,169
knowing that they're taking care of

1526
01:07:39,619 --> 01:07:44,779
themselves and you know there could be

1527
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:48,019
some underlying pharmacology that is

1528
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:50,540
actually doing that especially you know

1529
01:07:48,019 --> 01:07:54,440
in a within a certain dose range or

1530
01:07:50,539 --> 01:07:57,670
after you know taking it by a certain

1531
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:00,740
you know inhalation route particularly

1532
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:04,070
but the the reality is that we don't

1533
01:08:00,739 --> 01:08:06,169
have the clinical studies to tell us

1534
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:09,140
what are the acute pain relieving or any

1535
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:10,070
other the you know medical benefits of

1536
01:08:09,139 --> 01:08:13,190
cannabidiol

1537
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:15,800
we definitely have evidence to suggest

1538
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:18,619
that over time there is some bio

1539
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,920
accumulation of CBD in the in the brain

1540
01:08:18,619 --> 01:08:21,750
and in the body

1541
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,759
cannabinoids are very lipophilic so

1542
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:26,640
they're stored in the tissue and our fat

1543
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:29,009
tissue really well and you know it does

1544
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:31,500
after a certain level of accumulation it

1545
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:34,319
ends up with like this slow release so

1546
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:37,259
you know we see this with Dravet

1547
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:39,810
patients with you know a Padilla's CBD

1548
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:42,448
and you know with the FDA clinical

1549
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:46,080
trials we see that you know there there

1550
01:08:42,448 --> 01:08:49,108
is a profound benefit medical benefit of

1551
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:52,079
you know daily consumption of you know

1552
01:08:49,109 --> 01:08:53,819
pretty high doses of CBD you know the

1553
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:56,460
doses that are given to these kids are

1554
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:58,319
pretty whopping and it would be quite

1555
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:00,899
expensive to try and recapitulate that

1556
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:03,298
on your own and there are definitely

1557
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:06,838
more efficient and cost-effective ways

1558
01:09:03,298 --> 01:09:09,719
to go about it but but yes I think that

1559
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:11,460
that that latter part of your hypothesis

1560
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:13,619
that maintaining a healthy

1561
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:16,079
endocannabinoid system is by far the

1562
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:18,539
best way to set you're all set yourself

1563
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:21,689
up for success for any health condition

1564
01:09:18,539 --> 01:09:24,329
pain included the the other thing that

1565
01:09:21,689 --> 01:09:26,818
you know we didn't mention was again

1566
01:09:24,329 --> 01:09:34,649
going back to this affective component

1567
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:36,630
of pain so CBD is psychoactive so you

1568
01:09:34,649 --> 01:09:38,460
know you hear all the time like oh CB

1569
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:41,520
he's not a psychoactive anything that

1570
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:44,219
changes the brain chemistry and the the

1571
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:47,190
physiology of the brain is psychoactive

1572
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:50,100
so we know that CBD is psychoactive

1573
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:52,229
because it shuts off seizures it acts in

1574
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:55,170
the brain to change the physiology of

1575
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:57,959
the brain to create a beneficial effect

1576
01:09:55,170 --> 01:10:00,899
so CBD is psychoactive in that aspect

1577
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:02,969
and one of its other psychoactive

1578
01:10:00,899 --> 01:10:05,488
properties is that again under certain

1579
01:10:02,969 --> 01:10:09,329
conditions at certain doses it relieves

1580
01:10:05,488 --> 01:10:13,229
anxiety it provides positive affective

1581
01:10:09,329 --> 01:10:16,319
positive emotional support we also see

1582
01:10:13,229 --> 01:10:18,539
this in the opioid world because there's

1583
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:21,238
a researcher at Mount Sinai in New York

1584
01:10:18,539 --> 01:10:23,399
Yasmin Hurd who's been studying CBD for

1585
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:26,539
a very long time and her work

1586
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:30,659
demonstrates that in people CBD

1587
01:10:26,539 --> 01:10:33,149
profoundly reduces anxiety and that that

1588
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:37,130
reduction in anxiety is also associate

1589
01:10:33,149 --> 01:10:40,829
with a reduction in craving for opioids

1590
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:43,770
so addiction one of the one of the

1591
01:10:40,829 --> 01:10:46,050
primary drivers for drug seeking

1592
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:47,670
behavior when someone is in recovery

1593
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:49,650
when they have been physically dependent

1594
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:54,140
on a substance and they're trying to

1595
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:58,639
come out of it one of the primary drug

1596
01:10:54,140 --> 01:11:03,170
seeking you know craving triggers is

1597
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:07,710
negative emotions you feel crappy and

1598
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:12,710
that feeling is a trigger for seeking

1599
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:15,810
drugs so the the affective or emotional

1600
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:18,960
support that comes from you know

1601
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:21,120
chronically ingesting CBD I don't think

1602
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:24,630
we can underestimate I think it's going

1603
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:26,519
to be very difficult to measure but you

1604
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:28,079
know given what we know from these

1605
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:30,270
little bits and pieces from the

1606
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:33,869
literature that we do have I think that

1607
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:37,610
it is why is to say that you know having

1608
01:11:33,869 --> 01:11:39,989
a rich endocannabinoid system a

1609
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:42,509
supplemented endocannabinoid system if

1610
01:11:39,989 --> 01:11:45,479
that's what you need that will provide

1611
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:48,140
both you know that bodily sensation

1612
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:53,009
support that you need as well as the

1613
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:56,490
effective support that you need that's

1614
01:11:53,010 --> 01:12:00,140
great so so what I think it's important

1615
01:11:56,489 --> 01:12:03,210
to hit this one more time because I I

1616
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:07,590
really was caught off-guard and pleased

1617
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:10,920
that you said that taking CBD now who

1618
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:13,890
does not have an acute effect meaning it

1619
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:16,680
will help you now and actually your your

1620
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:18,930
example of taking five milligrams of CBD

1621
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:21,060
in your morning soda crack me up because

1622
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:22,409
I'm often telling people you know you

1623
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:24,270
got to be really careful about how

1624
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:27,389
you're taking your cannabinoids because

1625
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:29,940
you know your your CBD gummies filled

1626
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:31,680
with crap sugar and artificial coloring

1627
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:34,549
is probably doing worse for you than the

1628
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:38,130
CBD that you're trying to get through it

1629
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:42,510
but I think that it's important for us

1630
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:43,520
to understand that taking cannabidiol is

1631
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:47,150
a

1632
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:48,860
a long-term commitment and that if you

1633
01:12:47,149 --> 01:12:51,619
want to get relief from it you've got a

1634
01:12:48,859 --> 01:12:53,809
you know you can't just take it when

1635
01:12:51,619 --> 01:12:56,149
you're feeling bad it's important to

1636
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:58,280
take it every day on a regular schedule

1637
01:12:56,149 --> 01:13:00,769
and heck if you can take it everyday

1638
01:12:58,279 --> 01:13:03,590
small doses two or three times a day

1639
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:08,990
that's even better because you will

1640
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:14,020
metabolize more of it but the the the

1641
01:13:08,989 --> 01:13:17,840
overall idea that yes take cannabidiol

1642
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:20,570
to help your endocannabinoid system but

1643
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:22,880
also don't forget that you should be

1644
01:13:20,569 --> 01:13:25,909
doing the lifestyle changes that are

1645
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,180
necessary so that you ease off the

1646
01:13:25,909 --> 01:13:30,979
trauma that you're giving your

1647
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:33,710
endocannabinoid system so that you don't

1648
01:13:30,979 --> 01:13:35,929
have to take CBD forever you know a lot

1649
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:37,939
of people they start taking CBD and they

1650
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:39,350
get these great effects and then they're

1651
01:13:37,939 --> 01:13:40,789
like oh I'm feeling so much better and

1652
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:42,230
then they get off of it and then they

1653
01:13:40,789 --> 01:13:43,970
feel like crap again I'm gonna like oh

1654
01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:47,000
my god am I gonna have to take CBD the

1655
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:49,039
rest of my life and I said and I say you

1656
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,199
know you don't necessarily have to but

1657
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:53,600
you're probably gonna have to start

1658
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:57,139
exercising and getting proper sleep and

1659
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:58,610
not drinking coffee and then and then

1660
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:02,630
they're all like screwed that I'll buy

1661
01:13:58,609 --> 01:14:06,049
CBD you know you're absolutely right in

1662
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:09,560
that you know CBD is far more like a

1663
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:11,570
micronutrient than it is a drug so you

1664
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:12,710
know we think of taking a drug I'm going

1665
01:14:11,569 --> 01:14:14,929
to take this I'm going to feel better

1666
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:17,480
right and especially in America that is

1667
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:19,550
our expectation that is why we have a

1668
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:21,589
health care system built around Commerce

1669
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:23,960
give me the thing make me feel better

1670
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:27,470
now that is that is our culture of

1671
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:31,010
medicine and that is not how CBD works

1672
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:32,900
CBD works more like you know omega-3s

1673
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:36,530
and it's actually not that dissimilar

1674
01:14:32,899 --> 01:14:38,779
from omega-3s structurally so you know

1675
01:14:36,529 --> 01:14:41,119
we don't take fish oil when we have a

1676
01:14:38,779 --> 01:14:43,880
headache right so we're not expecting

1677
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:45,920
fish oil to like miraculously make us

1678
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:48,109
feel better in 30 to 90 minutes

1679
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,300
it's a nutrient and it's a part of our

1680
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:53,210
lifestyle where if we're deficient in

1681
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:54,949
some way if we don't have the diet or we

1682
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:56,539
don't have the lifestyle to provide us

1683
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:56,929
that kind of nutrient by some other

1684
01:14:56,539 --> 01:14:59,389
means

1685
01:14:56,929 --> 01:15:01,429
we have to supplement it by taking fish

1686
01:14:59,389 --> 01:15:03,828
oil it's the exact same thing with

1687
01:15:01,429 --> 01:15:05,779
cannabidiol if you're not stimulating

1688
01:15:03,828 --> 01:15:09,498
your own endogenous cannabinoids system

1689
01:15:05,779 --> 01:15:13,639
through like you said exercise sleep a

1690
01:15:09,498 --> 01:15:15,559
balanced diet acupuncture all these

1691
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:17,569
other things that mimic the

1692
01:15:15,559 --> 01:15:19,670
endocannabinoid system support the

1693
01:15:17,569 --> 01:15:21,799
endocannabinoid system without the plant

1694
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:23,748
derived cannabinoids if you're not doing

1695
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:26,630
those things then clearly yeah you've

1696
01:15:23,748 --> 01:15:29,029
got to make up for it by taking CBD as a

1697
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:31,219
micronutrient on a very regular basis

1698
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:33,768
and if you're going to be taking it on a

1699
01:15:31,219 --> 01:15:36,139
regular basis it's going to be expensive

1700
01:15:33,769 --> 01:15:39,050
so you might as well find out how to

1701
01:15:36,139 --> 01:15:41,269
take it in a way that's economical so

1702
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:44,119
you know there's tons of products out

1703
01:15:41,269 --> 01:15:46,309
there that are orally ingested you know

1704
01:15:44,118 --> 01:15:48,549
like you can eat something or drink

1705
01:15:46,309 --> 01:15:52,189
something that has cannabidiol in it and

1706
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:55,519
the the sad fact is that only about 5%

1707
01:15:52,189 --> 01:15:59,510
of what you swallow ends up making it

1708
01:15:55,519 --> 01:16:02,659
into your bloodstream CBD has terrible

1709
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:04,458
oral bioavailability that means if you

1710
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:06,469
put it in your mouths and you swallow it

1711
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:07,929
hardly any of it is getting to your

1712
01:16:06,469 --> 01:16:10,399
brain and the rest to your body

1713
01:16:07,929 --> 01:16:13,489
something like the lungs you know you've

1714
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:15,109
got about 50% bioavailability so if you

1715
01:16:13,488 --> 01:16:18,169
look at you know how much does it cost

1716
01:16:15,109 --> 01:16:21,248
you to you know vaporize a kilo of hemp

1717
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:26,090
flour versus how much does it cost you

1718
01:16:21,248 --> 01:16:29,118
to you know ingest 300 milligrams or

1719
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:30,708
rather 300 grams of CBD if we're talking

1720
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:33,498
like a 30%

1721
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:36,019
you know cannabinoid content you know

1722
01:16:33,498 --> 01:16:38,779
like that's a lot of oil that's really

1723
01:16:36,019 --> 01:16:42,248
expensive so you know thinking about

1724
01:16:38,779 --> 01:16:43,849
more efficient ways to utilize that

1725
01:16:42,248 --> 01:16:45,679
micronutrient to support your

1726
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:48,409
endocannabinoid system you know is a

1727
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:50,420
good thing unless you are also using it

1728
01:16:48,408 --> 01:16:52,429
in combination with all these lifestyle

1729
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:54,739
factors and then like you said you won't

1730
01:16:52,429 --> 01:16:57,979
need to use it forever let's tease out

1731
01:16:54,738 --> 01:17:00,678
one bit about using CBD orally because I

1732
01:16:57,979 --> 01:17:04,789
agree with you up to a point and the

1733
01:17:00,679 --> 01:17:07,219
point is you know a lot of these oral

1734
01:17:04,788 --> 01:17:09,170
solutions and we'll talk more about this

1735
01:17:07,219 --> 01:17:10,010
during the third set but a lot of these

1736
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:12,769
oral

1737
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:15,440
solutions like like capsules and various

1738
01:17:12,769 --> 01:17:19,639
edibles that I have got CBD added to

1739
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:23,089
them you eat them and for that CBD to

1740
01:17:19,639 --> 01:17:25,819
become accessible to the human they have

1741
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:29,090
to go through your gut and you

1742
01:17:25,819 --> 01:17:30,408
eventually through your liver and you

1743
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:31,940
know it takes time plus you're getting

1744
01:17:30,408 --> 01:17:33,469
all the other you know random sugars

1745
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:38,359
along the way so you know it's a long

1746
01:17:33,469 --> 01:17:42,078
road to go in contrast I find that

1747
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:45,799
patients get good results with an whole

1748
01:17:42,078 --> 01:17:47,719
plant ethanol extracted tincture because

1749
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,779
when they are put putting it in their

1750
01:17:47,719 --> 01:17:53,179
mouth whether sublingually or not the

1751
01:17:50,779 --> 01:17:54,800
ethanol acts as such an effective

1752
01:17:53,179 --> 01:17:57,859
carrier for cannabinoids

1753
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:00,529
that the CBD is actually making the jump

1754
01:17:57,859 --> 01:18:03,109
through the mucosal membranes and the

1755
01:18:00,529 --> 01:18:05,868
tongue and the cheek and the esophagus

1756
01:18:03,109 --> 01:18:09,049
and by the time you know any remaining

1757
01:18:05,868 --> 01:18:12,018
fluid of the tincture gets down to the

1758
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:16,460
small intestine it's already been soaked

1759
01:18:12,019 --> 01:18:19,070
in other places so what what what do you

1760
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:24,439
think about that delineation Shango

1761
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:26,448
thank you so much because there are so

1762
01:18:24,439 --> 01:18:28,969
many products out there that are labeled

1763
01:18:26,448 --> 01:18:32,388
as a tincture which are you know is a

1764
01:18:28,969 --> 01:18:35,059
cannabinoid which is an oil in an oil

1765
01:18:32,389 --> 01:18:38,599
and that's not the same thing as it

1766
01:18:35,059 --> 01:18:41,059
cannabinoid suspended in a solvent like

1767
01:18:38,599 --> 01:18:45,440
ethanol and you're absolutely right if

1768
01:18:41,059 --> 01:18:47,599
you have some kind of oil in order and

1769
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:49,939
if or if you have two bottles of

1770
01:18:47,599 --> 01:18:52,010
tincture let's say one of them is oil

1771
01:18:49,939 --> 01:18:53,719
and one of them is ethanol either way

1772
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:56,059
your best bet at getting those

1773
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:58,939
cannabinoids into your blood is right in

1774
01:18:56,059 --> 01:19:00,529
your mouth and so if you're going to use

1775
01:18:58,939 --> 01:19:03,500
an oil-based you know quote-unquote

1776
01:19:00,529 --> 01:19:05,479
teacher then you have to use it more

1777
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,038
like a topical you have to put it under

1778
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:09,500
your tongue and you have to use your

1779
01:19:07,038 --> 01:19:11,689
tongue to rub it in you have to rub it

1780
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:14,569
in under your gums into your cheeks you

1781
01:19:11,689 --> 01:19:17,299
have to actually it really is more of a

1782
01:19:14,569 --> 01:19:20,509
topical than it is a you know orally

1783
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:22,949
ingested product and you're right that

1784
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:26,220
with the ethanol there might

1785
01:19:22,949 --> 01:19:28,619
some chance of enhanced permeability

1786
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:30,840
right there in the buccal tissue the

1787
01:19:28,619 --> 01:19:32,849
tissue on the side of your cheek right

1788
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:34,619
in the sublingual tissue you've got a

1789
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:36,000
ton of blood vessels in there wouldn't

1790
01:19:34,619 --> 01:19:37,680
it be great if you could just take the

1791
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,149
cannabinoids and shove them right into

1792
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:40,920
all those blood vessels inside your

1793
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:44,519
mouth yeah that's the idea

1794
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:47,130
so oral bioavailability typically refers

1795
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:49,110
to when a drug is swallowed that's you

1796
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:51,690
know clinically what we talk about when

1797
01:19:49,109 --> 01:19:53,279
we're looking at an oral preparation

1798
01:19:51,689 --> 01:19:55,529
that's a preparation that's swallowed

1799
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:58,319
which is kind of different than a

1800
01:19:55,529 --> 01:20:00,569
preparation that is absorbed in the

1801
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:03,289
mouth which is you know a far more

1802
01:20:00,569 --> 01:20:05,699
efficient way to take cannabidiol

1803
01:20:03,289 --> 01:20:07,529
fantastic all right so we will pick up

1804
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:09,179
that topic again in the third set when

1805
01:20:07,529 --> 01:20:11,369
we was talking about dosing and methods

1806
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:13,500
but there's one more thing I want to hit

1807
01:20:11,369 --> 01:20:17,039
on before we go to our second commercial

1808
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:19,590
break and and I know that you are very

1809
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:22,829
evidence-based and so you may not have a

1810
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:26,489
lot to say about Canaveral but I do want

1811
01:20:22,829 --> 01:20:33,239
to talk about CBG because I was lucky

1812
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:36,809
enough to get my hands on a high CBG no

1813
01:20:33,239 --> 01:20:42,269
THC plant material about a year and a

1814
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:48,480
half ago that was part of a Rd seed grow

1815
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:49,770
in Oregon and that's yeah yeah yeah all

1816
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:51,359
right well we might as well I was not I

1817
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:53,340
wasn't gonna out him but yeah this is

1818
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:56,689
this is the this is the stuff developed

1819
01:20:53,340 --> 01:21:00,630
by Seth and Eric Crawford at oregon CBD

1820
01:20:56,689 --> 01:21:03,269
there in oregon and it's fantastic stuff

1821
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:05,609
so i was able to get some of this

1822
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:07,980
because they know that i work a lot with

1823
01:21:05,609 --> 01:21:10,199
patients and that i run a lot of dosing

1824
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:13,559
trials because i think that one of the

1825
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:16,340
biggest challenges with patients using

1826
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:19,860
cannabinoids is that everyone's using

1827
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:23,100
totally uncontrolled dosing and they're

1828
01:21:19,859 --> 01:21:25,469
just taking some right and and one of

1829
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:27,060
the things that is important about any

1830
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:31,440
kind of medicine is repeatable results

1831
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:33,369
anyway so what i got this material and I

1832
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:38,948
did ethanol extractions and we

1833
01:21:33,368 --> 01:21:40,179
a bunch of tinctures and I'll say RSO so

1834
01:21:38,948 --> 01:21:42,188
people know what I'm talking about

1835
01:21:40,179 --> 01:21:45,550
but really we're talk about full extract

1836
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:48,840
cannabis oil and and so we did a bunch

1837
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:53,668
of dosing trials here on Vashon Island

1838
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:57,099
with with pain patients and because it

1839
01:21:53,668 --> 01:21:59,559
was said and in some you know casual

1840
01:21:57,099 --> 01:22:01,449
early CBG studies that it was really

1841
01:21:59,559 --> 01:22:04,090
great for neuromuscular pain and I'm

1842
01:22:01,448 --> 01:22:06,339
like alright well you know CBG is gonna

1843
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:08,860
be the hot novel cannabinoid let's find

1844
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:11,349
out how to actually take this stuff so

1845
01:22:08,859 --> 01:22:13,478
that when I talk to people I actually

1846
01:22:11,349 --> 01:22:16,269
have my own first-hand knowledge great

1847
01:22:13,479 --> 01:22:18,489
so we we you know I make make this

1848
01:22:16,269 --> 01:22:20,530
questionnaire and I and I and I take the

1849
01:22:18,488 --> 01:22:21,878
tinctures in the RSO we cap a bunch of

1850
01:22:20,529 --> 01:22:26,378
it up and we give it to a lot of

1851
01:22:21,878 --> 01:22:29,519
patients and and absolutely

1852
01:22:26,378 --> 01:22:34,238
we got positive response from people

1853
01:22:29,519 --> 01:22:38,019
regarding their pain and it tends to act

1854
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:40,268
like a non intoxicating Delta 9 THC as

1855
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:42,309
far as the patient experience but where

1856
01:22:40,269 --> 01:22:46,208
I'm going with it is is this next part

1857
01:22:42,309 --> 01:22:49,269
the part that was really startling was

1858
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:51,188
that everyone said that it put them in a

1859
01:22:49,269 --> 01:22:54,099
better mood and so you know I teased

1860
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:57,189
that out with folks and it was

1861
01:22:54,099 --> 01:23:01,689
decreasing people's anxiety about having

1862
01:22:57,189 --> 01:23:03,820
pain at all and and when you tease that

1863
01:23:01,689 --> 01:23:05,800
out more this is how I explained it now

1864
01:23:03,819 --> 01:23:10,058
to folks is that you know people turn to

1865
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:13,418
cannabis for anxiety and pain but but

1866
01:23:10,059 --> 01:23:15,340
THC tends to slather you know I mean I

1867
01:23:13,418 --> 01:23:18,550
understand that that generally we're

1868
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:20,110
looking for doses of THC that you don't

1869
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:23,649
actually feel right that don't cause

1870
01:23:20,109 --> 01:23:25,179
intoxication but but at this point few

1871
01:23:23,649 --> 01:23:26,349
people take it that way right most

1872
01:23:25,179 --> 01:23:28,538
people think you're not a little high it

1873
01:23:26,349 --> 01:23:31,860
doesn't work so so based on people's

1874
01:23:28,538 --> 01:23:34,148
actual experiences you know Delta 9 THC

1875
01:23:31,859 --> 01:23:36,878
slathers a little bit of intoxication

1876
01:23:34,149 --> 01:23:38,559
over your anxiety and pain and you know

1877
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:41,408
does decrease your pain and acts as a

1878
01:23:38,559 --> 01:23:43,479
distractin but but you know involves

1879
01:23:41,408 --> 01:23:45,049
some intoxication and then the CBD it

1880
01:23:43,479 --> 01:23:46,730
doesn't work for today but it's

1881
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:48,310
work for next month if you take it for

1882
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:51,889
you know every day for the next month

1883
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:54,860
CBG is a different category it actually

1884
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:58,010
makes the patients feel like they are

1885
01:23:54,859 --> 01:24:00,949
capable of handling their day or their

1886
01:23:58,010 --> 01:24:03,079
pain with with the resources and

1887
01:24:00,949 --> 01:24:05,329
abilities they have in front of them

1888
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:08,899
and the patients said you know like my

1889
01:24:05,329 --> 01:24:11,559
pain is the same as yesterday but I feel

1890
01:24:08,899 --> 01:24:15,109
like I can just fricking handle it more

1891
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:17,510
because of the change in attitude and so

1892
01:24:15,109 --> 01:24:20,539
they're all like I think that I'm having

1893
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:22,579
some pain relief but I can tell you one

1894
01:24:20,539 --> 01:24:25,130
thing I can cope with my pain a lot

1895
01:24:22,579 --> 01:24:27,949
better and I love CBG for pain relief

1896
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:30,829
and then with that week we kind of did a

1897
01:24:27,949 --> 01:24:34,789
the secondary you know trial of people

1898
01:24:30,829 --> 01:24:38,000
who had extreme daily background anxiety

1899
01:24:34,789 --> 01:24:39,890
and performance anxiety and they took to

1900
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,380
it like a duck to water they were like

1901
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:45,800
oh my gosh this stops my ruminating and

1902
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:48,560
and and you know a fear of social

1903
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:52,070
situations and these things this is all

1904
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:54,970
a big setup to ask you as somebody who

1905
01:24:52,069 --> 01:24:58,340
studies you know the pharmacological

1906
01:24:54,970 --> 01:25:00,260
aspect of these cannabinoids have you

1907
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:03,610
seen any either

1908
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:07,369
you know legitimate peer-reviewed

1909
01:25:03,609 --> 01:25:10,250
evidence for what I'm describing or even

1910
01:25:07,369 --> 01:25:12,470
some significant anecdotal or or heck

1911
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:14,930
since you know how these mechanisms work

1912
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:16,610
I could do you imagine you might go oh

1913
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:18,200
there aren't any studies but from what

1914
01:25:16,609 --> 01:25:20,359
are you described I bet you ABC is

1915
01:25:18,199 --> 01:25:22,189
happening so I'm just gonna hand that

1916
01:25:20,359 --> 01:25:24,409
that whole explanation to you on a big

1917
01:25:22,189 --> 01:25:26,659
platter and say what do you think yeah

1918
01:25:24,409 --> 01:25:29,510
so we'll start with the evidence that we

1919
01:25:26,659 --> 01:25:32,750
do have which is preclinical so in petri

1920
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:34,310
dishes and animals and CBG is you know

1921
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:37,310
kind of like cannabidiol it is

1922
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:41,360
non-intoxicating and it is psychoactive

1923
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:44,150
it is you know very similar to CBD we

1924
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:46,009
don't it is not nearly as deeply studied

1925
01:25:44,149 --> 01:25:47,989
as cannabidiol so we don't know exactly

1926
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:50,869
you know all the mechanisms of action

1927
01:25:47,989 --> 01:25:53,449
which proteins it's interacting with but

1928
01:25:50,869 --> 01:25:55,699
in general you know it is anti oxidative

1929
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:57,500
and anti inflammatory you know it looks

1930
01:25:55,699 --> 01:25:58,880
like it's doing good things and not bad

1931
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,470
things to the brain

1932
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:02,630
so you know at a very fundamental

1933
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:04,699
molecular level there does seem to be

1934
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:07,400
some kind of basis that this could be a

1935
01:26:04,699 --> 01:26:08,989
profoundly therapeutic molecule because

1936
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:12,170
it looks like it does a lot of good

1937
01:26:08,989 --> 01:26:14,179
things without causing impairment you

1938
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:16,369
know with that said the anecdote that

1939
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:18,890
you just told me is the deepest and most

1940
01:26:16,369 --> 01:26:21,920
wide anecdote that I have ever heard

1941
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:25,250
about CBG because to date it has been

1942
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:27,949
nigh impossible to get enough of it to

1943
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:30,829
actually give to a human being at a dose

1944
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:32,720
that would do something so you know this

1945
01:26:30,829 --> 01:26:35,119
is changing now because you know I think

1946
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:37,970
now we have this year will be really the

1947
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:40,099
first time that we have large commercial

1948
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:43,280
operations which are growing type four

1949
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:45,770
CBG dominant cultivars and we'll have

1950
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:48,949
the opportunity to do this you know sort

1951
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:50,450
of real-world scientific experiment and

1952
01:26:48,949 --> 01:26:54,349
of putting this stuff in our bodies and

1953
01:26:50,449 --> 01:26:56,750
watching what happens so I do think that

1954
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:59,020
there is some fundamental basis for it

1955
01:26:56,750 --> 01:27:02,180
to be a profoundly therapeutic molecule

1956
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:05,000
but we also you know again we we don't

1957
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:07,909
have any evidence to look at either the

1958
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,760
acute or the chronic chronic effects for

1959
01:27:07,909 --> 01:27:13,309
either effective support or you know

1960
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:15,650
pain relief the other thing I will say

1961
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:17,210
and I you know like I always lean on

1962
01:27:15,649 --> 01:27:19,729
this because it's so true and I don't

1963
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:22,460
mean on it in a in a negative way to

1964
01:27:19,729 --> 01:27:26,319
downplay the power of pharmacology I

1965
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:29,510
clearly in the cannabis pharmacologist

1966
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:32,210
but I also equally believe in the power

1967
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:36,530
of the brain and what we know about all

1968
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:39,859
drugs any drug is the newer it is the

1969
01:27:36,529 --> 01:27:42,319
more profound the placebo effect is so

1970
01:27:39,859 --> 01:27:44,929
you're you know small test cases that

1971
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:46,429
you do with your your patients on Vashon

1972
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:49,250
do they know what they're getting do

1973
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:50,900
they know that it contains CBG well they

1974
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:52,550
they knew at the beginning of the study

1975
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:54,679
that it was a new novel cannabinoid

1976
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:56,840
called CBG but they did not know what

1977
01:27:54,680 --> 01:28:00,500
the effects were supposed to be mm-hmm

1978
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:01,909
yeah so you know and I certain and I

1979
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:03,529
certainly didn't prime them for this

1980
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:07,399
anxiety stuff which I wasn't even

1981
01:28:03,529 --> 01:28:09,769
looking for myself right think about you

1982
01:28:07,399 --> 01:28:12,059
know like what ails people generally and

1983
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:14,550
if you're a chronic pain patient

1984
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:16,140
both about that bodily sensation of pain

1985
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:18,570
as well as you know like we talked about

1986
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:21,090
earlier that affective component of pain

1987
01:28:18,569 --> 01:28:25,139
which is inseparable from the bodily

1988
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:28,170
suffering so you know III approach this

1989
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:30,660
you know from like you said you know I

1990
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:32,130
really appreciate the evidence and it

1991
01:28:30,659 --> 01:28:33,779
wouldn't it be lovely if we could do you

1992
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:35,760
know double-blind placebo-controlled

1993
01:28:33,779 --> 01:28:38,159
crossover clinical trials with this

1994
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:40,020
stuff yeah that'd be great as a matter

1995
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:42,389
of measure matter of fact you know dr.

1996
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:45,720
Ethan Russo happens to live on the same

1997
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:47,310
island that I do and I actually told him

1998
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:50,970
what I was doing and I described it to

1999
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:53,460
him and and and and he kind of raised

2000
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:54,780
his eyebrow because he's he's you know

2001
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:56,640
he's like that well that he says you're

2002
01:28:54,779 --> 01:28:58,979
using this term study he says this is

2003
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:01,110
this isn't really a study you know

2004
01:28:58,979 --> 01:29:02,609
you're just kind of giving it to people

2005
01:29:01,109 --> 01:29:06,179
and asking them questions that I'm like

2006
01:29:02,609 --> 01:29:08,849
yeah study and so you know yeah there

2007
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:11,340
was no there is no double-blinded in

2008
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:13,260
this or peer-reviewed NIST to this right

2009
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:14,730
but I totally understand

2010
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:16,230
you know dosing protocols I want to

2011
01:29:14,729 --> 01:29:19,409
recommend to people now which was the

2012
01:29:16,229 --> 01:29:22,159
actual point for sure and I also want to

2013
01:29:19,409 --> 01:29:25,800
say that everything we know about

2014
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:28,199
cannabis started from anecdotes you know

2015
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:29,970
20 years ago patients were coming into

2016
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:32,519
their doctors offices and saying hey Doc

2017
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:34,770
when I smoke a joint before bed I don't

2018
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:36,480
need to use my dilaudid or you know like

2019
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:38,070
I've noticed that since I started

2020
01:29:36,479 --> 01:29:41,159
smoking cannabis I used half as many

2021
01:29:38,069 --> 01:29:44,039
opioids and those anecdotes all

2022
01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:46,050
collected into community to find

2023
01:29:44,039 --> 01:29:48,810
evidence and that community to find

2024
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:51,420
evidence grew to a point where we were

2025
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:54,450
able to you know do more closely

2026
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:57,750
controlled experimental trials and so

2027
01:29:54,449 --> 01:30:00,479
all of this stuff has value heuristic

2028
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:03,390
value if nothing else in that it allows

2029
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:06,119
us to go down a line of questioning well

2030
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:08,160
huh isn't that interesting that you know

2031
01:30:06,119 --> 01:30:11,279
these chronic pain patients who

2032
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:13,559
experience anxiety have this you know

2033
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:15,509
what looks to be a very profound

2034
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:17,400
therapeutic effect why don't we dig into

2035
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:19,350
that a little deeper so I think there's

2036
01:30:17,399 --> 01:30:22,289
a ton of value in this

2037
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:24,600
you know both from a you know cellular

2038
01:30:22,289 --> 01:30:26,789
molecular level there's rationale there

2039
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:29,579
and there's definitely rationale to

2040
01:30:26,789 --> 01:30:31,409
listen to the people and when what

2041
01:30:29,579 --> 01:30:34,500
they're saying is real and it's worth

2042
01:30:31,409 --> 01:30:36,809
looking into a lot of my scientist

2043
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:39,090
friends when I talk with them say we're

2044
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:41,490
at emerald cup or something and which

2045
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:43,529
which pulls cannabis researchers and

2046
01:30:41,489 --> 01:30:45,479
scientists and doctors from all over the

2047
01:30:43,529 --> 01:30:47,479
world and we get together you know a lot

2048
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:50,219
of them talk a lot of trash about

2049
01:30:47,479 --> 01:30:52,859
citizen scientists right essentially

2050
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:54,449
what I'm doing and they're like yeah we

2051
01:30:52,859 --> 01:30:55,920
understand what you're doing but there

2052
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:57,449
doesn't have a lot of value to it and

2053
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,909
and I'm actually a big proponent for

2054
01:30:57,449 --> 01:31:03,289
citizen science that that like let's all

2055
01:30:59,909 --> 01:31:06,239
work at home on our own and and

2056
01:31:03,289 --> 01:31:08,310
especially since cannabis is federally

2057
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:11,069
illegal and and getting the research

2058
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:14,100
approved is so difficult let's let's

2059
01:31:11,069 --> 01:31:16,979
start doing this research on our own and

2060
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:18,060
then as it becomes more commonplace in

2061
01:31:16,979 --> 01:31:21,989
the population

2062
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:24,120
when legit research scientists go to

2063
01:31:21,989 --> 01:31:25,710
divine their studies look like well you

2064
01:31:24,119 --> 01:31:27,989
know I've heard this thing anecdotally

2065
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:30,149
let's go ahead up and and fire up the

2066
01:31:27,989 --> 01:31:32,880
funding machine and get the university

2067
01:31:30,149 --> 01:31:35,899
to do this study but that wouldn't have

2068
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:38,970
necessarily been indicated without

2069
01:31:35,899 --> 01:31:42,389
regular nobody's doing it on their own

2070
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:44,130
first for sure and the other component

2071
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:47,460
to that is that you know when we do

2072
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:50,310
clinical trials we have a very long list

2073
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:53,159
of exclusion criteria you know you have

2074
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:54,930
to be pretty neurotypical and you have

2075
01:31:53,159 --> 01:31:56,819
to have a pretty narrow range of

2076
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:58,470
conditions and you can't have abused

2077
01:31:56,819 --> 01:32:00,599
drugs in the past and you can't have it

2078
01:31:58,470 --> 01:32:02,190
this and you have to be this you have to

2079
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:04,770
be a certain age so we have a very

2080
01:32:02,189 --> 01:32:06,809
lengthy list of exclusion criteria which

2081
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:09,390
means that we're self selecting yeah

2082
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:11,280
that drug might work in this population

2083
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:13,500
that you have you know developed a

2084
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:15,359
rigorous exclusion criteria for and it

2085
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:17,189
only works for them but what about

2086
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:19,380
everybody else what about all these

2087
01:32:17,189 --> 01:32:21,239
other people who lie all over the place

2088
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:22,730
on the neurotypical spectrum you know

2089
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:25,469
and who have all of these other

2090
01:32:22,729 --> 01:32:28,250
comorbidities and who have all of these

2091
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:31,310
you know traumatic childhoods

2092
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:33,949
you know so that that's also a really

2093
01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:37,039
great thing about you know a large but

2094
01:32:33,949 --> 01:32:40,099
messy data set is that if you do have an

2095
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:42,050
effect which is profound

2096
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:44,210
you're gonna detect it in both

2097
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:46,640
populations you know if a drug really

2098
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:48,560
works it should work for everybody no

2099
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:51,310
matter what their you know neuro typer

2100
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:54,260
or background or underlying conditions

2101
01:32:51,310 --> 01:32:56,150
rather than you know some drug that only

2102
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:58,640
works for this very very narrowly

2103
01:32:56,149 --> 01:33:01,159
defined you know like population of

2104
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:03,500
people I want to hit on one other thing

2105
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:05,239
about you know you mentioned that last

2106
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:11,090
summer was the first summer that

2107
01:33:05,239 --> 01:33:12,829
cannabic girolle was in commercial you

2108
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:15,829
know acre acres and acres of it were

2109
01:33:12,829 --> 01:33:18,529
grown with with those Oregon CVD seeds

2110
01:33:15,829 --> 01:33:21,050
all over the country and I was very

2111
01:33:18,529 --> 01:33:24,710
excited because while I got my sample

2112
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:27,140
for these tests almost two years ago now

2113
01:33:24,710 --> 01:33:29,119
I was all like alright great I'll do

2114
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:33,350
this stuff now and then at the end of

2115
01:33:29,119 --> 01:33:35,659
the summer 2019 there'll be all these

2116
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:38,180
whole plant oils coming to market and I

2117
01:33:35,659 --> 01:33:40,699
can send people to purchase them and

2118
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:42,800
it'll be like this new new arrow in the

2119
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:44,869
quiver and I'll be damned I was very

2120
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:48,020
disappointed to see that the vast

2121
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:52,970
majority of the people who grew CVG they

2122
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:56,150
ended up making single my molecule

2123
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:58,220
isolate out of it and using it to spike

2124
01:33:56,149 --> 01:34:00,739
edibles and things like that and as

2125
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:03,110
you've mentioned several times during

2126
01:34:00,739 --> 01:34:05,210
this episode so far you know these

2127
01:34:03,109 --> 01:34:09,259
cannabinoids especially the novel ones

2128
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:11,989
are they work their best in the presence

2129
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:18,100
of other cannabinoids and so I feel like

2130
01:34:11,989 --> 01:34:21,979
you know CBG grown in volume at acres

2131
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:27,190
was made it was extracted into isolate

2132
01:34:21,979 --> 01:34:30,289
for the monetary value and ease of

2133
01:34:27,189 --> 01:34:33,109
integrating into products and yet again

2134
01:34:30,289 --> 01:34:35,060
patients lose out because what they

2135
01:34:33,109 --> 01:34:37,880
really needed to do was turn all that

2136
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:40,310
stuff into a whole plant full extract

2137
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:41,630
ethanol oil put it in capsules and give

2138
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:44,620
it to people so that

2139
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:47,869
is actually effective yeah I mean like

2140
01:34:44,619 --> 01:34:50,809
you're right but you're also like

2141
01:34:47,869 --> 01:34:54,289
fighting economic you're fighting

2142
01:34:50,810 --> 01:35:02,420
commercial this this is not new for me

2143
01:34:54,289 --> 01:35:04,369
or this show and you know like what is

2144
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:07,699
best for the patients is not necessarily

2145
01:35:04,369 --> 01:35:09,739
the same you know but I am encouraged

2146
01:35:07,699 --> 01:35:11,479
because you know this is you know one

2147
01:35:09,739 --> 01:35:13,369
more frontier that we get to go down

2148
01:35:11,479 --> 01:35:15,529
what happens when we have that full

2149
01:35:13,369 --> 01:35:17,390
cannabis extract what happens when we

2150
01:35:15,529 --> 01:35:19,609
have it you know in large doses and

2151
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:23,539
capsules what happens if we you know can

2152
01:35:19,609 --> 01:35:24,829
somehow vaporize that flower you know I

2153
01:35:23,539 --> 01:35:26,630
don't I don't know a lot about the

2154
01:35:24,829 --> 01:35:28,819
phenotype of that flower I've never had

2155
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:31,130
a chance to encounter it myself or even

2156
01:35:28,819 --> 01:35:33,729
look at a certificate of analysis but

2157
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:37,159
you know I I could imagine how it could

2158
01:35:33,729 --> 01:35:39,919
potentially be at least right now and in

2159
01:35:37,159 --> 01:35:42,050
this stage a relatively low yielding

2160
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:46,250
plant in terms of you know what is that

2161
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:48,350
cannabinoid per gram but I don't know so

2162
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:50,359
so maybe that's the thing too maybe we

2163
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:52,340
need to get it you know hybridized into

2164
01:35:50,359 --> 01:35:54,139
these like really oil-rich you know

2165
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:55,970
rather than just biomass producing

2166
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:58,760
plants these oil producing plants maybe

2167
01:35:55,970 --> 01:36:01,070
that'll help you know popularize it so I

2168
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:02,930
I'm excited because I do think that this

2169
01:36:01,069 --> 01:36:04,359
is a really interesting molecule and we

2170
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:07,010
have a long way to go with it

2171
01:36:04,359 --> 01:36:09,609
very good so last thing before we go to

2172
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:12,650
commercial are there any other

2173
01:36:09,609 --> 01:36:14,259
cannabinoids or constituents of cannabis

2174
01:36:12,649 --> 01:36:18,500
that you see coming down the line that

2175
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:20,420
we should look out for for dealing with

2176
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:22,460
pain I mean there's there's there's a

2177
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:25,180
slew of cannabinoids but there's almost

2178
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:27,829
no research on the vast majority of them

2179
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:29,329
but but what what do you anything you

2180
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:32,029
want to flag for us to make sure that we

2181
01:36:29,329 --> 01:36:34,789
keep an eye out for the future yeah I

2182
01:36:32,029 --> 01:36:37,729
think there are two big ones and you

2183
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:39,649
know if you are a nerd for the

2184
01:36:37,729 --> 01:36:41,839
literature like I am they've been there

2185
01:36:39,649 --> 01:36:44,449
all along and it shouldn't be a huge

2186
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:47,810
surprise but there the evidence is like

2187
01:36:44,449 --> 01:36:49,159
profound like beta carrier filing is a

2188
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:51,620
full agonist

2189
01:36:49,159 --> 01:36:53,989
at the cb2 receptor so it's not a

2190
01:36:51,619 --> 01:36:55,849
cannabinoid per se but it is a

2191
01:36:53,989 --> 01:37:00,769
cannabinoid in that it is a full agonist

2192
01:36:55,850 --> 01:37:03,760
at a cannabinoid receptor so baby

2193
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:05,990
finally you know is profoundly

2194
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:09,020
anti-inflammatory has tons of

2195
01:37:05,989 --> 01:37:11,719
therapeutic potential and it's abundant

2196
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:13,550
so I think that you know this one in

2197
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:16,460
particular could be playing a really

2198
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:19,760
important role in pain relief especially

2199
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:21,409
because of the mechanisms of pain and

2200
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:24,500
inflammation in particular

2201
01:37:21,409 --> 01:37:27,349
so at basal conditions when you have a

2202
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:29,569
normal healthy organism the cb2 receptor

2203
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:31,789
is pretty silent there's not much of it

2204
01:37:29,569 --> 01:37:33,590
around so much so that for a long time

2205
01:37:31,789 --> 01:37:36,739
even at the International cannabinoid

2206
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:39,350
Research Society ICRS that's the the

2207
01:37:36,739 --> 01:37:42,469
main professional scientific society in

2208
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:44,539
the cannabis and cannabinoid sphere ICRS

2209
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:47,000
you know still to this day there's a

2210
01:37:44,539 --> 01:37:48,769
little bit of debate about is the cb2

2211
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,720
receptor even present in the brain and

2212
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:53,540
that's because under normal conditions

2213
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:56,720
no it's not it's there's no need for it

2214
01:37:53,539 --> 01:37:59,239
but when you have chronic drug exposure

2215
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:02,240
chronic stress chronic inflammation you

2216
01:37:59,239 --> 01:38:04,789
know any kind of insult to the organism

2217
01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:07,069
these things bloom like crazy expression

2218
01:38:04,789 --> 01:38:09,199
of the CBT receptor goes up you know

2219
01:38:07,069 --> 01:38:11,479
under any kind of you know insult or

2220
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:12,979
injury and so particularly in those

2221
01:38:11,479 --> 01:38:15,169
conditions if you have all those

2222
01:38:12,979 --> 01:38:17,809
receptors sitting around waiting further

2223
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:20,420
you know little key to come float in and

2224
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:23,360
activate it may be beta carry ethylene

2225
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:26,569
could be a good you know component to

2226
01:38:23,359 --> 01:38:29,569
introduce so it's not a particularly

2227
01:38:26,569 --> 01:38:31,460
sexy one because it's everywhere but it

2228
01:38:29,569 --> 01:38:34,279
is it is you know it has a lot of

2229
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:36,340
promise the other one that there are

2230
01:38:34,279 --> 01:38:39,340
some preclinical evidence for is

2231
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:39,340
tetrahydrocannabinol

2232
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:44,300
so that one especially in combination

2233
01:38:42,649 --> 01:38:46,399
with other cannabinoids does look like

2234
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:49,010
there's a large amount of promise I

2235
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:51,529
think it's a few years behind Canaveral

2236
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:53,989
and I definitely don't know anyone who's

2237
01:38:51,529 --> 01:38:56,029
you know trying to cultivate THC V

2238
01:38:53,989 --> 01:38:58,489
dominant plants but certainly there's

2239
01:38:56,029 --> 01:39:00,079
some like semi synthetic folks out there

2240
01:38:58,489 --> 01:39:02,689
working with yeast who are trying to

2241
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:05,960
produce this you know at scale

2242
01:39:02,689 --> 01:39:08,839
and I think th CV has a lot of promise

2243
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:11,180
as well I also think and again this

2244
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:12,230
one's like not super sexy because it's

2245
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:16,600
so obvious

2246
01:39:12,229 --> 01:39:19,339
th CA so you know the acid form the non

2247
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:22,480
decarboxylated version of THC

2248
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:25,850
this thing's profoundly

2249
01:39:22,479 --> 01:39:28,488
anti-inflammatory but again it goes back

2250
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:31,370
to that sort of micronutrient territory

2251
01:39:28,488 --> 01:39:34,279
where if you have you know low but

2252
01:39:31,369 --> 01:39:38,210
consistent ingestion or somehow you know

2253
01:39:34,279 --> 01:39:39,679
putting the non-intoxicating THC into

2254
01:39:38,210 --> 01:39:41,960
your body and supporting the

2255
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:44,210
endocannabinoids system you know that

2256
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:46,939
way as from a micronutrient perspective

2257
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:49,069
that also has a lot of promise you know

2258
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:50,569
there are tons of patient stories out

2259
01:39:49,069 --> 01:39:53,029
there people who have been you know

2260
01:39:50,569 --> 01:39:56,119
preparing their own non-intoxicating

2261
01:39:53,029 --> 01:40:00,019
sort of cannabinoid rich you know hemp

2262
01:39:56,119 --> 01:40:02,479
seed elixirs for many years and you know

2263
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:04,610
it seems to be at least anecdotally that

2264
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:06,769
you know that has that has worked for

2265
01:40:04,609 --> 01:40:09,589
them to manage you know chronic chronic

2266
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:11,930
diseases so those are some of the big

2267
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:15,350
ones you know the acid form of THC the

2268
01:40:11,930 --> 01:40:19,550
the non decarboxylated form beta carry a

2269
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:21,380
fine lean and THC B fantastic thank you

2270
01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:23,719
ad we're gonna go ahead and take that

2271
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:25,279
last short break and be right back you

2272
01:40:23,719 --> 01:40:27,800
are listening to shaping fire and my

2273
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:31,670
guest today is cannabis pharmacologist

2274
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:33,289
ad ray pre-rolls have come a long way

2275
01:40:31,670 --> 01:40:35,930
since the early days of normalization

2276
01:40:33,289 --> 01:40:38,420
when you choose Saints joints you are

2277
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:40,610
smoking all flour top-shelf pre-rolls

2278

Shango Lowe's and our guest this week is

2421
01:45:57,380 --> 01:46:03,230
cannabis pharmacologist ad rate so here

2422
01:46:00,649 --> 01:46:06,500
we are in the third set and we want to

2423
01:46:03,229 --> 01:46:09,319
go through dosing and methods of taking

2424
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:11,060
in your cannabinoids because now that

2425
01:46:09,319 --> 01:46:12,889
you perhaps have these ideas that you

2426
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:15,950
that you might want to replace your

2427
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:17,510
opiates with cannabis one of the hardest

2428
01:46:15,949 --> 01:46:20,599
things is figuring out what the hell to

2429
01:46:17,510 --> 01:46:23,239
do next so so we're going to go through

2430
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:27,380
a couple of the different common methods

2431
01:46:23,239 --> 01:46:30,319
for ingesting or taking in cannabinoids

2432
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:33,109
and and and we'll kind of riff on each

2433
01:46:30,319 --> 01:46:35,239
of those so that we can we can all kind

2434
01:46:33,109 --> 01:46:37,369
of learn together so so a tea I know

2435
01:46:35,239 --> 01:46:39,529
from watching your other presentations

2436
01:46:37,369 --> 01:46:43,430
that you are not particularly a fan of

2437
01:46:39,529 --> 01:46:45,649
smoking and I mean for for medicinal

2438
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:48,310
right we all love to smoke smoke that

2439
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:51,979
but actually as far as it being

2440
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:55,850
medicinally effective would you explain

2441
01:46:51,979 --> 01:46:58,789
why that's that's what you teach yeah so

2442
01:46:55,850 --> 01:47:01,670
I mean that that the basis for that is

2443
01:46:58,789 --> 01:47:03,710
purely from poly aromatic hydrocarbons

2444
01:47:01,670 --> 01:47:06,619
from things that are potential

2445
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:09,260
carcinogens you know putting burnt plant

2446
01:47:06,619 --> 01:47:11,779
material inside of your body is less

2447
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:14,480
healthy than not putting burnt plant

2448
01:47:11,779 --> 01:47:17,569
material inside your body however that

2449
01:47:14,479 --> 01:47:20,149
being said I am I've always been a firm

2450
01:47:17,569 --> 01:47:22,189
believer that the best kind of medicine

2451
01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:25,579
is the one you will take

2452
01:47:22,189 --> 01:47:28,579
so if smoking cannabis feels like

2453
01:47:25,579 --> 01:47:30,619
medicine to you and it is the the the

2454
01:47:28,579 --> 01:47:32,930
path of least resistance to getting

2455
01:47:30,619 --> 01:47:34,369
medicine into your body then you're

2456
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:37,760
better off with the medicine than

2457
01:47:34,369 --> 01:47:40,369
without it for a lot of people smoking

2458
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:41,960
simply doesn't feel like medicine it was

2459
01:47:40,369 --> 01:47:44,449
never part of their culture it was

2460
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:46,550
always frowned upon there's some fear

2461
01:47:44,449 --> 01:47:48,519
and shame and there's a lot of war on

2462
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:51,460
drugs stuff happening there

2463
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:54,010
and smoking simply is not going to work

2464
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:56,170
for them the benefits of smoking are

2465
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:59,220
really the benefits of inhalation which

2466
01:47:56,170 --> 01:48:02,800
is an immediate onset here you have an

2467
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:05,650
activated molecule and Delta 9 THC in

2468
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:08,770
particular has to be decarboxylated it

2469
01:48:05,649 --> 01:48:11,849
has to be converted from it's a civ acid

2470
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:15,940
inactive form to its you know

2471
01:48:11,850 --> 01:48:20,170
decarboxylated active form so THC a has

2472
01:48:15,939 --> 01:48:23,469
to be converted into THC so to do that

2473
01:48:20,170 --> 01:48:25,960
you have to apply heat and the easiest

2474
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:28,060
you know way for thousands of years to

2475
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:31,390
apply heat to the cannabis plant is to

2476
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:34,480
set it on fire so the the benefit of

2477
01:48:31,390 --> 01:48:37,329
smoking is that you have an activated

2478
01:48:34,479 --> 01:48:40,089
THC which goes directly into your

2479
01:48:37,329 --> 01:48:42,729
freshly oxygenated blood supply which

2480
01:48:40,090 --> 01:48:44,860
goes directly up to your brain which is

2481
01:48:42,729 --> 01:48:48,399
exactly why it has an immediate effect

2482
01:48:44,859 --> 01:48:50,250
and for someone who is experiencing for

2483
01:48:48,399 --> 01:48:53,439
instance breakthrough cancer pain

2484
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:55,949
nothing is going to help better than to

2485
01:48:53,439 --> 01:48:58,679
have an immediate relief of that pain so

2486
01:48:55,949 --> 01:49:01,929
anything that can you know literally

2487
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:04,630
instantaneously shut off the pain that's

2488
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:07,570
amazing and so if smoking does that for

2489
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:10,000
you great there are other ways of

2490
01:49:07,569 --> 01:49:12,699
inhaling the cannabinoids that don't

2491
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,649
involve you know the burnt plant

2492
01:49:12,699 --> 01:49:17,380
material that you know can potentially

2493
01:49:14,649 --> 01:49:19,659
cause other health effects and when I

2494
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:22,630
say other health effects you know there

2495
01:49:19,659 --> 01:49:26,050
are known side effects of smoking

2496
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:28,960
cannabis although we have yet to see any

2497
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:31,119
you know sort of cancer or lung cancer

2498
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:32,770
come out of chronically smoking cannabis

2499
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:35,349
like we see with you know chronic

2500
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:38,770
tobacco smoking clearly causes cancer

2501
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:42,030
that's gnarly but what we do see are you

2502
01:49:38,770 --> 01:49:45,040
know COPD chronic inflammatory you know

2503
01:49:42,029 --> 01:49:47,949
respiratory issues we see you know

2504
01:49:45,039 --> 01:49:51,489
coughing we see phlegm production so

2505
01:49:47,949 --> 01:49:54,789
it's not to say that smoking is totally

2506
01:49:51,489 --> 01:49:57,579
unsafe but it's also not totally safe so

2507
01:49:54,789 --> 01:49:59,829
there's still other ways of reaping the

2508
01:49:57,579 --> 01:50:02,350
benefits of inhaled cannabinoids without

2509
01:49:59,829 --> 01:50:05,380
exposing yourselves to all of those

2510
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:07,360
that the toxins and the irritants that

2511
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:09,880
lead to all of those other you know

2512
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:11,920
inflammatory conditions I'll go ahead

2513
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:14,890
and add to that to that for a lot of

2514
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:16,810
people I mean your example of cancer

2515
01:50:14,890 --> 01:50:20,200
related pain and the immediate secession

2516
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:23,250
of pain is spot on and yet there are a

2517
01:50:20,199 --> 01:50:27,729
lot of patients who are taking either

2518
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:31,479
THC for other types of pain or or maybe

2519
01:50:27,729 --> 01:50:35,289
they're looking for CBD where smoking it

2520
01:50:31,479 --> 01:50:37,389
has that very fat fast effect it fills

2521
01:50:35,289 --> 01:50:39,430
your lungs it's instantly in your brain

2522
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:41,500
and you go up fast that's not

2523
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:43,659
necessarily what everybody who is

2524
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:47,680
fighting say for example inflammatory

2525
01:50:43,659 --> 01:50:50,739
pain is looking for taking say a

2526
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:54,430
tincture or something or a topical where

2527
01:50:50,739 --> 01:50:57,760
the cannabinoids enter the body at a

2528
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:59,590
slower rate so instead of going up and

2529
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:04,449
getting this peak and then slowly coming

2530
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:07,210
down you instead have this slow the slow

2531
01:51:04,449 --> 01:51:09,939
pathway up and then the slow pathway

2532
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:12,819
down it'll tend to you know last for

2533
01:51:09,939 --> 01:51:15,069
longer and allow you to be more

2534
01:51:12,819 --> 01:51:16,539
productive right it's go so many pain

2535
01:51:15,069 --> 01:51:21,069
patients they still have got to go to

2536
01:51:16,539 --> 01:51:25,359
work and and and it's hard to titrate or

2537
01:51:21,069 --> 01:51:26,889
control your dosage when you're smoking

2538
01:51:25,359 --> 01:51:28,869
and so people are like oh I'm gonna

2539
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:30,670
smoke and then they're like [ __ ] now I

2540
01:51:28,869 --> 01:51:33,460
can't go to work so I'm freaking baked

2541
01:51:30,670 --> 01:51:36,100
you know and so for those for those

2542
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:39,159
folks they should definitely be aware

2543
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:41,680
that in addition to not scorching your

2544
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:43,779
lungs you know some of these other

2545
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:46,869
options that we're gonna talk about may

2546
01:51:43,779 --> 01:51:49,929
be better for you because they are going

2547
01:51:46,869 --> 01:51:52,180
to be less intoxicating right and so

2548
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:53,920
they're I think for all of these methods

2549
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:55,690
of administration there are really three

2550
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:58,119
major components that we can talk about

2551
01:51:55,689 --> 01:52:00,489
right where you're managing impairment

2552
01:51:58,119 --> 01:52:02,559
you're also talking about the onset of

2553
01:52:00,489 --> 01:52:04,899
the effect how quickly it works as well

2554
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:08,200
as the duration of the effect how long

2555
01:52:04,899 --> 01:52:11,409
it works so you know one other element

2556
01:52:08,199 --> 01:52:13,599
of you know pain relief is you know a

2557
01:52:11,409 --> 01:52:15,250
lot of chronic pain patients have a lot

2558
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:16,960
of trouble sleeping they

2559
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:19,060
a difficulty falling asleep because

2560
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:21,039
they're in pain they have difficulty

2561
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:22,420
staying asleep because their pain wakes

2562
01:52:21,039 --> 01:52:25,090
them up in the middle of the night and

2563
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:27,340
so just from a sleep management

2564
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:30,340
perspective smoking is probably not the

2565
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:33,100
best idea because the the peak the onset

2566
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:35,260
might be you know almost immediate but

2567
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:37,120
the duration of that effect is really

2568
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:39,190
not very much you know two to three

2569
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:41,019
hours if you're lucky so you really do

2570
01:52:39,189 --> 01:52:42,819
for something like you know where you

2571
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:43,900
need a long-term effect you know

2572
01:52:42,819 --> 01:52:46,119
something that's going to get you

2573
01:52:43,899 --> 01:52:47,589
through a good six hours smoking isn't

2574
01:52:46,119 --> 01:52:49,649
going to be the best for you because you

2575
01:52:47,590 --> 01:52:53,020
need something with a longer duration

2576
01:52:49,649 --> 01:52:54,489
you know just as a little side note one

2577
01:52:53,020 --> 01:52:58,060
of these days somebody's gonna figure

2578
01:52:54,489 --> 01:53:01,689
out a good way to do time Early's whole

2579
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:04,750
plant capsules and they're just gonna

2580
01:53:01,689 --> 01:53:06,579
crush the market because you know some

2581
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:08,560
people use and you know enteric capsules

2582
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:10,539
which help a little bit but most of the

2583
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:12,490
time to make something time released you

2584
01:53:10,539 --> 01:53:15,130
have to over process to the point that

2585
01:53:12,489 --> 01:53:17,380
it's not whole plant anymore but your

2586
01:53:15,130 --> 01:53:19,630
description is point right on point

2587
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:21,690
because so many pain patients they'll

2588
01:53:19,630 --> 01:53:23,680
they will they will take whatever

2589
01:53:21,689 --> 01:53:27,129
cannabis they they're gonna take in the

2590
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:28,329
evening and then by you know 2:00 2:30

2591
01:53:27,130 --> 01:53:29,890
in the morning

2592
01:53:28,329 --> 01:53:33,149
their pain is waking them back up again

2593
01:53:29,890 --> 01:53:37,210
and so they have to have strategies to

2594
01:53:33,149 --> 01:53:40,420
have a second dose on their nightstand

2595
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:42,579
which then occasionally in some people

2596
01:53:40,420 --> 01:53:45,100
with some cultivars make them feel a

2597
01:53:42,579 --> 01:53:48,309
little groggy in the morning but but at

2598
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:51,160
some point or worse where sometimes - it

2599
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:53,650
can cause tachycardia right so you know

2600
01:53:51,159 --> 01:53:55,840
what I mean by that is a racing heart so

2601
01:53:53,649 --> 01:53:58,689
ironically you're trying to go to sleep

2602
01:53:55,840 --> 01:54:01,600
and yet you you know inadvertently

2603
01:53:58,689 --> 01:54:03,699
consume a little bit too much THC causes

2604
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:06,220
this like sympathetic nervous system

2605
01:54:03,699 --> 01:54:09,279
reaction where your brain interprets you

2606
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:13,119
know a fast paced heartbeat as paranoia

2607
01:54:09,279 --> 01:54:14,949
and anxiety yeah I hate that and and

2608
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:16,359
also I guess it's worthwhile to point

2609
01:54:14,949 --> 01:54:19,630
out at least at least my understanding

2610
01:54:16,359 --> 01:54:21,839
is that the tachycardia is actually most

2611
01:54:19,630 --> 01:54:24,989
likely attributed to a particular

2612
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:28,860
terpene in the

2613
01:54:24,988 --> 01:54:31,289
and not THC directly and so if you use

2614
01:54:28,859 --> 01:54:35,670
cannabis and you do get the racing heart

2615
01:54:31,289 --> 01:54:38,578
which is something that I hate there are

2616
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:41,219
you know you need to try enough to find

2617
01:54:38,578 --> 01:54:43,229
out what the terpene is for you and

2618
01:54:41,219 --> 01:54:45,569
those plants and then and then avoid

2619
01:54:43,229 --> 01:54:47,158
those plants and I would say that this

2620
01:54:45,569 --> 01:54:49,500
is kind of the cutting edge of

2621
01:54:47,158 --> 01:54:51,509
understanding you know using whole

2622
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:53,219
flower and there's there's not a lot of

2623
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:55,679
research on it but I think there will be

2624
01:54:53,219 --> 01:54:58,710
soon I think you're right - but I do

2625
01:54:55,679 --> 01:55:00,658
think that you know the the patients who

2626
01:54:58,710 --> 01:55:03,469
use dronabinol which is the synthetic

2627
01:55:00,658 --> 01:55:06,509
form of THC you know they also

2628
01:55:03,469 --> 01:55:08,880
experience this so I think that there

2629
01:55:06,510 --> 01:55:10,440
probably is some interaction between you

2630
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:18,029
know just like all of our cannabinoids

2631
01:55:10,439 --> 01:55:20,129
and terpenoids and ingesting it by any

2632
01:55:18,029 --> 01:55:22,019
means you've got to find that personal

2633
01:55:20,130 --> 01:55:23,699
therapeutic window right you've got to

2634
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:26,550
take enough of the stuff to get your

2635
01:55:23,698 --> 01:55:28,559
good effect without taking so much that

2636
01:55:26,550 --> 01:55:29,909
you get a bad effect yeah I totally

2637
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,500
agree with you all right so that's

2638
01:55:29,908 --> 01:55:32,939
smoking let's talk well we've already

2639
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:35,969
talked quite a bit about tincture but

2640
01:55:32,939 --> 01:55:37,589
let's talk about tincture so you know a

2641
01:55:35,969 --> 01:55:38,969
lot of people like tincture is because

2642
01:55:37,590 --> 01:55:42,840
they feel much more in control right

2643
01:55:38,969 --> 01:55:44,550
with with smoking you know it's really

2644
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:47,250
hard to control how much you're actually

2645
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:50,010
going to take and with you know things

2646
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:53,189
like capsules you're kind of beholden to

2647
01:55:50,010 --> 01:55:55,500
whatever they put in the capsule but

2648
01:55:53,189 --> 01:55:57,899
with tinctures this is very much

2649
01:55:55,500 --> 01:56:01,770
individualized medicine you're able to

2650
01:55:57,899 --> 01:56:05,069
say okay you know this this lab tested

2651
01:56:01,770 --> 01:56:08,849
tincture I know the potency of it and so

2652
01:56:05,069 --> 01:56:11,309
I'm gonna slowly increase my my dosage

2653
01:56:08,849 --> 01:56:13,619
over the next few days and then I'm

2654
01:56:11,310 --> 01:56:15,900
gonna find my sweet spot and then I know

2655
01:56:13,618 --> 01:56:18,539
it's going to be you know X amount of a

2656
01:56:15,899 --> 01:56:20,638
dropper or X amount of you know drops

2657
01:56:18,539 --> 01:56:23,488
themselves so that you can get

2658
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:25,920
repeatable results and for me and that's

2659
01:56:23,488 --> 01:56:27,629
why I generally you know recommend

2660
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:30,989
tinctures for people because of the

2661
01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:33,539
patient control yeah I love tinctures

2662
01:56:30,988 --> 01:56:35,549
for several reasons one of them is that

2663
01:56:33,539 --> 01:56:36,890
you know like you said it does feel like

2664
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:39,710
medicine too

2665
01:56:36,890 --> 01:56:41,510
you know like for a lot of people my

2666
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:42,859
grandparents age you know I'm lucky

2667
01:56:41,510 --> 01:56:44,119
enough that my grandmother is still

2668
01:56:42,859 --> 01:56:46,579
alive

2669
01:56:44,119 --> 01:56:48,500
and you know like there's absolutely no

2670
01:56:46,579 --> 01:56:50,989
way like she would even use something

2671
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:52,850
that looked like inhaler to inhale

2672
01:56:50,989 --> 01:56:54,769
cannabinoids but a tincture like that

2673
01:56:52,850 --> 01:56:56,720
feels like medicine medicine to her so

2674
01:56:54,770 --> 01:56:58,850
she'll actually use it and you know you

2675
01:56:56,720 --> 01:57:02,329
can't benefit from a medicine that you

2676
01:56:58,850 --> 01:57:05,630
are opposed to using so there's that

2677
01:57:02,329 --> 01:57:08,510
component the easily titratable easily

2678
01:57:05,630 --> 01:57:10,819
do scible reliable results those are all

2679
01:57:08,510 --> 01:57:13,489
amazing the other thing that I like

2680
01:57:10,819 --> 01:57:15,349
about some of these teachers is that you

2681
01:57:13,489 --> 01:57:17,920
know depending on the formulation it can

2682
01:57:15,350 --> 01:57:20,140
act as somewhat of a hybrid between a

2683
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:23,239
product that's available both

2684
01:57:20,140 --> 01:57:25,010
immediately in your mouth and if you

2685
01:57:23,239 --> 01:57:26,539
swallow some of it and it does get all

2686
01:57:25,010 --> 01:57:28,430
the way through the liver then you have

2687
01:57:26,539 --> 01:57:31,159
you know like a two-for-one where you

2688
01:57:28,430 --> 01:57:33,680
have the immediate onset you know from

2689
01:57:31,159 --> 01:57:35,329
some of the THC to you know produce some

2690
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:37,579
sedation whereas you have that sort of

2691
01:57:35,329 --> 01:57:39,890
slow release effect from the from the

2692
01:57:37,579 --> 01:57:42,500
liver and the you know converting

2693
01:57:39,890 --> 01:57:45,800
delta-9 into other you know metabolites

2694
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:47,390
that gives you this more prolonged slow

2695
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:50,230
release effect so you have both

2696
01:57:47,390 --> 01:57:53,660
immediate onset in the long duration

2697
01:57:50,229 --> 01:57:56,029
which is you know really not achievable

2698
01:57:53,659 --> 01:57:58,159
through any other product one of the

2699
01:57:56,029 --> 01:58:00,590
things that I find very liberating about

2700
01:57:58,159 --> 01:58:04,670
tinctures is that even though there are

2701
01:58:00,590 --> 01:58:08,270
certainly you know artisan and craft

2702
01:58:04,670 --> 01:58:11,300
ways to make a good ethanol tincture

2703
01:58:08,270 --> 01:58:14,570
that is going to be potentially better

2704
01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:16,850
than you know a novice tincture maker I

2705
01:58:14,569 --> 01:58:19,099
like the fact that it is a process

2706
01:58:16,850 --> 01:58:21,289
that's available to everyone right

2707
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:23,570
anybody can grow their own cannabis

2708
01:58:21,289 --> 01:58:26,300
plants in their yard they can take the

2709
01:58:23,569 --> 01:58:28,909
flower they can pour you know Everclear

2710
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:32,270
ethanol over the top you know shake it

2711
01:58:28,909 --> 01:58:34,760
for 90 seconds strain it through a

2712
01:58:32,270 --> 01:58:36,470
coffee filter and guess what you just

2713
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:38,150
made your own tincture and sure there's

2714
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:39,650
there's you know there's fancier ways to

2715
01:58:38,149 --> 01:58:41,539
go about it by like freezing everything

2716
01:58:39,649 --> 01:58:43,939
first and all that kind of stuff but

2717
01:58:41,539 --> 01:58:46,579
essentially if you just pour ethanol

2718
01:58:43,939 --> 01:58:47,819
over your flower and strain it you have

2719
01:58:46,579 --> 01:58:50,929
made tincture

2720
01:58:47,819 --> 01:58:55,590
and depending on what state you live in

2721
01:58:50,929 --> 01:58:58,319
many many state cannabis labs will will

2722
01:58:55,590 --> 01:59:00,989
allow patients to get things tested and

2723
01:58:58,319 --> 01:59:04,049
so you can find out how strong what you

2724
01:59:00,988 --> 01:59:06,388
made is as well and I think that that

2725
01:59:04,050 --> 01:59:11,000
kind of I don't know I guess I'll call

2726
01:59:06,389 --> 01:59:13,710
it egalitarian mm-hmm pharmacology is

2727
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:17,250
something that's it's it's very

2728
01:59:13,710 --> 01:59:22,020
attractive to me because I I do not

2729
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:23,429
support the ivory tower medicine idea I

2730
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:24,989
mean I guess we already established that

2731
01:59:23,429 --> 01:59:27,300
with the whole citizen scientist thing

2732
01:59:24,988 --> 01:59:30,269
but tinker's are great because you can

2733
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:31,980
have control of your own health by

2734
01:59:30,270 --> 01:59:34,380
growing your own plant making your own

2735
01:59:31,979 --> 01:59:37,198
tincture and and now you are

2736
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:39,960
self-sufficient and it's wildly less

2737
01:59:37,198 --> 01:59:43,799
expensive than purchasing it either

2738
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:45,599
licensed or unlicensed totally I and I

2739
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:48,420
the word that I use for this is

2740
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:51,270
empowerment and I think that you know

2741
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:54,029
it's it's beyond just the not being

2742
01:59:51,270 --> 01:59:57,449
reliant upon someone else but there's

2743
01:59:54,029 --> 01:59:59,939
like when you see a project through from

2744
01:59:57,448 --> 02:00:01,589
beginning to end and I see this with my

2745
01:59:59,939 --> 02:00:05,009
trainees and my students all the time

2746
02:00:01,590 --> 02:00:07,650
you have investment in it when you you

2747
02:00:05,010 --> 02:00:09,840
know pop that seed when you drop that

2748
02:00:07,649 --> 02:00:12,029
clone in the soil when you are tending

2749
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:14,429
to that plant when you are you know

2750
02:00:12,029 --> 02:00:16,469
looking for signs of maturity when you

2751
02:00:14,429 --> 02:00:18,618
are harvesting it with your own hands

2752
02:00:16,469 --> 02:00:22,289
you know you have a lot invested in

2753
02:00:18,618 --> 02:00:25,889
yourself and all of those you know that

2754
02:00:22,289 --> 02:00:28,889
that whole process is supportive of your

2755
02:00:25,889 --> 02:00:32,250
health you know like that is you taking

2756
02:00:28,889 --> 02:00:33,750
your own health into your hands and you

2757
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:35,609
know we see this all the time in the

2758
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:39,689
pink clinic you know those people who

2759
02:00:35,609 --> 02:00:41,789
are able to you know take control of

2760
02:00:39,689 --> 02:00:43,799
their own lives and decide I am going to

2761
02:00:41,789 --> 02:00:45,569
do this for myself those aren't the

2762
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:46,980
people we see in the pain clinic because

2763
02:00:45,569 --> 02:00:49,948
they don't have any pain because they

2764
02:00:46,979 --> 02:00:52,379
have figured it out for themselves so

2765
02:00:49,948 --> 02:00:55,888
you know like this this this you know

2766
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:59,819
being invested in it has has sort of a

2767
02:00:55,889 --> 02:01:01,078
holistic support you know from a human

2768
02:00:59,819 --> 02:01:03,750
level

2769
02:01:01,078 --> 02:01:06,118
in addition to you also as a by-product

2770
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:08,639
are not reliant upon some you know like

2771
02:01:06,118 --> 02:01:12,179
commerce or pharmaceutical company or

2772
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:15,440
something so yeah I love that idea of

2773
02:01:12,179 --> 02:01:18,090
this pharmaceutical at Galit Arianism

2774
02:01:15,439 --> 02:01:21,479
okay let's talk about edibles because a

2775
02:01:18,090 --> 02:01:24,239
lot of people use edibles and swear by

2776
02:01:21,479 --> 02:01:26,279
them for their pain and pretty much you

2777
02:01:24,238 --> 02:01:28,500
know will express that they can't live

2778
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:30,899
without them but edibles are are a

2779
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:34,439
complex medicine and they've got pros

2780
02:01:30,899 --> 02:01:36,420
and cons so so let's start there what

2781
02:01:34,439 --> 02:01:38,578
are your general impressions of the

2782
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:40,349
efficacy of edibles and and when you do

2783
02:01:38,578 --> 02:01:43,828
recommend edibles what do you recommend

2784
02:01:40,349 --> 02:01:46,710
people try yeah so let's start with the

2785
02:01:43,828 --> 02:01:49,078
pros so clearly we have something that's

2786
02:01:46,710 --> 02:01:51,960
really easily doable just like we have

2787
02:01:49,078 --> 02:01:55,649
with tinctures you know it's pretty easy

2788
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:57,510
even if you have something that is you

2789
02:01:55,649 --> 02:01:59,729
know more than the dose that you would

2790
02:01:57,510 --> 02:02:01,920
prefer it can often be really easy to

2791
02:01:59,729 --> 02:02:04,109
divide that dose you know I am NOT a

2792
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:06,929
five milligram gummy person like two and

2793
02:02:04,109 --> 02:02:08,639
a half is just fine thank you so you

2794
02:02:06,929 --> 02:02:10,679
know that that's the benefit is that you

2795
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:13,440
have something that is easily doable

2796
02:02:10,679 --> 02:02:15,658
which means that a patient knows what to

2797
02:02:13,439 --> 02:02:18,808
expect there's some consistency in that

2798
02:02:15,658 --> 02:02:21,269
effect which is huge so I love that

2799
02:02:18,809 --> 02:02:24,570
about edibles is that it's easy to dose

2800
02:02:21,270 --> 02:02:27,150
and easy to divide doses the other thing

2801
02:02:24,569 --> 02:02:28,769
that I really like is the duration you

2802
02:02:27,149 --> 02:02:31,229
know because we're putting the

2803
02:02:28,770 --> 02:02:35,579
cannabinoids through the liver you are

2804
02:02:31,229 --> 02:02:39,328
you know recruiting the liver to prolong

2805
02:02:35,578 --> 02:02:41,519
the effects of the medicine and often

2806
02:02:39,328 --> 02:02:42,840
that can be extremely therapeutic if

2807
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:44,699
you've got to get all the way through a

2808
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:46,710
workday if you've got to get all the way

2809
02:02:44,698 --> 02:02:48,928
through a night of sleep you need a

2810
02:02:46,710 --> 02:02:50,849
slow-release formula you know something

2811
02:02:48,929 --> 02:02:54,359
that wears off in two to three hours is

2812
02:02:50,849 --> 02:02:57,719
not going to work for you so I like it

2813
02:02:54,359 --> 02:03:00,089
for the ability to dose and the ability

2814
02:02:57,719 --> 02:03:02,279
to last for a long time and that I could

2815
02:03:00,090 --> 02:03:03,809
see why patients would totally swear by

2816
02:03:02,279 --> 02:03:06,630
that because those are really important

2817
02:03:03,809 --> 02:03:07,920
components of medicine and and also you

2818
02:03:06,630 --> 02:03:12,270
know we talked about earlier about the

2819
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:13,750
smoking while certainly the the power of

2820
02:03:12,270 --> 02:03:16,780
edibles

2821
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:20,829
is is not to be scoffed at it's nice

2822
02:03:16,779 --> 02:03:23,590
because you don't go up as fast as you

2823
02:03:20,829 --> 02:03:25,569
do with smoking and so if you're looking

2824
02:03:23,590 --> 02:03:29,409
for pain relief and the anti

2825
02:03:25,569 --> 02:03:29,710
inflammation without the stony aspect of

2826
02:03:29,409 --> 02:03:32,829
it

2827
02:03:29,710 --> 02:03:35,439
edibles can often be a good choice they

2828
02:03:32,829 --> 02:03:38,319
can as long as you stay within your own

2829
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:40,000
therapeutic window so you know we talked

2830
02:03:38,319 --> 02:03:41,590
briefly about that before how you've got

2831
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,140
to take enough of it to feel something

2832
02:03:41,590 --> 02:03:46,529
but you can't take so much that you

2833
02:03:44,140 --> 02:03:48,730
start to experience negative effects and

2834
02:03:46,529 --> 02:03:51,189
unfortunately with edibles the

2835
02:03:48,729 --> 02:03:55,299
likelihood of experiencing a negative

2836
02:03:51,189 --> 02:03:57,069
effect it can be pretty high so if we

2837
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:57,850
look at the data that came out of

2838
02:03:57,069 --> 02:03:59,679
Colorado

2839
02:03:57,850 --> 02:04:01,930
you know when legalization first came

2840
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:03,300
around we saw that the vast majority of

2841
02:04:01,930 --> 02:04:06,130
people who came into the emergency

2842
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:07,510
departments after ingesting cannabis you

2843
02:04:06,130 --> 02:04:09,340
know they're having an acute psychotic

2844
02:04:07,510 --> 02:04:11,170
episode or they think they're gonna die

2845
02:04:09,340 --> 02:04:13,659
there's you know some kind of THC

2846
02:04:11,170 --> 02:04:16,930
overdose the vast majority of those

2847
02:04:13,659 --> 02:04:19,479
cases are edibles and part of the reason

2848
02:04:16,930 --> 02:04:22,690
for that is that in when you ingest

2849
02:04:19,479 --> 02:04:26,409
cannabis delta-9 is converted you know

2850
02:04:22,689 --> 02:04:29,919
Delta 9 THC is converted into 11 hydroxy

2851
02:04:26,409 --> 02:04:33,369
THC which is far more potent and it

2852
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:36,730
lasts for a very long time so you know

2853
02:04:33,369 --> 02:04:38,769
inhaling five milligrams of THC is not

2854
02:04:36,729 --> 02:04:40,779
at all the same thing as swallowing five

2855
02:04:38,770 --> 02:04:42,580
milligrams of THC because your liver

2856
02:04:40,779 --> 02:04:46,000
converts it into something that's more

2857
02:04:42,579 --> 02:04:48,029
powerful and lasts longer the other

2858
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:50,319
thing about the liver is that you know

2859
02:04:48,029 --> 02:04:54,579
everyone's liver is different you know

2860
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:56,889
the different effects of edibles say far

2861
02:04:54,579 --> 02:04:58,630
more about the differences in our livers

2862
02:04:56,890 --> 02:05:00,520
than they do about the difference in

2863
02:04:58,630 --> 02:05:03,449
manufacturing processes or the

2864
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:06,520
differences in the products themselves

2865
02:05:03,448 --> 02:05:09,429
you know the the enzymes within our

2866
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:11,500
liver that you know metabolize drugs and

2867
02:05:09,430 --> 02:05:13,719
and dump things into our bloodstream and

2868
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:16,000
protect us from toxins all of those

2869
02:05:13,719 --> 02:05:19,000
enzymes are proteins and those proteins

2870
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,760
are encoded by our DNA and our DNA is

2871
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:23,890
different you know drug metabolism is

2872
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:25,300
affected by other drugs that you're

2873
02:05:23,890 --> 02:05:27,520
taking other medications that you're

2874
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:29,110
taking it's affected by your diet

2875
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:32,050
affected by your exercise and your other

2876
02:05:29,109 --> 02:05:34,149
lifestyle components so you know that

2877
02:05:32,050 --> 02:05:36,550
for all of those reasons you know the

2878
02:05:34,149 --> 02:05:38,739
effects of an edible are not only you

2879
02:05:36,550 --> 02:05:42,340
know variable between people but also

2880
02:05:38,739 --> 02:05:44,800
variable within one person so although

2881
02:05:42,340 --> 02:05:47,079
yes it might be really easily to dose

2882
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:51,940
and it might last a long time there's

2883
02:05:47,079 --> 02:05:54,369
also some degree of risk there because

2884
02:05:51,939 --> 02:05:58,149
you're you're allowing your liver to

2885
02:05:54,369 --> 02:06:00,609
produce a very potent molecule and it

2886
02:05:58,149 --> 02:06:02,829
you could experience different effects

2887
02:06:00,609 --> 02:06:04,809
you know from day to day because of the

2888
02:06:02,829 --> 02:06:07,899
other you know sort of lifestyle factors

2889
02:06:04,810 --> 02:06:10,450
and this is such a challenge for for

2890
02:06:07,899 --> 02:06:12,759
pain patients who are new to cannabis

2891
02:06:10,449 --> 02:06:14,819
because you know what we're kind of

2892
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:17,829
teasing apart is actually a really

2893
02:06:14,819 --> 02:06:19,899
complex situation right where the that

2894
02:06:17,829 --> 02:06:22,779
the patient wants the cannabinoids and

2895
02:06:19,899 --> 02:06:24,879
so they take inedible because they

2896
02:06:22,779 --> 02:06:28,119
they're approachable and they're pretty

2897
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:32,680
easy to get in in legal states anyway

2898
02:06:28,119 --> 02:06:36,189
and but then if you take it and you take

2899
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:40,450
too much your your will call it over

2900
02:06:36,189 --> 02:06:43,059
Medicaid itself not only is it way more

2901
02:06:40,449 --> 02:06:45,489
intense because it's become 11 hydroxy

2902
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:49,780
but because your body is processing it

2903
02:06:45,489 --> 02:06:52,479
more slowly your bad experience lasts

2904
02:06:49,779 --> 02:06:54,369
longer - right like if you if you smoke

2905
02:06:52,479 --> 02:06:57,219
too much pot it's like oh alright well

2906
02:06:54,369 --> 02:06:59,199
you know I'm gonna go and sit in nature

2907
02:06:57,220 --> 02:07:01,420
and I'll be pretty good in about 45

2908
02:06:59,199 --> 02:07:02,889
minutes I just gonna go away and while

2909
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:05,409
you know it's gonna go away with an

2910
02:07:02,890 --> 02:07:08,590
edible - that could easily be 2 and a

2911
02:07:05,409 --> 02:07:11,529
half hours easily you're like damn and

2912
02:07:08,590 --> 02:07:14,470
so that will often scare people away

2913
02:07:11,529 --> 02:07:17,259
from cannabis medicine when it really

2914
02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:20,050
had nothing to do with the inherent

2915
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:26,010
value of cannabis medicine it had to do

2916
02:07:20,050 --> 02:07:31,480
with using edibles properly for pain

2917
02:07:26,010 --> 02:07:34,890
takes some pre education and then an

2918
02:07:31,479 --> 02:07:37,419
awareness to start at a low amount

2919
02:07:34,890 --> 02:07:40,419
absolutely and this this outage the

2920
02:07:37,420 --> 02:07:43,389
start low and go slow apply

2921
02:07:40,418 --> 02:07:47,139
absolutely the most to any product that

2922
02:07:43,389 --> 02:07:49,779
is ingested swallowed so you know it is

2923
02:07:47,139 --> 02:07:52,269
incredibly important to start you know

2924
02:07:49,779 --> 02:07:54,069
really really low and when we're working

2925
02:07:52,269 --> 02:07:56,050
with our chronic pain patients in

2926
02:07:54,069 --> 02:07:58,448
Philadelphia I have a collaboration with

2927
02:07:56,050 --> 02:08:00,909
Thomas Jefferson University and the

2928
02:07:58,448 --> 02:08:03,158
Rothman orthopaedic Institute when we're

2929
02:08:00,908 --> 02:08:04,808
working with our chronic pain patients

2930
02:08:03,158 --> 02:08:06,668
you know we're advising them if they're

2931
02:08:04,809 --> 02:08:08,939
gonna use an edible product a swallow'd

2932
02:08:06,668 --> 02:08:11,769
product to start at one milligram of THC

2933
02:08:08,939 --> 02:08:13,418
because there there really are some

2934
02:08:11,769 --> 02:08:16,809
individuals out there who are

2935
02:08:13,418 --> 02:08:18,668
hypersensitive to THC you know there's a

2936
02:08:16,809 --> 02:08:21,429
lot of variability some people can

2937
02:08:18,668 --> 02:08:23,198
tolerate an entire 100 milligram edible

2938
02:08:21,429 --> 02:08:25,748
you know to themselves and other

2939
02:08:23,198 --> 02:08:28,058
people's you know spin out into you know

2940
02:08:25,748 --> 02:08:32,158
total paranoia and psychosis at one

2941
02:08:28,059 --> 02:08:34,809
milligram so you know it's far more

2942
02:08:32,158 --> 02:08:37,688
conservative and it's it's you know

2943
02:08:34,809 --> 02:08:39,340
better to not take enough than it is to

2944
02:08:37,689 --> 02:08:41,559
take too much because you can always

2945
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:45,189
take more but you can never take less

2946
02:08:41,559 --> 02:08:46,689
especially with inedible and you know

2947
02:08:45,189 --> 02:08:52,179
while we're talking about liberation

2948
02:08:46,689 --> 02:08:55,809
medicine let's let's talk about ego and

2949
02:08:52,179 --> 02:08:59,498
being cool I want to make sure I point

2950
02:08:55,809 --> 02:09:01,989
out to patients that there's a certain

2951
02:08:59,498 --> 02:09:06,519
vibe within the cannabis scene that

2952
02:09:01,988 --> 02:09:09,998
taking more THC is cool and if you take

2953
02:09:06,519 --> 02:09:13,090
less you are somehow less than or a wuss

2954
02:09:09,998 --> 02:09:14,109
or you know have got baby lungs or you

2955
02:09:13,090 --> 02:09:18,699
know there's a lot of different ways

2956
02:09:14,109 --> 02:09:21,429
that people with high tolerances can

2957
02:09:18,698 --> 02:09:24,279
kind of dis people who take a small

2958
02:09:21,429 --> 02:09:27,309
amount but I want to encourage folks to

2959
02:09:24,279 --> 02:09:30,099
you know if if taking two point five

2960
02:09:27,309 --> 02:09:32,229
milligrams of THC which which most

2961
02:09:30,099 --> 02:09:35,139
people don't feel it at two point five

2962
02:09:32,229 --> 02:09:37,418
milligrams it's a it's a nice steady you

2963
02:09:35,139 --> 02:09:39,788
know three times a day anti-inflammatory

2964
02:09:37,418 --> 02:09:42,398
dose but you don't get intoxicated and

2965
02:09:39,788 --> 02:09:44,559
and I'll mention sometimes you know two

2966
02:09:42,399 --> 02:09:46,269
point five milligrams and someone in the

2967
02:09:44,559 --> 02:09:48,399
group I'm talking with will totally

2968
02:09:46,269 --> 02:09:50,590
scoff and they're like them all I take

2969
02:09:48,399 --> 02:09:52,360
you know twenty five milligrams

2970
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:54,119
you know six times a day and I'm like

2971
02:09:52,359 --> 02:09:56,579
I'm glad that you found

2972
02:09:54,119 --> 02:09:58,140
something that worked for you but you

2973
02:09:56,579 --> 02:10:01,529
know there are a lot of people myself

2974
02:09:58,140 --> 02:10:04,619
included if I took 25 milligrams like

2975
02:10:01,529 --> 02:10:07,710
I'm gonna have a bad day oh yeah like

2976
02:10:04,619 --> 02:10:08,729
like my you know I'm gonna you know you

2977
02:10:07,710 --> 02:10:10,649
know I don't know if I can call it so

2978
02:10:08,729 --> 02:10:13,709
far psychosis but I need to go lay down

2979
02:10:10,649 --> 02:10:18,379
and I'm going to be scared for a few

2980
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:21,239
hours and I hate it and so like you know

2981
02:10:18,380 --> 02:10:23,340
individualized medicine is very modern

2982
02:10:21,239 --> 02:10:26,670
and it's important for pain patients to

2983
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:29,060
remember that you need to start low and

2984
02:10:26,670 --> 02:10:33,289
you need to increase it slowly and

2985
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:35,850
comparing your dosage to anybody else

2986
02:10:33,289 --> 02:10:39,239
should not matter at all you've got

2987
02:10:35,850 --> 02:10:41,160
different number of you know you know

2988
02:10:39,239 --> 02:10:44,819
Canada cannabinoid receivers in your

2989
02:10:41,159 --> 02:10:48,349
body you your body is gonna process it

2990
02:10:44,819 --> 02:10:51,359
at a different rate there really is not

2991
02:10:48,350 --> 02:10:53,850
you know any kind of hard and fast

2992
02:10:51,359 --> 02:10:55,979
comparisons patients to patients you

2993
02:10:53,850 --> 02:10:58,680
might be able to get guidance from other

2994
02:10:55,979 --> 02:11:01,589
patients but understand that guidance

2995
02:10:58,680 --> 02:11:04,050
and then start at 1 milligram right so I

2996
02:11:01,590 --> 02:11:05,819
I love that you're bringing this up and

2997
02:11:04,050 --> 02:11:07,440
and I don't know at least from my

2998
02:11:05,819 --> 02:11:09,809
patients that I'm working with you know

2999
02:11:07,439 --> 02:11:12,000
like we we are seeing a whole lot of

3000
02:11:09,810 --> 02:11:14,250
people that are entirely cannabis naive

3001
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,430
so luckily you know they're not bringing

3002
02:11:14,250 --> 02:11:18,420
that kind of thinking we're that kind of

3003
02:11:16,430 --> 02:11:21,000
for lack of a better word much ease

3004
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:23,130
moment to the table you know it's

3005
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:26,220
entirely novel for them and they're just

3006
02:11:23,130 --> 02:11:28,230
looking to their doctors for help so you

3007
02:11:26,220 --> 02:11:30,270
know fortunately you know we can start

3008
02:11:28,229 --> 02:11:31,919
working with people with all of those

3009
02:11:30,270 --> 02:11:35,280
factors that you mentioned you know your

3010
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:37,199
individual experience and the beautiful

3011
02:11:35,279 --> 02:11:40,349
thing about this plant is that it is

3012
02:11:37,199 --> 02:11:44,489
dynamic enough that there is something

3013
02:11:40,350 --> 02:11:47,370
for pretty much everyone and I love the

3014
02:11:44,489 --> 02:11:50,729
idea of we're all unified in our process

3015
02:11:47,369 --> 02:11:53,460
but not necessarily in our dose or our

3016
02:11:50,729 --> 02:11:55,109
amount so our process is always the same

3017
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:57,090
we start somewhere

3018
02:11:55,109 --> 02:11:59,519
and we either have a good time and we

3019
02:11:57,090 --> 02:12:01,289
can keep going or we have a bad time and

3020
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:04,200
we have to back off and

3021
02:12:01,289 --> 02:12:06,390
the magnitude at which we increase or

3022
02:12:04,199 --> 02:12:09,000
the magnitude at which we decrease our

3023
02:12:06,390 --> 02:12:11,940
consumption or our frequency may vary

3024
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:14,310
but that's the process right and this is

3025
02:12:11,939 --> 02:12:16,379
something that we don't talk about in

3026
02:12:14,310 --> 02:12:19,020
you know all of the rest of allopathic

3027
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:21,750
medicine very much you know that this is

3028
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:23,970
true for lots of other drugs that people

3029
02:12:21,750 --> 02:12:26,970
go to the doctors for you know like some

3030
02:12:23,970 --> 02:12:30,240
people go for anxiety medication or a

3031
02:12:26,970 --> 02:12:32,130
tricyclic antidepressant and the doctor

3032
02:12:30,239 --> 02:12:33,899
tries you on one thing and it didn't

3033
02:12:32,130 --> 02:12:35,250
work so you switch to a different drug

3034
02:12:33,899 --> 02:12:36,509
and then you have to up the dose and

3035
02:12:35,250 --> 02:12:38,220
then it was too much so then you back

3036
02:12:36,510 --> 02:12:41,340
down the dose but the difference between

3037
02:12:38,220 --> 02:12:43,740
allopathic pharmaceuticals and cannabis

3038
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:45,840
is that instead of your doctor telling

3039
02:12:43,739 --> 02:12:47,489
you you're having a bad time let's do

3040
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:49,680
something different you have to pay

3041
02:12:47,489 --> 02:12:52,139
attention to yourself and look at your

3042
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:54,600
journal and say that didn't work for me

3043
02:12:52,140 --> 02:12:57,060
I need to do something different which

3044
02:12:54,600 --> 02:12:59,430
for some people can be incredibly

3045
02:12:57,060 --> 02:13:01,260
empowering and it can make all the

3046
02:12:59,430 --> 02:13:04,440
difference in the world in their health

3047
02:13:01,260 --> 02:13:06,720
but for other people who are really

3048
02:13:04,439 --> 02:13:08,279
accustomed to having their hands you

3049
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:10,530
know truly held by a healthcare

3050
02:13:08,279 --> 02:13:13,380
professional and putting all of their

3051
02:13:10,529 --> 02:13:15,300
trust and getting all 100% of their

3052
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:17,760
guidance about their health from you

3053
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:21,270
know a person in a white coat that can

3054
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:23,070
be really intimidating to have to say

3055
02:13:21,270 --> 02:13:25,320
like oh jeez I have to like figure out

3056
02:13:23,069 --> 02:13:27,599
all of this stuff by myself like this is

3057
02:13:25,319 --> 02:13:30,090
really overwhelming and I feel for that

3058
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:32,700
person it is absolutely true it is work

3059
02:13:30,090 --> 02:13:35,789
to try and find a place to start and

3060
02:13:32,699 --> 02:13:38,010
then you know fine-tune your own process

3061
02:13:35,789 --> 02:13:41,460
in accordance to your own body and your

3062
02:13:38,010 --> 02:13:43,920
own lifestyle needs so it can be a

3063
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:47,100
process but it can also be an incredibly

3064
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:48,810
rewarding process and bully for anybody

3065
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:51,390
in the audience who's new to cannabis

3066
02:13:48,810 --> 02:13:55,770
who is trying to you know transition

3067
02:13:51,390 --> 02:13:57,600
from opioids to cannabis who is saying

3068
02:13:55,770 --> 02:14:03,390
okay I need to get a good education

3069
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:07,740
first right because it's it's sad how

3070
02:14:03,390 --> 02:14:12,869
much of the licensed market cannabis

3071
02:14:07,739 --> 02:14:14,039
packaging and marketing is intended to

3072
02:14:12,869 --> 02:14:18,569
confuse

3073
02:14:14,039 --> 02:14:21,090
the buyer of what it actually is maybe

3074
02:14:18,569 --> 02:14:23,909
trying to sound like a product of higher

3075
02:14:21,090 --> 02:14:28,350
quality than it is or making claims that

3076
02:14:23,909 --> 02:14:30,359
are untrue and so when you when you take

3077
02:14:28,350 --> 02:14:34,530
your health into your own hands

3078
02:14:30,359 --> 02:14:37,469
and you do your research in advance you

3079
02:14:34,529 --> 02:14:39,840
are really doing yourself a service for

3080
02:14:37,470 --> 02:14:41,760
sure and that can be really hard you

3081
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:44,579
know like it's very difficult to know

3082
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:46,650
who to trust you know like this is on

3083
02:14:44,579 --> 02:14:48,539
the label that it relieves pain and then

3084
02:14:46,649 --> 02:14:50,699
it improves cognition or whatever it is

3085
02:14:48,539 --> 02:14:53,220
whatever it's on the label oh it was

3086
02:14:50,699 --> 02:14:55,769
formulated by a PhD therefore it's a

3087
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:57,780
good product you know like that all of

3088
02:14:55,770 --> 02:15:00,450
those things can be kind of deceiving

3089
02:14:57,779 --> 02:15:02,069
and it's I I do feel for people who are

3090
02:15:00,449 --> 02:15:04,649
you know just embarking on this journey

3091
02:15:02,069 --> 02:15:07,079
because it is a lot of homework and it

3092
02:15:04,649 --> 02:15:09,059
is a lot of time that not a lot of

3093
02:15:07,079 --> 02:15:11,729
people you know have the luxury of

3094
02:15:09,060 --> 02:15:14,070
navigating I've heard you use the term

3095
02:15:11,729 --> 02:15:15,899
science washing before and I and I got a

3096
02:15:14,069 --> 02:15:17,429
chuckle out of that and and you're

3097
02:15:15,899 --> 02:15:19,369
comparing it to like green washing right

3098
02:15:17,430 --> 02:15:22,980
things that are are faking being

3099
02:15:19,369 --> 02:15:26,399
environmental right and there's so much

3100
02:15:22,979 --> 02:15:28,889
like there's so many cannabis products

3101
02:15:26,399 --> 02:15:32,369
that are faking having a scientific

3102
02:15:28,890 --> 02:15:34,850
basis to them not cannabis itself which

3103
02:15:32,369 --> 02:15:38,670
has a scientific basis but that

3104
02:15:34,850 --> 02:15:41,130
particular method may not like be in

3105
02:15:38,670 --> 02:15:43,260
line with the science exactly like if

3106
02:15:41,130 --> 02:15:45,779
you have a vaporizer pen that has you

3107
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:48,090
know sleep in its you know branding or

3108
02:15:45,779 --> 02:15:51,239
or its effects you know like I think

3109
02:15:48,090 --> 02:15:54,060
that your listeners are would benefit

3110
02:15:51,239 --> 02:15:57,539
from you know applying some scientific

3111
02:15:54,060 --> 02:16:00,330
thinking to that you know how do you

3112
02:15:57,539 --> 02:16:02,850
know that it's good for sleep where did

3113
02:16:00,329 --> 02:16:04,979
you get your information how many people

3114
02:16:02,850 --> 02:16:08,460
tried it for how many people did it work

3115
02:16:04,979 --> 02:16:12,119
you know like where did the formula come

3116
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:13,829
from so you know like I I love the idea

3117
02:16:12,119 --> 02:16:16,890
of everyone being a little bit more

3118
02:16:13,829 --> 02:16:18,539
skeptical you know and and especially

3119
02:16:16,890 --> 02:16:21,510
when it comes to this kind of stuff you

3120
02:16:18,539 --> 02:16:23,519
know we we have been relying on the

3121
02:16:21,510 --> 02:16:26,010
pharmaceutical industry to you

3122
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:29,310
we trusted them to provide us with safe

3123
02:16:26,010 --> 02:16:32,280
medicine for a long time and it didn't

3124
02:16:29,310 --> 02:16:34,649
happen you know like we were extremely

3125
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:37,920
misled by the pharmaceutical industry

3126
02:16:34,649 --> 02:16:39,569
when it came to the opioids and I think

3127
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:40,710
it would behoove all of us to think a

3128
02:16:39,569 --> 02:16:42,599
little bit more critically and

3129
02:16:40,709 --> 02:16:45,629
skeptically about you know any kind of

3130
02:16:42,599 --> 02:16:47,549
claim that appears on some packaging so

3131
02:16:45,629 --> 02:16:50,449
I realize we've kind of set ourself up

3132
02:16:47,549 --> 02:16:52,558
right we've just spent this show

3133
02:16:50,450 --> 02:16:55,010
recommending that people try cannabis

3134
02:16:52,558 --> 02:16:57,718
instead of opioids and now we just said

3135
02:16:55,010 --> 02:16:59,639
you know there the market is full of

3136
02:16:57,718 --> 02:17:01,589
lies and you can't trust what's on the

3137
02:16:59,638 --> 02:17:04,768
shelves and the damn thing is is that

3138
02:17:01,590 --> 02:17:07,920
they're both true and and the best thing

3139
02:17:04,769 --> 02:17:10,829
that I recommend to people is you you

3140
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:12,899
know do your research on you know the

3141
02:17:10,829 --> 02:17:15,000
dosing protocol that you want to do for

3142
02:17:12,899 --> 02:17:17,549
yourself and then do some research

3143
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:21,269
beyond just talking to a budtender on

3144
02:17:17,549 --> 02:17:24,808
the product that you're gonna buy but

3145
02:17:21,269 --> 02:17:27,510
then also you know humans have been

3146
02:17:24,808 --> 02:17:30,239
using cannabis and you know smoking it

3147
02:17:27,510 --> 02:17:33,599
and making cannabis tinctures for for

3148
02:17:30,239 --> 02:17:37,110
thousands and thousands of years the new

3149
02:17:33,599 --> 02:17:40,829
cool hot fancy thing is not necessarily

3150
02:17:37,110 --> 02:17:43,650
better and if you're just starting out

3151
02:17:40,829 --> 02:17:45,090
and you don't have a very good [ __ ]

3152
02:17:43,649 --> 02:17:48,000
detector when it comes to cannabis

3153
02:17:45,090 --> 02:17:50,819
products I would always recommend to

3154
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:53,579
start with something that is more simple

3155
02:17:50,819 --> 02:17:56,909
than more fancy you know everybody was

3156
02:17:53,579 --> 02:17:59,159
all excited when water-soluble CBD

3157
02:17:56,909 --> 02:18:00,569
became available and they're like oh we

3158
02:17:59,159 --> 02:18:03,119
can put in all these beverages than I'm

3159
02:18:00,569 --> 02:18:05,579
gonna like what use does water soluble

3160
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:07,800
isolate have because I don't think it's

3161
02:18:05,579 --> 02:18:09,718
healthy to take isolate and you have to

3162
02:18:07,799 --> 02:18:13,079
over process it even more to make it

3163
02:18:09,718 --> 02:18:18,178
water soluble and and so you know maybe

3164
02:18:13,079 --> 02:18:20,479
maybe that makes me you know less cool

3165
02:18:18,179 --> 02:18:22,679
it certainly got rid of any soda

3166
02:18:20,479 --> 02:18:24,869
advertisers I would have gotten on the

3167
02:18:22,679 --> 02:18:28,739
show but I think that sometimes it's

3168
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:32,250
it's a you know better if you stick with

3169
02:18:28,739 --> 02:18:33,718
the basics yeah and you know I many

3170
02:18:32,250 --> 02:18:36,148
times before I have said

3171
02:18:33,718 --> 02:18:39,358
that you know we did phase 1 clinical

3172
02:18:36,148 --> 02:18:43,439
trials on cannabis 5,000 years ago in

3173
02:18:39,359 --> 02:18:46,679
China it's safe for most people you know

3174
02:18:43,439 --> 02:18:49,139
and now the question is is it effective

3175
02:18:46,679 --> 02:18:51,659
and I do think that we have a lot of

3176
02:18:49,138 --> 02:18:54,659
evidence to demonstrate that you know

3177
02:18:51,659 --> 02:18:57,599
cannabis is both a safe and effective

3178
02:18:54,659 --> 02:19:00,179
pain reliever for most people with

3179
02:18:57,599 --> 02:19:02,700
chronic pain we can't say that about

3180
02:19:00,179 --> 02:19:04,379
opioids we do know that it does work for

3181
02:19:02,700 --> 02:19:06,630
some people you know a very small

3182
02:19:04,379 --> 02:19:08,728
proportion of people it works over the

3183
02:19:06,629 --> 02:19:11,039
long term there are people who have been

3184
02:19:08,728 --> 02:19:12,778
on you know opioids for decades and it

3185
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:16,920
you know it's effective for them but

3186
02:19:12,779 --> 02:19:19,590
it's far the risk of you know physical

3187
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:21,210
dependence and the risk of overdose and

3188
02:19:19,590 --> 02:19:22,710
the risk of you know constipation

3189
02:19:21,209 --> 02:19:25,589
cognitive impairment and all these other

3190
02:19:22,709 --> 02:19:27,509
things it's greater than the you know

3191
02:19:25,590 --> 02:19:31,349
pain relief that results from engaging

3192
02:19:27,510 --> 02:19:34,920
with opioids where these two start to

3193
02:19:31,349 --> 02:19:37,529
interact is largely at a point where you

3194
02:19:34,920 --> 02:19:40,529
know patients all often get to a point

3195
02:19:37,529 --> 02:19:43,260
where their opioids are becoming more

3196
02:19:40,529 --> 02:19:45,029
difficult to obtain and when you have a

3197
02:19:43,260 --> 02:19:47,519
person who's physically dependent upon

3198
02:19:45,029 --> 02:19:50,760
an opioid they're kind of stuck they

3199
02:19:47,519 --> 02:19:55,469
need something to be introduced into

3200
02:19:50,760 --> 02:19:57,930
their body to feel normal and so a lot

3201
02:19:55,469 --> 02:19:59,549
of people have been using cannabis in

3202
02:19:57,930 --> 02:20:01,950
combination with their opioids

3203
02:19:59,549 --> 02:20:04,019
especially initially and you know my

3204
02:20:01,950 --> 02:20:05,550
work in academia has been supporting

3205
02:20:04,020 --> 02:20:08,220
this approach for a very long time

3206
02:20:05,549 --> 02:20:10,858
because we know you know at a very

3207
02:20:08,219 --> 02:20:12,840
fundamental mammalian level when you

3208
02:20:10,859 --> 02:20:15,420
have these compounds in your body at the

3209
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:17,430
same time they produce synergistic pain

3210
02:20:15,420 --> 02:20:19,590
relief that means a greater than

3211
02:20:17,430 --> 02:20:24,238
additive effect it's not two plus two

3212
02:20:19,590 --> 02:20:26,340
equals full or it's two plus two equals

3213
02:20:24,238 --> 02:20:28,109
in so when you have something like that

3214
02:20:26,340 --> 02:20:30,210
when you have a seven instead of a four

3215
02:20:28,109 --> 02:20:32,790
then you can back off on the doses of

3216
02:20:30,209 --> 02:20:34,528
each of those components so that you can

3217
02:20:32,790 --> 02:20:37,670
achieve the same level of pain relief

3218
02:20:34,529 --> 02:20:41,550
you had before at a much smaller dose

3219
02:20:37,670 --> 02:20:44,728
anything anything we can do to reduce

3220
02:20:41,549 --> 02:20:46,889
the dose of an opioid required to elicit

3221
02:20:44,728 --> 02:20:50,579
pain relief that is a really

3222
02:20:46,889 --> 02:20:54,389
thing and you know nothing no other no

3223
02:20:50,579 --> 02:20:57,299
single other drug no other law no

3224
02:20:54,389 --> 02:20:59,340
prescription drug monitoring program no

3225
02:20:57,299 --> 02:21:02,519
abuse deterrent formulation of a

3226
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:05,670
pharmaceutical no other intervention has

3227
02:21:02,520 --> 02:21:08,670
reduced the number of opioid overdose

3228
02:21:05,670 --> 02:21:13,799
deaths as much as legalizing cannabis

3229
02:21:08,670 --> 02:21:16,170
has reduced opioid deaths so you know

3230
02:21:13,799 --> 02:21:18,028
we're about to go into the how-to of

3231
02:21:16,170 --> 02:21:19,139
actually doing the transition because I

3232
02:21:18,029 --> 02:21:20,729
know you've given this a lot of thought

3233
02:21:19,139 --> 02:21:22,889
but before we go there there's one more

3234
02:21:20,728 --> 02:21:25,228
thing I want to hit on on the edibles

3235
02:21:22,889 --> 02:21:27,599
tip and that is you and I mentioned in

3236
02:21:25,228 --> 02:21:29,398
passing that that you know many folks

3237
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:31,500
they just stopped at two point five

3238
02:21:29,398 --> 02:21:33,629
milligrams because that gets that takes

3239
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:35,579
care of their pain and maybe if they

3240
02:21:33,629 --> 02:21:37,589
want to feel like a little jocular with

3241
02:21:35,579 --> 02:21:39,408
it they'll go up to five milligrams and

3242
02:21:37,590 --> 02:21:42,210
so they're getting some of the other

3243
02:21:39,408 --> 02:21:44,129
attributes of pain relief as well but

3244
02:21:42,209 --> 02:21:45,719
then you've got these people who have

3245
02:21:44,129 --> 02:21:48,750
got long-term chronic pain and they're

3246
02:21:45,719 --> 02:21:52,349
taking 100 milligram brownies and and

3247
02:21:48,750 --> 02:21:54,209
they're both pain patients like like I

3248
02:21:52,350 --> 02:21:54,930
know there's several different variables

3249
02:21:54,209 --> 02:21:56,608
at play

3250
02:21:54,930 --> 02:21:59,970
so I'll just toss it to you like that

3251
02:21:56,609 --> 02:22:01,829
and say like what's up with that well

3252
02:21:59,969 --> 02:22:04,260
one of the one of the fundamental things

3253
02:22:01,829 --> 02:22:07,920
there is tolerance which is you know

3254
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:12,568
both a tool and a hindrance so in order

3255
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:14,699
to reap the benefits of THC in cannabis

3256
02:22:12,568 --> 02:22:16,528
you you do have to have some degree of

3257
02:22:14,699 --> 02:22:18,960
tolerance so that you can widen your own

3258
02:22:16,529 --> 02:22:21,540
personal therapeutic window you can

3259
02:22:18,959 --> 02:22:24,719
widen the dose range at which you feel

3260
02:22:21,540 --> 02:22:26,819
something but you you can still fall

3261
02:22:24,719 --> 02:22:30,148
below the threshold of feeling bad

3262
02:22:26,818 --> 02:22:32,549
things so staying in that therapeutic

3263
02:22:30,148 --> 02:22:35,129
window is easier if you have some

3264
02:22:32,549 --> 02:22:37,379
tolerance to THC it's it's more

3265
02:22:35,129 --> 02:22:41,369
tolerable you have a wider window of

3266
02:22:37,379 --> 02:22:43,019
good effects the problem comes in and

3267
02:22:41,370 --> 02:22:45,300
this is something that you know we would

3268
02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:49,439
be wise not to repeat with the opioids

3269
02:22:45,299 --> 02:22:52,799
right it with with opioids no no doctor

3270
02:22:49,439 --> 02:22:54,870
ever told their patient hey this stuff

3271
02:22:52,799 --> 02:22:56,908
can produce physical dependence to

3272
02:22:54,870 --> 02:22:58,979
manage your physical dependence you

3273
02:22:56,908 --> 02:23:00,689
should monitor your tolerance if you

3274
02:22:58,978 --> 02:23:03,809
find yourself taking more

3275
02:23:00,689 --> 02:23:05,309
or more frequently take a break switch

3276
02:23:03,809 --> 02:23:07,828
to something else for a couple of days

3277
02:23:05,309 --> 02:23:11,158
allow your body to reset and come back

3278
02:23:07,828 --> 02:23:13,049
to it that could have saved thousands of

3279
02:23:11,158 --> 02:23:14,699
people's lives but we never had that

3280
02:23:13,049 --> 02:23:17,099
conversation but with our opioid

3281
02:23:14,699 --> 02:23:19,050
consuming patients this is one thing

3282
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:21,359
that we can we have the opportunity to

3283
02:23:19,049 --> 02:23:23,998
do right with cannabis we can have that

3284
02:23:21,359 --> 02:23:25,709
exact conversation this is a substance

3285
02:23:23,998 --> 02:23:27,510
that you can develop physical dependence

3286
02:23:25,709 --> 02:23:29,399
it's rewarding you could you know

3287
02:23:27,510 --> 02:23:32,728
develop some kind of cannabis use

3288
02:23:29,398 --> 02:23:34,769
disorder or hyperemesis or some other

3289
02:23:32,728 --> 02:23:38,099
dysregulation in your endocannabinoid

3290
02:23:34,770 --> 02:23:40,709
system it's prudent to take a break from

3291
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:43,859
time to time not only to allow your body

3292
02:23:40,709 --> 02:23:45,959
to resent eyes but if you are able to

3293
02:23:43,859 --> 02:23:48,119
take those periodic tolerance breaks

3294
02:23:45,959 --> 02:23:49,949
you're able to reset eyes to a point

3295
02:23:48,119 --> 02:23:52,140
where you don't need a hundred

3296
02:23:49,949 --> 02:23:54,359
milligrams in order to feel that effect

3297
02:23:52,139 --> 02:23:57,148
that you felt on Friday night you know

3298
02:23:54,359 --> 02:24:00,359
it is a far more economical approach to

3299
02:23:57,148 --> 02:24:03,059
take tolerance breaks reduce the amount

3300
02:24:00,359 --> 02:24:06,238
that is required to elicit that same

3301
02:24:03,059 --> 02:24:09,090
effect for pain patients who have pain

3302
02:24:06,238 --> 02:24:12,719
every day the and who have transition to

3303
02:24:09,090 --> 02:24:15,658
cannabis what do you tell them to do on

3304
02:24:12,719 --> 02:24:17,398
those tolerance break days because you

3305
02:24:15,658 --> 02:24:20,340
know so many of the pain patients I

3306
02:24:17,398 --> 02:24:23,309
talked to the idea of taking a tolerance

3307
02:24:20,340 --> 02:24:25,859
break and experiencing 48 hours of their

3308
02:24:23,309 --> 02:24:29,129
pain straight just makes them cry and

3309
02:24:25,859 --> 02:24:33,869
and they they want to avoid that at all

3310
02:24:29,129 --> 02:24:35,788
costs yeah I mean like to be quite frank

3311
02:24:33,869 --> 02:24:38,760
I don't tell them anything because

3312
02:24:35,789 --> 02:24:40,709
people are very resourceful in figuring

3313
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:42,449
out what's gonna work best for them a

3314
02:24:40,709 --> 02:24:44,689
lot of people you know turn to other

3315
02:24:42,449 --> 02:24:46,408
kinds of pain therapies

3316
02:24:44,689 --> 02:24:48,539
anti-inflammatories you know the

3317
02:24:46,408 --> 02:24:50,340
non-steroidal ones you know some of them

3318
02:24:48,539 --> 02:24:52,680
might take an opioid for a couple of

3319
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:55,289
days because I mean like the risk with

3320
02:24:52,680 --> 02:24:57,328
opioids is over the long term where they

3321
02:24:55,289 --> 02:24:59,069
where they increase risk where they lose

3322
02:24:57,328 --> 02:25:01,020
their efficacy is when you take them

3323
02:24:59,068 --> 02:25:04,198
chronically but if you're only taking

3324
02:25:01,020 --> 02:25:05,578
you know opioids for two days that's

3325
02:25:04,199 --> 02:25:08,489
exactly what they were designed for

3326
02:25:05,578 --> 02:25:10,170
short-term use so some of them switch

3327
02:25:08,488 --> 02:25:12,898
back to opioids some of them you know

3328
02:25:10,170 --> 02:25:14,159
just you know rely on meditation and

3329
02:25:12,898 --> 02:25:16,680
cognitive sort of

3330
02:25:14,159 --> 02:25:18,780
techniques there in fact digital health

3331
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:21,180
technologies and apps that people can

3332
02:25:18,780 --> 02:25:23,790
download to you know sort of go through

3333
02:25:21,180 --> 02:25:25,800
practices daily to cognitively manage

3334
02:25:23,790 --> 02:25:27,870
their pain so you know I know

3335
02:25:25,799 --> 02:25:29,969
unfortunately I don't need to have those

3336
02:25:27,870 --> 02:25:32,040
conversations frankly at all because

3337
02:25:29,969 --> 02:25:33,569
people are very resourceful in figuring

3338
02:25:32,040 --> 02:25:34,980
out how can I just get through a couple

3339
02:25:33,569 --> 02:25:37,799
of days and it's different for everyone

3340
02:25:34,979 --> 02:25:39,209
it just makes me sad when when they

3341
02:25:37,799 --> 02:25:41,009
don't want to go back to the opiate

3342
02:25:39,209 --> 02:25:43,919
because maybe they had a challenge with

3343
02:25:41,010 --> 02:25:45,239
it before and then they are on cannabis

3344
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:47,819
and they know they need to take of the

3345
02:25:45,239 --> 02:25:51,329
break so either a they resist taking a

3346
02:25:47,819 --> 02:25:54,060
tolerance break because they are afraid

3347
02:25:51,329 --> 02:25:56,521
of those days off or as I see so common

3348
02:25:54,060 --> 02:25:58,440
they just turn to alcohol and so they're

3349
02:25:56,521 --> 02:25:59,790
sloshed for two days and then they come

3350
02:25:58,440 --> 02:26:03,120
back and I just wish there were more

3351
02:25:59,790 --> 02:26:05,670
options I do too and you know what I

3352
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:08,460
feel like this is going to be you know I

3353
02:26:05,670 --> 02:26:11,250
I would hope that as this you know

3354
02:26:08,459 --> 02:26:13,949
chronic pain management with cannabis

3355
02:26:11,250 --> 02:26:15,659
becomes more mainstream that we will

3356
02:26:13,950 --> 02:26:18,870
have more of our best and brightest

3357
02:26:15,659 --> 02:26:21,119
minds in clinical practice and in

3358
02:26:18,870 --> 02:26:23,700
scientific development that we will have

3359
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:26,460
some answers for people all right so

3360
02:26:23,700 --> 02:26:30,900
let's get down to the brass tacks of

3361
02:26:26,459 --> 02:26:35,579
actually transitioning so you know going

3362
02:26:30,899 --> 02:26:38,879
cold turkey on opioids can be not only

3363
02:26:35,579 --> 02:26:41,909
difficult but dangerous and there are

3364
02:26:38,879 --> 02:26:44,250
definitely advantages of doing kind of

3365
02:26:41,909 --> 02:26:46,200
like a measured transition but I know

3366
02:26:44,250 --> 02:26:48,021
you've developed this out in detail so

3367
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:51,870
so why don't you tell us your

3368
02:26:48,021 --> 02:26:54,210
recommendations eighty-four for transit

3369
02:26:51,870 --> 02:26:58,710
for the actual transition time the

3370
02:26:54,209 --> 02:27:00,989
process again is very different for

3371
02:26:58,709 --> 02:27:03,089
every patient and also just because

3372
02:27:00,989 --> 02:27:05,459
you're on an opioid doesn't mean that

3373
02:27:03,090 --> 02:27:07,290
you're on the same opioid as anyone else

3374
02:27:05,459 --> 02:27:09,719
who is going to the same pain clinic

3375
02:27:07,290 --> 02:27:12,570
so there are short-acting opioids and

3376
02:27:09,719 --> 02:27:14,699
longer-acting opioid drugs which all

3377
02:27:12,569 --> 02:27:17,810
have their different profiles in terms

3378
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:21,030
of how rapidly you can taper off of them

3379
02:27:17,810 --> 02:27:24,270
so again this is where the personalized

3380
02:27:21,030 --> 02:27:26,689
component is critical you know we've

3381
02:27:24,271 --> 02:27:29,418
been attempting to develop

3382
02:27:26,689 --> 02:27:31,939
opioid tapering protocol for a number of

3383
02:27:29,418 --> 02:27:33,498
years and we make some observations one

3384
02:27:31,939 --> 02:27:36,408
of which is if we tell a patient

3385
02:27:33,498 --> 02:27:38,718
absolutely nothing by the three-month

3386
02:27:36,408 --> 02:27:40,968
mark they have just sort of figured out

3387
02:27:38,718 --> 02:27:43,698
how to take half as many opioids or get

3388
02:27:40,968 --> 02:27:45,019
off of them entirely on their own so

3389
02:27:43,699 --> 02:27:47,209
again this kind of comes back to the

3390
02:27:45,020 --> 02:27:49,640
self empowering component where you know

3391
02:27:47,209 --> 02:27:52,579
people are perfectly capable of figuring

3392
02:27:49,639 --> 02:27:54,648
things out for themselves you know like

3393
02:27:52,578 --> 02:27:56,658
if if you need some strategies

3394
02:27:54,648 --> 02:27:58,759
specifically for doing that what we

3395
02:27:56,658 --> 02:28:01,759
found is that a lot of patients just

3396
02:27:58,759 --> 02:28:05,238
start by eliminating one of their daily

3397
02:28:01,759 --> 02:28:07,520
doses so a really common one that people

3398
02:28:05,238 --> 02:28:10,488
eliminate is the one right before bed so

3399
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:13,069
if they switch to some kind of ingested

3400
02:28:10,488 --> 02:28:15,350
or swallowed preparation of cannabis

3401
02:28:13,068 --> 02:28:17,568
right before bed they no longer need

3402
02:28:15,350 --> 02:28:19,578
their overnight dose of their opioids so

3403
02:28:17,568 --> 02:28:22,248
that's probably the most common one to

3404
02:28:19,578 --> 02:28:25,309
skip the dose of the opioid that's taken

3405
02:28:22,248 --> 02:28:27,068
right before bed and then often a lot of

3406
02:28:25,309 --> 02:28:29,238
patients wake up feeling refreshed

3407
02:28:27,068 --> 02:28:31,998
having slept through the whole night

3408
02:28:29,238 --> 02:28:35,809
without having that heavy sort of

3409
02:28:31,998 --> 02:28:39,939
sedation and the almost a hangover from

3410
02:28:35,809 --> 02:28:42,798
the heavier narcotics and just that that

3411
02:28:39,939 --> 02:28:44,568
cognitive state alone is able to get

3412
02:28:42,799 --> 02:28:47,929
them through the day so that they're

3413
02:28:44,568 --> 02:28:49,278
able to walk beside their pain and you

3414
02:28:47,929 --> 02:28:51,529
know live in the presence of the pain

3415
02:28:49,279 --> 02:28:54,799
rather than trying to totally numb it

3416
02:28:51,529 --> 02:28:57,379
with their next dose of their opioid so

3417
02:28:54,799 --> 02:28:59,600
those are those are my practical ones

3418
02:28:57,379 --> 02:29:01,609
and then I would also you know again

3419
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:03,828
advocate for the personalized component

3420
02:29:01,609 --> 02:29:06,140
which is do what is right for you you

3421
02:29:03,828 --> 02:29:09,020
know a lot of patients will do just fine

3422
02:29:06,139 --> 02:29:10,698
on you know like one or two doses of

3423
02:29:09,020 --> 02:29:13,520
their opioid every day a lot of people

3424
02:29:10,699 --> 02:29:14,989
can you know decide that they don't want

3425
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:17,119
to be reliant on this anymore and

3426
02:29:14,988 --> 02:29:19,968
they're willing to you know have a

3427
02:29:17,119 --> 02:29:21,679
little bit you know because the thing

3428
02:29:19,968 --> 02:29:24,978
about cannabis is that it doesn't

3429
02:29:21,679 --> 02:29:27,318
profoundly eliminate the pain the way

3430
02:29:24,978 --> 02:29:30,798
that an opioid does but it certainly

3431
02:29:27,318 --> 02:29:33,588
profoundly improves the quality of life

3432
02:29:30,799 --> 02:29:36,140
so for some people the physical

3433
02:29:33,588 --> 02:29:38,689
sensation of the pain is so intense that

3434
02:29:36,139 --> 02:29:40,579
they just can't ever get away from it

3435
02:29:38,689 --> 02:29:43,370
they're always going to be consuming

3436
02:29:40,579 --> 02:29:45,260
Oh Pio it's not fine if that's what your

3437
02:29:43,370 --> 02:29:47,690
body needs in order for you to have a

3438
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:49,370
high quality of life then shoot for that

3439
02:29:47,690 --> 02:29:52,010
but that's that's really what it boils

3440
02:29:49,370 --> 02:29:55,660
down to is figuring out what your own

3441
02:29:52,010 --> 02:29:58,521
personal priorities are and utilizing

3442
02:29:55,659 --> 02:30:00,440
cannabis in combination with and

3443
02:29:58,521 --> 02:30:03,470
eventually you know for some people

3444
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:06,021
potentially in substitution for the

3445
02:30:03,469 --> 02:30:08,539
opioids I think that patients who are

3446
02:30:06,021 --> 02:30:12,650
going through that transition they

3447
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:14,180
really need to they really could I'm

3448
02:30:12,649 --> 02:30:16,909
doing need and should I'm like oh these

3449
02:30:14,180 --> 02:30:19,010
are not good words it is described to me

3450
02:30:16,909 --> 02:30:21,889
often by patients that they think it's

3451
02:30:19,010 --> 02:30:24,649
going to be worse than it is and that

3452
02:30:21,889 --> 02:30:27,189
the transition becomes easier for even

3453
02:30:24,649 --> 02:30:31,489
very simple things like you know part of

3454
02:30:27,190 --> 02:30:32,840
part of taking Delta 9 THC is it can

3455
02:30:31,489 --> 02:30:35,299
cause a you know a little bit of

3456
02:30:32,840 --> 02:30:37,190
cascading forgetfulness that the kind of

3457
02:30:35,299 --> 02:30:37,879
thing where we joke as cannabis people

3458
02:30:37,190 --> 02:30:39,890
like Oh

3459
02:30:37,879 --> 02:30:42,500
forgot where my car keys were right just

3460
02:30:39,889 --> 02:30:44,840
basic stuff like that and so many

3461
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:48,200
patients there they're so used to taking

3462
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:49,940
their opioids on a schedule and that if

3463
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:52,311
they aren't on their schedule they're

3464
02:30:49,940 --> 02:30:54,980
afraid that their pain will flare up but

3465
02:30:52,310 --> 02:30:58,369
then they start incorporating cannabis

3466
02:30:54,979 --> 02:31:00,260
alongside the opioids and a little bit

3467
02:30:58,370 --> 02:31:02,420
of the pain relief kicks in that's

3468
02:31:00,260 --> 02:31:05,300
natural but also a little bit of that

3469
02:31:02,420 --> 02:31:08,271
that forgetfulness comes involved as

3470
02:31:05,299 --> 02:31:10,969
well and they actually forget that

3471
02:31:08,271 --> 02:31:13,159
they're in pain or they forget to take

3472
02:31:10,969 --> 02:31:16,069
their dose and they realized oh my gosh

3473
02:31:13,159 --> 02:31:19,250
you know I've naturally started

3474
02:31:16,069 --> 02:31:22,670
replacing the opioids opioids just

3475
02:31:19,250 --> 02:31:24,379
because of the nature of cannabis mm-hmm

3476
02:31:22,670 --> 02:31:26,540
yeah that's that's absolutely true I

3477
02:31:24,379 --> 02:31:28,569
think that's been reflected in some of

3478
02:31:26,540 --> 02:31:32,720
our anecdotes that we hear in the clinic

3479
02:31:28,569 --> 02:31:35,899
you know and and again like this this is

3480
02:31:32,719 --> 02:31:37,369
like to each their own you know for for

3481
02:31:35,899 --> 02:31:38,930
a lot of our patients you know more than

3482
02:31:37,370 --> 02:31:41,570
half of our patients don't experience

3483
02:31:38,930 --> 02:31:43,970
any impairment whatsoever and for those

3484
02:31:41,569 --> 02:31:46,310
that do experience some impairment they

3485
02:31:43,969 --> 02:31:48,289
either doesn't affect their day or

3486
02:31:46,310 --> 02:31:50,959
they're more willing to deal with the

3487
02:31:48,290 --> 02:31:53,060
impairment than they are to deal with

3488
02:31:50,959 --> 02:31:56,179
their opioid side-effects

3489
02:31:53,059 --> 02:31:58,908
well this is all fantastic 80 thank you

3490
02:31:56,180 --> 02:32:01,279
so much for taking your time - well

3491
02:31:58,908 --> 02:32:03,048
actually a lot more time than we had we

3492
02:32:01,279 --> 02:32:04,100
had planned on we actually got on a roll

3493
02:32:03,049 --> 02:32:06,890
this is a lot of really great

3494
02:32:04,100 --> 02:32:09,140
information but but I thank you so much

3495
02:32:06,889 --> 02:32:11,778
for sharing you know the caring that you

3496
02:32:09,139 --> 02:32:14,180
have for patience and your in-depth

3497
02:32:11,779 --> 02:32:16,970
scientific research because I think that

3498
02:32:14,180 --> 02:32:20,689
you know there's so much in our scene

3499
02:32:16,969 --> 02:32:23,208
which is you know anecdotal evidence and

3500
02:32:20,689 --> 02:32:25,270
people sharing only what worked for them

3501
02:32:23,209 --> 02:32:29,329
and then a whole bunch of kind of like

3502
02:32:25,270 --> 02:32:32,270
myth and taboo left over from from the

3503
02:32:29,328 --> 02:32:34,189
reefer madness days and I think that you

3504
02:32:32,270 --> 02:32:36,949
know people like you doing the real

3505
02:32:34,189 --> 02:32:39,619
research and then you know interacting

3506
02:32:36,949 --> 02:32:42,949
with patients and then coming out and

3507
02:32:39,619 --> 02:32:45,020
sharing the reality of what they can do

3508
02:32:42,949 --> 02:32:47,539
to save themselves is really important

3509
02:32:45,020 --> 02:32:50,689
well Shango it's an honor and a

3510
02:32:47,539 --> 02:32:53,149
privilege to do this work and I feel I'm

3511
02:32:50,689 --> 02:32:54,918
very strongly about sharing the work as

3512
02:32:53,148 --> 02:32:56,418
widely as possible so thank you so much

3513
02:32:54,918 --> 02:32:57,168
for the opportunity to share it with

3514
02:32:56,418 --> 02:32:59,600
your audience

3515
02:32:57,168 --> 02:33:02,959

3516
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:04,430
more about 80 there's a couple different

3517
02:33:02,959 --> 02:33:06,560
ways to do it first of all I recommend

3518
02:33:04,430 --> 02:33:08,898

but there's also a bunch of stuff she

3531
02:33:37,309 --> 02:33:42,439
covered there that we did not cover and

3532
02:33:39,408 --> 02:33:46,488
it's got pictures so that's great

3533
