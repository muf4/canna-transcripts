1
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,779
I was actually going to do a slide on

2
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:16,530
this I haven't got a gun yet that is

3
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:19,649
actually a little

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:23,429
you know the tombstone with hid r.i.p on

5
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:25,709
it because really as of this year pretty

6
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:29,129
much all of your your top flight led

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,399
companies are all at 2.2 2.3 2.4 even

8
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:35,129
2.5 microns on Jul there are 25 to 40%

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,140
more efficient electrically than HP s so

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,420
it's really the kind of the death knell

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,549
of hid for at least people they can't

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,129
afford either one I mean obviously there

13
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:45,869
are situations where you can but if you

14
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,000
have the money for either one

15
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,619
the LEDs really do outperform them in

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
pretty much every category whether it be

17
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:54,469
yield or efficiency whatever you name it

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,308
they're they're superior at this point

19
00:00:54,469 --> 00:01:00,780
so I'm kind of blow through here real

20
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:02,969
quickly some of the earlier parts

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,769
understanding HID lamps a lot of people

22
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,019
will hear about ceramic metal halide

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,100
lamps they'll try and portray them as

24
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:09,629
something different than the metal

25
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,109
halide lamp there's really no difference

26
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:15,269
in a ceramic metal halide lamp the only

27
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:16,978
change is they change this inner tube in

28
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,899
here to ceramic the same kind of glass

29
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:20,429
that they have in hid lamp what that

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,780
allowed them to do was put a lot more of

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,210
the red halide to meet the red halides

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,649
more stable so the lamp would preserve

33
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,209
that red color a long time if you

34
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:29,159
remember the old metal halides would

35
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:30,390
always go green whenever the lamp would

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,969
get old and that's because that red

37
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,250
halide is very reactive number one and

38
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:37,679
number two it actually can permeate

39
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,359
through the glass so the ceramic tube

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,820
made the ceramic metal halide much more

41
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,709
stable color stable I was originally

42
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,868
developed for them for the film industry

43
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:51,149
but it got translated into the to the

44
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:55,200
horticultural industry so this shows you

45
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:59,789
a hid a lot of your HID systems you'll

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:03,899
notice have a dimmable knob on your on

47
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:07,349
your on your ballast the problem is hid

48
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,909
high pressure sodium is why it's called

49
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:10,919
high pressure sodium the reason is the

50
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:12,900
pressure of that lamp actually affects

51
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,609
the spectrum of it as you look at this

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,960
this is the lamp this is from the

53
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,080
original papers written by the guys who

54
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,780
invented the HBS lamp back in 1953 or

55
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,890
something 57 and you'll notice this is

56
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,598
that like 200 watts 400 watt 600 watts

57
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:29,158
I'm a 600 watt lamp you'll notice that

58
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,738
almost all the powers right at the

59
00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:33,299
sodium band which is this yellow band as

60
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,739
it gets is you increase the pressure

61
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,629
you'll notice that more of the energy

62
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,459
keeps getting squashed to the sides and

63
00:02:36,628 --> 00:02:41,370
interestingly right around the sodium

64
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:44,670
band it starts to drop so the problem

65
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:47,640
with dimming and HPS lamb is that as you

66
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,919
dim it it goes this way okay so you're

67
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,378
why if you dim your H gives lamp 20 or

68
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,289
30 percent you may be getting 40 or 50

69
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:56,459
percent less photosynthetic ending

70
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:58,679
photosynthetically active energy because

71
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,658
this area here is really the only

72
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,519
efficient photosynthetic energy in them

73
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:04,139
and the light the green yellow is about

74
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,539
40 percent less efficient I'll get into

75
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,848
that a little bit later but that's why

76
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,259
it's not a good idea to dim either metal

77
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:13,500
halides or high pressure sodium

78
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:15,658
whereas LEDs can dim absolutely

79
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,009
perfectly there's no there's no change

80
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:19,109
the efficiencies effect to get more

81
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:24,060
efficient when you dim them and the

82
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:27,180
spectrum doesn't change at all so again

83
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,979
as I as I mentioned this is really the

84
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,769
area where you're going to tie into the

85
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:34,048
chlorophyll peaks this area here this

86
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,938
area here is really somewhere the range

87
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,700
of about 40% less efficient in terms of

88
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:43,009
actual photosynthetic ekta output the

89
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:45,899
green yellow region again that's the

90
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:47,310
double-ended lamps if the difference

91
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,079
what happened in double-ended lamps is

92
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,890
basically they made the lamp a lot

93
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,989
smaller the arc path got shorter so that

94
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:58,318
the stability of the arc path was better

95
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,569
than gain to maybe 10% 15% in the lamp

96
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,339
design but the reason the biggest reason

97
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:03,988
why double-ended lamps are so much more

98
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,239
efficient now is actually fixture

99
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,670
savings the old fixtures were incredibly

100
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,799
inefficient that glass lenses a lot of

101
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,979
Muslim prayer cold the reflectors were

102
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,230
not well designed now kavita literally

103
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,120
with this double ended lamp it got as

104
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,670
the lamp gets smaller the smaller that

105
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,780
arc path gets the easier it is to get

106
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,430
all the photons out

107
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,769
fixture in one bounce that's your goal

108
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,750
in designing a reflective fixture is to

109
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:29,729
try and have every single photon that's

110
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,069
going backwards it's not going out the

111
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,960
front come out of that fixture in one

112
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:36,240
bounce and by getting the lamp very

113
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,189
small the arc path very small with a

114
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,530
really highly well designed fixture with

115
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:41,759
no lens on it you're able to do that so

116
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:43,500
the view has literally gotten those

117
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,349
fixture efficiencies up to around 95%

118
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,850
where they used to be maybe 80 or 75% so

119
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,830
that's where you believe it or not

120
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,560
that's the big advantage in these new

121
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:53,819
double-ended lamps was the advantage the

122
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,410
fixture efficiencies were so

123
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:56,310
dramatically higher than any of the

124
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,260
stuff that you were seeing with the

125
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,209
single-ended lamps same with the ceramic

126
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,459
metal halide not only are the lamps a

127
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:03,989
little more efficient but the fixtures

128
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:07,829
are dramatically more efficient than

129
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:12,060
they used to be so again the whole idea

130
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:13,349
of LEDs is to try and I mean of fixture

131
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,449
efficiency is trying to get that light

132
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,490
out in one bounce so this is a really

133
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,719
rudimentary reflector you could see

134
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,340
where you might have to bounce 2 or 3

135
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,479
times to get out of there so one thing

136
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,750
you want to remember when you're talking

137
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,789
about HID lamps is if they rate 20,000

138
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,339
hours of 10,000 hours on the lamp that's

139
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,510
a half life that was designed back in

140
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,149
the days when they were lighting

141
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:38,339
warehouses with them so that basically

142
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:40,079
told you in 20,000 hours half of the

143
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,269
lamps would still be burning it is

144
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:45,089
absolutely not usable and not

145
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:48,209
appropriate or worthwhile information in

146
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:50,310
horticulture that's why most people are

147
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:51,889
replacing their HID lamps and anywhere

148
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:57,600
from six months to a year

149
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:59,759
so with led designs basically you have a

150
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,620
ceramic substrate on the bottom this

151
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,599
effectively is an insulator from the

152
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,759
chip to protect it insulates it from the

153
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,039
the board below the month the actual

154
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,219
circuit board and it also is the primary

155
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,990
heatsink of that chip okay and then you

156
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,880
have the lens on here and in your white

157
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,100
LEDs this lens will actually contain

158
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,719
phosphorus so this would be a blue LED

159
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,980
that would be a rating those foster's

160
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,680
and the phosphorus would create

161
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,390
in discrete LEDs that's just a clear

162
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,240
lens that gives you your throw

163
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:29,099
so that can change normal LEDs 180

164
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,870
degrees it goes in all directions more

165
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,210
it's almost a perfect mountain type

166
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,620
curve more in the middle and then as it

167
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,769
spreads out to the sides it drops off

168
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,209
but it's a 180 degree type spread what

169
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:41,879
this lens allows you to do is take that

170
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:49,109
down to 120 degrees or 80 degrees or 90

171
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:52,949
degrees or whatever okay this is a funny

172
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,960
article at metaphysic some universities

173
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:57,329
engineering department literally

174
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,759
published that they got more energy out

175
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:02,699
of an LED than they put in by running

176
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,079
like microwatts through a 3:1 LED and

177
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,339
there was this whole stand they

178
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,779
published this I can just see the

179
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,979
physics department pulling their hair

180
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,779
out screwed no you didn't actually

181
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,870
publish that to do because obviously

182
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:14,639
it's impossible it's ridiculous but what

183
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,889
it does tell you and they've documented

184
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,509
this numerous times is leds efficiencies

185
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:19,469
when you run them really really cool if

186
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:22,139
you keep that junction temperature

187
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,180
really really low the efficiencies are

188
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,589
remarkable they can get upwards of 90%

189
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,199
or better where right now they're

190
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:30,869
running around 30% so the future of LEDs

191
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,449
is really bright I mean it's almost

192
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,519
unlimited how much you know up to 100%

193
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,959
efficiency they're going to continue to

194
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,699
get better and better and better and

195
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,829
better and it's mostly about this

196
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,019
substrate it's mostly about improving

197
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:45,659
this heat conductivity of this substrate

198
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:48,359
material now the majority of your LEDs

199
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,800
out there are plastic substrates the

200
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,389
industry is starting to make a move on

201
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,460
was the first one to go to a ceramic

202
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,379
substrate it doesn't conduct heat

203
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:58,409
dramatically better than the plastic but

204
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,509
the material itself is has a similar

205
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,730
density and hardness and porosity to the

206
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:04,680
chip the silicon chip itself so you're

207
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:08,009
able to make a much more dynamic much

208
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,930
stronger bond between the two so the

209
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:13,230
thermal conductivity is more consistent

210
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:16,050
over a long period of time and if you

211
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,120
look at as the fixtures if you look at

212
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,579
the Oz room this is published by Oz room

213
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,780
the majority of your LEDs out there that

214
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,599
have a plastic substrate you're talking

215
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:27,809
about 30% degradation over 50 to 60,000

216
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,480
hours now granted flowering that's 18

217
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,968
years right is a long time but Oz room

218
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,060
with the ceramic substrate is

219
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:41,028
literally talking about 90% so 10%

220
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:43,578
degradation over $100,000 so really you

221
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:45,198
know the lifespan of these LEDs is it's

222
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:46,489
they're gonna last a lot longer than

223
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:47,508
you're gonna want them give them you're

224
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,810
going to be using them you'll have a

225
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:55,519
little replacement the problem surely

226
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:57,679
from efficiency gains so the that's the

227
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,860
beauty of LEDs they're extremely robust

228
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,120
extremely reliable they just they you

229
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,709
know I mean you can use them for 10

230
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,078
years and they won't change you don't

231
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:08,419
have to touch him there's been a

232
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:13,250
long-standing argument about passive

233
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:15,378
versus active cooling and LEDs and it's

234
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,970
kind of the common sense feel about it

235
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:18,350
is well you know why would you want fans

236
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,389
fans are the number one failure point

237
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,600
the fact is that that whole mindset

238
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:25,278
comes from these Chinese ballasts we

239
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,930
always have a fan that's the first thing

240
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,399
that fails I don't know if you guys have

241
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:30,078
had these loom attacking these other

242
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,698
ballasts and it's always the fan that

243
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:33,739
goes out because they use cheap fans

244
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:35,929
because they want you to buy another one

245
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,659
in a year but the reality is that if you

246
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:41,359
buy a high quality server great fan they

247
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:44,688
last 50 60 thousand hours absolutely

248
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,459
reliably so fans really are not a Chan

249
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:50,000
they're extremely inexpensive so the

250
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:52,369
overwhelming that the should say the

251
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,039
dominant opinion in the industry is if

252
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,198
you can use fans go and use them it's

253
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,169
better you'll keep the chips cooler

254
00:09:57,198 --> 00:10:02,088
under a wider variety of environmental

255
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:04,669
conditions and you will under under

256
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:07,040
passive cooled the advantage the passive

257
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:08,750
cooled the only real major advantage is

258
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,578
it's easier to make a waterproof

259
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,899
obviously water and rain and everything

260
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:13,338
is going to be splashing on it you don't

261
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:15,078
want a fan in there they make them

262
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:16,850
waterproof but still that's that's an

263
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:19,638
environment that's not going to be super

264
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,159
conducive to fans so that's really the

265
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,289
major advantage of passive cool other

266
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,350
than that there really isn't one fan

267
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:29,058
cooling is better its superior but you

268
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,769
know there's you start getting a big

269
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:31,969
blights like the food spiders things

270
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:33,230
like that obviously passive cool the

271
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,389
only way you can do when you do big

272
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,190
strips like that so it depends on the

273
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:40,720
design

274
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:42,550
vacation obviously so that's so now I

275
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,960
expect them we all understand kind of

276
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:46,089
the basics of spectrum this is sunlight

277
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,220
you'll notice a little bit of a peak in

278
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,300
the blue most of that is due the fact

279
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,250
that not only do you have sunlight

280
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:54,429
coming through with a very fairly

281
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,899
balanced spectrum then the skylight is a

282
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:58,179
very blue so it gives you a kind of a

283
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:59,709
peak and in the blue region this is how

284
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:01,719
the eyes see light

285
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:04,540
this is important when you start talking

286
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,580
about lumens or Lux and how you rate

287
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:09,699
light or how you measure light this is

288
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:12,790
how the eye sees light with a big spike

289
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:16,320
in the green region well Lux and lumens

290
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:19,029
are based on the way they're they're

291
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,400
adjusted to reflect how your eye would

292
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:23,709
see that light the visual brightness of

293
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:24,279
that light not the actual photons coming

294
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,580
out of it

295
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:29,259
so this is how plants see light okay

296
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,940
you've got your chlorophyll and deep

297
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:34,210
Peaks and both the red and the blue

298
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:36,630
region the green region where the eye

299
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:39,370
sees the light best is very very low

300
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,929
absorbability else there it actually is

301
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,299
utilized better if you see the Makri

302
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:45,549
curves that utilize better than this but

303
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:48,759
the reality is still the green yellow

304
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:50,409
region is about 40% less efficient than

305
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,120
the red and blue regions the peaks

306
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,639
anyway of the red and blue regions in

307
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,610
terms of actual photosynthetic activity

308
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:59,919
so you can't use lumens or Lux type

309
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,330
rating on any lamp you can't really try

310
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,860
and compare them because they're based

311
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:06,060
on how your eye sees and not how the

312
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,970
plan utilizes it all right

313
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:13,049
and there's the beta-carotene also shows

314
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,050
and this is the curve

315
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,840
this is the actual how plants used light

316
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:22,690
basically light strikes the plant the

317
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,490
water gets this the hydrogen stripped

318
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,620
out of it reduces releases the oxygen

319
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,960
that hydrogen and the carbon and the

320
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,019
carbon dioxide are bound together and it

321
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,509
creates a sugar literally every 10

322
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:38,860
photons roughly 10 photons creates a

323
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:41,350
carbohydrate so bottom line is the whole

324
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,509
goal in canvas is to try and get as many

325
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,930
photons as that plant can possibly

326
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:48,759
absorb and utilize efficiently in that

327
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:51,299
period of time that you have because

328
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:54,399
every 10 photons is a carbohydrate

329
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:58,509
that's it's just that simple

330
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:01,389
it's very straightforward now like I was

331
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:03,939
talking about lumens lumens are designed

332
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:07,929
for eye the way you the industry rates

333
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:10,480
lighting for for height for horticulture

334
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:13,689
is with par pars photosynthetically

335
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,970
active radiation there that basically

336
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,590
means that it's waiting all of the

337
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,649
spectrums that were are in the

338
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:24,250
photosynthetic region from deep blue all

339
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:27,009
the way to not far end but the very far

340
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:30,850
end of read all of those spectrum are

341
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:33,370
all weighted evenly so that's why even

342
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:37,450
power readings are not actually a really

343
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:40,539
accurate way to compare lights because

344
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:43,390
as I showed you before that yellow green

345
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:46,959
region is 40% less efficient but par

346
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:50,279
rated the same so that's why if you see

347
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,930
a light at HBS light which is 50% green

348
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:55,679
half the spectrum of an HBS light is in

349
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:59,169
green if you see if HPS light saying

350
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:01,269
1600 micro moles and you see an LED

351
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:03,639
light that has 10 percent green that has

352
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:06,639
600 micro moles then LED light has

353
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:11,049
substantially more actual photosynthetic

354
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,549
activity in a plant because all that

355
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:14,319
green light has been taken out it's

356
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:17,079
using only spectrums that the plant can

357
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,750
utilize most efficiently that's until

358
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,790
recently until this year it's just this

359
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,100
year that all the LEDs are now electric

360
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:25,629
doing more efficient than HBS last year

361
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,879
the entire market was roughly

362
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:30,309
electrically meaning the micromoles per

363
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,580
jewelry you know the power in to pack

364
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:35,049
two photons out they were about equal

365
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:38,200
the the vast majority the LEDs were all

366
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:40,059
about 1.8 so all the savings they were

367
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,710
getting which was around 25 to 30

368
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:42,939
percent for the better companies like

369
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,310
California light works we were getting

370
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:48,100
routinely in tests 25 to 30 percent

371
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:51,909
savings consistently purely on these

372
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,670
photosynthetic efficiency literally just

373
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:57,399
because of shaving out all that green

374
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:58,929
out of the light we were able to get 25

375
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,129
or 30 percent more efficiency against

376
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:04,599
for versus HBS now with a 20 percent

377
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:07,210
elect to 25 percent electrical

378
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,399
efficiency advantage the efficiency gain

379
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:13,120
is really around 45 to 50 percent almost

380
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:16,449
now so that's why when I say hid our IP

381
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,490
I mean this year at 50 percent more

382
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:21,070
efficient or 45 percent more efficient

383
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,680
it just it's pretty much this is going

384
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,870
to spell the end of HBS as a practical

385
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,759
solution for for horticulture as of this

386
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,259
year going forward and this is one

387
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,480
because when you add those two together

388
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:37,029
it's it's it's a dramatically more

389
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:39,159
efficient system so what they really

390
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:41,980
need and they're this system isn't in

391
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:43,839
place yet is an adjusted bar is a way of

392
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,519
taking the par value and some of your

393
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,899
par meters if you invest in the really

394
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,899
expensive ones that have software in

395
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:51,220
them you can actually take the power

396
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:53,079
measurement and run it through the Makri

397
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,450
curve and actually run it through this

398
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,520
absorption curve down here the

399
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:59,410
utilization curve rather and it will

400
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,059
give you the actual form the adjusted

401
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:03,219
bar what the actual photosynthetic

402
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:05,379
activity the plant is going to be so

403
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,090
that's really the only way absolutely

404
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:08,289
accurate way to compare two lights I see

405
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,389
a lot of people walking on the show of

406
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:12,669
bar meters comparing lights with par

407
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:14,889
meters and it gives you a rough idea but

408
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:18,279
it's really not accurate this is really

409
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:20,319
the only way to know for sure really how

410
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:23,220
the lights compares by running them

411
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,450
through this absorption curve here

412
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,790
here's some of your other lighting

413
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:31,759
sources now this is a really good

414
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:34,519
and it shows you exactly where HPS lines

415
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,750
up on the absorption curve this is the

416
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:41,329
overall peak absorption curve okay

417
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:44,870
look where it lines up the entire of HPS

418
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:47,720
is all in a relatively low efficiency

419
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,879
area not in Nunavut it literally has

420
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,920
nothing up in the high beings except for

421
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,840
this little Spiker and this and

422
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,579
different HPS of different spectrums so

423
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,050
this can change a little bit and then

424
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,310
the newer lamps are starting to run

425
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,109
higher and higher pressure so they're

426
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:02,059
still starting to squash a little more

427
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,830
of this on both sides you'll see someone

428
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:06,019
won't be a little flatter if they're

429
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,910
running a little higher pressure but the

430
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:09,589
majority the energy still especially

431
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,930
this whole half over here that's why I

432
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:15,319
say 50% of green yellow this whole half

433
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:17,090
over here is all right here so that's

434
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,769
where we were getting all earth all our

435
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:22,250
savings last year and the year before

436
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:24,289
that loader was there now with the

437
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,230
electrical it's just way more we're

438
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:32,329
doing 40 to 45 percent again this is the

439
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:36,740
idea don't dim HPS okay now there's two

440
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:38,779
kinds of LEDs out there one camp I call

441
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,609
the billion years of evolution can't be

442
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:42,740
wrong camper says well Sun lights white

443
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:44,089
light plants have been evolving for

444
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,430
millions and millions of years under

445
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:48,289
white light it must be best and that

446
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,660
makes perfect logical sense you know

447
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:53,480
prom is a science doesn't agree with it

448
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,550
the science suggests we know exactly

449
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,519
where the plants absorb we have these

450
00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:01,039
Peaks and the their the plant absorbs

451
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:03,319
much more efficiently at these exact

452
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,409
chlorophyll a and B Peaks now there are

453
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:08,539
other pigments that can absorb light and

454
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,980
can translate for that light into energy

455
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:11,839
all of them have to go through the

456
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,630
chloroplast they require chlorophyll a

457
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,519
to be around to do it like the

458
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,350
carotenoid system the red and yellows in

459
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:21,289
your plants that's the carotenoid system

460
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:23,359
that's underneath the chlorophyll the

461
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:25,609
carotenoid layer is actually beneath the

462
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,919
chlorophyll there that's why the

463
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:29,929
carotenoid layer is less efficient it

464
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,269
the natural conversion to energy isn't

465
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,440
that much less efficient than

466
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:35,450
chlorophyll but it's beneath the

467
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,789
chlorophyll is green so the very color

468
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,870
the carotenoids absorb is reflected away

469
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:40,430
by those chlorophyll

470
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:46,429
which is kind of the green blue region

471
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:48,590
so the white LED camp or the

472
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,960
full-spectrum camp says that white light

473
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:52,789
is best you have your white LEDs that

474
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:58,340
are basically a blue LED with white

475
00:18:52,789 --> 00:19:00,079
phosphors they creep here it is so this

476
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:01,639
is a white LED kind of spectrum this is

477
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,289
kind of exaggerated but usually they

478
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,720
have a big blue spike because it's a

479
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:08,539
blue LED driving that white cop or that

480
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,250
white LED blue LED and then you have all

481
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:13,639
this is the phosphorous creating this

482
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:16,730
big mound and then most of the really

483
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,980
top shelf LEDs will have a red spike

484
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,450
over here to like fluence you'll notice

485
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,269
they'll have a red spike that's with

486
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,710
discrete red LEDs so they'll have their

487
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:26,269
white LEDs that does this kind of a

488
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,000
curve and then they'll have a red LED

489
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:32,509
giving them a little spike on the end so

490
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,569
that's one cam or metal halide would be

491
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:39,950
more of a flat spectrum a little but but

492
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:42,819
it's pretty high in the blue in all of

493
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:45,680
those white LEDs you still have this

494
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:48,939
major 30 to 40 percent of the energy is

495
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:56,000
all being produced in this region that's

496
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:58,759
underutilized by the plant now the LEDs

497
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,589
that I call the discrete LED designs

498
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:04,759
like California light works like luma

499
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:08,449
grow they use a combination of red and

500
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:11,150
blue LEDs specifically at the

501
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:14,090
chlorophyll Peaks and then a white LED

502
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:17,780
in a lower power density like 20% or 30%

503
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:19,189
of the total power to cover the rest and

504
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:20,809
I think there's there's a pretty easy

505
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,670
argument to be made that if you're

506
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:25,579
trying to look for the absolutely most

507
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:28,190
efficient way to drive a plant this

508
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:29,689
approaches is the best it's the most

509
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,640
efficient we actually see it in

510
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,259
side-by-side testing and it's not

511
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,880
dramatically more efficient than the

512
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:36,920
white LEDs we're seeing somewhere

513
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,240
anywhere from five to ten percent better

514
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,880
efficiency in terms of true

515
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,339
photosynthetic activity we can run

516
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,140
slightly less power than a white LED and

517
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:46,669
get the same growth rates because of

518
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,350
this because we're not wasting a lot of

519
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:51,500
energy on the green now there is one

520
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:54,500
caveat on that though green bounces

521
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,970
around it bounces off the chlorophyll

522
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,079
and it does absorb and it can absorb

523
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,450
through the bottom of the leaves

524
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:02,569
everything so if you have a canopy

525
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:05,180
that's really unruly that's not pruned

526
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:07,519
properly that has a lot of shading

527
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,529
happening in it lights with more green

528
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,180
will actually perform better that green

529
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:13,940
will perform better in those those

530
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:16,880
heavily shaded canopies then it will in

531
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,440
a well prune canopy so that's why when

532
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,350
they talk about HPS having better

533
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,910
penetration that's kind of what I think

534
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:25,039
they're think they're meaning and

535
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,779
they're seeing is that if they've got a

536
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,549
lot of shading in their canopy the HPS

537
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:30,769
will give them some good penetration in

538
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:32,450
areas that are shaded because that green

539
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:33,980
lights going right through the leaves or

540
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,230
it's bouncing off of them and bouncing

541
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,690
around in the canopy here's the problem

542
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,579
you talk to any master grower worth of

543
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:43,970
salt he'll tell you prune Anette plant

544
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:46,369
is half your yield half the game is

545
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:49,640
shaping that plan so that nothing but

546
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:52,219
flowers see light and how much labor it

547
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,440
takes to get you to that point that's

548
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:58,370
really probably the single biggest thing

549
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:01,970
you can do to increase your yield is to

550
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:05,750
maximize exclusively flower seeing light

551
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:07,430
and nothing else so while the green

552
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,500
helps in those shaded canopies it's a

553
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,320
really bad way to run a can I grow

554
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,259
having a lot of shaded flowers in your

555
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:21,950
canopy so but that's how they compare to

556
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:23,599
each other so all right now we're going

557
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,539
to talk about spectrum a little bit mmm

558
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:29,389
this is there's a very fanciful term

559
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:31,490
called photo morphogenesis it refers to

560
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,170
the fact that plants all class three

561
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,230
plants in fact a tall class 3 and class

562
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:40,400
4 plants when they absorb different

563
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:41,490
frequencies they they can actually make

564
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,030
them

565
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:47,009
show different phenol expressions so we

566
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:48,420
see you know we've used it for years for

567
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:49,890
twenty thirty years now people been

568
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,720
growing cannabis they be using metal

569
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,700
halide advantage they've been using HPS

570
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,130
and flour the reason is because metal

571
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,380
halide is a blue dominant light and blue

572
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:01,020
light tends to favor vegetative growth

573
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,780
it tends to favor promote leaf

574
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:06,029
production and root production red light

575
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:10,889
tends to promote flower production and

576
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:12,808
fruiting and stem production so and then

577
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,820
that's obviously it's a function of

578
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:19,109
billions of years or millions of years

579
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:21,509
of you know spring to fall the light and

580
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:25,889
the sunlight is more blue in the early

581
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:26,910
stages in the high high growth period

582
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,830
during the middle of the growth period

583
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:31,470
as it starts getting into the late fall

584
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:33,539
it gets more and more red dominant and

585
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:34,890
so that triggers the the flowering

586
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:37,349
responses on a lot of plants through

587
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:41,670
that that flower based on on red light

588
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:45,599
so because of this we can actually use

589
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:47,610
the spectrum to tell the plant what we

590
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:50,099
want it to do with this vote the photons

591
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:51,990
it's absorbing as opposed to having one

592
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:54,359
fixed spectrum just letting the plant do

593
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,980
whatever it wants if you put more red

594
00:23:54,359 --> 00:24:00,240
light on that flower it will produce

595
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:02,400
more flower and less leaf to put more

596
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,349
blue on that line that plant while it's

597
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:09,090
flowering it'll produce more leaves in

598
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:11,009
those flowers so if you've ever compared

599
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:13,379
an outdoor plant like an outdoor

600
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:15,660
cannabis plant to an indoor one under

601
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,010
HBS you'll see that the HBS literally

602
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,040
just has a little fingertip leaves

603
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:22,259
coming out of the flowers right you look

604
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:23,849
at outdoor plants the leaves are big

605
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:25,529
leaves coming out of your flowers and

606
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:26,579
metal halide has longer leaves coming

607
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:28,230
out of the flowers as well

608
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:31,289
the reason is because there's more blue

609
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,910
during the flower peak flower cycle so

610
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:34,710
some of that energy that that plant is

611
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,080
absorbing is going into leaf production

612
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:39,210
instead of flower production now

613
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,220
interview they've done a sprog row and

614
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:44,519
trimmed all the leaves off had nothing

615
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:47,130
but flowers no you don't need some

616
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,869
leaves to grow flowers they really don't

617
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:50,320
the flower the leave little easing those

618
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:53,888
little finger leaves of HP

619
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,750
are enough to flower successfully and

620
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:57,819
really get dense flowers with cannabis

621
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,169
once the flowering cycle happens though

622
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:00,308
some leaves are helpful during the first

623
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:02,590
two weeks when the plants grow really

624
00:25:00,308 --> 00:25:05,589
fast when they big but they don't really

625
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:08,408
they're really not necessary later so

626
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:13,240
the reality is you want to try and drive

627
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:16,000
so while we've been using this ratio

628
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:19,599
forever using metal halide oops

629
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,109
using metal halide and veg using hpsm

630
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:26,069
flower by using discrete leds with

631
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:28,599
variable spectrum you can actually

632
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:32,769
change the ratios of the red and blue

633
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:36,668
throughout the flower cycle so what that

634
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:39,128
allows you to do is say for example a

635
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:42,730
typical ratio of red to blue for veg is

636
00:25:39,128 --> 00:25:46,329
about 64 to 60 percent red 40% blue we

637
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,558
almost always personally any grow like

638
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:49,388
to look at it's gonna have more red than

639
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:53,619
blue because red is photosynthetically

640
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:55,839
more efficient the blue takes more

641
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:58,089
energy while still making the same

642
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:01,928
carbohydrate so it's more expensive to

643
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:04,720
do blue ok so any lights you want to run

644
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:06,548
more red than blue so in but in veg to

645
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,769
get lots of leaf and get you that true

646
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:10,298
vet metal halide style of vegetative

647
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:13,899
growth you might run something like

648
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:15,579
60/40 red to blue okay what we can do

649
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:17,199
with what we do with California light

650
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:21,908
works or with blue macro with any of the

651
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:24,519
discrete type LED systems in pre flower

652
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:28,000
which is those first two weeks you can

653
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:30,220
crank the power up and run 70/30 you're

654
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,819
still running a lot of blue at 70/30

655
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:36,220
because HBS is like 95 595 percent red

656
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:37,960
its are they any blue at all so you run

657
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,389
70/30 the first two weeks keeping your

658
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,278
plant kind of compact if you don't mind

659
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:44,109
you got lots of room you're running more

660
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:47,429
red less blue you'll get a bigger

661
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:50,788
stretchier plant but it'll be bigger

662
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:56,649
okay one thing you want to remember is

663
00:26:50,788 --> 00:26:59,769
that there's no magic formula there's no

664
00:26:56,648 --> 00:27:00,939
magic spectrum that's the best doesn't

665
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:01,200
exist anybody tells you they've got the

666
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,480
map

667
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,819
formula just doesn't exist there's

668
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,730
dozens of different ratios that will do

669
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:10,138
different things depending on what you

670
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:13,860
want to do with the plant that's the

671
00:27:10,138 --> 00:27:16,259
beauty of leveraging spectrum is that

672
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:20,099
there's a different spectrum to get P

673
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:21,929
key to get maximum yield for firm for

674
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:24,178
top-shelf flower there's a different

675
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:25,610
spectrum for maximum yield pure yield

676
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,990
there's a different spectrum for

677
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:29,369
extraction

678
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,690
you can literally there's a different

679
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:32,219
spectrum to keep the little plants

680
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,580
really compact if your room with your

681
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:38,250
space challenged so you can leverage

682
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:41,099
this spectrum throughout the flower

683
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:43,589
cycle to actually use that function that

684
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:46,230
photo morphogenesis to get the plant to

685
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:48,028
do what you want it to do and that's a

686
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,769
level of control you just will never get

687
00:27:48,028 --> 00:27:50,490
with a fixed spectrum line there's no

688
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:53,009
way to do it

689
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:56,130
now that the yield that advantages

690
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:59,669
aren't dramatic like I said we see

691
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:01,260
between white and discrete spectrum in

692
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:02,250
tests we've seen it's somewhere in five

693
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:05,308
to ten percent range

694
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:09,329
you know advantages but in terms of

695
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:10,740
quality and flower structure you can

696
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:12,509
actually have some substantial

697
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,880
differences if you're willing but it's

698
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:16,558
all a trade-off if you want to get tons

699
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,419
and tons of resin it's super super

700
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,028
resonance you need to you're gonna have

701
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:22,590
to sacrifice a little flower mass your

702
00:28:21,028 --> 00:28:25,230
flowers will be a little smaller but a

703
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:27,658
lot harder and denser you're sacrificing

704
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,308
you by running you run more blue you get

705
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:30,899
more resin terpene production at the end

706
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:33,869
but you get a little less flower

707
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:36,239
production actual flower material doing

708
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:37,798
more red get bigger flowers but a little

709
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,870
less resin because you've only got so

710
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:42,778
much energy to work with it's a

711
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:45,000
trade-off so people don't understand it

712
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:50,159
it's all a trade-off there is no magic

713
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,169
ideal so but with the discreet LED

714
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,809
system you have that flexibility to

715
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:58,259
choose where you want that to go where

716
00:28:54,808 --> 00:29:00,898
you want that energy to go and as this

717
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:02,690
industry matures it's going to get more

718
00:29:00,898 --> 00:29:04,768
and more and more competitive and

719
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,360
quality is going to come to come unless

720
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:08,819
you're extracting quality is going to

721
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:11,069
become more and more and more important

722
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:11,769
with this with a discreet lighting

723
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:13,679
system you have

724
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:16,210
flexibility being able to change that

725
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,039
you can sacrifice a little bit of yield

726
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,740
to get denser and denser and higher

727
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:24,549
quality if you need to those other guys

728
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,930
can they got what the god they'll try

729
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:27,190
and do with nutrients and trust me they

730
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,660
aren't going to get very far with that

731
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:35,529
there's only so much you can do with

732
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:40,930
nutrients so this is again why don't

733
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:45,309
lead ease okay let's get into some other

734
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:47,560
spectrums UVB this is an actual insert

735
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:49,179
from the study done in 1987 by the

736
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:50,649
University of Maryland at the University

737
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,600
of Mississippi the ultimate irony that

738
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,370
all federal testing is done at the

739
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:56,740
University of Mississippi go figure

740
00:29:54,369 --> 00:30:00,879
but the University of Maryland did a

741
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:04,299
test with UVB from 0to equatorial Sun

742
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,650
level UVB exposure all the way through

743
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:06,909
veggie flower they actually did it all

744
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:10,170
the way through the entire vision flower

745
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:12,400
process at the end they came to a

746
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,380
baseline at 25 they said there were

747
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,000
Mexican sativa plants seems pretty

748
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,440
likely they were true sativa this

749
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,799
because that's a pretty high THC level

750
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:25,390
for 1987 but there's zero UVB was 25

751
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:28,149
percent 50 percent UVB was 28 100% UVB

752
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:30,670
of equatorial Sun which is roughly 500

753
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:33,370
micro moles or a 500 micro watts per

754
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:38,380
square centimeter was 32 percent so that

755
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:43,839
was a 7 percent increase over 0 to 100%

756
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:46,390
or 33% more THC at equatorial Sun and

757
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:50,589
it's linear that's actually a linear

758
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:53,140
function so California Lightworks has a

759
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:56,949
UV lamp for example that we've designed

760
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,810
and we decided specifically to at 2

761
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,650
lamps over a 4x4 TRAI will give you

762
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:05,379
effectively California or 30th parallel

763
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:07,480
UVB levels which is roughly 350 micro

764
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:10,300
micro Watts a square centimeter we chose

765
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,650
that just because we know all the

766
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:13,690
cannabis plants are probably have

767
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,940
evolved at least at that we didn't want

768
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,059
to go to you can try equatorial Sun if

769
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,960
you want but we're not sure that the

770
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,659
plants are going to be able to tolerate

771
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,210
that because they evolved at the 30th

772
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:27,150
parallel so 350 microwatts per square

773
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:29,910
centimeter is a nice safe amount of UVB

774
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:31,320
for pretty much any plant unless you're

775
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,790
talking ruderalis again if you're

776
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:35,339
talking Auto flowers those are from

777
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:36,899
Russia so they're even a higher latitude

778
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:39,029
so they might tolerate less we don't

779
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,690
know a lot of research to be done on

780
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:46,980
this but what you can pretty much assume

781
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:48,269
from UVB is if you provide equatorial

782
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,069
Sun you should be able to get somewhere

783
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:53,490
in the neighborhood of 30 plus percent

784
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:55,409
increasing your THC levels at California

785
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:58,859
Sun level to UVB you should be able to

786
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:01,650
give it 20 to 25% more UVB are more THC

787
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:06,119
so if you've got 20% plant that's a that

788
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:07,769
goes to 24% it's a lot especially so I I

789
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,169
typically tell people if you're in a

790
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:11,549
market where your th sees aggressively

791
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,800
measured if you're at a market where

792
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:16,829
your pounds literally your price per

793
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:19,980
pound is very theirs based on THC levels

794
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:21,659
any of those markets where THC is going

795
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:25,259
to change your profitability are going

796
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:27,810
to change your competitiveness UVB

797
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:29,460
really makes a lot of sense but if they

798
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:31,919
lay a complete layer of complexity is

799
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,480
it's difficult when you use your VP in

800
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,820
the room you need to turn them off when

801
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,039
you go in that room you do not want to

802
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:40,829
work under UVB because it's not the same

803
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:43,500
as Sun sunlight shut your eye down

804
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:45,720
automatically super-bright so your pupil

805
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,190
shuts will write down these lights are

806
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,600
really dim when you look at them so if

807
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,759
you look at these lights without eye

808
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,349
protection you're getting eight to ten

809
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:53,910
times as much UVB exposure from the

810
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:55,919
lights potential if you're within a

811
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,840
couple feet of them you walk in there I

812
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,950
used to walk in my room I had UVB lamps

813
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,799
in there and I walk in there and forget

814
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:04,799
about it maybe six inches from my head

815
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:07,019
blew everyone I'm like well I've been

816
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,129
standing you know at two feet for 300

817
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:11,579
micro moles at two feet you're getting

818
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:13,920
1200 micro moles at 6 inches there's

819
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:15,509
1,200 microwatts so you really have to

820
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,970
be careful using UVB I strongly

821
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:19,170
recommend it if it makes sense in your

822
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:21,089
market if it's going to make you more

823
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:22,590
competitive but you really got to be

824
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:25,289
careful put it on its own circuit

825
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:27,000
control it separately and are the

826
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:27,388
California light works UVB lab now it

827
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,950
comes with

828
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:30,718
flashing LED that's going to drive you

829
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,190
crazy if it's on so if you're in there

830
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,869
you'll do a little Drive you nuts

831
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,129
because they'll be flashing all the time

832
00:33:33,868 --> 00:33:40,819
and you'll know that it's on you can

833
00:33:35,128 --> 00:33:43,819
turn it off so now let's get into

834
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:43,819
application

835
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:54,380
oh one other thing I want to mention

836
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:56,090
typically when you're comparing LEDs to

837
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,120
HBS you're just comparing pure energy

838
00:33:56,089 --> 00:34:00,740
savings but if you can actually increase

839
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,989
your canopy for those of you that have

840
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,940
power challenges you know your panel

841
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,200
just won't handle do you have plenty of

842
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,480
space but you just your panels

843
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,579
undersized and you don't want to mess

844
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,929
with that you can pay for your light

845
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:17,299
LEDs in a in a cropper to a turn or two

846
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:20,300
because you can increase your canopy by

847
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,220
forty percent if you go to LEDs if your

848
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,110
space to you a power challenge you're

849
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:25,759
not just counting on the energy savings

850
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,970
now you're talking forty percent more

851
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,440
yield for each round because you can run

852
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:32,628
forty percent more canopy on the same

853
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,159
amount of power so that's a really fast

854
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:37,369
payback if that's your case it's your

855
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:42,019
power challenged much faster than just

856
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:45,319
energy savings now I'm gonna start

857
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:50,239
getting into there's a really commonly a

858
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:53,419
misunderstood aspect about lighting the

859
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,859
key to lighting plants indoors whether

860
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:58,129
it be green and this is true greenhouses

861
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:00,380
or indoors is you want to try and get as

862
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:02,960
close to true diffusion as possible

863
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:07,099
diffusion means light coming from all

864
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:10,460
directions all right we're teaming

865
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:12,199
throughout the last 20 years the common

866
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,389
mindset was you put that light down

867
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:17,449
close put the light down close because

868
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:19,250
it's more penetration right inverse

869
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:22,069
square law says the closer you are the

870
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,630
brighter the light is problem is the

871
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,039
inverse square law doesn't mean the

872
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,170
light is brighter it only means that

873
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:31,670
actual get closer it's illuminating a

874
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:33,680
smaller area as you raise the lights all

875
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,869
you're doing is expanding the area it's

876
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:38,149
illuminating every photons to reaches

877
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:40,339
the bottom there's no losses by raising

878
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:45,500
the lights up unless it bounces off the

879
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:48,320
walls so but one of the advantages when

880
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,360
you raise the lights up is now all of a

881
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,160
sudden you start getting crossover

882
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,599
lights start crossing over and hitting

883
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:56,059
different parts of the plant that you

884
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,159
would not see if you look at a plant and

885
00:35:56,059 --> 00:36:00,860
you put the light down close here's a

886
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,440
perfect example if you take a Christmas

887
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,440
tree

888
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,380
plant style plan four-foot tall with a

889
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,300
four-foot diameter base okay

890
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:13,079
the circle that that base creates on the

891
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:15,870
floor is ten square feet but the cone of

892
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:20,150
that Christmas tree shaped plant the

893
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:22,739
outer cone it forms is 70 square feet

894
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:25,680
that's how much more leaf area there is

895
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:28,799
then the footprint on the floor well the

896
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,779
closer the light is to that plant the

897
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,700
more all the light could see is the

898
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,110
footprint on the floor when you get that

899
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:35,849
light right down and there's one light

900
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:39,210
straight over the top of the plant all

901
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:40,619
that's shining on is an area of leaf the

902
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,470
size of the little print on the floor

903
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:45,569
everything else is shaded as you raise

904
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:47,009
the light up or make it bigger because

905
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,480
that effectively is the same thing

906
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,160
making the light big we're raising it up

907
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,780
and get him to overlap does roughly the

908
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,399
same thing because it's getting the

909
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,820
light coming from multiple directions I

910
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,349
should raise it up and get diffusion now

911
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,450
all of a sudden you're lighting more and

912
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:03,779
a higher and higher percentage of that

913
00:37:00,449 --> 00:37:05,669
canopy evenly because the lights are

914
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,380
crossing over this plant is here now

915
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,210
some of this fixture is shining on that

916
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,500
fix your shot on that one Johnny all

917
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:13,769
these different fixtures so the lights

918
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:17,000
penetrating in and what it does is it

919
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:21,570
takes it from it takes it from a planar

920
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,650
lighting to a volumetric lighting and

921
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,240
remember all of our lighting

922
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,980
measurements are always in square

923
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,469
centimeters they're always in this plane

924
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:33,570
or measurement but canopies aren't

925
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:34,980
planar they're volumetric and as you

926
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,620
raise those lights up and get more

927
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,809
diffusion you will illuminate more

928
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:42,750
square feet of Asheville Lee ferry in

929
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:44,969
that plant and as you do that believe it

930
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:47,519
or not your power density can slowly

931
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:49,349
drift up because you're using more of

932
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,360
the plant you're not over driving those

933
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:53,819
those areas of the plant that are that

934
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,680
are exposed while the shaded plants part

935
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,600
is not being used plants were designed

936
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,159
with the Sun have to Sun move so it

937
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,839
moves around it's very intense in one

938
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:02,909
place but it constantly moves into our

939
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,470
grow and then advantage so if you have

940
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:07,139
shady happening in your plan

941
00:38:04,469 --> 00:38:08,579
you're wasting that leaf absorption in

942
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:11,129
those areas while overdriving other

943
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:11,929
areas the only way to stop that is to

944
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:14,269
raise either

945
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:15,909
like God's fraud we're literally every

946
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:17,659
square inch there's no shading anywhere

947
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:20,029
you've gone through all of the

948
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:22,609
mechanical effort you know the work to

949
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:26,420
get the canopy perfectly manicured so

950
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:29,150
that it all sees light or you raise

951
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,130
those lights up and and most of your

952
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,809
commercial grows you know you can't you

953
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,519
know the time to do that most of the big

954
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:35,869
commercial girls I see they're not doing

955
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:40,460
strong growth because it's way too

956
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:41,719
time-consuming so if you're not a three

957
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,269
or four foot tall or five foot tall

958
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,949
plant as you raise those lights up now

959
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:47,690
if you're illuminating more and more and

960
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:49,429
more of the of the leaf area of that

961
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,700
plant you're turning it into a

962
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:54,559
volumetric canopy but your power density

963
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:56,389
is going to on any one leaf is going to

964
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:59,719
slowly drop because you're spreading it

965
00:38:56,389 --> 00:39:01,519
out over more area so believe it or not

966
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:04,699
that allows you to raise your power

967
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:07,550
dense your amount of power up if you're

968
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:09,829
running 800 micromoles right now on your

969
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:11,930
grow if you raise those lights up and

970
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:13,190
get a really really diffused light on

971
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:15,169
that plant you might be able to pump

972
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:17,179
that up to a thousand and use it you

973
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,950
utilize it properly and you will get

974
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:20,569
higher density in the bottom of a plant

975
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:22,879
you'll get higher density throughout the

976
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:26,620
plant more even distribution and density

977
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,000
throughout the plan by doing that so

978
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:30,679
it's it's it's strange but it's just

979
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,760
counterintuitive I know everybody thinks

980
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:33,440
down close is better but it's not

981
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,750
nothing about this - here's another

982
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,700
example you've got a two foot tall plant

983
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,650
and you put your lights two foot above

984
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:41,239
the top of the plant and the bottom

985
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,740
branch is two feet below the top of the

986
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:44,359
plant so it's two foot to the top and

987
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:47,599
it's four foot to the bottom branch

988
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:50,170
inverse square law says X to the top of

989
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,509
the plant 1/4 X to the bottom right

990
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:55,159
inverse square of the distance now if

991
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:56,840
you raise that like - 6 feet above the

992
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,129
top of the plant so it's 6 feet to the

993
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,350
top of the plant it's 8 feet to the

994
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:02,630
bottom branch now you square that it's

995
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:04,670
to the top it's 36 you squared to the

996
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,579
bottom branch is 64 it's half as much

997
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:08,869
light so purely just through the inverse

998
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:10,069
square law if you look at it from the

999
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:12,710
inverse square law as you raise the

1000
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:14,510
light up yes the intensity from that one

1001
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:17,420
light goes down because you're spreading

1002
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:18,590
the light over a bigger area but you've

1003
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,480
got other than all the other lights

1004
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:22,519
overlapping so the power density stays

1005
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,309
the same whatever you put power up there

1006
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:25,690
is what you get down here but as you

1007
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:28,210
raise

1008
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:29,650
lights up anyone right the differential

1009
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,849
between the top of the bottom gets less

1010
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,610
and less and less as you raise the

1011
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:37,299
lights up you start getting a narrow

1012
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:38,890
narrower band a band that's closer in

1013
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,800
terms of total light level in five

1014
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:44,339
minutes okay let's go ahead and have

1015
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:54,100
some questions anybody have questions

1016
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:56,380
yeah I'm doing a nursery in Southern

1017
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:59,469
Oregon they focused on Rudy I'm

1018
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:01,570
wondering if you had looked at any

1019
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:12,579
studies or have any information on

1020
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:14,110
optimum LED lights well from what I've

1021
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:16,690
been able to see I haven't seen a lot

1022
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:18,910
I've looked and I've not seen any really

1023
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:21,940
specific data on spectrum affecting

1024
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:24,879
cloning you know routing and cloning but

1025
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:28,000
I have seen some that suggest that blue

1026
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,930
light tends to enhance Brut production

1027
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,269
red light the differential read too far

1028
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:35,919
red interestingly has a similar effect

1029
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:37,179
that it does in the plan so but it's one

1030
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,720
thing I wanted to mention you guys too

1031
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:42,669
before we go far red is what causes

1032
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:46,809
plants to stretch it's not lighting

1033
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:48,099
level okay plant cells stretch because

1034
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:50,139
they don't see enough light they stretch

1035
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:52,000
because shade light has more far-red and

1036
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:54,429
the ratio far red to red is what's going

1037
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,929
to cause that plant to stretch and

1038
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:59,079
that's the other reason why they stretch

1039
00:41:55,929 --> 00:42:01,239
in flower because the same mechanism the

1040
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:03,190
ratio far into red is the same mechanism

1041
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:04,449
that triggers the flower response so

1042
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,769
you're getting a shade stretch response

1043
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:07,449
and a flower response at the same time

1044
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:09,340
those I just wanted to clarify the

1045
00:42:07,449 --> 00:42:11,189
question also it's not just about

1046
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:14,730
spectrum

1047
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:18,210
levels so very lil I mean you know I

1048
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:19,829
mean III know people that do cloning the

1049
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:23,429
lighting requirements for clones are

1050
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:25,200
very low actually it's really the key to

1051
00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:27,868
cloning is all about temperature and

1052
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:30,358
humidity preserving a really consistent

1053
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:32,099
humidity level of the canopy and keeping

1054
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:33,989
your temperature that canopy consistent

1055
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:35,369
and the root temperature is it's really

1056
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:37,348
all about that and oxygen levels

1057
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:39,180
obviously getting that oxygen if you're

1058
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:42,000
using clone plugs trying to get them to

1059
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:43,169
dry out to the optimum aeration first

1060
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,550
you know because they always start out a

1061
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,588
little too damp and trying to give them

1062
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,390
that perfect spot but I mean I'm not

1063
00:42:46,588 --> 00:42:51,989
really an expert in that you know that's

1064
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:54,449
not my field so really so I wish I could

1065
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:56,549
help you more with that but any other

1066
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:59,250
questions about lighting yeah yeah I had

1067
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:02,339
a question earlier somebody was talking

1068
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:05,219
about the phosphorus in the white LED

1069
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:08,429
and the degradation and can you maybe

1070
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:12,118
speak on the possibility of spectral

1071
00:43:08,429 --> 00:43:13,799
changes in the life of the LED in

1072
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:17,119
regards to the phosphorus yeah the

1073
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,380
thought the phosphors do degrade

1074
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,630
typically that's not terrible I mean

1075
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,670
they degrade town in 60 80 thousand our

1076
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:25,318
type range is about where they really

1077
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:27,470
start to degrade where you get a

1078
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:29,429
noticeable amount of degradation again

1079
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:30,899
is it enough

1080
00:43:29,429 --> 00:43:33,210
when everything is going up so rapidly

1081
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,160
you know all of the decisions of talking

1082
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,568
about 20 years life and all of that I

1083
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:38,098
mean when the lights going to be 30%

1084
00:43:36,568 --> 00:43:41,608
more efficient another two or three

1085
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:43,740
years are we really gonna be still using

1086
00:43:41,608 --> 00:43:45,900
them you know what I mean in five years

1087
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:48,328
when there are forty five percent more

1088
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,680
efficient again the next generation so I

1089
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:50,818
think we're the commercial lighting is

1090
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:52,469
in it goes you're going to see these

1091
00:43:50,818 --> 00:43:54,509
things being cycled through and resolved

1092
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:55,649
just like computer I don't know that I

1093
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:57,030
mean a lot of people may run them

1094
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:59,550
forever but if you're going to be as

1095
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:01,019
competitive as this industry is and it's

1096
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:02,700
going to continue to be more and more

1097
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:04,349
and more competitive you're gonna have

1098
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:06,179
to stay on the cutting edge and power to

1099
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:07,940
the power utilization and lighting is

1100
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:10,919
what are your number one biggest costs

1101
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:12,630
so you know you're gonna have to stay on

1102
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,039
that curve and stay ahead of that curve

1103
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,230
in terms of efficiency if you want to be

1104
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:17,849
competitive I mean green house is a

1105
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,469
little less important

1106
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:21,539
is only half your lighting that you're

1107
00:44:19,469 --> 00:44:25,199
doing with with with and by the way on

1108
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:26,759
greenhouse lighting when you look at

1109
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:29,399
greenhouse lighting the other beauty of

1110
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:32,160
LEDs in supplementing greenhouses that

1111
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,389
they're because they're dimmable now

1112
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:35,009
you're not just turning them on in the

1113
00:44:33,389 --> 00:44:36,150
morning and turning them off and then

1114
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,880
turning them on the afternoon and

1115
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:40,860
turning them off with LEDs you can dim

1116
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,349
them continuously California light Works

1117
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:46,079
has a photo sensor control that actually

1118
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:48,179
dims the lights up and down some goes

1119
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,980
behind a cloud boom they come up Sun

1120
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:51,599
Goes Down behind the cloud they come

1121
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,460
back down again automatically all

1122
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,650
through the day so you literally can get

1123
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:59,099
a green house to have indoor quality

1124
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:02,550
lighting by using LEDs as a

1125
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:03,779
supplementary light in greenhouses all

1126
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,700
right we brought it on time let's hear

1127
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:10,760
it for Eric Harrington thank

1128
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:10,759
[Applause]
