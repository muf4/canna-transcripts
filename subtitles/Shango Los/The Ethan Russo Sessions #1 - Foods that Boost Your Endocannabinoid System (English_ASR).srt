1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
hey there during the first shaping fire

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,778
sessions I sat down with Kevin Joe jury

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,359
of Wunderland nursery in Humboldt County

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:11,370
and by all accounts it was a huge

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,589
success not only did he and I have a

6
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:15,178
really good time making it for you but

7
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,640
tens of thousands of you have watched

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,670
the videos and so we are calling it a

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,830
success if you have not seen the Kevin

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,710
Joe jury sessions you can go ahead and

11
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:27,570
click up on the playlist above and see

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,089
all the episodes bundled together and

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,210
watch them all at once today though I am

14
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:35,820
here to launch shaping fire sessions

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,670
number two this time I sat down with dr.

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,980
Ethan Russo I'm very grateful that over

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,760
the holidays Ethan invited me over to

18
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:47,788
his house and we did a long interview on

19
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:50,039
a ride range of topics that are now cut

20
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,710
up into topic related snippets that

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,530
we'll be publishing over the next month

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,850
or so and as you'd expect we talked a

23
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,520
lot about terpenes we talked about

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,770
managing pain with terpenes how much of

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,170
a particular terpene you need for some

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,630
sort of medical efficacy we also talked

27
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,969
about the potential for terpene toxicity

28
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:11,310
when dabbing we hit on a couple other

29
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,158
non terpene topics too including for

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,240
example how mushrooms psilocybin

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,700
mushrooms work on the brain to cause

32
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:23,938
neurological healing and also this first

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,520
episode which is on what foods that you

34
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:29,399
can eat to support your endocannabinoid

35
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,140
system in addition to the you know can I

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,630
have it a Pathak care that you're given

37
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,609
your body so so we've got a whole bunch

38
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:38,310
of episodes that are gonna be coming out

39
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:41,009
this is number one thanks a lot to true

40
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,269
terpenes for sponsoring the YouTube

41
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,670
channel so we could bring you this

42
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,938
series and here we go

43
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,939
enjoy

44
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:53,819
so you can thank you so much for getting

45
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,489
together today you know the first

46
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,649
question I wanted to ask you when you do

47
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,689
your presentations you'll often kind of

48
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,010
mention in passing that you know we can

49
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,670
do all of this cannabinoid

50
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:09,060
supplementation of our endocannabinoids

51
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,430
system to help strengthen it but often

52
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,709
you'll mention that there may be foods

53
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,969
that we can eat as well which will

54
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,340
strengthen the endocannabinoid system

55
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:18,780
and so I filed that a little bit I found

56
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,420
that you have an entire paper on it and

57
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,479
so I hope that you would break down for

58
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:26,549
us kind of simply the foods that that

59
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,609
everyone and especially patients could

60
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,219
be eating to help support and strengthen

61
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,080
their endocannabinoid system in addition

62
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,689
to the regular cannabinoid therapies

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,200
they're working on sure well there's no

64
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:43,500
simple single food that's gonna serve

65
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:48,569
that purpose on turning up the under

66
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:51,269
cannabinoid system but in general an

67
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:53,579
anti-inflammatory diet which is very

68
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:57,299
different from what Americans typically

69
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:00,239
you know that's fried foods and emphasis

70
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:05,189
on that kind of thing is not

71
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:08,340
advantageous rather in general having a

72
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:11,459
lot of fruits and vegetables it's going

73
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:15,659
to be anti-inflammatory on much more

74
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:20,370
beneficial a lot of attention has been

75
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:22,560
paid towards things like fish oil in

76
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,009
other essential fatty acids and those

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,719
are great being strongly

78
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:31,109
anti-inflammatory but we don't have any

79
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:35,759
evidence that they directly increase the

80
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:38,820
endocannabinoid tone the real answer is

81
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:42,090
that to do this nutritionally you have

82
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:45,389
to be a little bit indirect and affect

83
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,759
the microbiome the microbiome ur that

84
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:48,750
gut bacteria and people probably been

85
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,899
hearing more

86
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,780
about this it may have heard the term

87
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:58,379
probiotics which are beneficial bacteria

88
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:03,389
like our in yogurt and in lacto

89
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:07,079
fermented foods these have a strong

90
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:10,939
anti-inflammatory effect on the gut they

91
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,740
help prevent diseases such as diarrhea

92
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:16,279
but beyond that we have increasing

93
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,109
evidence that they have a key role in

94
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,509
increasing the game in the

95
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:24,180
endocannabinoid system but beyond that

96
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:27,060
it's not just a matter of increasing

97
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,060
these bacteria but they have to have the

98
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,370
right food themselves and a lot of what

99
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,379
we might throw at them and a typical

100
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,709
American diet isn't going to be helpful

101
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:40,409
that way rather they like things that

102
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:43,739
are a little bit hard for humans to

103
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:46,680
digest these include certain kinds of

104
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,870
vegetable fibers people are not likely

105
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,040
familiar with things like burdock root

106
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:59,910
or acacia fiber but these are fibers

107
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:04,200
that are normally in digestibility gut

108
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:07,950
bacteria one of the simpler groups of

109
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:13,019
foods it's really helpful are the LDA CI

110
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:15,810
so that is your onions leeks garlic and

111
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:17,209
the gut bacteria really like those as

112
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,100
well

113
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:22,859
but there are some simple supplements

114
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,830
that people can use burdock can be

115
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:29,819
obtained in supplement capsules and the

116
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:32,189
acacia fiber is available online if it's

117
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,139
not in your store and for instance it's

118
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:38,160
a simple thing they had a tablespoon of

119
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:41,879
that two granola in the morning and if

120
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:46,760
someone's taking a good probiotic with a

121
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:48,779
wide variety of species not single-agent

122
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,319
chances are they're gonna see some

123
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:54,750
benefits down the road in all kinds of

124
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,860
things first of all the regulation of

125
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,459
their gut may be less pain improved

126
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,430
sleep even clearing

127
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:05,948
of acne in the face so these are all

128
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,870
things that have been tied in to the

129
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,740
endocannabinoid system in the gut

130
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,728
bacteria

131
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,530
what is that tie end point your first

132
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:15,810
part was all about the

133
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:18,339
anti-inflammatories is the

134
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,228
anti-inflammatory what happens at the

135
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:22,679
same time as supporting the

136
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:25,149
endocannabinoid system or is it through

137
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,939
taking is it the decrease in

138
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:29,859
inflammatory that is is the actual

139
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:31,810
benefit of the endocannabinoids is

140
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:36,538
where's the tie-in well it's it's really

141
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:38,848
both but if someone's eating a lot of

142
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:41,649
fruits and vegetables particularly

143
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:44,199
dark-colored berries blueberries for

144
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:48,448
example these have a lot of flavonoids

145
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:52,000
in them these are natural antioxidants

146
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:56,050
and there are correlations that have

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,769
been drawn between having a diet that's

148
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:03,639
rich in these kinds of foods and lower

149
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:05,799
risk of things like cancer so it all

150
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:10,300
ties together and so the old adage you

151
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:13,030
are what you eat has a lot of Merit from

152
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,490
when we've talked in the past about the

153
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:17,439
entourage effect and flavonoids being

154
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,658
part of what's important of what we're

155
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,009
getting out of cannabis are we

156
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:24,370
essentially saying that we're we're

157
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:26,949
getting some of the essential parts that

158
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,959
support the endocannabinoid system just

159
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:30,038
from another source that's not cannabis

160
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,459
we're getting flavonoids we're just

161
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:34,509
getting non cannabis flavonoids and it

162
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,908
supports the endocannabinoids system

163
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:39,879
yeah to some extent we're still looking

164
00:07:36,908 --> 00:07:42,879
at those relationships but clearly

165
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:45,089
having bio flavonoids in the diet is

166
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,788
going to be an advantaged overall health

167
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:50,829
