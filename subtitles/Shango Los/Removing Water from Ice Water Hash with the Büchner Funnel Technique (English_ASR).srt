1
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,079
hey everybody

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,199
shango lose of shaping fire here on

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,399
vashon island today

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,720
and i'm here with my buddy tyler

5
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:23,358
marquart um you know oh

6
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,399
i would love to have a freeze dryer to

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,320
make hash

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,479
but it's not in the budget yet right and

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,518
so for years i like many people

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,679
um you know either take the

11
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,558
plant material the hash and you know

12
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,840
maybe you put it

13
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,839
in a tent with a dehumidifier or maybe

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,960
you blow some fans over or maybe you do

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,239
both right

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,239
um and uh i was making a hash today

17
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,919
and tyler said hey you know i've got

18
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,959
this new invention

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,800
which is a happy medium between using a

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,920
dehumidifier and fans

21
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:59,119
but isn't quite um the cost

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,800
of a um of a freeze dryer

23
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,799
and i'm like dude bring it bring it over

24
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,359
check it out and um

25
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,640
and we just used it on my hash and i'm

26
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,560
thoroughly impressed

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,920
um it's a game changer for me and i'm

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,439
going to start using this

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,040
i don't know if anybody else in the

30
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,559
scene is using this but this is the

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,600
first time i've seen it in all of my

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,600
experience

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,280
so uh so i asked ty to take a minute

34
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,000
with us and explain

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,280
um what he's up to with this uh with

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
this new tech

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,280
um or we think it's new tech and then uh

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,118
and then we've got a bunch of pictures

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,118
and videos for you so that um

40
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,478
you can uh do it yourself at home so

41
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,159
with that tai so

42
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,599
so go ahead and explain what your

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,118
solution is yeah awesome thanks for

44
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,000
having me shango um

45
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,680
basically what we've done uh is used a

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,599
filtration device

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,240
that is that would you would use similar

48
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,280
to making bho but it's done with glass

49
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,039
so there's a lab piece that's called a

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,920
bookner funnel or a buckner funnel

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,200
depending on how you're going to

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,840
pronounce it

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,478
but it basically has a glass frit disc

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,640
in it

55
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,118
and it allows you to hook up a vacuum to

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,640
it so that you can pull water through

57
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,640
there's very a lot of different chemical

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,599
uses in it for chemistry applications in

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,360
a lab

60
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:12,560
but if you were to apply a 25 micron

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,120
dry sheet for making bubble hash and

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,560
ice water seeds hash in there that would

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,840
allow you to put the

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,000
the wet hash on top of it cover it with

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,159
a piece of aluminum foil or some sort of

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,759
fabric that would seal it

67
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,680
and then poke a small hole in it you

68
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,399
could pull the air through with a vacuum

69
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,280
and pull the water out of the hash

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,840
and allow it to dry faster and quicker

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,159
without

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,959
having just either air dried or which is

73
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,759
the cheap air

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,959
medium or using the freeze dryer and so

75
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,919
this was a quick way

76
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,120
that we found within eight hours we were

77
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,479
able to remove

78
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,319
uh one ounce of water from a hundred

79
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,919
grams of hash

80
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,199
starting wet right and so after we

81
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,559
pulled it out we weighed the hash it was

82
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,919
100 grams

83
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,840
and then we pulled it through and we

84
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,598
pulled 30 grams

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,640
of or 28 grams of water out of

86
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,560
the material and uh we almost filled up

87
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,799
an entire shot glass

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,479
and the once the water has been pulled

89
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,080
out and by this point in the video

90
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,280
we've already edited in pictures of it

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,680
so you know what we're talking about

92
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,439
right

93
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,719
and you've seen it bubble right it's

94
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,878
pretty badass

95
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,039
um what's happening is that the the

96
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:24,079
vacuum is pulling all the water

97
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,878
through the bottom and leaving me with

98
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
uh with dry-ish hash certainly not wet

99
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,959
hash anymore

100
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,639
um so so and also not dry to the point

101
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,200
where it's usable like right after you

102
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,439
finish

103
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,439
uh we're still working on how long the

104
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,199
tech needs to be to go to complete but

105
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,759
we're finding that almost within 24

106
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,158
hours

107
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,039
the stuff that i ran yesterday and did

108
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,000
this

109
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,318
process yesterday afternoon and evening

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,878
um

111
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,000
is already smokeable today so in in one

112
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,239
day now certainly

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,680
i'm gonna let it uh fan dry for another

114
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,640
day or so but really

115
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,080
it's it feels done it looks done yep and

116
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,359
we didn't have any major popping or

117
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,599
anything going like that there was a

118
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,120
little bit with uh just a smed

119
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,119
a little bit that we first did in the

120
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,158
beginning but like after the second test

121
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,519
it came out good and

122
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,280
from there on it just seemed like it

123
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,599
works yeah so

124
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,680
one of the cool things about it is um

125
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,839
how inexpensive it is right

126
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,879
so if we're you know while this is not

127
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,478
exactly

128
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,560
you know a uh freeze drawing so well

129
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,319
it's not at all freeze rising solution

130
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,199
that's a solution that's gonna cost you

131
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,439
you know 25 to 3 500 bucks to get into

132
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,120
whereas this costs how much uh we spent

133
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,040
just under a hundred dollars

134
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,240
for everything the so it includes a

135
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,879
small vacuum

136
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,639
um at the buchner funnel um and then

137
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,199
also a beaker regular beaker to attach

138
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,680
it into

139
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,319
so so if you have a lab you know if

140
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,240
you're if you

141
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,360
if you're licensed or unlicensed and

142
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,199
have a lab

143
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,280
um you know you may already have this

144
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,879
stuff in your lab and it's just a

145
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,638
different way of applying it

146
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,879
and if you're like me and you don't have

147
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,319
a lab or any kind of lab gear

148
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,319
like i'm able to get all the stuff on

149
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,560
amazon for under 100 bucks which is a

150
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,680
really nice solution i would say that

151
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,399
this pretty much

152
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,720
um removes the risk of molding right

153
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,799
yeah

154
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,759
like you've got different timings to dry

155
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,560
but i think that

156
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,960
since it's not sopping wet really your

157
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,519
your

158
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,198
mold risk is is very low now yeah you're

159
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,799
definitely increasing the chances

160
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,400
of success and reducing the

161
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,639
contamination issues

162
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,758
and uh just making it a lot faster and

163
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,519
more efficient now

164
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,960
obviously the air you're sucking past it

165
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,719
needs to be clean right like if you're

166
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,000
sucking moldy air past it like

167
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,280
you're going to increase your chances

168
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
because you're increasing the amount

169
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,439
it's hitting but

170
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,560
if you're doing it in clean environment

171
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,478
which obviously you're going to aim to

172
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,000
do when you're making your hash

173
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,680
you should be in a pretty good position

174
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,600
to make sure that it dries quickly

175
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,439
and you get the most water out of it as

176
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,879
possible i mean we we removed almost

177
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,918
what thirty percent of the water

178
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,839
yeah in there and then there was

179
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,279
probably another ten percent so fast

180
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,959
yeah quickly and it was uh

181
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,638
and it leaves it with a nice texture too

182
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,439
like it's it's a malleable usable

183
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,038
texture

184
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,478
um it doesn't create a texture like

185
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,000
freeze drying does where it becomes

186
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,758
crumbly and dusty at all

187
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
but it also doesn't grease out right

188
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,240
yeah and so you get like

189
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,240
almost uh kind of like a a a toffee or a

190
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,720
caramel kind of like consistency out of

191
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,439
it where

192
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,319
it would be like a pre sandy toffee yeah

193
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,240
yeah it's

194
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,080
interesting so um you know and again

195
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,478
with the ice water hash is golden gold

196
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,038
out

197
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,318
and uh and so we had good good runs this

198
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,959
time for a good r d

199
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,120
and it really made the uh end product

200
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,120
look and come out much better so yeah

201
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
so anyway so if you if this has any

202
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,280
interest to you after uh seeing the

203
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,439
video

204
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,959
and hearing our little spin about it um

205
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,918
go ahead and check

206
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,478
in the description um uh we've got some

207
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,000
links

208
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:36,719
to the the baseline tech that tyler

209
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,160
um developed for this and and you know

210
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,720
this is like rev1 right

211
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,759
we know it works because because we've

212
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
used it

213
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,960
but we assume that other folks in the

214
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,319
scene will build upon this and we're

215
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,038
going to keep on working on this idea

216
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,800
too

217
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,639
and and you know in the end we'll just

218
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,038
keep sharing with each other and find

219
00:06:50,639 --> 00:07:03,840
good diy tech for everybody so cool

220
00:06:53,038 --> 00:07:03,839
thanks tai thank you

221
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,159
you
