the art canvas groves facilities for the

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,720
last nine years Jodie has design built

20
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,159
and retrofitted well over a million

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,439
square feet of some of the biggest

22

Europe for Joanie locust you're too

27
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:12,620

28
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,200
smart oak roses company that I founded

29
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,740
about five or six years ago brief

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,170
description of what we do as you were

31
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:23,989
just told do a lot of design builds of

32
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,400
green house as well as indoor we do have

33
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:26,839
some touch points on outdoor I'm

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,950
specifically going into the hemp

35
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,799
industry from the last couple of years

36
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,920
now but our primary focus over the last

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,420
decade has been building high efficient

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,990
groves we work with companies such as

39
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:42,140
canopy growth a war up we've done some

40
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:44,478
consulting for tilray a lot of stuff in

41
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,879
the US but those our biggest clients and

42
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,700
we worked on multiple

43
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:49,929
comments to date as well South America

44
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,969
we're doing some land development

45
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:58,570
projects as well as Australia Plus move

46
00:01:54,968 --> 00:02:00,188
forward into him the new frontier now I

47
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:03,099
know hemp has been around for a long

48
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:04,989
time in the title of the talk new

49
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:07,149
frontiers really regards to the

50
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:08,889
explosion of the CBD market you know him

51
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:11,409
goes back thousands and thousands of

52
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,509
years longer than we even know and you

53
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:16,090
know we know that industrial hemp has

54
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:17,229
been in the game for a very very long

55
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,450
time

56
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:21,340
which is slowly sucking ramp up more in

57
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:23,469
the US markets and thankfully now that

58
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,759
we have the farm bill that's gonna allow

59
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:33,939
us to really push into that OCD and for

60
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:35,409
fiber hemp now what I've seen in the

61
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:37,810
market the last couple years that since

62
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:41,259
we've been involved doing consulting and

63
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,479
said enough farms I myself do have some

64
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:47,039
farmland down in southern Colorado

65
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:50,078
we're running outs some variations of

66
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,340
variation greenhouses doing a lot of

67
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:53,349
data capture over the last couple of

68
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,209
years over the plans to scale

69
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,879
tremendously were getting ready to

70
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:00,729
launch a farm in southern Texas about

71
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:04,030
2000 acres looking at about another two

72
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:05,729
or three thousand acres there's a lot of

73
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,459
people looking from the campus space

74
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:11,679
getting into him there's some challenges

75
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:13,209
with that now some of you if you do come

76
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,700
from the cannabis space you know that so

77
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,129
the last ten years 12 years as we pushed

78
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:20,828
into of regulatory environments there

79
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:23,379
was a lot of you know ramping up and

80
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:26,049
learning curves to understand growing

81
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:29,560
commercially from growing in your closet

82
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:30,939
your basement garage etc now that we've

83
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,009
kind of seen some of that markets

84
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:34,370
stabilized a little bit across the US

85
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:36,560
market

86
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,890
you know now we're in a second boom of

87
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,590
health and CVD now the US market is

88
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:44,209
starting to lead the CBD markets on the

89
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,650
planet so to speak although there are

90
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,140
some countries that have been doing CBD

91
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,730
you know for quite some time and we know

92
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:51,979
that some of that has been being

93
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:55,269
imported into the US market for reasons

94
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:59,479
of lack of availability of the market

95
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:02,060
and consistency in the market but

96
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,259
pushing it from campus into hemp is a

97
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,689
little different it's a little

98
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:07,250
challenging you know nutrition is a

99
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:09,560
little different we're growing outdoor

100
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,509
that's different so there's a lot of

101
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,580
variables mixed into that so it's it's

102
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:16,639
not a long one if you're coming from

103
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,650
cannabis commercial cultivation to get

104
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,120
into hip now it does put some people

105
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,620
ahead of the curve because we have an

106
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,740
understanding of the plane itself is

107
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,199
it's not a standard crop does have some

108
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,750
special requirements you know nutrition

109
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,240
being a big big one water which we'll

110
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,750
get a little bit more into later but

111
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,210
this crossover can't put some people a

112
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,670
little ahead of the curve

113
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:42,620
you know I myself in using you know what

114
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,300
we've learned over the last decade in a

115
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,780
regulatory commercial environments and

116
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:50,600
we're applying that into the hip market

117
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:52,729
now fortunately pimp is going to be a

118
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,180
little less restrictive although

119
00:04:52,730 --> 00:05:00,560
currently the FDA is meeting to work on

120
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:03,470
regulations with the USDA we do have

121
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,480
some insights of what is going on in

122
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,980
those regulations we work with a couple

123
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,650
scientists that have been asked to be on

124
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,379
the advisory board for legislation which

125
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:14,539
does help us get an understanding when

126
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:16,819
we actually go into solar clients to say

127
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,170
hey this is how things are moving this

128
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,699
is what's actually being written down

129
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,540
these are the things that they're

130
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:25,449
looking at

131
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:29,410
now total was a little bit more base on

132
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:32,379
that we know that big pharma his

133
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:35,140
lobbying heavily in heart against the

134
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:37,930
CBD market we saw this happen two years

135
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:40,389
ago when there was a major pullback from

136
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,459
the FDA on hemp companies that were

137
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:45,279
putting up products in the market and

138
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:46,389
they were labeled improperly and I don't

139
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,219
know if you interviewed been paying

140
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,479
attention to what's going on in the news

141
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,670
or what's going on in the business

142
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,220
industry on the head side but it wiped

143
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,490
out six or seven of the largest and

144
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,110
companies two years ago shut them down

145
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,790
so we know the big pharma is against it

146
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,500
but we know they are waiting on the

147
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,080
sidelines waiting for regulations be put

148
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,699
in place so they can also step in I mean

149
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,370
you've got company inside the Amazon

150
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,680
they released a products I believe about

151
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,810
three or four months ago CES is coming

152
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,699
to the marketplace Walgreens you know

153
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,019
and they tread very lightly and some of

154
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:19,329
these come with a very conservative like

155
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:21,879
CVS but they're stepping into it because

156
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:25,060
they know that it's going to be a very

157
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:26,918
big industry but without the regulations

158
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,319
of place everyone's still being very

159
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:32,109
cautious so something that has to be

160
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:36,159
paid attention to but I think it's not

161
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:39,460
going to be as tight of a loopholes you

162
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,500
know that we see in cannabis especially

163
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:42,759
on the value about product side that's

164
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,559
where you're gonna see a lot of the

165
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:49,788
strangleholds being put in place

166
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:52,969
let's jump forward a little bit you know

167
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:55,908
getting into any new industry cannabis

168
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:58,158
was a tough one moving targets

169
00:06:55,908 --> 00:07:01,248
you know hemp is as well there's there

170
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:03,829
are some fundamentals that's you need to

171
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:06,139
be aware of and he needs to be educated

172
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:07,879
before you to say hey let's grab some

173
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,429
seeds and less throw in the ground or

174
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,689
get some starters get some clones

175
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:14,058
because if you do that you're gonna find

176
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:16,819
yourself in a world of pain

177
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:19,219
research is massive when it comes to

178
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:20,598
getting involved in the industry you

179
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:24,649
need to know what you're looking at

180
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:25,668
everything from the farm operator even

181
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:28,399
if you're just trying to get some dirt

182
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:30,079
for yourself outside of an operating

183
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,209
farm now there's some advantages to

184
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,369
working with farms because you know

185
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:35,509
there's traditional farms that five six

186
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:38,209
seven generations that have been around

187
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:39,829
for a long time some of these you know

188
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:43,129
these people are struggling and it's sad

189
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:45,259
to see in him can also be a big help to

190
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:52,249
turn some of these farms around and save

191
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:53,838
big AG as we see it today once you are

192
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:55,549
able to do some research and you know

193
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:58,548
you find yourself a farm or find some

194
00:07:55,548 --> 00:08:01,548
dirt to work with you want to create a

195
00:07:58,548 --> 00:08:05,058
strategy and strategy is a multiple in

196
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:07,638
multiple levels to that everything from

197
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:09,019
business plan compliance how are you

198
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,788
going to distribute how are even a

199
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:12,408
process who's going to process are you

200
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:12,750
going to do it where you going to do

201
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,969
that

202
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,699
you know you have to put a plan in place

203
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,560
and be able to follow that plan and push

204
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,569
through I mean this is a business just

205
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,189
like anything else you know what there's

206
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:26,310
a lot of money to be made and that's

207
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:29,100
without a doubt but there's a lot of

208
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,668
risk as well and research and educating

209
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,620
yourself it's gonna be the best way to

210
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:36,478
pay attention to risk assessment because

211
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,190
anytime you start a business you have to

212
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,408
pay attention on both sides there's a

213
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,789
profitability and there's risk and we

214
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:43,620
always want to try to slide that scale

215
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:45,659
on the risk assessment side as low as

216
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,789
possible especially if you're using your

217
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:50,069
own money or for even more so if you're

218
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:53,610
raising money and capital to invest into

219
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:55,350
your business the compliance I know

220
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,000
we're a little you know we're a little

221
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,269
kind of the great area with that

222
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,070
specifically States more more states are

223
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,590
coming online for example Texas just

224
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:07,050
passed their hemp bill even though it is

225
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,090
federally legal not all states I've

226
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:11,669
gotten on board with what hims gonna

227
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,769
look like for them so that is one thing

228
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:15,419
you need to pay attention to contact the

229
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:17,159
agricultural department

230
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,829
you know there's several divisions

231
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,419
within state government as well as local

232
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,070
municipalities that are gonna want to

233
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:26,610
weigh in or they're gonna have some

234
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:29,250
comments to make so go and ask these

235
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,990
people are very helpful in most cases

236
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,049
that we've been in quite a few states

237
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,580
where it was an open door sit down I

238
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:38,519
mean we were just in California and

239
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:41,250
Sonoma and Sonoma County they were very

240
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,929
very helpful and very open about what

241
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,460
their position was and they were willing

242
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:45,659
to help to make sure that you were going

243
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,320
to be set up properly

244
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:53,009
so take the time find out what's going

245
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:56,220
on where you want to grow business plane

246
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:57,720
is a big deal I've seen a lot of

247
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,570
businesses try to start a business with

248
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,370
that one they don't have to be you know

249
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,040
next-level you don't have to have an MBA

250
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,600
from Harvard / a genius in the business

251
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,789
world to put a business plan together

252
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,769
do some research if you don't know

253
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:12,719
what's entailed in business plans but

254
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:14,309
these are going to help steer you in the

255
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,230
right direction from a business

256
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:18,059
perspective you know there's two sides

257
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,700
of the business those operations and

258
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:22,769
there's business we always recommend or

259
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,110
myself specifically recommends if you

260
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:26,220
know the cultivation side don't try to

261
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,090
learn the business side if you don't

262
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,850
know much about it

263
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,710
get someone involved it's worth the time

264
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,470
it's worth the effort because at the end

265
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,000
of the day the operations can do what it

266
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,440
can to its best ability if you don't

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,899
have a good financial plane and a

268
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,760
business model that you're gonna be in

269
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:46,740
the world pain it's for that question so

270
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:51,480
let's move on to the better parts of

271
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:54,149
hemp the cultivation now you know most

272
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,120
of these crops are grown outdoors so you

273
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:58,500
know a lot of people think you just drop

274
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,490
some seeds in the ground you're good to

275
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,980
go

276
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:05,190
I actually I get a lot of calls I spoke

277
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,830
with a woman the other day she was told

278
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,910
oh yeah we're gonna drive by 40 acres it

279
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,400
was a pre-existing farm they were

280
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:14,250
growing corn you know there's some

281
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:18,449
structures on site there's barns some

282
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:19,710
silos no equipment no irrigation shears

283
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,500
think no if there's water rights and

284
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:24,060
she's told you can you just go and get

285
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,039
some genetics and drop them in the

286
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,209
ground and you're good to go

287
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,389
so I started asking questions first

288
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:33,470
question well how much capital do you

289
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:35,299
oh I have about $200,000 I said well man

290
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,100
what are you gonna do $200,000

291
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:39,469
have you done any research whatsoever oh

292
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,450
no my friend told me that it's it's it's

293
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,259
easy I guess get some seeds put him in

294
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,320
the ground he said do you know which

295
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:46,850
seeds costs you have any concept of

296
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,230
labor who's going to take care of the

297
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,519
plants how are you gonna feed them how

298
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,300
you're gonna water them how they're

299
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,778
gonna be trimmed how you're gonna

300
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:56,208
harvest them and then she had no idea

301
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:59,208
none but just because people are telling

302
00:11:56,208 --> 00:12:01,489
her hey this is easy it doesn't take

303
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:03,619
much so there's all these different

304
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,209
components that are involved in it and

305
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,009
yet one thing we always like to do is we

306
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,869
look at weather studies is one of our

307
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:11,500
first components you know you want to

308
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:14,870
take a look at the last 10 15 years

309
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,028
Colorado for example has impossible hail

310
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,320
storms especially down south or anything

311
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:21,588
that's close to little to the range

312
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,690
mountain ranges you can access this

313
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:24,860
information pretty much online but these

314
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,649
are things you want to pay attention to

315
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,659
you know temperature spikes over a

316
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:31,309
10-year period how hot is it getting was

317
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:33,559
the hottest point was the driest point

318
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:36,078
humidity rain levels you want to be

319
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:38,689
prepared and weather is a big component

320
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:41,028
yes you're growing outside a lot of

321
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,610
people do it farming as is an outside

322
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:45,889
you know agricultural application you

323
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:48,740
know but temp is a little different than

324
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:50,750
other crops you know the farm that we're

325
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,549
working with like said fit generation

326
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,149
immigrant watermelon pumpkins and

327
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:56,240
cabbage

328
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:57,889
well they do water applications a little

329
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,649
bit different than we require for him

330
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:04,189
they're watering 12 to every 12 to 13

331
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:05,659
days and won't survive that the

332
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,270
gentleman ran him for the last four

333
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:10,399
years and he was not even able to

334
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:14,809
pound per plant even planting by May

335
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:17,240
fifteenth reason why water so weather

336
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:19,669
and having knowledge of of what's going

337
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,220
on this is a big part you know soil

338
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:26,089
water those two are major components and

339
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:28,700
growing these plants too much water too

340
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,350
little water there was too little so it

341
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,509
started happening as the grouse arts dry

342
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,580
now then it's cracking the cracks then

343
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:36,799
expose the roots next thing you know the

344
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,360
plants shut down or die

345
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:43,099
I mean little they will dry from the

346
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:45,440
roots up into the plant so a soil water

347
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,090
you know these two components itself are

348
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,890
bigger than most people think you need

349
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,540
to know what's in the soil you need to

350
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:52,789
know what's in the water a lot of these

351
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:56,149
farms and a lot of applications coming

352
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:58,789
from water Asian they're coming from

353
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:01,009
wells and wells could be very high in

354
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:05,240
iron iron will kill at your plants

355
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:08,840
without question also we've seen arsenic

356
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,909
as well in well water as you know to go

357
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,160
along with iron you know so there are

358
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:16,069
some things you need to be aware of and

359
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:17,719
understand what's in the soil and the

360
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,950
water because those are two biggest

361
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,680
components outside of the weather

362
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,540
weather we have no control over soil and

363
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,489
the water you do so you need to take

364
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:27,829
samples you need to understand what's in

365
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:31,310
there then you can actually build a

366
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:34,090
strategic nutrition application for your

367
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:37,639
plants and your harvest and your crops

368
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,990
you know nutrition is a big one we've

369
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,500
come across a lot of hemp farms that

370
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:46,610
we've seen general applications of you

371
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,190
know everything from Simplot CSI you

372
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:50,169
know some of the just the major

373
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:53,529
manufacturers of

374
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:55,990
new nutrition or fertilizers for other

375
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:58,958
crops you know you know for vegetables

376
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:01,299
fruits what have you not to say they

377
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:03,059
don't work but there's no micronutrients

378
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:06,250
there's no calcium supplementation

379
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:10,179
there's some certain things or specific

380
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:12,639
things that are missing and yes NPK can

381
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:14,919
get you there but NDK is not going to

382
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,019
increase CBD levels spike and increase

383
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:19,179
yields especially if it's not given in

384
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,940
the right doses you know so general

385
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:24,009
farming you know these guys are great at

386
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,000
what they do in those crops but again

387
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:29,439
you know hemp has special requirements

388
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,328
sure he could get away with it but you

389
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,519
know what do the research because if you

390
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:34,958
put a proper program together you're

391
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,570
gonna see better yields and you'll see

392
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,899
higher CBD levels what we're seeing

393
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:42,970
outdoor on the top of the chart is

394
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:46,570
depending on genetics is anywhere from

395
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,100
14 to 16 percent on CBD levels now

396
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,610
depending on how that gets processed

397
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:54,129
after harvest dried those conditions

398
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,810
they can drop that cb2 level by anywhere

399
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:57,278
from four to five percent so next thing

400
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:59,559
you know you're harvesting at fifteen

401
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,389
fourteen by the time you get it for a

402
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,338
processor to come and look at it or to

403
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:06,278
sell it we already done the ten percent

404
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:07,839
so all these things matter and how you

405
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:10,059
you're doing it because the higher the

406
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,040
CBD and percentage the more valuable the

407
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:14,919
crop is and right now what we're seeing

408
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:17,409
is there's a lot of pillaging going on

409
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:19,328
there's you know for example Colorado

410
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,889
doesn't have a lot of processing that so

411
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:23,019
we've got guys coming from other states

412
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:24,639
and blocking everybody on the head and

413
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:26,828
beat them down for the biomass kind of

414
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,129
to the degree of you know what will buy

415
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:32,849
for twenty five dollars a pound

416
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:34,320
by us or you don't sell it and it's

417
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,450
unfortunate because people work hard

418
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,980
guys are putting on very long days and

419
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,759
then you got guys strong are mean

420
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,470
because they can't get rid of it

421
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,169
so you know having the highest EP Global

422
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,029
Content that you can is also very

423
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:50,689
important which kind of falls back and

424
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:54,990
starts flowing into the genetic aspect

425
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:57,510
between nutrition with your soil and

426
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:01,169
water again like I'm saying it will

427
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:03,029
increase your CVD levels ultimately if

428
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:05,188
you start building greenhouses which is

429
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:09,029
something we're starting to do for a

430
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:10,800
different type of supply chain you're

431
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,599
gonna go year-round and you're going to

432
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,639
see higher CBD levels because you're

433
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,129
able to control the environment a whole

434
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,910
lot more than just going outside we seen

435
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,240
greenhouse

436
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,589
hit numbers as high as 20 to 23 percent

437
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,500
but again you know the capital venture

438
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:27,299
there's is a bit more costly but you can

439
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,890
harvest five times a year and in a

440
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:33,960
single structure of depending on how you

441
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:37,950
set up your harvesting genetics genetics

442
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,019
is a big component in this hemp game so

443
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:43,319
to speak there's a lot of people

444
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:45,900
claiming feminized genetics but

445
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:48,059
unfortunately what's being sold at

446
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,519
market it's not feminized these guys are

447
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:54,629
breeding or trying to breed feminized

448
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,470
genetics outside can't do that but we

449
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,140
never happened

450
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,929
there will be cross-contamination

451
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,150
so currently as we see right now we know

452
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:03,950
about seven or eight major lawsuits for

453
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,929
hundreds of millions of dollars because

454
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,179
they were buying genetics that were

455
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:09,620
being labeled as feminized and then they

456
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:11,960
kicked out out of the fact as part of

457
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:14,869
their defense there's no such thing as

458
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,660
truly feminized genetics there's a four

459
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:19,789
to seven percent chance of man's that

460
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,830
study that's actually in the marketplace

461
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:24,440
has been published was also attached to

462
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:28,879
a case study that was done of breeding

463
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,919
feminized seeds outside so that in

464
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,870
itself the problematic so there's

465
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:35,270
companies that have bought and spent

466
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:37,969
millions of dollars on seeds have spent

467
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:39,950
more money on actual their farms and

468
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,529
getting things set up and then their

469
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:45,890
crops got pollinated and they've lost

470
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:48,519
millions and millions of dollars this

471
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,049
goes back to research

472
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,849
researching what you're getting and

473
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:54,619
especially in the genetic side is

474
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:55,719
extremely important because you don't

475
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:58,459
want to be caught in that situation

476
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,720
where you get well you know almost at

477
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,259
the end and you're not even realizing

478
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,700
you there's you know crops of him called

479
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:06,259
name next thing you know you're looking

480
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,529
in September and you go wait a second

481
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:11,450
why am I seeing seeds something that you

482
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:13,788
just need to be aware of there's some

483
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,730
great genetics in the market something

484
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:19,308
fantastic genetics but you have to be

485
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:22,640
aware of what you're buying there's some

486
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:25,579
guys that have been selling industrial

487
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,770
hemp that's CBD and guys have run them

488
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:32,599
out makes they know they're getting 2%

489
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:34,460
3% CBD also lawsuits happening so so

490
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:36,769
going back to the first comment I was

491
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,179
making research you know know what

492
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:41,389
you're getting you know what you're

493
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:43,610
looking at ask talk to people you know a

494
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,840
lot of people are very open about you

495
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:47,298
and what they're doing to a degree of

496
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:48,740
well where you're getting your genetics

497
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:51,200
from oh well we get it from h.t.t.h

498
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,710
seeds or we're getting it from blossom

499
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,960
seeds you know pay attention and know

500
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:59,450
what you're buying and get most of the

501
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,509
time if it sounds too good to be true it

502
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,730
is most of the time I can tell you right

503
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:06,890
now the average cost of a quote

504
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,929
feminized seed is about a dollar in the

505
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,419
marketplace we're going to see that

506
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:13,640
shift because the seed industry is a

507
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:15,860
booming opportunity in the market as

508
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,720
well because there's not enough genetics

509
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:19,490
and people are scrambling to try to get

510
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,880
them to market or get them to you know

511
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,589
operators but there's people that are

512
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,419
jumping in that bandwagon and they're

513
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:29,720
they're throwing a lot of nonsense and

514
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:31,700
fake things into the mix I think we will

515
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,110
see that price on genetics start to

516
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,480
slide down within the next two to three

517
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:36,740
years that makes three to five years is

518
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,360
going to be interesting to see because

519
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,980
even though there's a lot of people

520
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,859
getting involved right now

521
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,620
last year we saw probably about 60% crop

522
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:48,259
failures and what happened even here in

523
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:50,959
Oregon Morgan struggled because of early

524
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:53,658
rains and early and high humidity levels

525
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,639
so there was a lot of you know botrytis

526
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:57,559
of Bruce areum a lot of blood mold that

527
00:20:55,638 --> 00:20:59,808
was happening to get larger yields here

528
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:01,788
in Oregon but that becomes a problem if

529
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:06,980
there's too much humidity so there was a

530
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:08,269
lot of crop failures here as well but

531
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,819
getting back to the genetic side of

532
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:11,778
things the you know there several

533
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:14,538
options or seeds

534
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:15,619
there's clones there starters you know

535
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:17,148
the starters aren't gonna always

536
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:19,609
guarantee you even if they're common

537
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:21,949
feminized as well they're not guaranteed

538
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:24,379
to be feminized you know so what we've

539
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,909
suggested is you know tour clients that

540
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,679
have bought some of these starters

541
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:31,070
they're gonna have to walk through all

542
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,960
their crops and eyeball every single

543
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:35,750
plant to make sure they're not gonna get

544
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,639
a meal and you better know what you're

545
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,638
looking at because if you skip past one

546
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:42,740
or two I mean it could wipe out a fair

547
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:45,500
amount of your crop pollen goes very far

548
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,120
and then it doesn't take much to push it

549
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,450
not a lot of breeze will get it where it

550
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,998
needs to go

551
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,979
clones that's another marketplace that

552
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:56,409
we're seeing pop up a lot last year or

553
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:59,259
going into this season clothes are great

554
00:21:56,409 --> 00:22:00,639
but you need to know you know what

555
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:03,190
you're dealing with when it comes to

556
00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:04,928
generational cuttings you know how old

557
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,479
are the mothers where do they come from

558
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:08,769
how are they being taken care of I mean

559
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:12,609
there's a lot of components with that as

560
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:14,288
well so it's you have to again you have

561
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:15,308
to educate yourself and know what you're

562
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:17,440
dealing with and if you're going to go

563
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:19,450
buy clothes go to the farm and look

564
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,669
because one of the biggest problems I've

565
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:24,278
seen with farms offering or nurseries

566
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:26,499
offer evening explodes as the mothers

567
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:27,759
are root bound and I'll tell you a

568
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:30,190
little thing about group down mothers

569
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,528
they will cut production down by 50 to

570
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,729
75 percent and that's a fact

571
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:36,009
we've seen this in the cannabis space

572
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:38,288
those mothers are sitting in containers

573
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:40,179
too long they're they're gonna get

574
00:22:38,288 --> 00:22:42,940
stressed and the offspring are gonna

575
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:46,028
give you literally 50 to 75% unless a

576
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,588
video that they should and I've seen

577
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:50,338
this myself a lot seven or eight years

578
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:52,928
ago at my own facility back in Colorado

579
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:54,519
the crew wasn't changing mothers and

580
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:55,959
Tommy fashion and I'd like to rotate

581
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:59,229
them every two to three months depending

582
00:22:55,959 --> 00:23:02,919
on how many cuttings were taking we ran

583
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:04,838
on a harvest and I mean I'd walk past

584
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,369
the room and I looked in and I go what

585
00:23:04,838 --> 00:23:09,128
are we growing in here and it was dark

586
00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:11,439
star dark stars a large yield er very

587
00:23:09,128 --> 00:23:13,238
much cuter and I looked in the room and

588
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,328
it was learning look like oh gee look

589
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:17,739
like golf ball-sized nuts and when we

590
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:20,259
waited out it was on a seventy percent

591
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:21,069
lower from that harvest to the prior

592
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:24,490
because

593
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:26,308
others will move out so educate yourself

594
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:30,819
research to know what you're buying

595
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:33,250
you know IPM pressures are a big deal in

596
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:34,720
outdoor you get into green door you can

597
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,269
control a bit more naturally indoors

598
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,159
where it's gonna be your best option

599
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:41,829
but also know what your pressures are

600
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:43,960
know what other farms are growing around

601
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:47,528
you know what the wind patterns are like

602
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,450
know if it is an outdoor farm how they

603
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:52,179
sprain and who's spring because that's

604
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,500
all aerial application so these are the

605
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:55,360
things that need to pay attention to as

606
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,819
well because you don't want to be too

607
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,528
close to a farm or downwind and they're

608
00:23:57,819 --> 00:24:00,939
coming in they're spraying you know

609
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:03,220
traditional cross which they could

610
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:06,580
pretty much spray whatever they want you

611
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:09,850
know including Eagle 20 so you have to

612
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:12,579
be aware of applications of fungicides

613
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:14,500
pesticides surrounding you then the

614
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:15,519
other portion is the pressures as far as

615
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,250
pest

616
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:20,169
you know how in patterns is someone

617
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,388
growing grapes upstream from you because

618
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:25,028
you know grapes have a large tendency to

619
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:27,069
produce a lot of powdery mildew as well

620
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:28,388
as other problems but if you're in a

621
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,678
wind pattern that come it's going to be

622
00:24:28,388 --> 00:24:32,019
pushed your way how are you gonna deal

623
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,820
with that you know anybody - pest

624
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:36,308
management is a very big deal as well

625
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:37,450
you know bug control you know there's a

626
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:41,308
lot of ways that you can handle that

627
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:44,200
with outdoor crops but again it all

628
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:46,240
circles back to research understanding

629
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,250
educating what you're getting yourself

630
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,859
into

631
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:53,319
if you're able to spend some time and do

632
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:54,908
your due diligence I mean and honestly

633
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:57,369
due diligence should take you a couple

634
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:59,830
months to three months on average is

635
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:02,469
what we've seen to get a good idea of

636
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:04,509
where you want to grow what you want to

637
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,579
grow how you want to grow it the

638
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:09,400
marketplace genetics and all these

639
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:11,500
components I mean you'll be in a good

640
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,350
then a much better spot to be successful

641
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,179
you know and and the reward is gonna be

642
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:18,639
great at least for the next three four

643
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:21,490
or five years you know because you know

644
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,419
supply and the US market is is not

645
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:27,669
consistent and it's all over the map

646
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:30,788
last year Revlon a colleague of mine

647
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:33,520
brokered a deal for 250,000 kilos for

648
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:36,369
one purchase with Revlon just one

649
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:39,119
company they wiped out 60 or 70 percent

650
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:41,739
of what was available in the US market

651
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:44,439
so now imagine when you got companies

652
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:47,558
like the Amazons coming in and the CVS's

653
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,880
and adult food companies all these other

654
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:50,408
companies are wanting to get into the

655
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,929
industry and they're researching you

656
00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:56,200
know value products right now the supply

657
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:59,259
is is at the bottom wrong compared to

658
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,140
the demand so there's a lot of a lot of

659
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:03,669
room to get in now and set up and get

660
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,640
through the next few years before you

661
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:08,409
see a major you know pushback in the

662
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,390
market or we'll start to see that price

663
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:12,640
volatility start to hit it might be

664
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,288
longer but just what I've seen and

665
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,259
traveling across the country and you

666
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:18,849
know talking to new farms coming online

667
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:20,829
it seems to be reasonable you know three

668
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:23,959
or four years is a good time to get in

669
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:25,730
you just have to be smart

670
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,869
and if you do it right and execute

671
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,929
that's the other thing you have to

672
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:33,019
execute it's a lot of hard work it is

673
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:35,570
there's there's no way around it there's

674
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:37,190
no fast solution to make money but if

675
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:39,439
you do it right I mean you're gonna look

676
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:42,528
anywhere from you know 40,000 per acre

677
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,190
on the low side up to 120 130 thousand

678
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:51,648
dollars as it grows those are real

679
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:54,460
numbers we see them all the time so you

680
00:26:51,648 --> 00:26:56,839
know my job here is to give you guys an

681
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,058
education on what I've learned what I've

682
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:02,058
seen and give you enough for you to stop

683
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:03,230
if you're ready to jump in you know be

684
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:05,868
able to ask some questions

685
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,579
at least adjust where you're going and

686
00:27:05,868 --> 00:27:08,898
maybe steer your ship a little bit

687
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:11,359
different so that you're going to be

688
00:27:08,898 --> 00:27:12,739
successful because that's the reason for

689
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:17,288
all these seminars is for everyone to be

690
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:21,069
successful and that's about a look at

691
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:21,069
great do we have some questions

692
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,910
thank you very much when you were saying

693
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,859
the indoor CVD was getting twenty to

694
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:32,170
twenty three percent what was at TVC

695
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:34,479
numbers they were still point zero three

696
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:38,560
or less told to you cleared the whole

697
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,289
told th da TCA so so test result based

698
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,419
on federal and you know mandates yeah

699
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:46,420
now the touch base will not a little bit

700
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,009
more and maybe I'm giving up a little

701
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:51,009
too much of my business manager probably

702
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:54,069
would agree sometimes I'm just you know

703
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:57,730
mr. talkie you know there are ways to

704
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:58,929
monitor your crops and testing early and

705
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,400
this is something that we did on

706
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:02,200
cannabis about five or six years ago

707
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,540
maybe actually about six or seven years

708
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,190
ago we started harvesting or taking

709
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:09,099
cuttings from plants and getting them

710
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,680
tested prior to maturity dates and what

711
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:13,750
we started discovering was and I don't

712
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,279
quite a few genetics you know CB

713
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:20,650
profiles and THC cannabis were higher

714
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:23,049
three weeks out from maturity or harvest

715
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:26,530
and that has it got closer the TC rose

716
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:29,319
and the Kevin Waits drops so one thing

717
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:30,549
that we've started doing last season

718
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:32,649
it's the same kind of thing even on

719
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:34,690
outdoor crops and greenhouses as well

720
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,670
you can start taking samples and see

721
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,960
what your profiles look like because

722
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,860
there is a point that they're gonna be

723
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,950
at their widest and then they're gonna

724
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:44,349
start to close and change so you know

725
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:46,299
physiological aspect of the plan changes

726
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:48,099
as it was closed for maturity so doesn't

727
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:50,069
make sense yeah I thought they were more

728
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:52,889
in relationship with the entire

729
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:54,779
I realize they are came together yeah I

730
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:56,070
mean they they do they shift and every

731
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:58,139
Jeanette's a little different you know

732
00:28:56,069 --> 00:29:00,419
there's a lot of similarities you know a

733
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,910
greenhouse you're gonna see a higher

734
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:05,070
level and the reason beams because it's

735
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,570
consistent if you're getting the same

736
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:08,220
amount of par value every day because

737
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:10,079
you can control that it's if your light

738
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,900
DEP being in the wintertime you know

739
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,579
you're removing a lot of the variables

740
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,680
you have no control over by going into

741
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:20,220
greenhouse and the great thing about

742
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:22,830
greenhouses too is when it comes with

743
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,390
processing it's a lot faster to get

744
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:26,189
processed because there's no dust

745
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:29,040
there's no dirt there's no bugs or it's

746
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:31,140
clean so that stuff if you process a lot

747
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,759
faster into the degree of the processing

748
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,500
facility I can do 15 or 20 thousand

749
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,990
thousand pounds a day can hit the top

750
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,059
into that market or the top of number if

751
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:41,220
it's greenhouse product if it's outdoor

752
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,690
depend on location it might hit ten

753
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,460
because there comes a point in time

754
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:47,009
they're gonna have to stop clean break

755
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,519
down clean break down so there are some

756
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:49,109
advantages

757
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,879
big advantages to the greenhouse but

758
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:53,069
that's why you're gonna see the higher

759
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,710
CBD numbers okay how much did interested

760
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:57,569
to use you know we do a lot of cherry

761
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,750
wine as you know what we like just

762
00:29:57,569 --> 00:30:02,669
because the dynamic range it has the HD

763
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,980
one is something else for you know we

764
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:06,690
use a lot of but you know in this day

765
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,480
and day and age it's really gonna be

766
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:11,430
about endgame you know and and what you

767
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,680
want to offer to the market you know we

768
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,620
have some guys are pushing more CBN or

769
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,759
CBG genetics so again it's this is part

770
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:19,589
of the research is you know where do you

771
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,089
want to be in that column you know that

772
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:23,039
cog in the wheel where do you where do

773
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:24,240
you want to find your niche and you know

774
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,250
when you educate yourself and have an

775
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,500
understanding of that and seeing what's

776
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,569
there and what's missing you fill those

777
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,160
gaps because then it gives you a better

778
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:37,210
chance of being successful

779
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:39,880
hi Jodi thank you for the presentation

780
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,970
yeah you made a reference point to hemp

781
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:45,460
and industrial and agate I made

782
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:48,190
commercial greenhouse researcher and

783
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:52,289
most of my effort is aimed at helping

784
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:54,789
small to medium size operations in

785
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:58,409
hydroponic food edible crop production

786
00:30:54,789 --> 00:31:00,970
okay so could you speak a bit to the

787
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:03,519
potential of him is that something that

788
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:06,160
we're aiming towards the big growers and

789
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,220
it's the traditional cannabis crop that

790
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:14,200
small and medium-sized operations should

791
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:16,329
focus on so you know hemp as a whole and

792
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,250
see if it's going to go across the board

793
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:20,799
to industrial hemp so you know CBD is

794
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,500
exploding right now naturally but what

795
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:26,529
we're also seeing is a large increase

796
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:29,349
and just even fiber hemp being grown as

797
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:32,170
well but this is all very large-scale

798
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:33,819
and even on the greenhouse side you know

799
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,910
we're working on North Carolina right

800
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:42,129
now we're doing about five acres of

801
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:43,810
green house for CBD other projects that

802
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,420
we're talking to potential clients

803
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:48,399
that's small I mean we have some clients

804
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:52,570
are talking three four hundred acres of

805
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:56,980
glass for him but CBD specifically for

806
00:31:52,569 --> 00:31:59,259
medical applications cannabis seems like

807
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,670
it's going to be on the smaller side

808
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:03,490
because there's a lot of regulations

809
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:05,890
around it's very restrictive I mean

810
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:09,009
we've done some very large projects and

811
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:11,680
Leamington Canada for example we did a

812
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:13,769
thirty five acre conversion from bell

813
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:18,700
peppers to strawberries to all cannabis

814
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:21,470
very unique situation but we rarely see

815
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,808
large greenhouse application

816
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:27,250
or canvas we're seeing acres you know

817
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:30,079
handfuls but not hundred thirty fifty

818
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:42,349
not very often and I don't that answered

819
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:44,149
your question at all but no no no this

820
00:32:42,349 --> 00:32:49,099
is a group in North Carolina is actually

821
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:50,600
based out of New York yeah um I was

822
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:53,990
wondering if you could tell me about

823
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:56,240
what you are spending per square foot on

824
00:32:53,990 --> 00:33:00,048
your greenhouses about you know where

825
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,179
does that live and then also could you

826
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:05,058
speak to the strains that have CBN as

827
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:06,169
well as CBD Kent burg and curious about

828
00:33:05,058 --> 00:33:08,149
that

829
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:10,190
you know start it's the genetics you'll

830
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,809
have to top my head I actually and I

831
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,720
don't have it in front of me so my

832
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:17,808
laptop and this is not mine but there's

833
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,440
a list and maybe I can give you my

834
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:24,609
contact information I have a list of the

835
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,548
king amount of Kentucky specifically of

836
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:30,469
you know approved genetics so to speak

837
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,569
from a federal perspective and that

838
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,100
gives some of those ranges and it's it's

839
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:36,589
a very long list I think there's like 50

840
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:39,439
or 60 at this point it's it's it's

841
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:43,428
pretty big and I think it does classify

842
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,019
you know a broad CBD or CBN Sakichi so

843
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:46,820
maybe that's something I can get some

844
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:48,650
information to you about greenhouses

845
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:51,139
that's that's kind of a moving target or

846
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:53,000
I even call a loaded question because

847
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,380
it's really about you know what you're

848
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,200
trying to do I mean there's so many

849
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,750
variations of glazing alone you know

850
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,370
whatever

851
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:02,069
from plastic poly the polycarbonate

852
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:04,619
acrylic glass all those things affect

853
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:07,079
price whether you're gonna pour pad or

854
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:09,659
you're just gonna do gravel I mean so it

855
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:11,719
could range anywhere from you know $40

856
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,740
$50 a square foot on the very low end

857
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:15,779
which would probably give you like sheet

858
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:19,439
metal citing you know very basic

859
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:23,310
greenhouse you know all the way up to

860
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,570
120 130 dollars a square foot you don't

861
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:27,320
actually get to the higher end we're

862
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:30,480
talking you know full light depth glass

863
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:34,980
concrete you know doing underground as

864
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:38,398
well and mechanical systems you know co2

865
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:40,398
generation some applications if it's

866
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,839
possible that demographic geothermal

867
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,309
there's a lot of components with that

868
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,679
but you know the higher in greenhouses

869
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:51,389
you know we're gonna give you a a lot

870
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:53,820
more control very close to end or not

871
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:56,878
the same but it still gonna give you a

872
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,630
very close you know one first one just

873
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,630
about so to speak

874
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:06,469
hi Jodi hi you mentioned briefly about

875
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:09,529
Canada what do you think of the can come

876
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:13,719
to the market and would you say we have

877
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:17,330
to just stick with industrial or CBD or

878
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:20,859
indoor or outdoor um when it comes to

879
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:23,269
him we're talking about him specifically

880
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:25,130
Canada is still kind of trying to find

881
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:27,559
itself in the cannabis market and there

882
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:30,289
are some companies that are dabbling on

883
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:32,659
the hand side for sure you know there

884
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:35,900
was just so Acronis just released there

885
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:37,730
you know did a report on they're

886
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,010
dropping 300 million dollars into the

887
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:42,260
hemp industry but in the US market the

888
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:45,740
problem of Canada is where it's located

889
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:48,080
in the hemisphere it's hard to run a lot

890
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:49,879
of outdoor crops because they just don't

891
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,519
have enough summer you don't like

892
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,670
Edmonton for example we're doing a large

893
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:58,730
indoor project there they have three

894
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:00,500
months of summer that's it the rest of

895
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:03,469
it is it's you know coming in out of the

896
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,659
cold or going into the cold so you know

897
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:07,339
the hip there are some hemp farms but

898
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:08,869
it's going to be challenging for them

899
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,340
because they just don't have the weather

900
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:12,859
for it now they didn't build the

901
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:15,079
greenhouses and they could do just fine

902
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,789
and then then it comes out to a play of

903
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:19,940
capital how much capital they have to

904
00:36:16,789 --> 00:36:20,900
spend you know circling back to your

905
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,920
last question

906
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:26,269
you know industrial hemp versus CBD

907
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,309
there's avenues for both you know the

908
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:29,780
both are exciting you know I mean the

909
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:31,429
industrial hemp is exciting just the

910
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,110
fact of you know we can get rid of the

911
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:35,059
plastics we can get rid of all these

912
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,840
things that are killing our planet you

913
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:38,849
know a hip in itself can you know

914
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,000
if you've if anyone sent research like

915
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:44,509
Chernobyl right now they're working on

916
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,760
trying to start remediating the

917
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:51,090
radiation and and has that ability to

918
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,770
clean land so you know there's a lot of

919
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,510
exciting things and there's there's

920
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:56,730
passive both I mean there's ways to

921
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,800
travel down both and make money

922
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,320
I mean without question it really boils

923
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,730
down to you know what do you want to do

924
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,100
you know what interests you you know

925
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,019
what do you feel passionate about that's

926
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:08,549
always for me the best route to take if

927
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:10,349
I'm extremely passionate about this and

928
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:12,030
not that I'm always gonna go down the

929
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:14,880
path that it's something that excites me

930
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,930
so I mean maybe that's a good way for

931
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,260
you to take a look at it hopefully

932
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:23,159
that's helpful to finish off Jodi I've

933
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:25,680
got a question myself what form of CVD

934
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:27,750
are you encouraging your clients to have

935
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:30,719
produced on the end right on one side

936
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:34,619
you've got people producing CBD isolate

937
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:36,509
which the genetics may be more available

938
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:39,420
because you're not looking for the as

939
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:41,640
large of a terpene profile but ISIL it

940
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,409
doesn't have the scientific health

941
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:45,779
support but people are still buying

942
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:47,579
crazy to put it in everything and on the

943
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,019
other side you've got people we're

944
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:51,659
having a finished product that is going

945
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:54,239
to be a full spectrum or full inch

946
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:56,339
spectrum oil with medical applications

947
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,529
and people generally are like a little

948
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,000
grossed CBD but that end product is

949
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:03,660
really important so what do you

950
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,460
recommend for folks yeah again you need

951
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:07,739
to figure out what your endgame is going

952
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,929
to be you know if you like from my

953
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:12,329
perspective ultimately what I want to do

954
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:15,659
is be a supplier and I want to be able

955
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:17,909
to supply medical grade CBD I want us to

956
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:20,039
be able to supply CBD that's available

957
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:20,460
for valium at products like lotions and

958
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:23,400
cream

959
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:26,039
and you know that's what stuff it's

960
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,829
really about what are you where do you

961
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:32,009
want to be you know I mean it's still so

962
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:35,098
wide open and yes on the the US market

963
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,810
right now it's becoming you know a huge

964
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,359
thing that people are looking and

965
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:42,150
throwing hundreds of millions of dollars

966
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:46,380
at like cannabis was seven eight years

967
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:47,670
ago right but it's just really you got

968
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,869
to make that decision and it's hard to

969
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:51,059
say I mean it most of the clients that

970
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:52,829
we talked to they already have in their

971
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:54,779
mind what they want to do and you know

972
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:56,730
an isolate is generally what we're

973
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,530
seeing seventy to eighty percent of the

974
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,179
market going towards it's like you know

975
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,950
what we and a lot of guys we just want

976
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:03,539
to do biomass we want to grow it we

977
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:05,539
don't have someone pick it up and then

978
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:08,099
they process it that's all we want to do

979
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:09,900
and that's that's a great model I mean

980
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:12,570
it's simple you know and keeps it easy
