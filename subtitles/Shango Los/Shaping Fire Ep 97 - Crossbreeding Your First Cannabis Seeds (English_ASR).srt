00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,400
I'm not a big fan of gatekeeping

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,080
knowledge if you want to learn a skill

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,199
people shouldn't try to keep the

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,539
education from you gatekeeping happens a

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,580
lot in cannabis nowadays it was less

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,859
common before when we were all just

8
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,959
criminals together now that there are

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,118
some Legal Financial opportunities in

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,219
cannabis some folks have decided that

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,980
cannabis can now be a win-lose sport

12
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:33,359
instead of including everybody and I'm

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,759
not down with that

14
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,100
if you have ever considered introducing

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,320
a male and female cannabis plant to each

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,020
other to watch seeds be made and have

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,179
your own pile of seeds to Fino hunt you

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,000
should absolutely do that breeding is

19
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:50,700
not hard at all in fact it is so easy it

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,619
happens on accident all the time don't

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,480
let people tell you it is too hard or

22
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,140
that you shouldn't do it

23
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,898
now that said you don't become an elite

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,359
breeder without years of work studying

25
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,618
and looking at thousands of plants but

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,079
that isn't what you wanted to do right

27
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:10,019
you just wanted to make some seeds make

28
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,420
seeds save seeds share seeds with

29
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,640
friends and especially patients open

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,079
pollinate and preserve land races and

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,719
share those too

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,179
I firmly believe in cannabis patient

33
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:24,900
self-sufficiency and the plant wants you

34
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,939
to make crosses even bad ones so this

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,100

to join me you know um I have been

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,080
trying to put together this show for a

111
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:17,879
while but you know it really takes

112
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,519
um um a particular kind of person to to

113
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,100
do like an introductory show on breeding

114
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,319
you know so many of the people in the

115
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:30,000
scene who I'm friends with

116
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:33,240
um uh they may be Advanced breeders but

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,879
they don't necessarily have

118
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,360
um the bringing it down to the basics

119
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:42,360
for new folks level uh or or really all

120
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,400
that much teaching experience and so

121
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,160

122
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,959

123
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,699

124
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,739
seeds that I grew this summer and that

125
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:56,400
and that was great but like I I knew you

126
00:04:52,740 --> 00:05:00,000
just as a as a seed guy right but um

127
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:02,399
when I had the opportunity to see your

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,160

129
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,339

131
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:11,758
that's when I looked you up and I found

132
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,320
out like you had a you had a masters and

133
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,180
you had been a great graduate assistant

134
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,819
and you had been teaching you know

135
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,500
biology and I'm like oh that you know

136
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,599
this is the guy that I'm looking for and

137
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,579
then and then you know we we connected

138
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,500
and you were exactly the guy who I

139
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:27,899
thought you were so anyway I appreciate

140
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,339

141
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:32,758
um you know people who are tuning into

142
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:36,538
the show to get like a like a an easy

143
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:39,538
better understanding of how to start off

144
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:41,639
growing your first uh not just growing

145
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:44,459
but breeding your first cannabis variety

146
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,680
that that this will be a good solution

147
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:49,138
for them so so thank you for all of that

148
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,180
thank you for all the compliments and

149
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,639
yeah I really hope I can help some

150
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,579
people today maybe avoid some pitfalls

151
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,160
and wasted time that I definitely got

152
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:01,198
into when I first started making seeds

153
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,900
and it is so time consuming right it's

154
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,240
so it's such a drag to to put in all

155
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:08,099
that time and effort and like patience

156
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,620
and then get all the way to the end and

157
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,820
find out that like something you just

158
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,800
screwed something up or something wasn't

159
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,240
right and and then having to start over

160
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,199
so

161
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,600
um you know I I've only uh bred uh one

162
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,300
time myself and it was for very

163
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,180
particular reason it was what like six

164
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,879
seven years ago and at the when CBD

165
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,220
stuff was uh first starting to become uh

166
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,680
more readily available uh and the seeds

167
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,080
at the time you know you'd buy you know

168
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,560
CBD seeds in a pack and they didn't all

169
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:42,538
breed they didn't all grow with CBD in

170
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,379
them you know there it would be it was

171
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:49,439
more like there are some CBD seeds in

172
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:52,918
this pack so so you couldn't just like

173
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:56,160
you know grow them all find your females

174
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:59,099
clone them and then have a field of CBD

175
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,880
because not all of those female plan

176
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,620
it's had CBD in them and and working

177
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,259
with the patients here on Vashon Island

178
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,180
I I could I couldn't just give out seeds

179
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:12,780
to people that that they were going to

180
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,759
have to grow and then get tested before

181
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,559
they knew that it even had CBD in it

182
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,319
that's not like setting them up for

183
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:24,199
Success right and so my first project

184
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:27,300
was to make CBD seeds that were 18 to 1

185
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:32,280
but that every single female was going

186
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:34,620
to show that CBD profile and so so you

187
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,659
know I did that and gave away a bunch

188
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,259
and then much to my surprise sold a

189
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:42,780
bunch and and that was awesome what was

190
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:45,319
your motivation for starting to breed

191
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,318
cannabis

192
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,918
um okay well before I just want to say I

193
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,800
can totally relate to that problem back

194
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:55,560
in 2013 and I was this the first CBD

195
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,379
seat I could get was from sohum seeds it

196
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,439
was Harla zoo and you know the pack just

197
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,819
said most plants will be CBD dominant it

198
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,680
was really frustrating for me at the

199
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,139
time because I like CBD crew was

200
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,959
releasing one-to-one seeds so I knew

201
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,478
that one of their parents had to be a a

202
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,519
CBD dominant true breeding line and they

203
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,279
just weren't releasing it so I

204
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,299
appreciate your work doing that

205
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,459
um

206
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,439
but uh the the first seed that I ever

207
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,899
made and I wouldn't you know this wasn't

208
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,959
really breeding uh it was just making

209
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:29,878
seed to have more seed uh and it was the

210
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,519
first strain I ever grew which was

211
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,560
Twilight from Dutch Passion and I just

212
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,500
made seed with it

213
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,299
um I've actually never I never grew any

214
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,479
of the seed I made because I didn't like

215
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,218
the strain so that's one uh one Pitfall

216
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,259
to avoid don't make seed if you die

217
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,300
actually that's really funny to put in

218
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,819
all that effort and then go like I'm not

219
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,979
happy with this I'm gonna move on yeah

220
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,660
yeah I mean at the time it was like I

221
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,100
concurrently made the seed with the

222
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,379
first grow of it so it didn't really

223
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,700
waste any time for me but it was effort

224
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,220
that

225
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,660
um you know if I knew that I didn't

226
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,080
agree with the strain so much I wouldn't

227
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:06,079
have done

228
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,419
so um you know it's interesting because

229
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,920
like people grow for a lot of different

230
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,479
reasons right I mean of course there's

231
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:14,759
just fun right there's cannabis

232
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,220
enthusiasts who just you know freaking

233
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,559
love the plant and they want to do and

234
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,060
try everything and

235
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,919
um and then there's people who are like

236
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:25,679
more in it for the science right they're

237
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:28,379
like bot but you know botany-minded and

238
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:31,620
they're all like I must I must

239
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:34,080
um I must know all plants intimately

240
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,060
um then there are some people who do it

241
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,160
in service to patients which was kind of

242
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:41,458
like where I was coming at it from is

243
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,679
that I needed this for patience

244
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,539
um and then there's uh I think most

245
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,879
people fall into one of the last two

246
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:51,599
categories which is to get something

247
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:53,820
that they uniquely love

248
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,399
um or because they need to make some

249
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,860
money right and

250
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,259
um and uh I think that's uh you know I

251
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,139
think people generally fall into to

252
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:07,679
those categories when you decided that

253
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:10,199
you wanted to dive in and you know

254
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:14,458
really study it take your take your you

255
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:17,459
know you know botany and and soil and uh

256
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,958
biology backgrounds and really dive into

257
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:21,539
cannabis

258
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,119
um you know what were what did you want

259
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,439
to create with that what was your goal

260
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,700
um and the reason why I'm asking you I

261
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,760
know that I know the show isn't like

262
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:32,759
about you but um but what I'm hoping is

263
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,980
is that um the people who are listening

264
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:37,080
to the show who are thinking about

265
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,060
getting into this or are considering it

266
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,620
maybe kind of giving them a little

267
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:42,239
encouragement

268
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,539
sure

269
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,519
um so I I sort of always had an interest

270
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:50,399
in cannabis I didn't know that I would

271
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,578
be in the industry necessarily but

272
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,679
um it was a goal and you even I lived in

273
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:58,259
the east coast usually in you know not

274
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:01,379
friendly States uh

275
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:04,379
so I was growing Black Market but back

276
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:07,139
in like the early 2000s and all that

277
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:09,899
while I was going through formal school

278
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:11,278
for biology and then I worked for the

279
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,919
forest service for a little bit and then

280
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,139
I went back to grad school for uh Plant

281
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,659
Pathology

282
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:21,659
focused on fungal pathogens and all of

283
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:23,219
that was kind of with back in the month

284
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:25,679
you know in the back of my mind well

285
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,300
this could be used for focusing on like

286
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,599
a natural resource career with the

287
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:32,879
forest service or uh Park service or I

288
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,339
could also do cannabis with this and

289
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,338
especially nowadays if you're young and

290
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:40,380
you have access to a lot of schools have

291
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:45,180
cannabis specific programs now or

292
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:47,039
classes uh and even schools in

293
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:50,939
unfriendly states are able to work with

294
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:54,419
hemp and do really cool uh you know

295
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:56,640
genomic uh Cutting Edge technology type

296
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:59,099
stuff with it so if I were just getting

297
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,439
into it I might uh have focused more on

298
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,360
that in my education

299
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,680
um but yeah I always wanted to work with

300
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,560
cannabis I was always interested in

301
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,659
breeding I I didn't really take many

302
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,659
formal breeding classes I really learned

303
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:15,480
on the job since I've worked with a

304
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:20,819
cannabis breeder and you know I had a

305
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:23,759
background genetics and biology but uh

306
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,740
practical plant breeding is a much

307
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,179
different thing than I had in my head at

308
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,680
the time

309
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:31,199
um

310
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,199
yes it's it's just much more directed

311
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,560
than you know I I think evolutionarily a

312
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,140
lot and uh Evolution still applies of

313
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:43,679
course to plant breeding and artificial

314
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:45,419
selection but the numbers and how to

315
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,819
achieve something on a human time scale

316
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:50,458
are a lot different is opportunities

317
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,740
right because uh you know you and I both

318
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:55,799
got into breeding originally because we

319
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,320
both saw the opportunity and the need uh

320
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,838
for to to to have a pack of seeds that

321
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,579
CBD was expressed in every one of those

322
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,800
seeds and so that's what you know

323
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:06,479
originally got you and I to start but

324
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,919
there's so many you know opportunities

325
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,839
right now

326
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,419
um as somebody who's very involved with

327
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,279
the the Cannabis breeding scene what are

328
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:15,479
the some of the opportunities like the

329
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:17,578
niches

330
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,920
um that that are just dying to be filled

331
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:23,219
right now

332
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:25,500
so there are a couple that I see

333
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,019
um so some of the first things

334
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,820
Beyond just making seeds for preserving

335
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:32,459
and growing in the future the first

336
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,639
breeding programs that I also started on

337
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:37,919
my own were uh CBD programs where I was

338
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,139
trying to get CBD dominant plants as

339
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,838
well and then I was also eventually

340
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:47,278
trying to put CBD into Autoflower plants

341
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:50,220
so the Autoflower generally was a

342
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,799
missing Niche that I saw maybe 10 years

343
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,160
ago and that's being filled but there's

344
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:58,620
still a huge deficit in the quality and

345
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:02,039
variety of Autoflower plants so that's

346
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,480
still a really big open Niche a lot of

347
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:05,159
people are moving into it there's a lot

348
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,778
of new Growers that are just growing

349
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:08,819
autoflowers

350
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:10,740
um and there are some great Autoflower

351
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,480
genetics but you know people have only

352
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,419
been working on autoflowers for the last

353
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,778
20 years intensely maybe 30 40 years

354
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:20,099
total as far as smokable flower goes and

355
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:22,320
they've been working on Photo periods

356
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,879
for thousands so there's a lot that can

357
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,600
be moved into Autoflower to improve

358
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:30,419
those still just as THC cultivars also

359
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,220
um smokable hemp is turning out to be a

360
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:33,719
smaller Market than maybe I thought it

361
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,320
was going to be a few years ago but

362
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,839
there's also a lot of potential and a

363
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,000
missing Market there so I don't know how

364
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,940
big of a market but there is a lack of

365
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,120
good smokable Autoflower hemp there's

366
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,639
increasing amounts of good smokable uh

367
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,539
photo period hemp but that's still uh

368
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,440
you know

369
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:59,578
far below THC photo periods better

370
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,260
Elites the other big Market that's going

371
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:04,019
to be a little harder for small-scale

372
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:07,259
Growers to compete with is the minor

373
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:11,339
cannabinoid Market yeah so especially

374
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:14,039
you know CBD THC are relatively easy to

375
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:17,040
The Inheritance patterns of them they

376
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,439
kind of function as one co-dominant gene

377
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,179
where you cross a THC that I'm going to

378
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,060
plant a CBD dominant plant they come out

379
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:26,278
intermediate you inbreed that generation

380
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:30,479
and it's going to segregate one to two

381
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:34,799
to one where one uh 25 will be THC

382
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,778
dominant 50 will be intermediate 25 will

383
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:42,179
be CBD dominant uh so that's a

384
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:44,220
relatively easy uh test or um Gene to

385
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:46,500
breed with for a home breeder you still

386
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,420
have to get that tested you can bioassay

387
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,519
it I guess and if you're not getting

388
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:54,419
high off a plant it's probably a pure

389
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,759
CBD plant uh but what's that what's that

390
00:15:54,419 --> 00:16:00,299
term you just used bioassay

391
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,379
is that just like is that like kind of

392
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:04,198
like a

393
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:06,360
um like a cute phrase for smoking it

394
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:08,159
exactly right I've not heard that that's

395
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,079
funny all right sorry go ahead

396
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,819
yeah I I actually heard that in

397
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,859
reference to

398
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,399
um I think it was Andrew Weil and Gary

399
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:20,159
linkoff who was the Audubon mushroom

400
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,740
field guy author uh they found some Jim

401
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,500
nopalist spectabilis in Central Park in

402
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:29,039
New York and they reported it as active

403
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,980
following a bioassay I mean they just

404
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,019
ate it and helped everyone went well yes

405
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,300
yeah

406
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:38,759
so I'm sorry I I interrupted you you're

407
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:41,338
explaining how some of the novel

408
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,959
cannabinoids uh are are a target-rich

409
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,180
environment but

410
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,619
um but uh that's not just for everybody

411
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:47,578
because of the analytics that are

412
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,799
necessary

413
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:52,019
yeah it's going to be hard to compete

414
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,240
with some of the bigger players with um

415
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:57,060
you know like you're like your neighbors

416
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,100
at Oregon CBD seeds right like right

417
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:01,679
they've got a whole

418
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,540
scientific setup there now for like

419
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,279
intense analytical breeding that's it's

420
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:06,178
hard for a normal Joe to compete with

421
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,578
that

422
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,220
yeah exactly especially at numbers to

423
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:14,039
create a a plant that is not just that

424
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,500
cannabinoid but is a worthy agronomic

425
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:18,240
plant to grow uh

426
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,459
so

427
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,179
yeah that's that's where I see the major

428
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,500
uh Market

429
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:27,600
taxes right now yeah I totally agree

430
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,980
with you on both of those and and you

431
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,779
know if I was getting into breeding

432
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,720
right now I would intentionally try to

433
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:35,700
stay away from uh the kinds of stuff

434
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,679
that um

435
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,600
um like the big companies with Deep

436
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,120
Pockets and scientific teams were

437
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,859
working on because you know long and

438
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,359
short of it is that unless it's your

439
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:48,000
passion

440
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,939
um all those companies are gonna get

441
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,319
that stuff done first and um you know

442
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,538
you don't really it's it's really hard

443
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:58,019
to compete with folks like that

444
00:17:54,538 --> 00:18:00,359
um whereas uh you know and anybody can

445
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:03,000
for example I agree with you the

446
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,139
autoflowers are continuing to be more

447
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and more

448
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,900
um predominant for home Growers and

449
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,538
patients and uh and competing with um

450
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,220
with light depth and so I think there's

451
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:17,460
a lot of opportunities in autoflowers

452
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,558
and also for uh atypical terpenes for

453
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,759
example like Menthol right like sure

454
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,200
there's some plants that have got

455
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,700
Menthol but

456
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,360
um you know there's there's not a lot

457
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,580
and there are a lot of other flavor Pro

458
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:33,418
terpene profiles

459
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:35,939
um that are as Fringe as Menthol that

460
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:39,000
that people can find and and and just

461
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:44,220
run with and um I think that is

462
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,220
something that uh is more about uh uh

463
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,960
you know having a decent sized sift and

464
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,940
putting the time to smell it and then

465
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,700
and then focusing like you can you can

466
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,580
get to that with with backyard or or

467
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,200
bedroom breeding a lot easier then

468
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:01,619
you're going to be able to create a

469
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,960
freaking thcv dominant strain

470
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:05,479
and then in some ways even though those

471
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,700
are

472
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,740
inherited in complex multi-genetic

473
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,019
fashion uh something like a terpene

474
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,538
profile there is a limit to the

475
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:17,940
scalability simply because one is some

476
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:19,619
of these large firms can't smell every

477
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,058
plant and can't take care of every plant

478
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:23,819
in a way that really gives you a good

479
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:25,798
idea of what the terpene uh profile or

480
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:29,339
the the aroma profile is going to be at

481
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:31,079
the end of The Cure so even if they have

482
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,000
all the genomic data and they know

483
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:35,339
exactly what base pairs are in that

484
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,400
plant we don't really have the phenotype

485
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:40,259
data of what genes are associated with

486
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,298
different terpene profiles so that's an

487
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:45,720
area where home Growers are still very

488
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:47,460
competitive uh something like disease

489
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,120
resistance can also even though it's

490
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,798
very complex and for known genes the big

491
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,019
players are going to have an advantage

492
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,779
if you have a plant that you observe to

493
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:59,339
be resistant you know that's something

494
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:03,058
you can observe

495
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:04,798
at home even if it's a you know complex

496
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:07,139
trait

497
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,660
yeah that's a really interesting point

498
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,059
um these these companies that are doing

499
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:13,259
uh huge huge huge grows of thousands of

500
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:14,940
plants

501
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:17,279
um they are totally not going to have

502
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,700
the staff and the labor to be able to go

503
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:23,279
and sniff all the plants to find out you

504
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,220
know what they have that's special and

505
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,139
um that really uh does create a stronger

506
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,360
position for the home Growers

507
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,400
um another another opportunity that I

508
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:35,038
think there is is for short flowering

509
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,840
plants and and I mean short flowering

510
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:41,220
photos that are under like let's say 52

511
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,339
days

512
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,779
um because as we know when when those of

513
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:47,879
us in

514
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:50,099
um well let's just say those of us who

515
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,200
are not in California right

516
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:54,659
um we we buy these seeds and we get

517
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,038
California seeds and and you know if

518
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,240
you're going to grow them indoors that's

519
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:59,519
one thing because you can pretend

520
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,200
California in your bedroom but if you're

521
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,839
going to grow outdoors

522
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,880
um California seeds don't just Thrive or

523
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,500
they don't Thrive just anywhere because

524
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,179
most of us have got

525
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,819
um you know other

526
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,919
other kinds of weather I mean I mean I'm

527
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:15,359
an extreme example here on Vashon Island

528
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,280
where

529
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,699
um you know our our plants start

530
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:23,879
flowering around August 15th so an eight

531
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,980
weeker is going to be like October 15th

532
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,720
and like I'm two and a half to three

533
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,159
weeks into my rain season at that point

534
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,500
like there's no chance I'm going to

535
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,780
finish anything from California in

536
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,480
western Washington and so

537
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:38,879
um so I look for very short things like

538
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,798
the uh like there's a bunch of under 55

539
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,220
Day stuff from Humboldt Seed Company

540
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:47,400
where you know they may just barely be

541
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,720
that where I live versus California but

542
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,820
um but there's no doubt that they're

543
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,259
short and that's a great opportunity too

544
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:54,480
I mean if somebody could if somebody

545
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:57,298
could get a reliable great terpene

546
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,099
profile 45-dayer

547
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:02,158
um I think it'd be a huge breakthrough

548
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:03,658
yeah I agree and that there's um you

549
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,799
know increasingly I'm seeing people

550
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:07,320
selling

551
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,298
what they call fast photos which are a

552
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:13,259
photo period crossed with an Autoflower

553
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:15,298
uh so they will be they'll function as

554
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:18,658
photo periods you can eventually you can

555
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:21,619
take clones but that auto is either

556
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:25,320
speeds up its flowering time and or it

557
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:28,519
triggers earlier from uh diminished

558
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:32,220
light so it has a

559
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:34,319
longer critical night period than a pure

560
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,000
photo period I actually haven't come

561
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,298
across those yet I want to come across

562
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,179
that myself the idea to have a um a a a

563
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:43,740
fast flower that I can clone is very

564
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:46,559
attractive to me

565
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:50,099
yeah I think that humbled seed company

566
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:51,359
uh has some like that

567
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:54,418
um I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to

568
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,158
start using that keyword so um all right

569
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,480
so we we you know we've we've kind of

570
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,460
established like a whole bunch of

571
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,620
different reasons that people breed and

572
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,960
what some of the opportunities are

573
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:06,000
um let's um let's talk a bit about uh

574
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,679
space and materials

575
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,720
um because there's a lot of different

576
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,419
ways to do this and anybody who tells

577
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,500
you that there's only one way to breed

578
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,820
um they're just kind of full of

579
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,140
themselves because there's lots of way

580
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:17,939
to do this

581
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,120
um would you go ahead and uh just kind

582
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,759
of like uh describe and compare

583
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:27,000
um what your thoughts are about breeding

584
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:29,099
indoors versus breeding Outdoors

585
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,558
is going to depend on what your final

586
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:35,219
goals are to some extent and what your

587
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,359
situation is you can do either uh if

588
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,700
you're

589
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:40,500
goal is to produce a plant that's being

590
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,779
grown Outdoors then there are benefits

591
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,558
to Growing outdoors and you can also

592
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:48,058
grow outdoors and indoors where you're

593
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,700
breeding a cycle outdoors and then

594
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:53,279
breeding indoors over the winter or some

595
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,419
combination like this

596
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,940
um

597
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:59,880
of course indoors is more accessible to

598
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,679
more people but again it depends on what

599
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,360
your final goals are and there's there's

600
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,559
different ways you can tweak your

601
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:10,079
breeding scheme and methodology to

602
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:13,740
buffer against some of the negatives for

603
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:15,178
either situation so

604
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,659
um

605
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:20,460
yes both can be done I I don't know that

606
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:22,679
there's an inherent benefit it just

607
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,058
depends on what your end goals are to

608
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,480
what degree do you think it's important

609
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:30,000
to breed in the same environment where

610
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,980
the seeds are going to be grown

611
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,279
I think it's fairly significant

612
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:38,120
especially for outdoor varieties

613
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:41,038
um like I'll give an example where

614
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:43,139
we have worked with some autoflowers

615
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,359
that are bred in Oregon where the

616
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,000
they're grown outdoors in the summer

617
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,399
usually when during the dry period so

618
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,220
like July to late August and the weather

619
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,280
during that period is usually 80s to 100

620
00:24:53,220 --> 00:25:00,120
during the day lately and then it still

621
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:02,158
drops to you know 40 to 60 at night so

622
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:04,558
you get this cool night period well

623
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,980
those same Autos when they were grown in

624
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:10,619
the midwest ended up really short and

625
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:13,460
one of the things we kind of theorize is

626
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:17,099
that they're responding to

627
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:19,620
basically heat units so because it's

628
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:22,199
still hot in the night in the midwest

629
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:24,839
their metabolism is sort of still

630
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,759
running and they're Aging in a way but

631
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:29,939
they're not actively elongating and

632
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,400
growing in the same way that they do uh

633
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,159
in Oregon

634
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,919
so there's definitely environmental

635
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,659
effects that can have like unforeseen or

636
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,580
significant consequences on how the

637
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:43,200
plant reacts

638
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:45,240
depending on where you're growing it of

639
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,220
course for indoor breeders those are you

640
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,519
know the differences are going to be

641
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,960
minor well there still will be some to

642
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:54,418
between

643
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,100
and among different indoor grow setups

644
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,360
but it's going to be a much more

645
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:59,879
significant effect when you take an

646
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,038
indoor outdoor or vice versa

647
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,778
that's an interesting idea about the the

648
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:05,419
hot nights I think you may have just

649
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:09,058
solved something that happened to me

650
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:12,000
earlier this summer I was running a

651
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:13,440
specialty Autoflower indoors which I

652
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,980
normally just run them Outdoors but I

653
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,259
was doing it indoors and it it was a uh

654
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:22,259
it was like a really squat plant it

655
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:23,940
didn't stunt but it stopped at about 18

656
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:26,038
inches and it was Heavy I mean it was

657
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,500
heavy for 18 inches but I didn't

658
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:30,480
understand why it didn't

659
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,720
um get the height that I was expecting

660
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,700
and other people did well it was it was

661
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,640
indoors and it was hot in this this

662
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,038
spring here and my my nights were hot

663
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,159
and I bet you that

664
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:46,859
um those those additional heat units

665
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,159
um kept them surprisingly small because

666
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:52,918
it was so hot in the evening so I I had

667
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,200
never heard of that analysis before so

668
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,659
it could be something you know not

669
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,580
necessarily how I described it like

670
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:01,860
there there is a technique called

671
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:05,639
temperature diff in greenhouses where

672
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:07,979
they uh affect the height of greenhouse

673
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,320
plants by raising the temperature in the

674
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,179
morning for a certain period of time and

675
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,399
plants will react physiologically to

676
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:16,320
things like that so

677
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,480
um it could be either or both of those

678
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,178
things and I've seen similarly I've seen

679
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,819
a plant a not a flower that was bred

680
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:26,038
outdoors in Oregon or in greenhouses and

681
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:29,000
uh it was grown indoors under 24 hours

682
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:31,859
of light it ended up about a foot tall

683
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,140
like branched like six branches and each

684
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:37,558
branch had about a two liter nug on it

685
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,720
just to the soil it does not look like

686
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:42,778
normally you know it's a four or five

687
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,759
foot plant with normal size Buds and

688
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:47,960
structure so

689
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:50,940
they definitely are reacting differently

690
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,880
so let's talk about the advantages in

691
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,798
space between indoor and outdoor so

692
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,080
indoors is of course great there's lots

693
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:00,000
of great reasons for it for for privacy

694
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,278
and control of your environment and

695
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,200
maybe your breeding for indoor plants

696
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:05,240
because that's what you want to provide

697
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,038
to people

698
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,140
but also outdoor is great because you've

699
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:13,019
got you know if you if you don't live in

700
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:15,840
the city you may well have uh unlimited

701
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,278
space and so you can do a more

702
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,099
significant

703
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:23,460
um you know run with with you know to

704
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:26,879
produce more seeds at one time I was

705
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:29,700
talking to to Dan Jimmy

706
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,080
um at um at gnome automatics and he's

707
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,419
all like when he wants to bring

708
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:34,678
something to Market he's looking to

709
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:37,200
produce 30

710
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,080
000 seeds of it and I'm like holy crap

711
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,140
that's a that's a lot of um that's a lot

712
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:45,298
of moms and a lot of processing those of

713
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,900
those seeds and so

714
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:48,058
um

715
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,278
you know depending on what your

716
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:52,798
particular needs are as the Breeders

717
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:55,019
that's really going to influence whether

718
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:57,720
or not you choose to grow indoor or

719
00:28:55,019 --> 00:29:00,418
outdoor it's it's it's not just one

720
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,278
variable it's probably you know eight or

721
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:04,919
ten or twelve variables that you have to

722
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:07,019
decide which is right for you yes

723
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:08,220
totally and that's a lot of these

724
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:10,619
questions we have to start with where

725
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,179
your goal is are you just reading for

726
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:13,798
yourself or home are you trying to

727
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:16,320
produce commercial quantities things

728
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:18,538
like that and that will change uh you

729
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,038
know how you approach the project to

730
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:22,259
begin with

731
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:24,179
what do you think about

732
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:27,119
um you know a lot more people are

733
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:30,360
breaking up indoor space into subspaces

734
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,759
by using grow tents versus just you know

735
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:36,240
using an entire room like a grow room

736
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:39,658
they might take their garage and put you

737
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,819
know you know four or six you know tents

738
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:44,039
in there and treat them as individual

739
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:47,278
spaces I I think that's a pretty novel

740
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:48,658
approach to to turn one room into six

741
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,419
rooms

742
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:54,360
and they're doing this for breeding yeah

743
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:57,299
they're doing this for breeding okay so

744
00:29:54,359 --> 00:30:00,439
I think it's valid as long as you meet a

745
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:03,480
certain uh pollen control

746
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,399
threshold so

747
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,500
especially cannabis pollen it's wind

748
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:09,479
pollinated it moves around really easily

749
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,919
so

750
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,099
I've seen people doing this where

751
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,440
they're filtering usually through a Merv

752
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:19,079
filter I think anything rated above a

753
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:23,820
nine will work for pollen but probably

754
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:26,099
an 11 to 13 is better and then they'll

755
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:28,619
have them under positive pressure

756
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:30,058
blowing in clean filtered air the

757
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:31,500
problem is if you have a bunch you know

758
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:33,839
right next to each other you also want

759
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:38,119
to be filtering the outlet air with the

760
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:40,619
same filter or higher and then

761
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:42,898
with grow tents they're usually sewn

762
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:45,538
together so if you have

763
00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:48,658
any holes in that tent pollen will be

764
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:50,398
escaping out of those holes you can you

765
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,760
know tape them up or I've seen heat

766
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:55,379
sealed tents where there aren't any

767
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:56,460
holes in the seals

768
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,159
um

769
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,899
but it anytime you open that tent as

770
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:04,080
well you're going to be exposing the

771
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:06,898
rest of the tents to pollen so there are

772
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,819
there are ways to manage that uh you can

773
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:11,158
build tents where there's irrigation

774
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:13,019
into the tents and you once the pollen

775
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,200
starts to drop you close the tent you

776
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:17,940
never open it until it's harvested so

777
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,360
that's one way to prevent pollen

778
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:23,759
contamination uh another way you know

779
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:27,119
that's for producing pretty much

780
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:30,240
uh commercial quantity seed Lots though

781
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:33,119
if you're devoting a whole tent to it if

782
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,038
you're just breeding you can do pollen

783
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,918
bags or an individual

784
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,538
uh Branch pollination probably with just

785
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,759
as much control over pollen

786
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:43,019
contamination uh and you know if you're

787
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,579
not opening the tents that's different

788
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:47,579
you have a situation where they're

789
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:50,339
completely sealed that's the ideal

790
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:52,740
situation but if if you have grow tents

791
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:55,259
and there's these you know pinholes all

792
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,538
over the seams and things like that well

793
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:59,220
that might still work broadly but you're

794
00:31:57,538 --> 00:32:00,980
going to have a certain amount of pollen

795
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,880
contamination from one to the other

796
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,099
especially if you're opening and going

797
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,899
Ten to Ten and you can minimize that

798
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:10,558
with spraying water and things like that

799
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:12,839
but cannabis pollen is is very movable

800
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,599
yeah I think that's a good point and and

801
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:16,859
I and I think for most folks uh you know

802
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,199
that they're they're probably going to

803
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:21,298
start with their their 110 and their one

804
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,399
project and then after they have success

805
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:26,278
and they give some seeds away to

806
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:28,379
patients and they sell some uh you know

807
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:30,179
to you know friends or online or

808
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,919
something uh and they were like oh hell

809
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:34,500
I think I wanna I think I want to do

810
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,299
this some more well you know okay so so

811
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,099
maybe now you you get a couple more

812
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:40,259
tents but you're gonna spend some of

813
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:42,719
that money you made to get some like

814
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:44,940
really nice tents right so I've had a

815
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,399
bunch of really mediocre to crappy tense

816
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,100
and then I and then I you know gorilla

817
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,879
sent me a tent and I'm like oh crap this

818
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:53,219
is

819
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,559
um this is a whole different level than

820
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,298
the other tents I've been using and you

821
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:59,759
know if I was doing this I'm certainly

822
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:01,379
you know not pushing you know saying

823
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,419
that people need to use gorilla tens I'm

824
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,600
just saying that there are different uh

825
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:08,580
grades of tense and and as as somebody

826
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:10,500
decides to take this more seriously if

827
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:13,798
they choose to they will probably

828
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:16,019
upgrade their gear to be on par with

829
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:19,200
their level of Interest yes I would say

830
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:22,620
that's valid if you're producing a tent

831
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,919
full of seed though that's a lot of seed

832
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:28,798
like you said 30 000 uh seeds for a

833
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,538
commercial lot uh from Dan that's you

834
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,639
know you could do that in a 10 by 10

835
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:34,440
area with

836
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,899
I you know I'm used to producing seed

837
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,860
Outdoors but probably a thousand

838
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:42,959
uh maybe 1500 watts

839
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:45,418
could easily produce that much seed

840
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,679
yeah I agree with you on that

841
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:48,899
um but if you're you know if you're if

842
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:53,159
you've gotten to the point that there's

843
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:55,918
one well I I I'm pretty sure that uh one

844
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:59,100
tent can grow to be five tenths pretty

845
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,259
fast when somebody's got the bug

846
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:04,678
um so you you said that most of the time

847
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:07,079
that you are breeding um it's outdoors

848
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,179
um let's talk a little bit about uh

849
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:11,338
doing that responsibly

850
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:13,858
um uh I have I have no idea what process

851
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:17,759
you use but but the main thing I want to

852
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:21,719
hit on is uh folks that just let their

853
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,879
pollen go like into the air wild

854
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:25,559
um especially if they are in uh

855
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:27,239
neighborhoods right

856
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:29,460
um it's it's been very challenging here

857
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:32,338
on Vashon Island we you know we we did

858
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:35,039
an education campaign here

859
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:38,539
um and uh we're not running into it as

860
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:42,239
much as we did say in like 2015 but in

861
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:44,820
2013 14 15 times

862
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,858
um we had people that were just putting

863
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,320
a male plant with some female plants in

864
00:34:46,858 --> 00:34:52,918
their yard and you know our whole island

865
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,500
is only like 14 miles long and

866
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:58,980
um you know with enough people letting

867
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,420
pollen you know go on the island all all

868
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:04,858
sorts of cross-contamination was

869
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:08,639
happening and I you know patient Gardens

870
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:11,279
got ruined by being seated because they

871
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:14,460
didn't know that their neighbor at the

872
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,800
end of the block was letting pollen just

873
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:19,800
like just like the raw dogging it out

874
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,839
into the out into the air and so you

875
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,019
know I definitely discourage people from

876
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:26,578
just letting like males go

877
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:27,960
um but you know you're doing this at a

878
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:30,480
professional level

879
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,220
um uh you know are you is that how you

880
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,539
guys do it with the pollen or or I

881
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:35,939
imagine that you have more pollen

882
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:37,858
control even Outdoors

883
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,358
um where you're where you're applying it

884
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:41,759
in a more controlled way I don't know

885
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:43,559
though and and and so I'll leave that up

886
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,900
to you to explain there are pollen

887
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:47,880
isolation distances for like commercial

888
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:52,440
seed production if you're going to do an

889
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,960
outdoor uh production of seed which I'm

890
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,300
talking like many many acres of seed

891
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,119
production uh otherwise you know all the

892
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,539
breeding that we do and what I would do

893
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:06,420
outdoors is

894
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:09,239
the plants are bagged

895
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:11,639
so usually we do all female breeding and

896
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:13,919
so we're partially reversing plants to

897
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:17,338
self them and those plants are bagged

898
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,380
before any pollen is dropped so they

899
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:21,960
never release pollen openly it's just

900
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,760
onto themselves inside the bag and

901
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,220
similarly if we're doing say a

902
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,920
production we will have it in a pollen

903
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:30,059
isolation like I described earlier with

904
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,780
a

905
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:33,480
um

906
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,460
filtered Inlet and outlet and then once

907
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,740
they start producing pollen they don't

908
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:40,260
get opened again so we're not we're not

909
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:41,819
just releasing pollen and if you're

910
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,380
doing something like a backyard and this

911
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,359
is another thing like you really need to

912
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,700
know what your goals are why is someone

913
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:50,519
leaving a male out there just you know

914
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:52,739
continuously poly pollinating his female

915
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:54,119
or their female

916
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:58,259
um you know how many seeds are they

917
00:36:54,119 --> 00:37:01,800
trying to produce you don't need much

918
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,839
pollen to produce a lot of seed so if

919
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,460
you're going to do a select pollination

920
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,099
in your backyard I would have that mail

921
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,139
in a closet or in some you know you can

922
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:11,940
do it in a little Greenhouse something

923
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:13,920
like that and

924
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,619
personally when I have a single male at

925
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,039
home like this and it's not bagged I

926
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:22,920
remove all of the any uh forming male

927
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:25,199
flowers before they drop pollen

928
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,820
until the female is ready to receive

929
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:30,299
pollen and then I'll let the males

930
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:32,338
develop collect that pollen or pair them

931
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,339
in the closet bring the female inside

932
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:37,199
let them you know uh

933
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:39,960
have sex with each other and then I kill

934
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,118
the male immediately so stop doing

935
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,920
something like that or a more controlled

936
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,740
pollination if you're trying to get a

937
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,240
big lot of seed then I if you can try to

938
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:50,159
bring the females to the male in an

939
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,159
enclosed space and you can let them hang

940
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,659
out for a couple days even in the dark

941
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,519
just to get pollinated and then kill the

942
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:58,799
male or you could do it a couple times

943
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:00,239
you know bring them in at night and just

944
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,440
shake that mail all over them take them

945
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,159
out again

946
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,720
um

947
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:04,980
and you could keep the mail for a couple

948
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:07,379
weeks do that and then kill the male

949
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,000
whenever it's done yeah I like that idea

950
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:12,000
and and I think the moral of the story

951
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,460
is is a is like you know there there's

952
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,619
no way in one show that we are going to

953
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,900
be able to cover all variables everyone

954
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:21,900
might consider for making their first

955
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:24,059
they're making their first cross what

956
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,740
we're trying to get across is that there

957
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:27,838
are a lot of ways to do this and make

958
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:29,819
sure you do your homework and try not to

959
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,320
be irresponsible with your pollen I

960
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,480
think that's kind of like the generally

961
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,740
the point yeah totally and if you're

962
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,358
just letting your mail out there

963
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:38,639
pollinate everything you're also only

964
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:41,880
doing you're limiting yourself to one

965
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,618
pollination uh project a year as well

966
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,880
yeah that's true because your entire

967
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:46,619
property is going to be covered with

968
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,599
that one pollen yeah that makes a lot of

969
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:51,000
sense yeah at least well that's alive

970
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,320
yeah yeah right on all right cool well

971
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,358
let's go ahead and take our first short

972
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,220
break when we come back we're gonna talk

973
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:58,500
a little bit about

974
00:38:56,219 --> 00:39:02,098
um this new vocabulary people are using

975
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:04,019
about bio intelligent seeds so you are

976
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:08,240
listening to shaping fire and my guest

977
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:08,239
today is crop advisor Brandon Potter

978
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:13,139
there are so many seed banks nowadays

979
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,420
that you really have options and who to

980
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:17,338
choose not only that if you pick the

981
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,619
wrong seed bank you could be in for a

982
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:21,900
really sketchy ride and that's only one

983
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:23,579
of the reasons I recommend hembra

984
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,139
genetics collection to my friends and

985
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:29,700
listeners who are looking for a seed

986
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:31,799
bank that's hembra spelled h-e-m-b-r-a

987
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:34,439
hembra is not just another seed bank

988
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,480
hembra is a woman operated Boutique

989
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,700

00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:51,299
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

1077
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,160
growing is so valued by Farmers is

1078
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,260
because the mycelium networks in the

1079
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:57,838
soil remain established from year to

1080
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,579
year and we know these fungal networks

1081
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:01,920
are essential because they are the

1082
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:04,140
nutrient super highways that extend far

1083
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,720
and wide in the substrate to feed your

1084
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:09,118
plants the trouble with growing in New

1085

Living soils or Blended cocoa substrates

1086
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,740
is that it takes most of the plant's

1087
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:15,199
life just to create these mycelium

1088
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:18,239

Potter

1130
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,539
so before the break we were talking

1131
00:44:55,858 --> 00:44:59,880
about uh you know some of the things to

1132
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:01,139
consider uh when deciding whether or not

1133
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,140
you were going to breed indoors or

1134
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:06,299
outdoors and um while people can

1135
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:08,098
certainly breed in any kind of a

1136
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,900
substrate there is this interesting

1137
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:12,480
discussion that's been going on the last

1138
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:15,480
few years about bio-intelligent seeds

1139
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:19,559
and the idea with bio-intelligent seeds

1140
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:23,338
is that they are grown in soil and seeds

1141
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:25,858
that are grown in soil have got a

1142
00:45:23,338 --> 00:45:29,338
different biological makeup and they

1143
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:32,219
know what to do when they are presented

1144
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:33,900
uh soil again and you know at the

1145
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:36,059
beginning when I first heard that I'm

1146
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:39,240
like that's a really cool idea as being

1147
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:41,039
a living soil guy like I am I said but I

1148
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:43,019
really don't know what the what the

1149
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:46,079
reasons would for that would be like

1150
00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:49,019
like a seeds a seed but then last

1151
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:52,380
episode when we were talking with Jeff

1152
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:54,719

1153

this is where the whole case for

1154
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:59,939
bio-intelligence seeds I think starts

1155
00:45:56,699 --> 00:46:02,578
because the idea that there is

1156
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:05,880
endophytic bacteria which if you haven't

1157
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:08,579
listened to that show yet is bacteria

1158
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,740
that spends some apart of it of some

1159
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:13,140
part of its life cycle in the cannabis

1160
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:15,059
plant it's interesting to find out that

1161
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:17,960
the these these these endophantic

1162
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:20,699
bacteria will

1163
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:24,659
come up through the roots into the plant

1164
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:25,618
and enter a newly forming seed and there

1165
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:28,259
is

1166
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:30,900
um oh I forget what it's called but it's

1167
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,060
it's another type of bacteria which

1168
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,639
means that it is bacteria from the

1169
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:39,179
neighboring environment that lands on

1170
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:40,858
the flower and so and gets folded into

1171
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:43,739
the seeds

1172
00:46:40,858 --> 00:46:45,719
um from the branch and so these seeds

1173
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:47,578
are going to be all packed up with the

1174
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:51,118
bacteria that it that the seeds going to

1175
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:53,280
need wherever it goes which makes it a

1176
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,160
more reliable and people are using this

1177
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,900
term bio-intelligent seed and I'm very

1178
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:00,899
attracted to that

1179
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:03,380
um what are your thoughts on on uh seeds

1180
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:06,780
that are grown in living soil versus

1181
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,740
more inert mediums like cocoa or

1182
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,380
something

1183
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:13,019
so I definitely agree and am intrigued

1184
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,780
by the interactions that are going on

1185
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:17,519
with the Environmental

1186
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:19,380
organisms and the seed and how they can

1187
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:23,280
pass from the environment to the seed

1188
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:25,318
and back I am more familiar with fungal

1189
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,019
interactions in that way because fungi

1190
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:30,179
also form endophytic relationships

1191
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:33,179
within a plant body including some

1192
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:35,519
within the seed but I am learning more

1193
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:39,239
about the bacterial Cycles the

1194
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:41,400
rhizophagy and things like this and

1195
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:44,459
there are also of course bacteria within

1196
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,500
the plant body of the of the seed so

1197
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,599
it's in the embryo of the seed there's

1198
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,099
also you know a plethora of things on

1199
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:52,440
the seed coat

1200
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:54,599
um so one of the previous practices are

1201
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,579
is often to be like oh bigger plants or

1202
00:47:54,599 --> 00:48:00,180
your seeds and hydrogen peroxide or

1203
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:02,220
bleach water and I I would really only

1204
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:05,399
do that if you think there is a pathogen

1205
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:06,838
on the seed coat so there's definitely

1206
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,180
going to be differences in the

1207
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:11,940
population that are colonizing seeds

1208
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:14,279
that are grown in organic substrates and

1209
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:18,119
and living soil and things like this

1210
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:21,119
compared to cocoa or more sterile media

1211
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:22,800
they're still you know I say sterile

1212
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,660
media nothing is sterile there's

1213
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,420
definitely organisms in there as well

1214
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:30,679
their population is going to be

1215
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:33,500
different than a different media

1216
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:35,940
different types of organisms maybe

1217
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:38,579
species as well as total population

1218
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:41,280
density you know I haven't seen specific

1219
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:44,760
numbers on this but in general I would

1220
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,099
assume or expect that living soil is

1221
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,920
going to have higher diversity and more

1222
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:52,140
likely to have beneficial organisms but

1223
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,818
not necessarily you could also you know

1224
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:59,818
pathogens and latent pathogens can also

1225
00:48:55,818 --> 00:49:02,579
get into the seed even botrytus can form

1226
00:48:59,818 --> 00:49:05,400
an endophytic infection in a cannabis

1227
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:07,740
plant potentially and not show symptoms

1228
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,599
and even get into the seed or the plant

1229
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:12,239
the mother plant may have cannabis on

1230
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,039
the buds and there will be botrytis on

1231
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,559
the seed coat mostly but some of the

1232
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:20,099
seeds may also be internally effect

1233
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:22,440
infected and that's going to be cultivar

1234
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:24,240
and path if are specific on whether or

1235
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,760
not that's happening but

1236
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,318
um so my point is that yes there's going

1237
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,540
to be a lot of potential beneficial

1238
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:33,000
relationships that we can exploit and

1239
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:34,619
how you produce the seed will affect

1240
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,199
that

1241
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:39,480
um but it's also a pathogen risk that

1242
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:42,358
these organisms are in there so one

1243
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:45,240
thing to say about at least for uh

1244
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:46,679
endophytic fungi of the aerial parts of

1245
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:48,899
the plant so this is the parts of the

1246
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:52,679
plant that are going to be producing the

1247
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:54,119
seed and will potentially

1248
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:57,199
uh

1249
00:49:54,119 --> 00:50:01,559
provide the inocula to colonize the seed

1250
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:03,838
those fungi are usually uh acquired

1251
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:05,639
horizontally from the environment so

1252
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:07,019
it's not just your soil it's where

1253
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:10,199
you're growing the plant if you're

1254
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:11,699
growing that plant under a canopy of a

1255
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:13,439
certain tree you're gonna you might

1256
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:14,939
you're going to expose it to a different

1257
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,559
uh

1258
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,838
potential

1259
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,000
population of endophytes than if you

1260
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:23,759
grow it indoors or under a different

1261
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,159
species of canopy tree something like

1262
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,619
that so there

1263
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,299
it's hard to predict which one's going

1264
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:33,420
to be most beneficial because this is

1265
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:35,660
all so new we don't really know how to

1266
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,619
manipulate it in that secondary way from

1267
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:39,559
environmental manipulation to help

1268
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:42,000
inoculate the seed with the proper

1269
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:44,039
microorganisms we are gaining some

1270
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,980
knowledge of oh this is my microorganism

1271
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:48,539
is beneficial and we can inoculate the

1272
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,539
plant perhaps while it's growing the

1273
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:52,219
seed or the seed

1274
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:55,980
post-harvest

1275
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:57,838
to help it get that organism associated

1276
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:00,300
with it uh

1277
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:02,519
you know they there's a lot Unknown

1278
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:05,460
about it in general the bigger the

1279
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:09,239
diversity the more diverse uh

1280
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:11,460
the population of microbes are the more

1281
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:14,239
resilient more likely you will have

1282
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:17,880
beneficial symbionts in there with it

1283
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:20,279
uh yes right it's not guaranteed yeah

1284
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:22,619
right on a very very very good point and

1285
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:26,819
you know this whole idea of

1286
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:30,180
um of of bacteria and uh fungus that is

1287
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:33,239
that is on board a seed you know this is

1288
00:51:30,179 --> 00:51:36,239
this is brand new science and it is

1289
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:40,858
really strange to consider the idea that

1290
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:44,818
uh different seeds from the same mother

1291
00:51:40,858 --> 00:51:47,699
plant will have different

1292
00:51:44,818 --> 00:51:51,000
um you know endophytic bacteria in it

1293
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:52,858
because of where it is on the plant and

1294
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,719
then when that those seeds are

1295
00:51:52,858 --> 00:51:59,159
germinated

1296
00:51:54,719 --> 00:52:01,019
um that is a um that bacteria expresses

1297
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:03,058
itself differently in different ways in

1298
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:04,739
the different plants so

1299
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:07,079
um I'm going to use the word Fino even

1300
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:09,118
though it's not appropriate but but

1301
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:12,240
people will understand what I mean we're

1302
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,640
always talking about different phenos in

1303
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:16,318
one seed run

1304
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:18,480
and and what we're realizing now is like

1305
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,940
yeah there are those different

1306
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,818
um variety Expressions within the seed

1307
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:26,460
run but now it's even more complex

1308
00:52:23,818 --> 00:52:29,338
because each seed is going to have

1309
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:32,119
onboarded different endophytic bacteria

1310
00:52:29,338 --> 00:52:34,739
depending on where it was in the plant

1311
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,960
and us trying to figure out how

1312
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:38,699
influential that is that opens up a

1313
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,039
whole bunch of new doors you mentioning

1314
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:42,598
making seeds Under The Canopy of a

1315
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:44,099
particular plant

1316
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:47,280
um you know or a tree or something we

1317
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:49,559
may find out that the the the fungus

1318
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,319
that's you know being dropped from these

1319
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:54,300
plants in its own pollen that's in the

1320
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:56,219
air might also be influencing our

1321
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,500
cannabis plants and that's just like a

1322
00:52:56,219 --> 00:53:00,838
whole new Brave New World

1323
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:03,659
yeah and and the ways some of these

1324
00:53:00,838 --> 00:53:05,759
organisms are inherited by the plant are

1325
00:53:03,659 --> 00:53:07,799
some of them are passed from the parent

1326
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,540
to the seed and that's vertical

1327
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,579
transmission some of them are acquired

1328
00:53:09,539 --> 00:53:13,619
from the environment during the plant's

1329
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:15,960
life cycle which would be horizontal

1330
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:18,960
transmission as some plants are more

1331
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:21,539
prone to acquiring

1332
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,358
um their endophytic partners and some

1333
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:26,639
lean towards systemic vertical

1334
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:28,440
transmission of them so something like a

1335
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:31,920
there's a lot of grass endophytes that

1336
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,960
are past apparent to offspring and I'm

1337
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,559
really not sure where cannabis lies

1338
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:40,440
along that Continuum if you can uh you

1339
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:42,720
know if you take a variety and it has a

1340
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,880
certain microbi biome associated with

1341
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,318
its internal seed you grow that a couple

1342
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,358
times is it keeping that through

1343
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:51,300
generations this is something I'm

1344
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:53,219
unclear of for cannabis and it might be

1345
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,980
you know maybe some of the organisms are

1346
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:58,818
kept and some of them are lost so

1347
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:01,679
there's definitely a lot of work to do I

1348
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:03,599
there's a potential here too for a

1349
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:07,078
scientist if they can figure out a

1350
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:09,300
stably inherited uh you know microbe

1351
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:12,000
that they can sell to breeders or seed

1352
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:15,119
producers to improve their their

1353
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,800
existing varieties that's uh you know

1354
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,440
definitely a marketable product for

1355
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,000
someone if that's possible yeah that's a

1356
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,280
really interesting idea

1357
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,619
in fact they actually do that for

1358
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,380
grasses there are endophyte inoculated

1359
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:31,140
grasses usually fungal endophytes

1360
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:33,420
um because grass and the fights often

1361
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:35,219
have a toxin that is poisonous to

1362
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,619
livestock so they've developed these

1363
00:54:35,219 --> 00:54:39,899
endophytes that are symbiones with the

1364
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:42,800
grass they help reduce insect herbivory

1365
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:46,260
but they don't poison the last livestock

1366
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:49,200
right on all right so let's uh let's uh

1367
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:52,859
cycle ourselves back um off the theory

1368
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:55,739
and back on to checking these boxes for

1369
00:54:52,858 --> 00:54:58,380
the the new Growers so so so you know

1370
00:54:55,739 --> 00:55:00,598
the the the new breeder rather so the

1371
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,940
breeder knows why they want to grow and

1372
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:05,220
they've got an idea of of what they want

1373
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,659
to breed and they've figured out whether

1374
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:08,098
or not they're going to do it indoor and

1375
00:55:06,659 --> 00:55:10,679
outdoor and how they're going to control

1376
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:12,720
their pollen and

1377
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:15,358
um and so now they're actually like

1378
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:17,939
choosing their plants right and and the

1379
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:20,480
actual characteristics now

1380
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:24,659
um you know

1381
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:26,338
for for an advanced breeder who are who

1382
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:29,058
are going to go

1383
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:31,619
um many generations this can get

1384
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:34,800
confusing very quickly

1385
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:37,079
but what I'm going to ask you is that if

1386
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:40,680
if we're just talking about the first

1387
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:43,680
time somebody is making a cross and so

1388
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:47,219
they are going to be looking for a male

1389
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:49,739
that they like and they are looking for

1390
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:52,500
um a female or potential potentially a

1391
00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:57,419
group of females that they like

1392
00:55:52,500 --> 00:56:00,440
um to just get this what I'll call F1

1393
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:03,780
um what are some of the plant

1394
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:07,019
characteristics that you recommend that

1395
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:11,180
a first-time breeder look at when

1396
00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:14,039
considering they're males and females

1397
00:56:11,179 --> 00:56:18,118
so again you're gonna have to start with

1398
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:19,920
whatever the breeding goal is uh and you

1399
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:21,960
might have certain goals that are you

1400
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,059
know required checks that you have to

1401
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,220
mark off and some other that are

1402
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:28,079
negotiable and there might be traits

1403
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:31,139
that come up in your program as you move

1404
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,700
along that you you know re-prioritize

1405
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:35,759
that list

1406
00:56:32,699 --> 00:56:38,279
um but in in general for

1407
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,420
small scale Growers

1408
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,579
um

1409
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:42,780
one of the okay so the first decision

1410
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:46,318
you have to make is are you doing

1411
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,859
regular seeds or feminized seeds if you

1412
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:49,380
um

1413
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:52,019
are doing regular seeds I actually

1414
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,900
generally advise against choosing a

1415
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:57,719
single male to choose a single male

1416
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,338
properly you would want to create a

1417
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:01,318
bunch of test crosses with a bunch of

1418
00:56:59,338 --> 00:57:03,358
different males and pick pick the mail

1419
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:05,400
that actually passes on the genes that

1420
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:07,199
you want which is uh quite a bit of work

1421
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,480
you that's

1422
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:11,219
how a large-scale breeder might do it

1423
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,579
but for a home breeder that's a lot of

1424
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:17,098
work that's uh I think might be better

1425
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:19,200
spent moving forward in Generations as

1426
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:21,000
either a half sib population where

1427
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:23,039
you're selecting the female that you can

1428
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,099
get a good read on the characteristics

1429
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:27,980
from and you're using a group of males

1430
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:32,280
um

1431
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:34,740
or you could do uh you know

1432
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,359
most traditionally people do pedigree

1433
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:38,879
breeding where they're picking one male

1434
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:41,279
to one female and the risk with that is

1435
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,858
if you pick the wrong mail you send your

1436
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,720
line down the wrong road if you're

1437
00:57:43,858 --> 00:57:47,578
buffering that with a group of males and

1438
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:50,459
you're picking based on characteristics

1439
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:54,839
you know are present in a female it's

1440
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:57,539
going to take longer but uh long term

1441
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:59,519
you might be more likely to

1442
00:57:57,539 --> 00:58:01,558
reach a product without having to go

1443
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:03,420
back and start again

1444
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:04,859
um but so for characteristics that I

1445
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:07,079
would look for in either a male or

1446
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:08,880
female one you want to have whatever

1447
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:12,059
characteristics you're breeding for

1448
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,559
should be present in both if possible or

1449
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:15,200
you're planning on working more

1450
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:18,720
generations to get it

1451
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:21,019
standardized but General Vigor you know

1452
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:21,019
uh

1453
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:26,160
disease resistance things like that

1454
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:29,180
on top of you know most people will be

1455
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:31,679
selecting for a terpene structure resin

1456
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:34,259
potency things things like that will be

1457
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:35,399
in most people's selection list

1458
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:38,819
um

1459
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:40,318
so in your example when you have uh

1460
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:41,880
multiple males

1461
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:43,739
um in that example you're gonna have

1462
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,019
multiple males and multiple females are

1463
00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:47,519
you trying to hit one female with

1464
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:50,400
multiple males and then you're gonna

1465
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:53,639
you're gonna sift and search the seeds

1466
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,280
that that one female uh uh puts out I've

1467
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:59,039
never I've not heard this uh multiple

1468
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:02,339
males uh approach unless people were

1469
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,719
trying to uh like do an open pollination

1470
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:05,699
and

1471
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:07,809
um you know preserve preserve a line

1472
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:09,118
that might be lost or something

1473
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:10,940
[Music]

1474
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:14,900
um so I I like to work on a population

1475
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:17,579
basis uh especially for early

1476
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:20,700
generations of lines before I start

1477
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:23,298
inbreeding uh

1478
00:59:20,699 --> 00:59:23,298
but

1479
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:30,838
so basically why I I lean against single

1480
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:33,419
males you

1481
00:59:30,838 --> 00:59:35,420
let's see how should I explain this

1482
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,420
um

1483
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:42,240
okay so when you do a selfing you're

1484
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:45,420
increasing the homozygosity to the Next

1485
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:48,539
Generation by 50 percent

1486
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:52,139
if you do a full save mating so a male

1487
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:55,099
to a female or one female to a separate

1488
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:57,659
female you're increasing it by 25

1489
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:59,280
and then it goes down half if you're

1490
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:02,818
doing a half the meeting where you're

1491
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:05,700
picking uh one select female mother

1492
01:00:02,818 --> 01:00:08,460
plant out of a population of males that

1493
01:00:05,699 --> 01:00:12,118
pollinated it so it's the slowest form

1494
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:16,440
of breeding in that respect

1495
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:18,539
but you're moving the line forward in a

1496
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:21,720
more General way whereas if you're doing

1497
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:23,460
the the more specific inbreeding types

1498
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:26,219
of breeding that are more traditional

1499
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:28,798
say fulsive is most traditional

1500
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:31,639
um for cannabis or cell thing is a lot

1501
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:35,338
more common now you're moving it towards

1502
01:00:31,639 --> 01:00:37,318
homozygosity a lot faster but to screen

1503
01:00:35,338 --> 01:00:39,719
the amount of lines to get the

1504
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:41,400
exceptional plants will be more

1505
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:44,098
difficult you have to plant larger

1506
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:47,639
populations you're more likely to take a

1507
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:49,859
step down an inbred line that isn't the

1508
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:52,019
good step

1509
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:54,539
so it's not that multiple males is

1510
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:56,219
better than doing it that way but for a

1511
01:00:54,539 --> 01:00:58,739
home breeder a small scale breeder

1512
01:00:56,219 --> 01:01:00,598
that's the technique I would lean

1513
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:03,618
towards more of like an open pollinated

1514
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:07,619
variety uh

1515
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:09,119
production method rather than inbreeding

1516
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:12,358
when you inbreed you're generally

1517
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:14,579
producing parent lines to make hybrids

1518
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:16,980
out of and and that is going to be much

1519
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:20,220
more difficult for a home breeder to

1520
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:21,179
produce exceptional hybrids than you

1521
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:23,338
know someone with a really large

1522
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:27,179
operation

1523
01:01:23,338 --> 01:01:29,460
so I know that some people resist going

1524
01:01:27,179 --> 01:01:32,039
about their breeding projects because

1525
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:34,500
they don't believe that they have got

1526
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:37,858
like a lot of room

1527
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:41,818
um for large sifts I mean we all

1528
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:43,259
idealize large sips and and in a in in a

1529
01:01:41,818 --> 01:01:46,739
perfect world where you've got lots of

1530
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:50,220
time labor and space that's awesome

1531
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:52,679
um but you know when when a when a new

1532
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:55,318
breeder says to me oh I would really

1533
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:58,078
like to cross this and this but you know

1534
01:01:55,318 --> 01:02:00,539
I don't really have all that much

1535
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:04,318
um all that much room for a lot of

1536
01:02:00,539 --> 01:02:07,079
plants or you know or I usually just say

1537
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:09,480
just do it dude or person you know just

1538
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:12,119
just just go ahead and do it and get

1539
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:15,900
your first one done you don't have to

1540
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:18,599
you know you can always get better as as

1541
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:21,059
new projects come about for you and then

1542
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:22,980
and then after your original cross if

1543
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:24,839
you're going to start inbreeding well

1544
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,639
then they then you can fine tune it

1545
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:28,500
there

1546
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:30,598
you talk about a lot of these different

1547
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:32,280
variables that we want to control for

1548
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:35,760
but but

1549
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:38,040
am I right that that controlling for all

1550
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:41,040
these variables is really about getting

1551
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:43,500
more and more sophisticated and if

1552
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:45,480
you've got you know your male line that

1553
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,880
you like and your female line that you

1554
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:50,579
like just get them in the same damn like

1555
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:53,220
space and let nature do its thing like

1556
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:55,859
you don't have to overthink this

1557
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:57,480
yeah absolutely and this is this comes

1558
01:02:55,858 --> 01:02:59,639
back to what your goals are if you just

1559
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,740
want to make say you want to make seed

1560
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:04,139
to have seed defino hunt for the rest of

1561
01:03:01,739 --> 01:03:06,539
your life you could do that in one grow

1562
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:09,298
and if you have two lines that you like

1563
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:11,219
you know smash them together you have

1564
01:03:09,298 --> 01:03:13,679
seed and you can either move forward

1565
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:16,139
generational with that seed or just

1566
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:19,139
final hunt that seed forever and for

1567
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:20,639
that you know especially if someone just

1568
01:03:19,139 --> 01:03:23,039
wants oh I just want a bunch of dank

1569
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:25,078
seed and have it forever you could get

1570
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:27,119
two Elite female clones that you know

1571
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:28,859
you like put them together and other

1572
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:30,720
people would start a seed company for

1573
01:03:28,858 --> 01:03:32,578
that and that's very easy if you have

1574
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:34,399
access to those original genetics to do

1575
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:37,380
but if you have two lines that you like

1576
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,900
you know absolutely don't don't

1577
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,920
put barriers up for yourself

1578
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:43,139
um

1579
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,260
it just just get it done make the seeds

1580
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:47,098
and see what you end up with

1581
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:48,900
there's a lot of different directions

1582
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:50,880
you could take that as well if you if

1583
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:54,480
you are an indoor grower and you have

1584
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:56,039
those plants uh on hold you can do back

1585
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,599
cross breeding type things if you're

1586
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:01,019
selecting for certain traits in one of

1587
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:03,000
the parents or you can inbreed or you

1588
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:05,159
can just grow that seed for it so we we

1589
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,318
now are talking about being in a

1590
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:10,558
situation where we have we have chosen

1591
01:04:07,318 --> 01:04:13,318
our um you know either one or now I'm

1592
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:16,319
liking your case for multiple males and

1593
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:18,539
you've got your one or multiple females

1594
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:19,679
depending on what your goals are and

1595
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:23,039
what your

1596
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:26,578
um you know how much space you have

1597
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:29,818
um what do you do about the the pollen

1598
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:32,818
from dropping from the mail when the

1599
01:04:29,818 --> 01:04:34,079
female is ready for it right because

1600
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:35,338
um you know since you're going to be

1601
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,839
bringing together two different

1602
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:38,940
varieties

1603
01:04:36,838 --> 01:04:41,460
um you know it's entirely likely that

1604
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:43,858
the male is going to be ready at a

1605
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:45,539
different time as the female and I've

1606
01:04:43,858 --> 01:04:48,119
not run into this since I've I've only

1607
01:04:45,539 --> 01:04:50,880
done this once um I just I just put them

1608
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:53,519
next to each other and I got lucky

1609
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,460
um would you speak to this idea of of

1610
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:58,380
having the pollen drop at the right time

1611
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:01,318
um and and you'll probably end up tying

1612
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:04,140
this back into the show to um your idea

1613
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:05,759
for just just maybe bagging some of the

1614
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:07,318
branches to collect it and put it on

1615
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,240
later but just kind of speak to this

1616
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:10,980
idea to the male and female being ready

1617
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:13,078
at different times

1618
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:13,260
which unfortunately happens with humans

1619
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:16,619
too

1620
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:19,319
[Laughter]

1621
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:21,599
so I hopefully you have some background

1622
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:23,940
on how long your plants are going to

1623
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:25,920
flower or something like that generally

1624
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:28,440
I would start the male first because

1625
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,659
even if it's ready first it'll produce

1626
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:34,019
pollen for a certain you know window of

1627
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:36,679
time and you can get your female ready

1628
01:05:34,019 --> 01:05:39,298
in that time or you can save the pollen

1629
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:41,039
generally females you know people like

1630
01:05:39,298 --> 01:05:42,480
to hold the pollen off of them until

1631
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:45,239
they're you know if you have an eight

1632
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,940
week flower maybe week three so that it

1633
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:49,558
has enough uh stigmas to produce a good

1634
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:51,420
seed yield if you pollinate earlier than

1635
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:54,000
that it'll be fine you just might get a

1636
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:55,680
lower seed yield your seeds might be

1637
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,780
bigger

1638
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:59,460
um you could also have the female and

1639
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:01,440
male together the whole time and it will

1640
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:02,940
eventually produce new flowers that's

1641
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,159
fine as well you just have some

1642
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:06,358
different seed ages

1643
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:10,159
um

1644
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:13,318
so as far as the best way to pollinate

1645
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:15,420
uh you know

1646
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:17,039
if you can get your mail dropping

1647
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:18,358
flowers at the great right time or a

1648
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,279
little bit before that and you hold your

1649
01:06:18,358 --> 01:06:23,338
mail in a separate area until you want

1650
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:25,980
to pollinate that is ideal

1651
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:28,380
um if you have to save pollen I

1652
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:30,440
personally try to avoid saving pollen

1653
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:34,559
it's it's always been hit or miss for me

1654
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:36,920
but you can get the pollen collected

1655
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:41,400
remove any flower material from there

1656
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:44,659
and save it with desiccant in uh

1657
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:46,798
the freezer and that should last

1658
01:06:44,659 --> 01:06:48,960
theoretically a long time I have never

1659
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:51,239
pushed it because saving pollen has

1660
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,280
always not worked out well for me it

1661
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:55,078
always uh gets better seed production

1662
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,680
when it's fresh

1663
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:58,318
um

1664
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:02,159
similarly like uh

1665
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:05,099
feminized uh pollen producers especially

1666
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:07,500
sometimes have trouble dropping the

1667
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:10,200
pollen out of the anthers so you can

1668
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:12,059
collect the entire flowers dry the

1669
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:14,098
flowers and then kind of grind them up

1670
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:17,760
and the pollen will fall out and then

1671
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:20,519
apply that by hand that works

1672
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,440
all right I it's always preferable that

1673
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:24,500
the pollen just drops and it's less work

1674
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:28,679
and everything works out all right

1675
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:30,358
but usually I would just uh

1676
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:32,460
get rid of the mail as soon as you

1677
01:07:30,358 --> 01:07:34,739
pollinate unless you're leaving it in a

1678
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:36,358
tent or something like that and letting

1679
01:07:34,739 --> 01:07:38,338
it go until Harvest

1680
01:07:36,358 --> 01:07:40,679
yeah I agree with you about saving

1681
01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:42,239
pollen uh I have found that most the

1682
01:07:40,679 --> 01:07:45,000
time when I've done that

1683
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:46,798
um it gets it gets moist in rots or it

1684
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,440
starts to Clump on the female flower

1685
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:52,559
when I go to apply it so

1686
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,960
um you know this is you know in

1687
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,660
retrospect this is pretty cheesy but um

1688
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:01,380
when I when I did my cross I literally

1689
01:07:57,659 --> 01:08:02,879
wrapped the mail into the the female

1690
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:05,039
plants

1691
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:10,200
um and put them on a um

1692
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:13,380
uh on on my deck in a uh in a tent and

1693
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:15,659
just uh you know let them let them do it

1694
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:17,520
and naturally and I got lucky because I

1695
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:19,858
didn't have to save it um but you know

1696
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,660
there's a lot of people who save pollen

1697
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:23,100
successfully and there are certainly

1698
01:08:21,659 --> 01:08:24,960
ways to do it

1699
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,579
um but you know since we're talking

1700
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,140
about somebody doing this for their

1701
01:08:26,579 --> 01:08:30,000
first time

1702
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:33,000
um we want to try to continually keep

1703
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,119
this as as simple as possible

1704
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,698
um where in the in the process do you

1705
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:40,679
normally add the pollen to the female

1706
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:42,960
print and when I say process I mean like

1707
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:44,399
where in the in the flowering cycle do

1708
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:48,079
you want to

1709
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:50,759
um um you know encourage the pollen uh

1710
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:53,399
immediately as soon as you start to see

1711
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:55,979
pistols or do do you want to wait until

1712
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:57,838
the flowers are are more mature uh so

1713
01:08:55,979 --> 01:09:00,599
generally I would wait until the flowers

1714
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:03,059
are a little more mature however it

1715
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,859
depending on your situation if there is

1716
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:06,900
potential for say pollen contamination

1717
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:09,719
you you might want to get that pollen

1718
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:13,079
all over the branch or plant that you're

1719
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:15,719
making so that if there is a few pollen

1720
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:18,238
grains from a you know fiber hemp grow a

1721
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:20,399
couple miles away blowing around there

1722
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:23,218
you've already fully pollinated with

1723
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:26,159
your plant uh with your preferred pollen

1724
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:28,679
source to limit a potential

1725
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:30,479
contamination otherwise I would wait

1726
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:34,199
until there's a little more flour and

1727
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:36,298
you get better seed yields right on so

1728
01:09:34,198 --> 01:09:38,460
um how do you know that you have

1729
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:40,859
effectively pollinated your plants a lot

1730
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:43,439
of first-time uh breeders you know

1731
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:45,660
they'll they'll either you know add the

1732
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:48,298
pollen themselves or put them near each

1733
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:49,559
other and they're hoping for it and then

1734
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:50,880
and then because you know they don't

1735
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,880
have a lot of experience they're all

1736
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:56,400
like did it did it do it you know so

1737
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,619
what are what are the first visual signs

1738
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:00,960
that the plant has

1739
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:03,238
um accepted the pollen successfully yeah

1740
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,460
sometimes it can be hard to tell

1741
01:10:03,238 --> 01:10:07,859
um and generally the first things that

1742
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:10,020
you'll see is that the pistols kind of

1743
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:11,759
start to turn brown this can also just

1744
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:13,620
happen by touching them so if you

1745
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,719
touched them it might just turn brown

1746
01:10:13,619 --> 01:10:17,640
because you touched them but it's it's

1747
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:19,260
it kind of becomes distinctive once you

1748
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:21,780
get an eye for it it's like a certain

1749
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:24,480
way that the the pistol shrivels back

1750
01:10:21,779 --> 01:10:27,539
and then pretty soon within a week maybe

1751
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:30,658
you can see uh of you'll start to

1752
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:33,960
develop into a seed through the bract at

1753
01:10:30,658 --> 01:10:36,599
what point like will will they start to

1754
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,520
see seeds form like I know that we'll

1755
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:42,300
talk more about how long to let the

1756
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:44,880
seeds to run and mature during the down

1757
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:48,659
the line in this conversation but when

1758
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:51,900
will they start seeing the the green uh

1759
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:53,698
very young seeds start to form it's a

1760
01:10:51,899 --> 01:10:56,158
little bit plant dependent depending how

1761
01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:57,960
like uh the structure of their brachial

1762
01:10:56,158 --> 01:11:01,259
that's surrounding what's going to

1763
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:03,000
become the seed but as as soon as a week

1764
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:04,739
I can see them sometimes and they

1765
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,100
usually appear white at first and the

1766
01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:10,738
pistols still are attached uh you kind

1767
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:12,900
of can see them poking out sometimes

1768
01:11:10,738 --> 01:11:15,059
um you know you hit on feminized seeds

1769
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:17,460
uh briefly and I want to go back to that

1770
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:20,280
for one moment so you know this show is

1771
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:22,020
not about uh you know breeding or you

1772
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:24,119
know making feminized seeds and their

1773
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:26,400
importance we've done that on other

1774
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:30,238
shows but but I would just like you to

1775
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:34,198
speak to the idea of of the first time

1776
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:36,779
breeder considering whether or not they

1777
01:11:34,198 --> 01:11:39,479
want to make feminized seeds just walk

1778
01:11:36,779 --> 01:11:41,759
us through like you know what those

1779
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:43,500
considerations might be for the first

1780
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,780
time breeder yeah so there's definitely

1781
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:49,560
positives and negatives the the first

1782
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:52,139
positive for a growing female only like

1783
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:54,780
a female only breeding project is that

1784
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:56,880
you're getting a read on both sides of

1785
01:11:54,779 --> 01:11:58,759
whatever cross you're going to make so

1786
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:02,400
you can make more effective selections

1787
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:04,380
uh the the major drawback to feminine

1788
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:07,019
seed especially for home producers is

1789
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:09,480
that it's less reliable and that some

1790
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:11,040
some plants don't reverse as well and

1791
01:12:09,479 --> 01:12:13,919
you're more likely to have a pollen

1792
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:16,079
failure you can have a nicking failure

1793
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,179
where like you know especially you

1794
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:19,679
mentioned earlier about getting the male

1795
01:12:18,179 --> 01:12:22,500
flowers at the right time as the female

1796
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:24,000
is ready you know if you have a short

1797
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:27,359
flowering indica and you're trying to

1798
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,819
cross that to a long flowering tropical

1799
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:33,420
variety

1800
01:12:28,819 --> 01:12:36,420
you might want to have the short

1801
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:37,800
flowering variety be the pollen donor or

1802
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:40,199
you're going to have to flour that long

1803
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:42,779
flowering variety far before the short

1804
01:12:40,198 --> 01:12:43,979
flouring variety because you could you

1805
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:46,198
know you could trigger a tropical

1806
01:12:43,979 --> 01:12:48,299
variety and it doesn't produce pollen

1807
01:12:46,198 --> 01:12:50,099
for another eight weeks meanwhile the

1808
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:51,000
other plant's done

1809
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,520
um

1810
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,560
so with feminized seed you're more

1811
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,640
likely to get of pollen failure like I

1812
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,380
mentioned where either you're going to

1813
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,380
have to put extra work into collecting

1814
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:03,779
the flour and helping that pollen Escape

1815
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:06,659
or it just doesn't produce very viable

1816
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:07,679
pollen and you get lower seed yields so

1817
01:13:06,658 --> 01:13:09,839
and you don't want to be if you're

1818
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:11,640
having a long-term breeding project if

1819
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,279
you're having pollination issues from

1820
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,900
the beginning that's a red flag so some

1821
01:13:14,279 --> 01:13:17,939
varieties are going to be better as

1822
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:21,899
regular varieties for for breeding

1823
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:25,319
because of that for home breeders

1824
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:27,319
um or seed seed producers but as far as

1825
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:29,519
functionality like you know

1826
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:32,039
feminized seed isn't genetically

1827
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,540
modified or anything like that as far as

1828
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:34,859
I'm aware there is no functional

1829
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:37,158
difference in the plants that are grown

1830
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:39,479
from it you can breed female

1831
01:13:37,158 --> 01:13:41,460
feminized seed to regular seed you can

1832
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:45,000
breed feminized seed only for

1833
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:46,980
Generations that's fine so

1834
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,020
yeah those those are the major drawback

1835
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:50,519
I see about feminine seed is pollen

1836
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:52,140
production and

1837
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,880
you have to understand at least some

1838
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:55,260
about the technology of how to reverse a

1839
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,060
plant which is pretty accessible

1840
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:59,340
nowadays all right

1841
01:13:57,060 --> 01:14:01,679
um so let's go ahead and take our second

1842
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:04,739
uh short break when we come back we're

1843
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:08,158
going to talk about uh judging when to

1844
01:14:04,738 --> 01:14:11,099
uh collect the seeds and harvest them

1845
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:13,439
handling them and and and prepping them

1846
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:15,239
for whatever you're going to do next

1847

1896
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:06,960
one of the challenges with buying

1897
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:09,178
Autoflower seeds is that often you'll

1898
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,579
have as many different phenos as you

1899
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:14,219
will have seeds in a pack that can be

1900
01:16:11,579 --> 01:16:16,439
fun sure but so many varieties in one

1901
01:16:14,219 --> 01:16:18,300
pack is a sign of an immature seed line

1902
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:20,759
that hasn't been worked enough

1903
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,619
I prefer my auto flowers to be worked

1904
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:24,840
enough that each Fino in the pack really

1905
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:26,519
captures the aspects that the breeder

1906
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:29,640
was intending

1907
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:31,380
this is why I recommend gnome automatics

1908
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:33,900

tested at a wide range of conditions and

1914
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:48,300
taken to a level of maturity that each

1915

1967
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:53,698
they seek out the best talent build

1968

relationships helps them take their

1969
01:18:53,698 --> 01:18:58,019
product to the highest levels and then

1970
01:18:55,619 --> 01:19:00,899
buys their well-cured flowers in order

1971
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:03,120
to hand roll them just for you I really

1972
01:19:00,899 --> 01:19:05,579
like their hand blown glass tips

welcome back you are listening to

1990
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:45,658
shapingfire I'm your host shangolos and

1991
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:47,640
my guest today is crop advisor Brandon

1992
01:19:45,658 --> 01:19:51,359
Potter so here we are at the big finish

1993
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:54,840
so um now we've got plants that have got

1994
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:58,019
seeds in them we have successfully uh

1995
01:19:54,840 --> 01:20:00,719
pollinated and we are uh so grateful to

1996
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:03,900
have reached this point with the plant

1997
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:06,539
um you know Chances Are by the time

1998
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:09,839
somebody is at this point they have

1999
01:20:06,539 --> 01:20:12,779
already grown cannabis before so they

2000
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:15,960
know how to successfully grow and

2001
01:20:12,779 --> 01:20:18,259
harvest cannabis in your experience are

2002
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:20,520
there any other particular care

2003
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:22,320
instructions that are different than

2004
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,840
growing a regular plant when you're

2005
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:26,579
growing for seed

2006
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:28,980
um uh I'm thinking like you know

2007
01:20:26,579 --> 01:20:31,439
different uh you know different

2008
01:20:28,979 --> 01:20:34,079
nutrients that you would normally use or

2009
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:35,039
different or different light or I don't

2010
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,738
know anything is there anything

2011
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:39,300
different when a seed is being grown for

2012
01:20:37,738 --> 01:20:42,899
excuse me when a plant is being grown

2013
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:46,760
for seed than when we're just uh growing

2014
01:20:42,899 --> 01:20:46,759
it for smokable usable flower

2015
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:53,100
um so generally I would give it more of

2016
01:20:49,738 --> 01:20:55,559
a veg nutrient type profile through its

2017
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:57,360
entire life than if I were smoking for

2018
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:00,060
flour and I wouldn't do any type of

2019
01:20:57,359 --> 01:21:01,859
flushing or anything like that you want

2020
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:03,960
the plant to kind of finesse on its own

2021
01:21:01,859 --> 01:21:05,759
not because it's being starved of any

2022
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,739
nutrients

2023
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:11,159
um other than that it's it's pretty

2024
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:13,079
similar to Growing for flour around so

2025
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:16,019
for a lot of folks you know the the the

2026
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:18,719
trying to figure out when to harvest is

2027
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:20,460
one of the more challenging aspects

2028
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:22,560
because

2029
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:24,060
um for many people if they're doing

2030
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,380
photos

2031
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:28,140
um you know people a lot of people are

2032
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:30,960
just looking for uh the you know a 20

2033
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:33,960
percent ish ish of trichomes that have

2034
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:36,260
gone Amber and of course you know when

2035
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:39,179
you're when you're a more

2036
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:42,119
experienced uh cultivator you will know

2037
01:21:39,179 --> 01:21:44,819
how to recognize swollen flowers and the

2038
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:46,619
color changes and you know the change in

2039
01:21:44,819 --> 01:21:48,119
the pistols and all these extra things

2040
01:21:46,619 --> 01:21:49,979
but really

2041
01:21:48,119 --> 01:21:52,559
um the first rule of thumb that that

2042
01:21:49,979 --> 01:21:54,139
most novice cultivators go with is the

2043
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,580
is the 20

2044
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:58,320
Amber trichomes unless it's an

2045
01:21:56,579 --> 01:22:00,658
Autoflower which which don't really

2046
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:03,179
Amber up the same way

2047
01:22:00,658 --> 01:22:05,339
um what do you look for when deciding

2048
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:08,640
when to

2049
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:10,619
um to harvest the seeds because you know

2050
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:13,739
we've all gotten seeds that didn't look

2051
01:22:10,619 --> 01:22:15,539
like they had finished maturing and uh

2052
01:22:13,738 --> 01:22:17,459
you know for for many seed varieties

2053
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:19,920
we're looking for you know a darkened

2054
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:21,840
seed potentially with you know striping

2055
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,480
on it depending on what kind of a plant

2056
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,279
it is but uh but we've all bought seed

2057
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:27,839
packs that that looks like the seeds

2058
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:30,238
were not mature and we're like keeping

2059
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,460
our fingers crossed uh when we that they

2060
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:34,439
that they germinate so so what do you

2061
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:36,539
look for what in considerations when

2062
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:38,960
you're judging when to when to pull the

2063
01:22:36,539 --> 01:22:38,960
plant down

2064
01:22:39,179 --> 01:22:45,658
so basically it I base it on time from

2065
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:48,840
when I know pollination occurred as well

2066
01:22:45,658 --> 01:22:51,839
as I usually dig out a couple seeds and

2067
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:53,760
squeeze them see how full they are how

2068
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,860
mature they are uh of course they're

2069
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:57,960
sacrificing those seeds

2070
01:22:55,859 --> 01:23:01,019
um but it should also be noted that a

2071
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,640
lot of seed the color of seed and the

2072
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:05,460
striping on seed is really variety

2073
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:06,719
dependent the of course if you have a

2074
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:08,399
seed that's supposed to be brown and

2075
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:11,340
it's tiger striped and it's it's white

2076
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:14,399
then it's probably immature uh but you

2077
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:15,779
know like the variety freak show has

2078
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:18,000
notoriously

2079
01:23:15,779 --> 01:23:19,219
light colored seeds that are kind of

2080
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,840
misshapen

2081
01:23:19,219 --> 01:23:25,198
but that's all they ever do even if you

2082
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:27,000
let them go forever but generally I you

2083
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:29,279
want to be able to squeeze a seed and

2084
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,319
have it you know be resistant full of an

2085
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:34,920
embryo when you squeeze it you'll see a

2086
01:23:31,319 --> 01:23:36,779
now dead or dying embryo pop out of it

2087
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:39,060
uh you should be able to see like the

2088
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:40,738
completely formed Little Radical and

2089
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:42,480
things like that

2090
01:23:40,738 --> 01:23:45,359
um and it should it should start to be

2091
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:47,218
getting a hard seed coat it wants the

2092
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,799
you know you do do a few tests like that

2093
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:52,800
when the majority of seeds are like that

2094
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:55,679
uh you're probably good to go it doesn't

2095
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,480
hurt to let it go over I've heard people

2096
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:59,520
claim you know it's you can get over

2097
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:01,139
mature seed I really don't think that's

2098
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,980
a thing

2099
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:04,079
um

2100
01:24:01,979 --> 01:24:07,439
the especially if you're cleaning your

2101
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:09,840
seed at the end of it you might get a

2102
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:11,359
lighter seed and things like that that

2103
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:14,219
will blow off

2104
01:24:11,359 --> 01:24:16,799
when you're cleaning it

2105
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:18,658
um you said that uh one of the

2106
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:21,060
um one of the things you use to judge

2107
01:24:18,658 --> 01:24:24,779
when to pull the seeds you said you know

2108
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:27,179
days from uh pollination so

2109
01:24:24,779 --> 01:24:29,639
um like dig into that a little bit more

2110
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:32,940
if you would uh do you are you looking

2111
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:35,100
for a particular number of days or a

2112
01:24:32,939 --> 01:24:38,519
certain number of days in relationship

2113
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:41,699
to how long the bloom cycle is supposed

2114
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:44,159
to be for this particular female like

2115
01:24:41,698 --> 01:24:46,678
give us a little more on that

2116
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:48,839
usually I use the same time frame

2117
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:51,420
regardless of the variety and I haven't

2118
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:54,239
I haven't produced seeds on any you know

2119
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:55,679
16 week varieties so I can't say it's

2120
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:57,059
necessarily true for that but I think

2121
01:24:55,679 --> 01:25:00,060
that it would still apply and that there

2122
01:24:57,060 --> 01:25:01,679
would even if you pollinate based on

2123
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:03,300
this time frame there would be a mature

2124
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:05,760
seed sitting in there for you know 10

2125
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:07,199
weeks or whatever but uh

2126
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,119
so

2127
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:11,939
I would say two weeks is the absolute

2128
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:13,800
minimum to get viable seed if you're

2129
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:17,339
trying to do something really fast

2130
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:19,679
uh preferably you wanna

2131
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:21,539
let it go at least four weeks and six

2132
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:23,579
weeks is better so if I can let

2133
01:25:21,539 --> 01:25:25,380
something go at least six weeks and then

2134
01:25:23,579 --> 01:25:27,779
start looking at it sometimes it'll be

2135
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:29,219
just completely finished uh at four

2136
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:31,139
weeks and you don't really need that

2137
01:25:29,219 --> 01:25:33,600
extra two weeks but

2138
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:35,159
um I I don't think it hurts to let it go

2139
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,719
over unless you have something like but

2140
01:25:35,158 --> 01:25:40,019
right it's happening and that'll start

2141
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:43,198
infecting and eating your seeds there's

2142
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:45,600
really no harm in letting it over mature

2143
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:48,359
let me push on this a little bit so you

2144
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:52,800
said um you know six weeks two two is

2145
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:56,639
minimum six would be Optimum now uh if

2146
01:25:52,800 --> 01:26:00,779
if we are going to pollinate our our

2147
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:03,239
plant you know a week or two into the

2148
01:26:00,779 --> 01:26:05,939
flowering cycle that kind of lines up

2149
01:26:03,238 --> 01:26:08,279
with an eight-week plant which is you

2150
01:26:05,939 --> 01:26:12,000
know give or take that's it's a pretty

2151
01:26:08,279 --> 01:26:14,939
common uh Bloom cycle so it could be

2152
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,219
unless you're doing a specialty plant or

2153
01:26:14,939 --> 01:26:20,039
something that has an especially long

2154
01:26:17,219 --> 01:26:21,960
flowering cycle that

2155
01:26:20,039 --> 01:26:24,060
um you might want to pull those seeds

2156
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:25,198
just simply when the flowers are done is

2157
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:28,580
is that

2158
01:26:25,198 --> 01:26:28,579
um am I is that oversimplified

2159
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,060
you're saying that

2160
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:34,860
you you might be pulling them earlier

2161
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:37,320
than six weeks everybody no no I'm

2162
01:26:34,859 --> 01:26:38,939
suggesting that if if you if you're if

2163
01:26:37,319 --> 01:26:41,698
your plan is going to start to flower

2164
01:26:38,939 --> 01:26:43,319
and then you pollinate it at like you

2165
01:26:41,698 --> 01:26:45,719
know somewhere between week one and two

2166
01:26:43,319 --> 01:26:47,698
of the flowering process and then you

2167
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:50,279
said you know you want a minimum of two

2168
01:26:47,698 --> 01:26:51,899
weeks for pro but more like six weeks to

2169
01:26:50,279 --> 01:26:54,059
put forward to allow for this all the

2170
01:26:51,899 --> 01:26:55,500
seeds to mature when you add those two

2171
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:57,060
weeks and the six weeks you're at eight

2172
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:59,460
weeks which is like one of the most

2173
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:02,639
common Bloom cycles for cannabis plants

2174
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:06,539
so it's it's sounding sounding like uh

2175
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:08,940
in in many or if not most cases

2176
01:27:06,539 --> 01:27:11,279
um it's not really a different time to

2177
01:27:08,939 --> 01:27:13,259
pull the seeds as it is just when you

2178
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:16,019
would pull the flowers normally

2179
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:17,579
yeah completely so it's it'd be very

2180
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:19,860
convenient you know if you have like a

2181
01:27:17,579 --> 01:27:21,420
under branch that you pollinated but you

2182
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:23,639
still want the flour from that plant you

2183
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:26,340
can usually just Harvest them at the

2184
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:28,619
same time if I do pollinate something

2185
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:31,079
especially if it's later in the cycle of

2186
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:33,238
something that I know I'm going to cut

2187
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:34,920
down for flour then I'll pick a lower

2188
01:27:33,238 --> 01:27:37,138
branch and you can kind of leave that

2189
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:39,420
lower Branch alive and let the seeds

2190
01:27:37,139 --> 01:27:41,219
mature a couple weeks longer say you

2191
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:43,859
have an eight week flour you pollinate

2192
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:45,359
it week four or five then you want to

2193
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:47,639
let it go beyond where you would flower

2194
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:50,158
or harvest for a flower

2195
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:53,460
yeah I you know the one time I did this

2196
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:55,379
I intentionally just let it go until

2197
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:58,739
um uh

2198
01:27:55,380 --> 01:28:01,079
until I was a good two weeks beyond the

2199
01:27:58,738 --> 01:28:04,259
when I would have flowered it because I

2200
01:28:01,079 --> 01:28:05,219
was so concerned about

2201
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:08,520
um

2202
01:28:05,219 --> 01:28:10,198
the seeds not fully maturing and

2203
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:13,080
ripening and I would have gone through

2204
01:28:10,198 --> 01:28:15,839
all this you know effort for nothing

2205
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:18,960
um and then so so this this eight week

2206
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:20,520
plan I was looking to harvest it at week

2207
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,800
10

2208
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:25,500
um and then I was surprised it actually

2209
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:28,260
just started dropping the seeds onto the

2210
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:30,840
ground and I'm all like oh well I would

2211
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:33,539
say that that's probably like the most

2212
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:35,699
sure sign I'm going to get but it's

2213
01:28:33,539 --> 01:28:38,219
possible I was misreading that sign what

2214
01:28:35,698 --> 01:28:40,500
what stage are we at when the plant is

2215
01:28:38,219 --> 01:28:42,600
actually literally dropping seeds into

2216
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:45,779
the pot or on the ground

2217
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:46,739
and I mean that's you know it depends

2218
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:49,738
what

2219
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:51,718
varieties you're working with that's in

2220
01:28:49,738 --> 01:28:54,419
you know kind of atavistic trait where

2221
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:56,100
it's ancestrally wild cannabis plants

2222
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:57,779
will shatter and drop their seeds a lot

2223
01:28:56,100 --> 01:29:01,260
more readily than the domesticated

2224
01:28:57,779 --> 01:29:02,939
varieties uh so if you have a plant like

2225
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:05,039
that yeah you want to harvest it before

2226
01:29:02,939 --> 01:29:07,619
it drops its seed if it's dropping its

2227
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:09,899
seed they're definitely ready that's

2228
01:29:07,619 --> 01:29:11,579
really the only that and say if you're

2229
01:29:09,899 --> 01:29:15,599
outdoors and it's getting rained on I've

2230
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:16,198
seen uh seed germinating in colas before

2231
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,460
um

2232
01:29:16,198 --> 01:29:19,439
so

2233
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:21,480
you want to avoid those kind of

2234
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:24,539
negatives to letting it go too long but

2235
01:29:21,479 --> 01:29:27,539
otherwise there's not a harm to that and

2236
01:29:24,539 --> 01:29:29,039
if you you know if you collected had a

2237
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:31,920
plastic piece of plastic under the plant

2238
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:35,158
collected those seeds they'd be fine

2239
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:37,199
right on so so all right so so we're in

2240
01:29:35,158 --> 01:29:39,179
this situation the the seeds are

2241
01:29:37,198 --> 01:29:41,698
dropping from the plant

2242
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:43,739
um if if some are dropping chances are

2243
01:29:41,698 --> 01:29:45,479
your vast majority of them are mature

2244
01:29:43,738 --> 01:29:48,599
and ready to rock

2245
01:29:45,479 --> 01:29:52,500
um uh do you have any best practices for

2246
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:55,020
harvesting a seeded plant that is you

2247
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:57,300
know dropping seeds because uh you know

2248
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:58,560
certainly we want to we want to be more

2249
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:00,300
gentle with this plant because we don't

2250
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:03,060
want to be dropping the seeds all over

2251
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:06,239
all over the room so

2252
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:07,980
um you know I just cut it and put it in

2253
01:30:06,238 --> 01:30:10,619
a bag like right then and there so

2254
01:30:07,979 --> 01:30:13,138
there's as little motion as possible

2255
01:30:10,619 --> 01:30:16,079
um what do you do that's that's exactly

2256
01:30:13,139 --> 01:30:17,520
what I would do if it's a big area of

2257
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:19,380
seed production I'd lay down plastic

2258
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:23,159
before I start cutting plants down and

2259
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:25,739
then collect uh the Fallen seed as well

2260
01:30:23,158 --> 01:30:27,960
um but yeah there's if it's just one

2261
01:30:25,738 --> 01:30:29,339
plant I just put the bag under it cut it

2262
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:31,920
right into the bag

2263
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:35,100
Would You Walk us through the the next

2264
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:37,560
steps of um take us from where we're at

2265
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:40,320
now to

2266
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:41,580
um to having clean seeds so what just

2267
01:30:40,319 --> 01:30:43,380
walk us through I know there's a lot of

2268
01:30:41,579 --> 01:30:45,779
different ways that people do it and we

2269
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:47,219
are talking about somebody who is a

2270
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:49,380
first-time breeder so they're they're

2271
01:30:47,219 --> 01:30:51,539
not going to have all the sexy gear that

2272
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:54,300
we see you know professional breeders

2273
01:30:51,539 --> 01:30:57,179
have so just walk us through like the

2274
01:30:54,300 --> 01:31:00,360
Baseline of what they're gonna do

2275
01:30:57,179 --> 01:31:02,279
so what I would do first is uh just

2276
01:31:00,359 --> 01:31:03,779
drive the plant material usually at

2277
01:31:02,279 --> 01:31:06,059
ambient temperature you don't want to

2278
01:31:03,779 --> 01:31:08,840
use heat if you have a dehumidifier you

2279
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:11,520
want to keep the humidity low

2280
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:14,100
once the plant is kind of crispy that's

2281
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,719
when I would thresh it it's a lot easier

2282
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:18,179
to thresh plants that are just like

2283
01:31:15,719 --> 01:31:22,439
crunchy if you're trying to save the

2284
01:31:18,179 --> 01:31:24,539
flour from the seeded Bud that it

2285
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:26,279
generally I don't I usually just throw

2286
01:31:24,539 --> 01:31:28,079
it away because it gets really beat up

2287
01:31:26,279 --> 01:31:29,759
and isn't the best quality but you could

2288
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:31,800
you could absolutely save it especially

2289
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:34,020
for something like cooking

2290
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:36,719
um but regardless I would get it crispy

2291
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:40,199
and then you just basically shuck it

2292
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:42,060
right off the branch get real rough take

2293
01:31:40,198 --> 01:31:44,759
those flowers and grind them between

2294
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:46,920
your hand you don't have to be too

2295
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:48,659
careful at this point the seeds should

2296
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:50,520
be relatively resilient if you're

2297
01:31:48,658 --> 01:31:52,079
crushing them by grinding them in your

2298
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:53,179
hand then they probably were dead

2299
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:55,738
already

2300
01:31:53,179 --> 01:31:59,699
so do that until it's kind of like a

2301
01:31:55,738 --> 01:32:01,379
consistent powder seed plant mixture and

2302
01:31:59,698 --> 01:32:04,439
then you can start to separate that

2303
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:06,300
material so I I always use I always

2304
01:32:04,439 --> 01:32:10,138
recommend using gloves at this point

2305
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:13,920
because anytime I'm touching the seeds I

2306
01:32:10,139 --> 01:32:16,560
really want to limit my human oils onto

2307
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:18,840
the seeds for the reasons we mentioned

2308
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:21,120
earlier about the vital biology that's

2309
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:22,380
on the outside of the seeds you know a

2310
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:24,960
lot of people handle their seeds like

2311
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:28,139
like they are like a little impervious

2312
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:30,119
suitcases but um you know I go a little

2313
01:32:28,139 --> 01:32:31,139
more gentle than that um what are your

2314
01:32:30,119 --> 01:32:34,319
thoughts

2315
01:32:31,139 --> 01:32:37,260
I definitely touch seed without gloves

2316
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:38,939
during that that process I wear gloves

2317
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:40,800
because grinding plant material in

2318
01:32:38,939 --> 01:32:44,879
between your hands is not doesn't feel

2319
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:47,159
good uh but I'm you know I've never

2320
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:50,279
thought about it how the oil affects the

2321
01:32:47,158 --> 01:32:51,899
seed coat microbiome I'm sure it has

2322
01:32:50,279 --> 01:32:54,238
some effect I don't know what it would

2323
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:56,460
be yeah I didn't actually think about it

2324
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:59,218
at all until uh last episode with Jeff

2325
01:32:56,460 --> 01:33:02,399
lowenfels when he was explaining the the

2326
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:04,800
bacteria on the inside and outside of

2327
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:07,799
the seed that are carried with it where

2328
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:10,079
the seed is going the the um the

2329
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:12,119
research of uh I think the the

2330
01:33:10,079 --> 01:33:13,800
scientist's name was James White I

2331
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:15,238
believe it was anyway

2332
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:18,119
um it's totally changed my relationship

2333
01:33:15,238 --> 01:33:19,738
with uh with with the you know handling

2334
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:21,359
the seeds

2335
01:33:19,738 --> 01:33:24,599
um so so now that you've kind of like

2336
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:26,158
pulverized the flowers in your hands and

2337
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:28,800
a bunch of seeds are like just like

2338
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:31,799
raining out of it for you hopefully

2339
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:34,560
um you still have got all of this

2340
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:36,060
um plant material mixed in with the

2341
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,460
seeds

2342
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:41,760
um you know if you're just producing a

2343
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:44,158
little bit just going at it on a on a on

2344
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:48,119
a flat surface with a credit card might

2345
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:50,399
be tedious but it would work uh is there

2346
01:33:48,119 --> 01:33:52,738
um is there a nice best practice you

2347
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:56,819
like for removing the plant material

2348
01:33:52,738 --> 01:33:59,959
from the seeds for home scale I do one

2349
01:33:56,819 --> 01:34:02,519
of a couple things I will

2350
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:05,039
grind the plant material through a

2351
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:07,320
screen sometimes to get it really fine

2352
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:09,238
uh when you okay so when you thresh the

2353
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:11,579
plant you have just this pile of whole

2354
01:34:09,238 --> 01:34:14,579
plant material you can kind of shake it

2355
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:16,859
in a tub and the seed will sink to the

2356
01:34:14,579 --> 01:34:19,500
bottom and at that point you might want

2357
01:34:16,859 --> 01:34:21,779
to just pick the plant material off the

2358
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:23,760
top and get rid of some of the bigger

2359
01:34:21,779 --> 01:34:25,519
stuff but then I'll grind it through

2360
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:29,460
like a

2361
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:31,139
spaghetti strainer screen and make all

2362
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:32,939
that plant material more fine and

2363
01:34:31,139 --> 01:34:35,219
usually the seed sits on top of that

2364
01:34:32,939 --> 01:34:37,500
screen so that's like the first

2365
01:34:35,219 --> 01:34:39,060
sift of plant material I throw away

2366
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,979
everything that ground through the

2367
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:43,500
screen

2368
01:34:39,979 --> 01:34:44,939
then I pour that seed into like a

2369
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:47,100
dishwashing tub

2370
01:34:44,939 --> 01:34:48,779
and I kind of shake it around and I've

2371
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:50,760
seen people do this a few different ways

2372
01:34:48,779 --> 01:34:53,519
and you can also buy or build machines

2373
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:55,860
that use vacuum cleaners to air clean

2374
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:59,820
that are more precise but just for the

2375
01:34:55,859 --> 01:35:01,679
home grower just a dishwasher tub shake

2376
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:03,658
it around move it to one corner and then

2377
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:05,819
I blow into the

2378
01:35:03,658 --> 01:35:07,979
tub kind of in the direction of the

2379
01:35:05,819 --> 01:35:10,799
seeds and all the light seed and plant

2380
01:35:07,979 --> 01:35:12,059
material will fly away you have to be a

2381
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:14,100
little bit careful you're going to lose

2382
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:15,840
some good seed pretty much any air

2383
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:18,780
cleaner is going to remove a little bit

2384
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:20,279
of good seed but the idea is that you're

2385
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:24,179
removing you know

2386
01:35:20,279 --> 01:35:27,000
95 of the trash and you're leaving

2387
01:35:24,179 --> 01:35:28,560
yourself with viable seed so now we're

2388
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,679
sorting seeds

2389
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:33,659
um what are you looking for for seeds

2390
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:35,940
that you are going to reject once you

2391
01:35:33,658 --> 01:35:37,920
have like a in it depends on what size

2392
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:39,479
lot you're doing and what are you saving

2393
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,158
are you just saving them for breeding

2394
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:43,259
then I might you know have a lower

2395
01:35:41,158 --> 01:35:45,359
standard for defects and things like

2396
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:48,780
that but if you're going to give it to

2397
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:51,299
people I'd clean them more precisely but

2398
01:35:48,779 --> 01:35:53,399
generally you can light colored seed is

2399
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:55,380
usually pretty obvious and if you pick

2400
01:35:53,399 --> 01:35:57,420
up a seed it just crunches in your hand

2401
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:58,760
it wasn't filled with anything you just

2402
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:00,840
toss those away

2403
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:02,579
sometimes those Will Survive air

2404
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:04,500
cleaning and they'll still be in the

2405
01:36:02,579 --> 01:36:06,658
batch especially if they still have

2406
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:08,520
plant material attached to them they

2407
01:36:06,658 --> 01:36:11,819
might be have been a little heavier and

2408
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:14,159
survived that you know if you know your

2409
01:36:11,819 --> 01:36:17,399
seed variety well you'll get a look at

2410
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:19,138
what a a good mature healthy seed looks

2411
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:21,479
like and you'll be able to kind of

2412
01:36:19,139 --> 01:36:23,880
calibrate and look for the ones that

2413
01:36:21,479 --> 01:36:25,319
don't look correct so if you have a seed

2414
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:27,659
variety that usually has Tiger stripes

2415
01:36:25,319 --> 01:36:30,059
and you have one that's light and tan uh

2416
01:36:27,658 --> 01:36:32,219
you know I would toss that

2417
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:35,219
um but it's surprising though because

2418
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:36,840
some some seed especially uh you know if

2419
01:36:35,219 --> 01:36:38,520
you do cell thing or you say you're

2420
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:41,340
trying to do a quick breeding cycle and

2421
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:44,580
you only let it go two weeks the seed

2422
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:48,239
might look green still and look immature

2423
01:36:44,579 --> 01:36:49,859
but it'll still have 70 germination

2424
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:52,439
which could be enough if all you're

2425
01:36:49,859 --> 01:36:54,960
doing is breeding with it I haven't seen

2426
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:56,579
any of those seeds yet that's a that's a

2427
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,139
strange thing yeah probably because

2428
01:36:56,579 --> 01:36:59,639
they're not released that way right

2429
01:36:58,139 --> 01:37:02,940
they're just they're part of a breeding

2430
01:36:59,639 --> 01:37:05,760
program yeah absolutely yeah

2431
01:37:02,939 --> 01:37:08,399
um you know I I you know I don't really

2432
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,480
know when people talk about curing their

2433
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:11,658
seeds

2434
01:37:09,479 --> 01:37:15,959
um I don't usually know what they mean

2435
01:37:11,658 --> 01:37:18,000
but we do know that a a fresh seed taken

2436
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:18,658
right off the plant

2437
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,920
um

2438
01:37:18,658 --> 01:37:25,500
given a little bit of time to dry will

2439
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:27,239
then germinate better in a couple weeks

2440
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:29,760
than it does on the day that you take it

2441
01:37:27,238 --> 01:37:31,678
from the plant but I actually don't know

2442
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:34,320
a whole lot about that would you speak

2443
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:36,899
to this idea of curing seeds and letting

2444
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:37,819
them dry and to increase germination

2445
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:40,019
rates

2446
01:37:37,819 --> 01:37:41,460
so that when you go to them they're

2447
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:43,980
they're actually ready to do their job

2448
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:46,739
yeah so I think it's two things one is

2449
01:37:43,979 --> 01:37:50,638
is drying it down to a moisture lever

2450
01:37:46,738 --> 01:37:53,279
level where it will be shelf stable uh

2451
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:56,340
for a certain amount of time and that's

2452
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:59,219
down to five percent moisture is uh

2453
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:02,460
preferred anything under 10 and in cold

2454
01:37:59,219 --> 01:38:04,020
treatment is also going to stay alive

2455
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:06,359
for years

2456
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:08,040
um there's also another aspect to you

2457
01:38:06,359 --> 01:38:10,859
know curing or aging your seed a little

2458
01:38:08,039 --> 01:38:13,380
bit and it's probably a post Harvest

2459
01:38:10,859 --> 01:38:17,039
maturation just physiologically that

2460
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:20,400
embryo is still doing things after the

2461
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:23,939
Harvest and it's not quite ready to

2462
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:25,920
germinate yet if you plant you know a

2463
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:28,859
week after cleaning seed or something

2464
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:31,020
like that you might get 50 germination

2465
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:34,559
if you wait two to three weeks that'll

2466
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:36,179
go up to 90. so there's something

2467
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,739
happening and I think it's beyond just

2468
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:39,658
because the moisture content probably

2469
01:38:37,738 --> 01:38:42,959
won't change that long in that amount of

2470
01:38:39,658 --> 01:38:46,500
time so my guess is that's mostly some

2471
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:49,020
physiological process within the seed

2472
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:50,939
and uh let's finish up with storing so

2473
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:53,040
now you've put in all this effort and

2474
01:38:50,939 --> 01:38:55,500
you've got your first run of seeds and

2475
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:56,939
you're so freaking stoked and you're

2476
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:58,979
gonna you're gonna share them with your

2477
01:38:56,939 --> 01:39:00,299
friends and you can't wait to grow it

2478
01:38:58,979 --> 01:39:01,500
and smoke it

2479
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:04,139
um but you got some other stuff you got

2480
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:06,359
to do first and so um so you're gonna

2481
01:39:04,139 --> 01:39:09,060
need to store it for a while

2482
01:39:06,359 --> 01:39:11,219
um what are your best practices for um

2483
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:13,219
for storing seed before I get to that

2484
01:39:11,219 --> 01:39:16,020
there's just one more thing

2485
01:39:13,219 --> 01:39:18,719
I forgot to mention I have heard some

2486
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:21,000
people talk about uh you know some seeds

2487
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:23,039
need to of other species need to what's

2488
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,840
called vernalize or they go through a

2489
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:26,760
cold period in the winter before they're

2490
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:28,440
able to germinate I have heard some

2491
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:31,320
people report and I don't have a

2492
01:39:28,439 --> 01:39:33,119
specific experience with this

2493
01:39:31,319 --> 01:39:35,939
um but they say that they get better

2494
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:38,399
germination if they put their seed in

2495
01:39:35,939 --> 01:39:40,678
not just wait the those two or three

2496
01:39:38,399 --> 01:39:42,899
weeks before trying to plant it but they

2497
01:39:40,679 --> 01:39:44,699
put it in a refrigerator or a freezer

2498
01:39:42,899 --> 01:39:45,359
for that period of time

2499
01:39:44,698 --> 01:39:47,879
um

2500
01:39:45,359 --> 01:39:49,619
I'm not sure if they've compared that

2501
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:52,380
just to waiting and I'm kind of curious

2502
01:39:49,619 --> 01:39:54,539
to try that sometime but usually when

2503
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:56,940
we're waiting the seed is in a cold

2504
01:39:54,539 --> 01:39:59,158
Vault so basically all our seeds is

2505
01:39:56,939 --> 01:40:03,419
getting that treatment anyway

2506
01:39:59,158 --> 01:40:05,638
um but yeah so when your seed is when

2507
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:08,179
your seed is dried down to a good

2508
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:11,460
percentage which should be under 10

2509
01:40:08,179 --> 01:40:13,020
preferably under eight or so percent

2510
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:13,800
moisture

2511
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:17,639
um

2512
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:20,460
you can put it in either a freezer or a

2513
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:23,579
refrigerator I usually keep my stuff in

2514
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:25,439
a refrigerator freezer should be okay as

2515
01:40:23,579 --> 01:40:28,260
long as the moisture level is low and

2516
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:30,839
that's probably best for long term uh

2517
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:33,900
storage the problem with either a

2518
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,760
refrigerator or a freezer usually arises

2519
01:40:33,899 --> 01:40:38,279
from when you're taking the seed in and

2520
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:40,440
out so you want to have it in an

2521
01:40:38,279 --> 01:40:42,179
airtight container maybe with a little

2522
01:40:40,439 --> 01:40:43,319
desiccant

2523
01:40:42,179 --> 01:40:45,960
um

2524
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:48,599
and put it in the freezer refrigerator

2525
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:51,300
when you take the seed out to access

2526
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:54,360
that session whenever you're ready to

2527
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:56,039
grow it you want to let it acclimate to

2528
01:40:54,359 --> 01:40:57,779
whatever the room temperature is before

2529
01:40:56,039 --> 01:40:59,460
you open it because like if you take

2530
01:40:57,779 --> 01:41:00,840
that say you have it in a little plastic

2531
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:02,158
container you take that out of the

2532
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:04,860
freezer it's going to be instantly

2533
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:07,559
covered with with moisture and if you

2534
01:41:04,859 --> 01:41:09,359
open that before the seed reaches before

2535
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:11,460
it all equalizes in temperature the same

2536
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:13,859
thing will happen to the seed and that's

2537
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:16,679
what will limit the viability over time

2538
01:41:13,859 --> 01:41:20,158
more than more than temperature more

2539
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:22,679
than the air exposure it's going to be

2540
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:24,599
moisture that is a dangerous seed uh so

2541
01:41:22,679 --> 01:41:26,699
we've now we've got them cured and we've

2542
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:29,219
got them stored and we know that we want

2543
01:41:26,698 --> 01:41:31,678
to bring it back to temperature before

2544
01:41:29,219 --> 01:41:33,179
we open the the container especially if

2545
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:35,039
we're only going to take out some of the

2546
01:41:33,179 --> 01:41:36,719
seeds we don't want to reclose the

2547
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:38,359
container with all that condensation

2548
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:41,158
that it suddenly pulled out of the air

2549
01:41:38,359 --> 01:41:44,279
because you you'd risk either mold or

2550
01:41:41,158 --> 01:41:45,960
heck maybe even potentially accidental

2551
01:41:44,279 --> 01:41:47,880
germination eh

2552
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:49,380
yeah if you're taking out a little pack

2553
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:51,300
and you're going to plant all the seed

2554
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:53,520
then you know you don't have to wait but

2555
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:55,619
if it's like a stored seed that you're

2556
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:57,600
taking a little aliquot out of you don't

2557
01:41:55,618 --> 01:42:00,000
want to damage the seed that goes back

2558
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:01,920
into storage aliquot there's my word for

2559
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,060
the day I haven't heard that in a long

2560
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:05,219
time

2561
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:07,080
um all right great so um so before

2562
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:09,179
before we wrap up and I let you go

2563
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:12,479
Brandon is there is there anything else

2564
01:42:09,179 --> 01:42:14,399
that um you know you've done this

2565
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:16,559
process so many times and and now you're

2566
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:18,000
doing it uh professionally is there is

2567
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,500
there anything else looking back on this

2568
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:23,100
show where you're all like you're like

2569
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:26,100
actually there's one more thing that the

2570
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:27,659
um that the new breeder is going to want

2571
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:30,060
to know is there is there anything that

2572
01:42:27,658 --> 01:42:32,579
jumps out into your brain right away

2573
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:34,320
that uh that we may not have covered

2574
01:42:32,579 --> 01:42:37,679
that we want to go back and and

2575
01:42:34,319 --> 01:42:39,719
punctuate before before we wrap up

2576
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:42,239
it there might be a couple points if

2577
01:42:39,719 --> 01:42:45,179
someone to ask me advice as a new grower

2578
01:42:42,238 --> 01:42:47,399
the first thing I would say is know your

2579
01:42:45,179 --> 01:42:49,260
germplasm that you're working with and

2580
01:42:47,399 --> 01:42:52,198
what is available before you start

2581
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:53,820
designing your program uh don't just

2582
01:42:52,198 --> 01:42:56,879
cross things because you like the name

2583
01:42:53,819 --> 01:42:58,738
or whatever and also expect things to

2584
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:01,279
react differently than you think they're

2585
01:42:58,738 --> 01:43:04,019
going to when you cross them

2586
01:43:01,279 --> 01:43:05,399
when you say know your germplasm break

2587
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:07,520
that out a little bit what exactly do

2588
01:43:05,399 --> 01:43:09,839
you mean

2589
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,880
know the two lines that you're working

2590
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:15,060
with and have grown them and things like

2591
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:17,579
that I I yes I would say have grown them

2592
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:19,560
and have some at least have seen the

2593
01:43:17,579 --> 01:43:22,079
flower people in canvas especially will

2594
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:24,600
attach to names and have these I was

2595
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:27,118
guilty of this where you you get these

2596
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:28,500
ideas you fantasize about a plant uh

2597
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:30,059
based on its description or something

2598
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:32,100
and then it's not what it is when you

2599
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:34,260
get it or you have the plant and you

2600
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:36,659
fantasize about a cross because oh these

2601
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:38,219
will this plant and this plant would

2602
01:43:36,658 --> 01:43:40,019
make a really good intermediate but then

2603
01:43:38,219 --> 01:43:42,719
you cross them and the intermediate

2604
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:45,540
doesn't exist it's totally different so

2605
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:47,460
you need to be flexible and just uh work

2606
01:43:45,539 --> 01:43:50,399
with what you have and not you know the

2607
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:51,960
fantasy of what you have yeah I actually

2608
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:53,638
have been running into a problem with

2609
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:57,359
that myself I have this fantasy of

2610
01:43:53,639 --> 01:43:59,039
Crossing um Sour Diesel to jet fuel OG

2611
01:43:57,359 --> 01:44:00,118
um because I like both of those very

2612
01:43:59,039 --> 01:44:03,359
much

2613
01:44:00,118 --> 01:44:06,559
um but you know having grown Sour Diesel

2614
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:09,559
a couple times it is uh so

2615
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:13,739
likely to both

2616
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:16,560
throw male flowers and express itself

2617
01:44:13,738 --> 01:44:19,079
with intersex flowers

2618
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:21,480
um that I just I'm just not willing to

2619
01:44:19,079 --> 01:44:23,579
you know breed with it and cause all

2620
01:44:21,479 --> 01:44:26,399
these potential problems down the line

2621
01:44:23,579 --> 01:44:29,340
and I didn't realize that until I you

2622
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:31,799
know started growing the sour diesel

2623
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:34,139
that we have today and realizing that

2624
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:36,539
that most of the folks who are

2625
01:44:34,139 --> 01:44:39,779
you know working with sour diesel are

2626
01:44:36,539 --> 01:44:43,679
expecting male flowers and intersex

2627
01:44:39,779 --> 01:44:45,840
flowers and and I'm like well I guess I

2628
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:48,840
probably won't go down that path because

2629
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:51,179
I I did my research on the germplasm yes

2630
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:53,639
it's also surprising I have some things

2631
01:44:51,179 --> 01:44:55,500
that are prone to intersex that when you

2632
01:44:53,639 --> 01:44:57,539
cross them none of the plants in the

2633
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:58,859
cross will be intersexed maybe if I took

2634
01:44:57,539 --> 01:45:01,439
it another generation it would start

2635
01:44:58,859 --> 01:45:02,759
causing problems but if you're just so I

2636
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:04,919
don't want to discourage people either

2637
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:06,960
if you're just trying to make an F1 you

2638
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:09,079
know and one of them is intersex it

2639
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:11,399
might solve the problem and

2640
01:45:09,079 --> 01:45:13,439
alternatively I've had plants that were

2641
01:45:11,399 --> 01:45:15,479
you know never produced in male flower I

2642
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:16,879
crossed them all of the seeds are

2643
01:45:15,479 --> 01:45:19,559
intersexed

2644
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:21,420
and neither of the parents seemingly one

2645
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:23,219
of the parents was deep chunk which I'm

2646
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:25,020
not aware of intersex problems with deep

2647
01:45:23,219 --> 01:45:26,880
chunk and the other was a clone

2648
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:29,400
lesperado so I don't know the background

2649
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:31,920
of esperado but the Clone itself you

2650
01:45:29,399 --> 01:45:34,920
know never had had a problem but every

2651
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:38,399
almost every single seed is just almost

2652
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:40,079
50 50. right on

2653
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:43,379
um right on so do you have anything else

2654
01:45:40,079 --> 01:45:46,618
to add before we before we wrap up

2655
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:48,659
um lastly the the other the last like uh

2656
01:45:46,618 --> 01:45:52,139
kind of point that I try to

2657
01:45:48,658 --> 01:45:54,539
impose on newer Growers is uh you know

2658
01:45:52,139 --> 01:45:59,000
consider working with higher populations

2659
01:45:54,539 --> 01:46:02,158
even if you have a small uh space so

2660
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:04,260
this might be breaking plant count

2661
01:46:02,158 --> 01:46:07,138
numbers for a lot of people and this is

2662
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:09,179
why I would prefer say uh if you're

2663
01:46:07,139 --> 01:46:11,400
going to regulate Gardens do it on Space

2664
01:46:09,179 --> 01:46:13,079
rather than plant house because I can

2665
01:46:11,399 --> 01:46:16,079
you can fit

2666
01:46:13,079 --> 01:46:18,319
a hundred plants or more in a two by

2667
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:21,719
four if you have them stunted in little

2668
01:46:18,319 --> 01:46:23,819
uh trays something like that and if

2669
01:46:21,719 --> 01:46:26,399
you're not selecting especially when

2670
01:46:23,819 --> 01:46:28,500
you're making cross initial crosses and

2671
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:30,539
you're introducing jeans where you're

2672
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:33,118
just selecting for one major Gene but

2673
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:35,880
you want to keep the gene pool uh broad

2674
01:46:33,118 --> 01:46:37,198
like if I'm doing a photo autocross and

2675
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:39,800
I'm not trying to select specific

2676
01:46:37,198 --> 01:46:43,439
phenotypes yet I'll do those original

2677
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:45,679
Generations as populations in small

2678
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:48,238
tents so you're still hitting a large

2679
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:50,520
selection numbers and I still will make

2680
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:51,959
especially selections against plants

2681
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:53,880
that get diseased and things like that

2682
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:55,439
but you're in a very small space that's

2683
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:57,600
probably not something that's going to

2684
01:46:55,439 --> 01:46:59,819
happen with the first time rear but that

2685
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:02,100
sounds like it might be a really good

2686
01:46:59,819 --> 01:47:04,019
set too because as soon as you do this

2687
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:06,179
once and you have success you're

2688
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:07,860
suddenly going to want to do way bigger

2689
01:47:06,179 --> 01:47:10,319
sifts so you have more options I'm

2690
01:47:07,859 --> 01:47:12,420
guessing well cool well Brandon thank

2691
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:14,880
you so much for coming on shapingfire

2692
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:17,158
and sharing your experience I

2693
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,960
appreciated a great deal I really

2694
01:47:17,158 --> 01:47:21,179
appreciate the invitation thank you for

2695
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:23,579
having me so if you want to follow along

2696
01:47:21,179 --> 01:47:25,800
uh with Brandon there are three

2697
01:47:23,579 --> 01:47:28,019
different places that you can

2698
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:30,360
um you can be in contact with him if you

2699
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:33,360
wish the first I definitely recommend

2700
01:47:30,359 --> 01:47:36,059
following his uh personal Instagram at

2701
01:47:33,359 --> 01:47:37,859
growinghire

2702
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:40,440
um he I mean first of all there's a lot

2703
01:47:37,859 --> 01:47:43,439
of great plant photos but the commentary

2704
01:47:40,439 --> 01:47:46,079
that Brandon offers on on this or that

2705
01:47:43,439 --> 01:47:48,079
project that he's working on is engaging

2706
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:51,658
in educational so that's a good thing

2707
01:47:48,079 --> 01:47:54,059
second I'm a big fan of the company that

2708
01:47:51,658 --> 01:47:57,420
Brandon has started uh with a couple of

2709
01:47:54,060 --> 01:48:02,940
his friends Michael fight Solutions uh

2710
01:47:57,420 --> 01:48:07,079
which focuses on uh crop advising with a

2711
01:48:02,939 --> 01:48:10,500
regenerative and mycology mindset for uh

2712
01:48:07,079 --> 01:48:14,819
for agriculture and and their Instagram

2713
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:16,920
is at micro fights Solutions and if

2714

01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:19,158
that's

2716
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:26,039
m-y-c-o-p-h-y-t-e microphic might go
