1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:10,960
so even you know you are a pretty famous

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,429
proponent of the entourage effect using

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,089
the entirety of the cannabis plant

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:18,730
together because all of the you know THC

5
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:20,800
the CBD all the what we call minor

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,990
cannabinoids the terpenes all these

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,330
parts they kind of play together with

8
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:26,859
our endocannabinoids system or body as a

9
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:29,139
whole kind of like a lock and key to

10
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:31,929
kind of open up you know different forms

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,640
of healing but in popular press and

12
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:35,710
where most of the studies that we're

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,950
seeing you know they're mostly on you

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,259
know THC CBD the acid forms of those you

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:44,680
know CVG and some of the terpenes are

16
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:47,049
cool right but um I'm curious what you

17
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:49,450
think we may find with some of the

18
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:52,259
things that we're not hearing about and

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:55,870
may or may not be researched yet like

20
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:58,899
like the the flavonoids the esters and

21
00:00:55,869 --> 00:01:00,939
secondary secondary metabolites that are

22
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:02,109
there and you know what what do you

23
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:05,078
think that we're gonna find when we

24
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:07,299
start studying those focus li instead of

25
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:08,648
you know just turbans generally well

26
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,368
there's a lot of potential for other

27
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:13,840
parts of the plant from the leaves

28
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:16,349
there's an agent called canna preen

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,090
which has a really interesting

30
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:22,118
anti-inflammatory profile there's been

31
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:25,840
virtually no work done on yet another

32
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:29,858
agent of Flav owned from cannabis is

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,950
called ken flavin a again this is a very

34
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:34,858
powerful anti-inflammatory without the

35
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,629
side effects of the non-steroidal

36
00:01:34,858 --> 00:01:40,269
anti-inflammatories that quite

37
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:43,958
frequently can produce ulcers even heart

38
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:45,688
attacks or strokes in contrast ken

39
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:49,060
flavin he has an anti-inflammatory

40
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:52,328
profile where these side effects would

41
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,969
not occur so that's something that it's

42
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:57,578
worth looking into additionally we've

43
00:01:54,968 --> 00:02:00,519
got a totally different set of agents

44
00:01:57,578 --> 00:02:02,138
from cannabis roots which historically

45
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:05,649
have been used for some of the same

46
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:07,988
things as the tops including as int

47
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:10,239
inflammatories and in treatment of

48
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:14,349
cancer we know that the roots contain

49
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,700
small amounts of tri terpenoids which

50
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:18,310
have very interesting

51
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:21,219
facts in these areas and even some

52
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,069
alkaloids which they always look for in

53
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:27,580
the tops but never found so there's a

54
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:29,768
lot to be learned yet do we know enough

55
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,410
yet about even how to use these that

56
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:34,000
that it would justify processing other

57
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:36,519
parts of the plants other than the

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,419
flowers just to get some of these even

59
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,799
though we don't know exactly what

60
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:45,518
they're doing yet being done a couple of

61
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:48,400
months ago I was in Chile in Valparaiso

62
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,590
on the coast and there was a man there

63
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,360
selling various kind of cannabis

64
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,000
preparations on the street and one of

65
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,489
them was a salve that he made out of

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,739
cannabis roots so there are a lot of

67
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,799
artisanal products that are employing

68
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:05,920
these other parts of the plants and dog

69
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:08,110
people are claiming good efficacy we

70
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,229
don't have again controlled clinical

71
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,569
trials but hopefully that will come and

72
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:15,129
give us the answers it's interesting too

73
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,619
because you know you've said before that

74
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:20,289
you know people who are processing their

75
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,599
Sun leaves for CBD are gonna be

76
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,789
disappointed because in the in the

77
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,888
exterior Sun leaves where trichomes are

78
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:29,229
not made they're not gonna find CBD

79
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:31,359
there and and so I tell people you know

80
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:33,039
if you want to still use your Sun leaves

81
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:34,689
that's great but you're essentially

82
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,798
making yourself wheatgrass shots you

83
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:37,568
know you're gonna you're getting some

84
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,459
with chlorophyll and aminos and good

85
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:42,729
things like that but this actually is a

86
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:44,969
whole nother level of justification for

87
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:47,349
that because while we may not know

88
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:50,139
exactly what they're doing to us in

89
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:51,818
those dosages and with a plant that

90
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,620
we've carried around for us for so many

91
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:56,589
thousands of years chances are it's only

92
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,769
going to be a win well it's not likely

93
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:03,370
to produce damage a lot of people are

94
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:05,019
juicing leaves in large amounts because

95
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,230
of the magnesium load from the

96
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:11,919
chlorophyll they can get intestinal

97
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:14,738
cramping and diarrhea but beyond that I

98
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,829
wouldn't expect any major harms great

99
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,660
thank you so if you're interested in the

100
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:21,549
specialty chemicals that you can find in

101
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,950
the cannabis rootball we actually did a

102
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,959
podcast on

103
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:26,370
a while back so you can find a link for

104
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,519
that in the first comment Thank You

105
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,519
