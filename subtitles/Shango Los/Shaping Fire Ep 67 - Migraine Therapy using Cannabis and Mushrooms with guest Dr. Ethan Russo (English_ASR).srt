2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,240
one of the greatest challenges in life

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,160
is to suffer from an ailment that people

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,160
have chosen to take for granted

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,839
there exists a variety of diseases and

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,399
other health issues that are so common

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,320
that they are

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,919
actually seen as natural or somehow to

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,920
be expected and therefore

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,760
not as motivating for medical research

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,000
or empathy from others

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,080
they may be entirely life debilitating

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,920
but because they seem to be intractable

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,198
and their solution not impending or

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,039
media engaging

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,719
they become just taken for granted and

17
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,079
people lose interest

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,759
today we're going to talk about one of

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,439
these health issues

20
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,599
migraines are a headache disorder that

21
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,878
affects 15 percent of everyone in the

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,719
entire world

23
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,320
typically these migraine headaches last

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,920
from a few hours to three days and

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,000
sometimes longer

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,239
symptoms include nausea vomiting and

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,198
severe sensitivity to light sound and

28
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,718
smell

29
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,558
while some folks can function during

30
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,558
these episodes the majority need to

31
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,839
withdraw from society and hide from

32
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,479
sensory stimulation

33
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,478
and simply bear the pain until it passes

34
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,280
astonishingly we still do not understand

35
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,560
why humans have migraines at all

it's great to be here once again

103
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,759
thank you so let's get right into

104
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,719
talking about and getting a better

105
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,679
understanding of what

106
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,439
migraines are um there's such a variety

107
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,959
of them that when i'm talking to

108
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,400
patients and they're explaining their

109
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,158
symptoms to me

110
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,480
they can be all over the place and yet

111
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,679
somehow they all fit into

112
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:28,798
this this this basket you know of

113
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,959
called migraines um what technically

114
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,239
are migraines and and why does there

115
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,519
seem to be such a variety

116
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:39,200
of them well uh

117
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,080
migraine is probably the most complex

118
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,759
biochemical disorder that affects humans

119
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,640
that we're aware of

120
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:49,199
um so it encompasses a lot of territory

121
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,759
i think everyone recognizes at the most

122
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,158
basic

123
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,158
level that it's a kind of headache but

124
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,679
in fact there are forms of migraine with

125
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,598
no headache at all

126
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,959
uh just to make it all the more

127
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,878
complicated

128
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,799
uh but this is a condition that often

129
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,840
runs in families but it's not

130
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,040
strongly genetic um

131
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,319
so there are aspects of it that

132
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:16,079
enter into questions about it

133
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,519
uh clearly families can be affected but

134
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,400
families often have

135
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,560
similar environments and that can

136
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,679
certainly affect the tendency towards

137
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,879
this

138
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,840
but migraine is most often recognized as

139
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,600
a headache that is associated with a

140
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,599
throbbing type pain

141
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,000
usually on one side of the head in other

142
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,360
words unilateral

143
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,800
also associated with some odd phenomena

144
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,720
it may or may not be associated with an

145
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,840
aura an aura is a warning that consists

146
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,160
of a change in neurologic function the

147
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,799
most common of which

148
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,759
is a visual disturbance that could

149
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,319
include

150
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,000
an actual field cut where you lose

151
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,120
vision totally on one side

152
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,918
it's just a blank it doesn't exist

153
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,478
in the person's brain at that time but

154
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,359
also

155
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,959
can include what is called scintillating

156
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,080
scotometer

157
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:18,079
these are flashing lights or

158
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:21,279
sparkles or lightning bolts

159
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,959
um or it can include visual distortions

160
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,198
like things look like they're melting

161
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,799
so it's a very disturbing symptom and

162
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,600
that often

163
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,478
presages a headache to follow somewhere

164
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,520
between

165
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:38,000
20 and 40 minutes later but there's

166
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,319
situations in which the aura

167
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,600
occurs without the headache and that's

168
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,240
called a migraine

169
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,639
equivalent the other features of

170
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,680
migraine that are quite commonly

171
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,199
present are association with nausea and

172
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,759
vomiting

173
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,319
and two other phenomena that call are

174
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,400
called

175
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:01,839
photophobia and phonophobia photophobia

176
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,560
is a is literally fear of light

177
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,959
phonophobia is fear of sound and this is

178
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,639
what

179
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:11,359
leads people with a migraine to engage

180
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,800
in hibernation behavior what they're

181
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,000
going to want to do

182
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,199
is hide away in a dark quiet room try to

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
get to sleep

184
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,840
and that often will stop the migraine if

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,600
they can get to sleep

186
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,599
um so this has been an affliction of

187
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,199
humans for as long as there's been

188
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,840
recorded history

189
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,120
going back to the ancient greeks and

190
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:39,038
obviously much before that

191
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,079
we probably don't have the writing for

192
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:46,159
and interestingly

193
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,879
for at least 1200 years there's been

194
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,160
it's been noted that cannabis can be an

195
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:54,319
effective treatment

196
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,439
so i suspect we'll get into that later

197
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,360
so with these different uh types of

198
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,079
manifestations these different symptoms

199
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,879
you know we've got

200
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,240
we've got localized pain we've got the

201
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,478
the radiant type

202
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,519
um we've got these auras that can that

203
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,079
can warn us

204
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,120
and then uh some include the the the

205
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,560
sharp stabbing

206
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,439
ice pick kind you know people have got

207
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,879
different symptoms than other people and

208
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,759
then sometimes the same

209
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,079
patient will have different symptoms

210
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,000
from

211
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,839
migraine to migraine like they'll say oh

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,279
this is i'm having a migraine oh i can

213
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,560
tell it's this kind

214
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:33,279
um do we have any explanation for why

215
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,280
uh migraines would show up with

216
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:40,478
different symptoms in the same human

217
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:43,439
uh no not really

218
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,000
um you've made a distinction between

219
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,598
what are called

220
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,759
simple migraines where there's the

221
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,000
headache with the associated symptoms

222
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,038
and classic migraine which would have

223
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,120
the aura

224
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,759
followed by the headache and associated

225
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,759
symptoms

226
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,119
although some people tend to split these

227
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,918
into different diagnoses

228
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,800
they really are part of the same package

229
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,318
there's similar similar pathophysiology

230
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,120
which is to say

231
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,000
the underlying basis and phenomena seem

232
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,560
to be the same

233
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,199
and clearly people with migraine

234
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,560
tendencies over the course of a lifetime

235
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,759
may manifest different patterns

236
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,160
so i tend to be what's called the lumper

237
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,479
and

238
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:34,320
put them in a more single category

239
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,838
so um i i recognize that if these are

240
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,879
you know i guess for this for the sake

241
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,640
of this interview i'm going to be a

242
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,918
lumper too

243
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,278
so so if we're going to lump them

244
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,158
together is is the underlying mechanism

245
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,958
for pain

246
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,120
the same between the different types or

247
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:52,559
are they all going to be caused by

248
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,320
uh subtly different uh mechanisms

249
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:59,439
in the human body uh

250
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,600
the underlying biochemical effects seem

251
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,080
to be held in common

252
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,920
um so yeah i'm going to say that they're

253
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,120
largely the same

254
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:12,000
we should state at the outset that

255
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,560
this is not created by muscles pulling

256
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,799
on the head

257
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,679
what has been called in the past tension

258
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:23,359
headache or muscle contraction headache

259
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:26,479
has very little objective evidence

260
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,200
to support it and in fact most headaches

261
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,879
fall

262
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:35,120
under a more broader rubric

263
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:39,519
of migraine so what's involved is

264
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,560
exceedingly complex in terms of the pain

265
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,600
it seems to be due to a release of

266
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,799
chemicals that

267
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,839
excite the nerves and it may have its

268
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,838
basis

269
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,000
in a lower part of the brain the brain

270
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:56,080
stem

271
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
a part called substantia [ __ ]

272
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:03,240
and is involved to some degree

273
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,399
but particularly an area called the

274
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,519
periaqueductal gray

275
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,919
in the brainstem is

276
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,480
is felt to be the so-called migraine

277
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:18,639
generator

278
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:21,920
so um if if this is the generator

279
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:26,159
it starts there and then how these other

280
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:28,879
how the the chemicals that it puts out

281
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,919
um impacts different people in different

282
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,679
ways so for so

283
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,039
so it's taking what is essentially the

284
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,639
same action

285
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:39,838
but how our bodies

286
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,799
use those chemicals is based more on

287
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,839
genetics is that

288
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,240
a close understanding ah boy be hard to

289
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,440
say

290
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,440
what we can what we can say is

291
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,800
that they're chemical changes that

292
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,440
sensitize

293
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:58,639
synthesize the nerves so phenomena that

294
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,200
normally are not painful such as

295
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,159
the beating of the heart stretching the

296
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
blood vessels

297
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:08,240
creates a pounding pain hopefully

298
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,278
people don't have this all the time

299
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,600
because it's very

300
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:15,919
disturbing so it is the case

301
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,240
that migraine is associated with both

302
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:21,439
biochemical changes

303
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,720
that affect the nerves but also

304
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,760
changes in blood vessels what are called

305
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,040
vascular changes so in the old

306
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,120
literature

307
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,120
uh there were a lot of people that

308
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,600
thought that this was more of a plumbing

309
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,720
issue

310
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,120
that it had to do with um

311
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,839
blood vessels being too big or too small

312
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,039
but

313
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,480
in fact those are more secondary changes

314
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:49,838
on that really are more related to

315
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,839
the complex biochemical

316
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,440
disturbance that's going on during a

317
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,360
migraine

318
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,880
before we move forward i want to jump

319
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,680
back to something that you said in

320
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,799
passing

321
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:03,838
um i believe that you said that

322
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,199
um the comment there's a common

323
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,320
misperception

324
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,560
that migraines are caused by i think you

325
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,839
said the stretching of muscles

326
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,000
um so is this what

327
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,760
you know it's not uncommon for me to

328
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,720
hear from patients that

329
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,559
they believe it's like the the fascia

330
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,079
that is between the skin

331
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:29,039
of their scalp and their and the skull

332
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:31,439
that there's some issue with the the the

333
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:35,360
the fascia that surrounds

334
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,600
the the skull and or and or

335
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,399
some people will not for example pull

336
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,680
their hair

337
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,919
back into ponytails because they believe

338
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,958
that that is irritating

339
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,879
the fascia or or or you know the

340
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:52,399
musculature in some way of the

341
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:56,000
of the head and that you know may be an

342
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,480
onset to their migraines uh

343
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
was that comment meant to suggest that

344
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,920
that this belief is a

345
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,159
myth and and they might they might be

346
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,439
related but there's no actual scientific

347
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,559
correlation

348
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,839
uh what it says this um

349
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,838
people may note a variety of triggers

350
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,360
there's a difference between a trigger

351
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,519
and a cause okay so pulling the hair

352
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,039
back isn't a cause it can be

353
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,278
a trigger for some people because

354
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,360
one of the effects of migraine as well

355
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:28,799
as other clinical endocannabinoid

356
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,639
deficiencies

357
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,000
is a supersensitization the idea of

358
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,120
having pain where it

359
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,278
doesn't belong because the tissues look

360
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:44,320
normal so many people with migraine may

361
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:48,000
have areas

362
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,360
of spot tenderness throughout the scalp

363
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
or a face so even between headaches they

364
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,079
may have spots that when they're pressed

365
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,839
are unusually uh sensitive or painful

366
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,359
but there are many other triggers for

367
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,800
migraines too

368
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,959
uh for some people it's certain foods

369
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,479
that may contain the amino acid

370
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,000
pteramine

371
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,039
and strong cheese or red wine

372
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,159
for other people exposure to flashing

373
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,639
lights or overly bright sunshine

374
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,078
may act as a trigger and so people with

375
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,039
migraine often

376
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:28,159
wear broad brimmed hats and polarized

377
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:31,278
sunglasses to reduce glare

378
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,639
this kind of thing or exposure to

379
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:36,958
excessive

380
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,759
noise um any of these things can act as

381
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,958
a trigger

382
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,000
to a migraine let's tease out that

383
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,799
trigger a little bit

384
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,720
because one thing that i think that

385
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,120
patients have in common

386
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
is is their particular set of

387
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,839
environmental triggers

388
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,240
so um you know whether or not it's light

389
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,720
or

390
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,480
sound or strong smells or or a food

391
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,000
most patients have got the things that

392
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,240
they tend to avoid

393
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,078
because they can cut they can trigger

394
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,120
the migraines for them

395
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:12,319
um uh and especially like you know over

396
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,839
over stimulation in any category

397
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,680
um are all of these doing one

398
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,760
thing that um that stimulates

399
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,359
the area of the brain that you said you

400
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,679
know most of the migraines

401
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,919
come from are they are is there

402
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,679
something going on with the stimulation

403
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,679
and then the nervous system and then

404
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,198
that begets the migraine is it that

405
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,879
direct

406
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:40,399
uh let's use an analogy

407
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:43,360
um suppose we had kids around a pool

408
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,639
and they're taking buckets of water

409
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,039
individually

410
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,879
so johnny has a bucket and sally has a

411
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,919
bucket

412
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,240
and it really doesn't matter whose

413
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:58,159
bucket it was but at a certain point

414
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,759
the pull overflows and with migraine it

415
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,719
may be a combination

416
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,919
of one strong trigger and a couple of

417
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,199
minor triggers

418
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:09,439
but in the end uh it happens

419
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,958
um and then you know there's a

420
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,920
relationship to stress

421
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,799
but it isn't the way people think if

422
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,838
we're going to

423
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,359
make broad categorizations it's often

424
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,560
said that migraners

425
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,560
people with a susceptibility to migraine

426
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:29,278
often function really well under stress

427
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,599
but they're very prone to what's called

428
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,360
a holiday headache or weekend headache

429
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,680
or a vacation headache

430
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,039
when the stress is over that's when

431
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,239
they'll get hit

432
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,719
during the the the downtime

433
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,000
um and it can similarly come from

434
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,600
sleeping too long

435
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,799
um they're just countless factors um

436
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,680
and it is the case that

437
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,159
people with migraine often benefit um

438
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,758
from

439
00:16:54,159 --> 00:17:01,519
keeping regular habits in other words

440
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:04,798
set bedtime and time to get up

441
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,959
regular meals not skipping meals

442
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:10,240
any of these things can contribute to

443
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,519
the tendency to have an attack

444
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,400
i can imagine that folks who experience

445
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,558
migraines regularly are pretty

446
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,679
unsatisfied

447
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,119
with this answer based on the state of

448
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,199
the science

449
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,119
what you know the people like you who

450
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,600
are actually doing the research

451
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,359
trying to know more you know what do you

452
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,599
you know what do you all say over

453
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,678
over coffee or beer like because the see

454
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,240
this it's it's such a mess right how do

455
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,840
you

456
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,359
what do you all discuss with each other

457
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,959
about how you actually help

458
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:44,319
people when it's so varied

459
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,160
yeah well i to be honest this uh

460
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,599
migraine was one of my favorite things

461
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,558
to treat because

462
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,879
i was interested in it i thought that we

463
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:56,319
had good things to offer people

464
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,440
and i always appreciated its complexity

465
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:02,879
but um this is the reason that i saw

466
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,919
new patients one an hour

467
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:09,679
modern medicine doesn't give most

468
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:12,880
practitioners that kind of luxury but

469
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,720
to go through this to get an adequate

470
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,840
history addressing

471
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,038
triggers uh addressing what migraine is

472
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,558
about

473
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,480
and uh prescribing

474
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,038
a course of action that would include

475
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,919
medicine but also lifestyle

476
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,879
adjustments so it takes a full hour and

477
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,759
that's

478
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,720
after having previously spent spending

479
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,960
time

480
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,240
uh going through the past medical

481
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,440
history

482
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:45,759
which hopefully was there in advance

483
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,558
so prior records um yeah this is complex

484
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,919
and it's not

485
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,359
amenable to the the current 15-minute

486
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,000
appointment

487
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,959
it's probably not very appropriate for

488
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,798
you know

489
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,640
they've got a hard job to do but just

490
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,480
your general physician you know your

491
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,240
family physician that you go in

492
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,599
they're not going to have necessarily

493
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,319
the the depth

494
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,639
nor the hour to give a patient and so i

495
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,558
can

496
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,600
i can see how people would be frustrated

497
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:16,639
in trying to find a solution so

498
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:19,038
before we move on to talking about how

499
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,038
migraines

500
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,119
and endocannabinoid deficiency work

501
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:26,240
together or don't

502
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:29,038
um i wanted to hit on real quick um

503
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,279
hormones as being a trigger because you

504
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,319
know it's incredibly common

505
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,960
for women who you know are are you know

506
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,399
three times

507
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,798
more likely to experience migraines than

508
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,600
men are that that they will experience

509
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,119
them

510
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:47,759
around their monthly cycle and

511
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,798
and you know you very often i'll hear a

512
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,839
female patient

513
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,839
you know curse her cycle and the

514
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:54,639
hormones and the migraine in the same

515
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,399
breath

516
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,120
um how are those related uh it's clearly

517
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,159
the case

518
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,279
that um hormones can be a trigger and

519
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,240
the most common

520
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,399
uh association with migraine would be

521
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,558
for them to occur

522
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,200
perimenstrually but in some women they

523
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:18,079
could occur at the time of ovulation

524
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:21,360
so it's just another factor in the past

525
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:24,399
women were often told well you know

526
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,119
when you go through menopause uh diesel

527
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,880
stop

528
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:32,719
something to look forward to haha from a

529
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,159
male physician uh that is sometimes true

530
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,400
but not always true

531
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,280
and again not something to look forward

532
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,080
to

533
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:43,038
um there are a lot of unknown factors

534
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,079
here again we

535
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,119
we mentioned genetics but um i've really

536
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,759
come to believe

537
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,639
that there's an important relationship

538
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:55,759
to the endocannabinoid system

539
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,000
that is similarly affected by diet and

540
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:02,158
the microbiome in other words

541
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,119
the bacteria in the gut and uh

542
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,240
that certainly could be a strong

543
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:10,719
explanation for

544
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,679
why uh it seems that migraine is more

545
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,880
common

546
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,080
on some circles these days and there are

547
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,360
relationships of

548
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,519
migraine um to

549
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:24,240
differences regionally that have to do

550
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:27,519
with traditional lifestyles versus

551
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,679
quote modern unquote lifestyles

552
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,918
let's let's go ahead and dig into

553
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,080
endocannabinoid deficiency right now one

554
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,038
of the things that i

555
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:39,199
was most attracted to your papers tying

556
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:39,759
endocannabinoid deficiency and migraines

557
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,880
together

558
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:45,279
is that you know when when

559
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,120
explaining the endocannabinoid system to

560
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,759
people

561
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,678
very often they say well you know doing

562
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,440
something taking cannabis medicine to

563
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,679
help my endocannabinoid system sounds

564
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,798
like it's some kind of panacea how can

565
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,400
how can one herb help so many things and

566
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,960
and what i generally explain to them

567
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,120
is that well the endocannabinoid system

568
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,200
is the body's

569
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:10,239
homeostasis um mechanism

570
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,759
and so if the endocannabinoid system is

571
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:17,599
um dysfunctional well each of the

572
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:19,519
body's individual systems can start to

573
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,918
become unstable and out of balance and

574
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:22,960
and you can experience a host of of

575
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,480
challenges

576
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,759
in in your papers you talk about

577
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,759
um patients who are experiencing

578
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:37,440
a uh a low endocannabinoid

579
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:39,279
tone are more susceptible to migraines

580
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,679
and then and then you kind of build on

581
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,000
this platform so so let's start there

582
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,960
would you explain in detail what you

583
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
mean by

584
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,159
a patient's endocannabinoid tone

585
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,519
and how you believe that is related to

586
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,039
the propensity for

587
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:57,000
them to have migraines sure

588
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,158
okay so first of all what's an

589
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,640
angiocannabinoid

590
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,400
these are endogenous cannabinoids so

591
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,000
these would be

592
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:10,080
substances that are similar to thc

593
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,759
that naturally occur within our bodies

594
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:16,359
these are of key importance in the brain

595
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,079
in regulating the levels of

596
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:20,959
neurotransmitters the chemical

597
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:23,359
messengers in the brain

598
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,919
endocannabinoid tone is a function of

599
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:29,599
several things simultaneously

600
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,880
so the amounts of the endocannabinoids

601
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:36,158
the um number and

602
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,200
activity of the receptor cb1

603
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,520
where they work and also the activity of

604
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,600
the

605
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,240
enzymes that make and break down the

606
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:46,879
endocannabinoids

607
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,599
so again endocannabinoid tone is

608
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,640
something

609
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:54,240
that we refer to in the literature but

610
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,960
it's not something we can easily measure

611
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,919
in patients the only way to do it

612
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,120
directly is

613
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:04,080
with a cerebral spinal fluid examination

614
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,319
by a lumbar puncture or spinal tap which

615
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,918
is

616
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:11,839
obviously an invasive procedure

617
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,559
we're really at the beginning of being

618
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,439
able to do

619
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:17,119
brain imaging to try and assess this

620
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,159
kind of function

621
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:22,359
but um clearly we know

622
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,559
very well at this point when

623
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:28,158
endocannabinoid levels are low

624
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:30,879
or endocannabinoid tone is diminished

625
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:34,240
then a number of things will occur a

626
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,440
person who is affected in this manner

627
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,400
is going to tend to have pain

628
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,558
they're going to tend to not sleep well

629
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,400
they're going to tend to be nauseated

630
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,119
and then there are a whole host of other

631
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,360
things

632
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,479
that can happen but already justin would

633
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,719
have mentioned

634
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,519
you see some commonality with the

635
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,240
symptoms of migraine

636
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,839
but it also would apply to other

637
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,200
disorders that seemingly

638
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:03,599
are related such as fibromyalgia and

639
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,679
irritable bowel

640
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,119
and as i've heard you mentioned in other

641
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,200
conversations

642
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,399
a lot of people end up with all three of

643
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,480
these conditions

644
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,679
unfortunately they can occur at the same

645
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,400
time uh

646
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,840
or people with a tendency towards one

647
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,200
may manifest

648
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:25,038
the others at some point in their lives

649
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,600
so i can imagine that some folks

650
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:30,720
listening are like well i don't want

651
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:33,199
deficiency um how does that happen

652
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,798
and we've spoken before about you know

653
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,360
how many different ways

654
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,038
um you know the the modern american life

655
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,839
thing can give it to you from

656
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,640
from poor sleep poor nutrition

657
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:46,480
environmental

658
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,520
toxins pharmaceuticals you may be taking

659
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,278
um and then genetic predisposition

660
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:56,639
so so all of these you know repress

661
00:25:53,278 --> 00:26:00,430
the body's creation of these

662
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,679
of these endogenous cannabinoids

663
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,080
[Music]

664
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,240
is it as simple i mean it's never as

665
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,158
simple but

666
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,319
when when the body's creation of

667
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:15,760
endocannabinoids

668
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,759
is repressed from these ways of living

669
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,600
are we thinking that it's the lack of

670
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:25,278
these cannabinoids in the body

671
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,740
that allows the balance in these systems

672
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:27,200
to

673
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,640
[Music]

674
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:34,159
become erratic and therefore allows

675
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,759
this pain to manifest as a migraine

676
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,159
ah quite possibly clearly i believe that

677
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,440
and

678
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:44,400
um some people who have

679
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,440
uh investigated this type of thing uh

680
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,919
feel similarly

681
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,880
we have some direct evidence at this

682
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,960
point

683
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:56,320
um when i wrote first um

684
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,679
article length paper um on

685
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,158
clinical endocannabinoid deficiency in

686
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:03,440
2004

687
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:07,760
i proposed a study which i knew

688
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,440
couldn't be done in the united states on

689
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,679
just wouldn't have gotten ethical

690
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,759
approval and it was to

691
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,840
examine the cerebrospinal fluid of

692
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,519
migraine sufferers versus

693
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,879
people who didn't have it and look for

694
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,079
differences

695
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,679
subsequently in 2008 a group in italy

696
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:27,839
sarkie eliadol did exactly that study

697
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,278
and there was a tremendous

698
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:35,918
difference in the level of anandamide

699
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:38,398
uh one of the endocannabinoids in

700
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,240
in micronerves versus control patients

701
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:43,678
that didn't have headaches

702
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,240
so this is the first objective proof

703
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,120
of the importance of the endocannabinoid

704
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,240
system in migraine and the first

705
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,558
uh proof again if you will of clinical

706
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,759
endocannabinoid deficiency

707
00:27:54,558 --> 00:28:00,000
being at the root of the pathophysiology

708
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,000
of migraine

709
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,839
and i find it interesting that you know

710
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,880
we'll talk to it we'll talk more

711
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,000
later about how how you know using

712
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,120
cannabis

713
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,880
um helps with migraines there's the also

714
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,959
the idea that even though we can't prove

715
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,600
that endocannabinoid deficiency is the

716
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,679
cause

717
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,119
the fact that adding cannabinoids makes

718
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,880
it better seems to

719
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,158
suggest that that's part of the problem

720
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,120
as well

721
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,960
is there a way that we can tease apart

722
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:30,239
the difference

723
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,079
between migraines that are caused by

724
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,200
endocannabinoid deficiency

725
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,240
versus migraines that are caused solely

726
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,679
by

727
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,599
um uh you know someone's genetic makeup

728
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,679
i can imagine myself being a patient and

729
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:44,158
going well i don't know if i'm just

730
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,120
doomed

731
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,120
because of my dna or if i should try

732
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:52,959
cannabis medicine

733
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:56,798
well we can't name our parents

734
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,798
you choose them but i'm convinced at

735
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:01,679
this point that yeah you can have a

736
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,519
genetic susceptibility but

737
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,720
certainly there are things that people

738
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:10,480
can do to lower their risk

739
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,600
if not totally eliminate them

740
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,278
right so that there is hope we should

741
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,519
say that

742
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:18,720
so without us getting sidetracked and

743
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,278
going too far

744
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,079
uh down the endocannabinoid deficiency

745
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:24,000
path

746
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,079
um i would like to talk a little bit

747
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,679
about um the threshold

748
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:32,720
right so when when when patients are

749
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:36,000
explaining to me um their

750
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,319
what they're looking for relief from and

751
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,679
you know i often will ask them you know

752
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,480
what kind of lifestyle

753
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,519
that they've got and and for folks

754
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,159
they're like okay

755
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,079
i recognize that these are the array of

756
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,278
things you know poor sleep

757
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,720
and um you know environmental toxins and

758
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:54,240
pharmaceuticals and things like that

759
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,440
that can cause endocannabinoid

760
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,558
deficiency

761
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,919
but how much is enough

762
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:04,158
to cause the the host of problems that

763
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,480
come with endocannabinoid deficiency

764
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,360
like migraines fibromyalgia irritable

765
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,440
bowel syndrome

766
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,639
like clearly it's probably not one

767
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,720
night's poor

768
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,919
sleep and it's probably not two nights

769
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,038
poor sleep

770
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,440
it's probably some amount of poor

771
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:22,798
sleep and maybe some amount of

772
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,120
environmental toxins and poor nutrition

773
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,720
is there any kind of guidance that you

774
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:31,519
can offer for people

775
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:34,159
to kind of figure out if they may be

776
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:36,000
endocannabinoid deficient since there is

777
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,720
no present test

778
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,200
well unfortunately you'll find out when

779
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,159
it's too late but i would advise the

780
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,319
migraine sensitive individual not to go

781
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,480
to a wine and cheese party and stay up

782
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,639
all night

783
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,759
they're going to be much more likely to

784
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,600
have a hangover

785
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:59,119
let alone a migraine subsequently so

786
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:01,278
um but um it's good to have an awareness

787
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:05,759
of the triggers and try to avoid them

788
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:07,919
not combine them uh things of this sort

789
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,440
and then again there are so many

790
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,880
lifestyle

791
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,840
pros that people can pursue that

792
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,120
would influence their tendency and

793
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:21,519
typically when i saw a patient with

794
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,678
migraine we not only talked about drugs

795
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,440
we spent a lot of time

796
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:30,159
talking about lifestyle on i recommended

797
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,759
a low-impact aerobic activity program

798
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,960
for everyone

799
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:38,640
regular sleep habits and

800
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:42,240
these days i also throw in pitch for

801
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:46,399
prebiotics and probiotics

802
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:49,519
to try and optimize

803
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:52,278
the microbiome on this

804
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,319
probably has a great deal to do with

805
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:58,079
endocannabinoid tone

806
00:31:54,319 --> 00:32:00,319
and tendency to migraine as well as

807
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,158
irritable bowel and a bunch of other

808
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,599
conditions

809
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:09,039
you said before on this program that

810
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:12,480
um the the gut um

811
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:15,519
plays a very significant role

812
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,120
in peace of mind

813
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:22,000
perspective stress

814
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,839
and and so many other you know

815
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,038
afflictions and symptoms

816
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:28,240
based on the gut biome for folks who are

817
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,079
new to this idea

818
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,359
that they're actually you know thinking

819
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,599
with their stomach

820
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,278
would you give us a nice summary of it

821
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,199
so that for you know the people

822
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,159
can hear it who need to hear it and and

823
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,200
research that continually on their own

824
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,240
sure so um our

825
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,519
gut uh the colon in particular just

826
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,240
filled with bacteria um they're there

827
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,798
naturally they have a great deal to do

828
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,079
with

829
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:59,679
our digestion what gets absorbed

830
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:02,960
but also there is a gut brain access

831
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,960
and so a lot of these bacteria make

832
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,278
uh neurotransmitters that get

833
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,519
transported to the brain

834
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:13,200
and increasingly we have evidence that

835
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:16,558
they are related to endocannabinoid tone

836
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,278
on just on another subject

837
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:22,000
we've had this huge increase in the

838
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,880
prevalence of autoimmune conditions

839
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,319
and it certainly may relate uh to

840
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,240
exactly the same thing

841
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:32,480
the microbiome and

842
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,000
a lot of people with these conditions

843
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,440
see improvement

844
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,159
and sometimes the ability to reduce or

845
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,880
eliminate

846
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,159
medicines when they've gotten their

847
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,880
microbiome more in balance

848
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,880
so when you had patients in your office

849
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,559
and you were suggesting for them to take

850
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,159
probiotics i'm curious what you

851
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,798
recommended for them to actually

852
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,320
physically go by i mean many of us who

853
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,558
are into regenerative

854
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:03,519
cannabis cultivation we're used to

855
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:06,879
producing lactobacillus acid syndrome

856
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,519
lab and and we know that that really

857
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,159
helps our our gut in lots of ways but

858
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,239
you know

859
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,358
your your regular patient who's walking

860
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,838
into your

861
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:18,239
um doctor's office probably is not going

862
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:18,559
to be immediately prepared to go out and

863
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,838
make

864
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:23,519
lab even though they really should um

865
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,039
what kind of recommendations did you

866
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,440
make for patients to go

867
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,079
buy off the shelf that that might help

868
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,960
them

869
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,280
start out sure well just for context i

870
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,878
left

871
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,839
practice in 2003 but for some years

872
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:39,759
prior to that i was recommending a book

873
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:42,078
that i still recommend

874
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,520
called nourishing traditions by sally

875
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,879
fallon

876
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:51,199
and it emphasized emphasized a

877
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:53,918
anti-inflammatory diet

878
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:57,719
that was rich in fermented foods so this

879
00:34:53,918 --> 00:35:00,799
would be things like yogurt kefir

880
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:03,598
lacto-fermented vegetables

881
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,640
and that remains part of it but on these

882
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,480
days

883
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,078
there are also supplements that are

884
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,358
available um

885
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,960
and these can be of two different

886
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:15,519
types so the ones mainly based on

887
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,480
lactobacilli

888
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:20,719
i don't recommend single agents but it

889
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,920
should be

890
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:26,799
one that contains a variety of

891
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,599
different ones hopefully with coded

892
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,440
names that

893
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,039
indicate that they've been through

894
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,760
clinical trials

895
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:38,960
and they're also spore based bacilli

896
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,560
that seemingly make it through the gut

897
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,679
to the colon where they can

898
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:49,039
sprout and live

899
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:51,078
but additionally it includes feedstock

900
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,119
for the bacteria that are called

901
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:56,480
prebiotics

902
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:59,680
and that would be foods in the

903
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:03,760
alci so your onions leeks

904
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:07,838
garlic but additionally

905
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:11,760
fibers such as acacia fiber burdock root

906
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:15,759
marshmallow root things of this sort

907
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:19,520
but a lot of that can be gotten through

908
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,720
a good very diverse vegetable

909
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:26,000
based diet with salad greens

910
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:29,279
not iceberg lettuce but you know more

911
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,400
colored um type greens uh

912
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,040
things of this sort can really go a long

913
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,079
way to

914
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:38,159
improving the microbiome

915
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,000
so it sounds like where where we've

916
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:42,639
gotten ourselves is that

917
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,960
we we know that the migrainer you know

918
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:47,440
is experiencing migraines

919
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,880
and that there could be this you know

920
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,400
there's this this

921
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,039
rainbow variety of potential causes

922
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,079
but but when it comes down to okay we

923
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:00,159
might not be able to point at to exactly

924
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,280
the mechanism for what causes the

925
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:04,399
migraine

926
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,519
but we do know that um

927
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,720
intensity and commonality of the

928
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,440
migraine

929
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,639
is significantly decreased in most

930
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,639
patients

931
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:21,358
by getting regular and routine

932
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:24,960
sleep eating a you know vegetable rich

933
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:28,239
high probiotic diet taking

934
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,639
a probiotic supplement

935
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,159
and avoiding triggers would that be a

936
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,960
fair assessment

937
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,159
you bet all right so before we go to

938
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,599
commercial

939
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,000
after the after the commercial break

940
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:44,000
we'll start talking specifically about

941
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,880
using cannabis to help um with migraines

942
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,280
um somebody i talked to about before the

943
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,000
show

944
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,720
said you know ask dr russo if migraines

945
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,679
can cause

946
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,679
permanent damage because when they're at

947
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,519
their worst when their migraine

948
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,199
is making them feel like perhaps they'd

949
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,400
rather be dead they're

950
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:05,279
additionally afraid that that

951
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,920
they're getting permanent damage from

952
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,200
this

953
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,838
experience as well and and they wanted

954
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,199
to know if

955
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:13,679
if there was actually any threat from

956
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:16,719
that um

957
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:19,598
yeah not a tremendous amount

958
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:22,159
however this is a very significant

959
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,359
source of morbidity morbidity is a way

960
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:27,039
of saying

961
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:29,920
um a burden of illness

962
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:32,159
people with migraine often lose a lot of

963
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,200
time from work

964
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,960
and can even be labeled unreliable

965
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,719
particularly if it's a woman that might

966
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:44,079
get hit with this every cycle

967
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:47,279
and it's unwarranted but

968
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,920
there's a danger there for sure um

969
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,480
there's a tremendous need to lower the

970
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,200
frequency and severity of attacks

971
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,240
so that this isn't going to impair the

972
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,039
ability

973
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:01,279
of somebody to do their best in their

974
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:05,759
career

975
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:09,040
but beyond that

976
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,440
there are situations um where there's

977
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,440
such

978
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:16,400
a strong depression of neural function

979
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,880
in the aura um that there could be

980
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,160
associated strokes

981
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,838
um people with severe migraine may be

982
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:28,719
um more susceptible to uh

983
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:30,559
a cumulative effects that would be

984
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:33,279
deleterious later in life

985
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:34,559
but for the most part it's a really

986
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,119
severe

987
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,480
headache with associated symptoms but

988
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,160
once it's gone

989
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,880
and the person has had a chance to

990
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:46,078
recover they'll be okay

991
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,480
but during an attack yeah people

992
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,880
feel like they they're gonna die or they

993
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,920
would want to die

994
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,519
and it's serious it's really serious

995
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,240
people with chronic migraine consider

996
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,759
themselves

997
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:05,039
more ill even than chronic diabetics

998
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,640
so that there's a very strong

999
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:12,559
effect on perception

1000
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:15,118
of wellness with great implications on

1001
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,358
lifestyle

1002
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,838
so a lot of people with severe migraine

1003
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:21,279
are very avoidant of certain kinds of

1004
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,960
activities and

1005
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,160
it can really detract uh from enjoyment

1006
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,440
of life

1007
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,239
uh so it's a big deal so it's not just a

1008
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,039
headache

1009
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,559
yeah a lot more to it it reminds me a

1010
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:37,920
lot of panic attacks right

1011
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,119
until until you've had a panic attack um

1012
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,280
you know most people are

1013
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,960
like yeah you're you're stressed out and

1014
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,720
anxious i get it but but until you've

1015
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,920
had a panic attack you don't realize

1016
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,318
that it's

1017
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,358
a totally different color and flavor and

1018
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:52,079
category of

1019
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,159
its own i find that to be very similar

1020
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,920
to migraines where yeah we you know most

1021
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:57,118
people experience a headache at you know

1022
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,000
some point in their lives

1023
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,559
but migraines is is a category of its

1024
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,159
own

1025
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:07,519
with a with a you know a much larger

1026
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,838
and more impactful set of you know

1027
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,119
symptoms that we want relief from i want

1028
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:14,719
to i want to um

1029
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:17,119
so so if if the vast majority of time

1030
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,519
the migraine is not going to cause any

1031
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,400
kind of permanent damage while being

1032
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,920
like you know an epic drag you know it's

1033
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,440
not going to cause

1034
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,079
physical damage except in the rare case

1035
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,559
where

1036
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,318
the person has a stroke i know that

1037
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:33,519
there are listeners who picked up on

1038
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:34,318
that and they're going to be thinking

1039
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,039
about that

1040
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:38,400
little aspect a lot and so is there

1041
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,759
anything that can be

1042
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,720
taken um during

1043
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,599
a migraine or you know on your way up to

1044
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,799
a migraine

1045
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,920
that acts as a prophylactic to having a

1046
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,200
stroke during

1047
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,720
the migraine well not specifically

1048
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:59,039
however in cases where a patient with

1049
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:01,838
migraine who presents with weakness on

1050
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,679
one side that looks like a stroke

1051
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:06,000
my approach to that in the emergency

1052
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:09,838
room was was often

1053
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,039
intravenous magnesium sulfate magnesium

1054
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,880
has a strong

1055
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:19,519
calming influence on the brain and

1056
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,760
can abrogate stop a migraine attack

1057
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,358
including one of these complicated

1058
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,160
migraine

1059
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:28,239
situations or hemiplegic migraine

1060
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,719
hemiplegic migraine is

1061
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:31,598
a weakness on one side associated with

1062
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,799
migraine that

1063
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:37,200
simulates a stroke

1064
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,039
but again hopefully the vast majority of

1065
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:42,399
these are not going to culminate

1066
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:44,000
in permanent damage well if you were

1067
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,358
using introvenous

1068
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,159
magnesium sulfate in the hospital

1069
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:50,719
and that is not an option for most folks

1070
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,920
having

1071
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:54,399
a serious episode at home is it is it at

1072
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,880
all

1073
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,680
called for to pick up over the counter

1074
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,000
magnesium

1075
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,679
sulfate tablets and to think about

1076
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,838
taking those orally or is it just a

1077
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:08,078
different mechanism and not the same

1078
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,960
uh no uh close but no cigar in this

1079
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,599
instance

1080
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,440
magnesium sulfate taken orally doesn't

1081
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,720
get absorbed and

1082
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,119
produces diarrhea if someone wants to

1083
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:21,118
use something orally as a preventive for

1084
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,599
migraine

1085
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:27,838
it needs to be what's called a chelated

1086
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,838
magnesium that's c-h-e

1087
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:34,560
um and they're specific i hesitate to do

1088
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,679
this but there's a specific brand

1089
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:41,759
i will recommend called amino mag

1090
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:45,118
it's a amino

1091
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,359
from douglas laboratories i had

1092
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,680
tremendous success with this in my

1093
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,838
practice

1094
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:56,559
in using that as a preventive for

1095
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:58,400
migraine quite benign drug

1096
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,159
only about five percent of people get

1097
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,599
diarrhea with it

1098
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:05,118
um usually the dosing was one tablet

1099
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,240
three times a day

1100
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:11,519
which could be reduced to twice a day if

1101
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:13,679
it did produce any gut upset but most

1102
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:17,280
forms of magnesium that you'll

1103
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:19,039
find anywhere on magnesium citrate or

1104
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,280
magnesium sulfate

1105
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,279
again are going to produce diarrhea and

1106
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,359
not be helpful

1107
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,599
right on i know that you're you're

1108
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,759
always very hesitant to

1109
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,280
you know recommend brands because that's

1110
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,960
that's not how you roll but

1111
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,200
with the level of specificity we're

1112
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,318
looking to actually get people help i i

1113
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,838
appreciate you

1114
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:40,239
um offering that anyway so uh let's go

1115
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:42,239
ahead

1116
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:43,759
and take our first short break and we'll

1117
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,598
be right back you are listening to

1118
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,680
shaping fire and my guest today is

1119
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,440
neurologist and cannabis researcher

1120
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:52,799
dr ethan russo for years organic

1121
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,800
cultivators have been looking for a

1122
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,800
replacement for using peat moss

1123
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,318
peat moss has long been the go-to soil

1124
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,359
amendment for water retention and

1125
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:01,519
container growing

1126
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:03,279
but organic growers know that peat moss

1127
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,199
is an unsustainable resource

1128
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,760
and the mining of peat bogs destroys

1129
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:09,598
habitat and releases sequestered carbon

1130
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,200
but peat moss works so well that many

1131
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,119
have continued to use it

1132
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:14,960
but now there's finally a revolutionary

1133
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,920
replacement for peat moss that shares

1134
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,960
the same benefits

1135
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,599
while also being sustainable pit moss

1136
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,000
sounds an axe like peat moss but instead

1137
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,680
of being mined from fragile ecosystems

1138
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,599
it actually is made from upcycled

1139
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,679
organic paper and tree bark

1140
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,200
pit moss is excellent at retaining water

1141
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:32,000
in your substrate and creating air

1142
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:34,480
pockets and

1143
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,838
tiny living environments for microbes

1144
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,480
pit moss instantly

1145
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:40,559
increases aeration nutrient absorption

1146
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,800
and water conservation too

1147
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:44,719
carefully and locally sourced pit moss

1148
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,599
is the result of decades-long research

1149
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,318
into the use of recycled paper fibers

1150
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,559
pit moss

1151
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,318
has the fluffy nature of peat moss and

1152
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,119
handles exactly the same

1153
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:57,119
and like peat moss pit moss is inert so

1154
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,960
it won't change your ph

1155
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,119
available in a range of preparations

1156
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,079
including a nutrient enhanced blend

1157
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,720
a coco coir blend and also as an organic

1158
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,960
soil conditioner with no added nutrients

1159
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:09,838
pitt moss is also available as an animal

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,640
available

1193
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,760

product for quality

1195
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,359
and determined that there isn't a better

1196
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,480
version of the product that he could be

1197
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:31,039
selling

1221
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:21,679
as a business owner you are incredibly

1222
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,039
busy in reality you are responsible for

1223
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:24,879
everything your company does

1224
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,558
you've got so many responsibilities

1225
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,400
every single day that often you just

1226
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,880
don't have the time to really dig into

1227
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,079
your marketing as deeply as you'd like

1228
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,680
you know there's more that you could do

1229
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,359
to reach out to new customers and

1230
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,078
encourage loyalty in the customers you

1231
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:37,679
already have

1232
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,039
but you certainly don't have the time

1233
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:41,440
for it and you're not ready to hire

1234
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:44,239
somebody full time for that role either

bottom line

you know most marketing firms are

1240
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,639
excited to make your logo

1241
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,639
packaging and website very pretty but

1242
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:57,598
they leave responsibility for improving

1243
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:59,598
your bottom line

1244
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,640
up to you they don't want that kind of

1245
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,160
responsibility

1246
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:04,480
but that's pretty much the most

1247
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:06,000
important part of marketing right

storefront

1252
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,079
and keep them coming back to you and

1253
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,839
telling their friends

1254
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,839
now if you happen to be a new cannabis

finance but she totally gets cannabis

1265
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,879
at moon time medicinals.com kirsten and

1266
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:41,838
her team put together a whole brand

1267
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,200
package for them

1268
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:45,679
built their website and wrote their

1269
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,118
sales materials no doubt this is a paid

1270
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:48,558
commercial spot but that does not mean

1271
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,480
they bought my opinion

1272
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,000
i've worked with blunt branding on five

1273
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,719
projects now for various of their

1274
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,400
clients and

1275
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:55,759
every single time they have done more

1276
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,200
than they have promised and over

1277
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,280
delivered on results

1278
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:01,118
i love how they generate new revenue and

1279
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,200
focus on that as the goal instead of

1280
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,039
just making a pretty logo

1281
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:06,799
similarly every single friend i have

1282
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:07,119
referred them to has come back to thank

1283
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,280
me

1284
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,039
and that just does not happen every day

1285
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,319
grab a pen and paper because the website

1286
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:13,920

shango los and our guest this week is

1305
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,000
neurologist and cannabis researcher

1306
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,680
dr ethan russo so during the break uh

1307
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,400
ethan and i were talking about

1308
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,199
the actual brain mechanics um of the

1309
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,119
migraine

1310
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:57,519
and uh and he rethought something that

1311
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,200
he said and so so ethan why you go ahead

1312
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:00,880
and make that clarification that you

1313
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,679
wanted to make

1314
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,240
uh sure i had mentioned uh the

1315
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:09,919
importance of the substantia nigrain and

1316
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:12,959
migraine pathophysiology and then i went

1317
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,280
on to describe the periaqueductal gray

1318
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,039
it is the periaqueductal gray that's the

1319
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,160
migraine generator and the

1320
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:23,199
substantia [ __ ] probably doesn't enter

1321
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,159
into it in a big way for some reason i

1322
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:26,480
was

1323
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,480
thinking of that maybe i had parkinson's

1324
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,519
disease on my mind

1325
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,039
um but a slight correction there

1326
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,039
right on that's probably for the

1327
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:35,519
hardcore people you know following at

1328
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,639
home

1329
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,480
but you know that's one of the reasons

1330
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:39,358
why we'd love to have you here ethan is

1331
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,760
that um

1332
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,920
you know you your attention to detail is

1333
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,359
serious and we know that we can get the

1334
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,000
real deal from you so

1335
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:49,838
so we we all appreciate that correction

1336
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,400
so so during this second set we're going

1337
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:54,400
to talk

1338
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,720
um less about um the nature of migraines

1339
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,318
and

1340
00:51:54,719 --> 00:52:01,039
more about the interaction of uh

1341
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:02,679
cannabinoids and migraines and we're not

1342
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:04,639
really going to be talking as much about

1343
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:06,719
endocannabinoids anymore which are the

1344
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,639
cannabinoids that the brain makes

1345
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:09,838
itself and instead we're going to be

1346
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:12,639
talking about

1347
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,279
uh cannabinoids that are uh made outside

1348
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:15,118
of the body

1349
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,559
in the cannabis plant that we're gonna

1350
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,559
we're gonna take

1351
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,839
so you know even one of the things that

1352
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,960
always shocks people

1353
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:24,960
is when they see these uh classic

1354
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,960
historical bottles

1355
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,639
of medicine from you know the the 1800s

1356
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,800
and early 1900s

1357
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:33,920
and they say that they contain cannabis

1358
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,318
sativa and they're

1359
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,838
they're so shocked that cannabis was

1360
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:41,199
prescribed in a huge

1361
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,799
part of the pharmacopoeia until 1942

1362
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,480
would you give us a little historical

1363
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,960
basis for doctors

1364
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,920
recommending cannabis for well a range

1365
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,400
of issues but in this case migraines

1366
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,318
sure well we've got to go way back um

1367
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:58,079
i've spent decades

1368
00:52:54,318 --> 00:53:00,639
trying to assess the literature on this

1369
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,880
and the oldest reference to cannabis for

1370
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:06,078
migraine that have found

1371
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:09,280
dates back 1200 years

1372
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:11,119
to persia a physician named sabur ibn

1373
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,079
sal

1374
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,119
and it was particularly interesting

1375
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:18,400
cannabis was

1376
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:21,440
one of a variety of ingredients and

1377
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,480
it wasn't given as a pill it wasn't

1378
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,200
smoked

1379
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,199
rather the cannabis in this instance was

1380
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,838
instilled in the nose

1381
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:31,279
now this is particularly telling for a

1382
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:34,000
couple of reasons

1383
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:37,040
first of all drugs that are absorbable

1384
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,880
through the nose tend to be pretty fast

1385
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:44,239
additionally it's something you can do

1386
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,318
when someone's nauseated and vomiting

1387
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:47,358
so one of the big problems with migraine

1388
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:51,519
is getting medicine

1389
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:54,480
in at the time and the intranasal

1390
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:57,358
root obviates the need for trying to

1391
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,280
give medicine by mouth

1392
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:00,480
so we can't say anything about how

1393
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,599
effective it was

1394
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:06,639
but this guy was quite influential

1395
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:11,119
at the time subsequently

1396
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:14,639
in the region there uh were

1397
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:15,838
cannabis was very influential in islamic

1398
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:19,118
medicine

1399
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:22,318
uh and then obviously nearby in

1400
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:26,000
india uh so all of these cultures

1401
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:27,440
uh noted an association of cannabis for

1402
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:33,119
migraine

1403
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:36,240
then we fast forward to 1839

1404
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,280
and william b o'shaughnessy is an irish

1405
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,358
physician

1406
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,798
who in the service of the british crown

1407
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:44,639
went to india

1408
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:48,318
to calcutta currently colcott um

1409
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:50,879
and he was a real genuine scientist of

1410
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:54,480
first caliber

1411
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:57,280
he um studied

1412
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,838
what the ayurvedic physicians were doing

1413
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,640
uh

1414
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:01,279
and noted uh the use of of cannabis

1415
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:03,759
which was

1416
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,559
different uh to the cannabis that they

1417
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,680
had in europe

1418
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:11,119
which we'd think of as hemp

1419
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:13,598
low-level cbd and but this was

1420
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:16,798
high-powered thc predominant

1421
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:18,559
cannabis um

1422
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:21,199
so he took what he learned from the

1423
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:23,839
ayurvedic physicians he did experiments

1424
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:28,159
on animals and then gave it to people

1425
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:29,358
for a variety of conditions about 1842

1426
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:33,440
he took a trip

1427
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:36,400
back to england and lectured on this

1428
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,599
and was highly influential in the rapid

1429
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,960
spread

1430
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:44,079
of cannabis based medicine to

1431
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,798
uh the british empire to the european

1432
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,000
continent

1433
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:53,119
and to north america so the next

1434
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,920
year in 1843 a guy named clendening

1435
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,519
started using cannabis to treat migraine

1436
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,079
in a series of patients with

1437
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:01,358
excellent results and things just took

1438
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,519
off from there

1439
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,519
if we examine the 19th century

1440
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:08,719
literature there were dozens

1441
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:09,920
of articles about use of cannabis and

1442
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:13,279
migraine

1443
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:16,559
and it was extremely interesting because

1444
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,839
they didn't have mri scans or cat scans

1445
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,880
or eegs

1446
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:23,759
or any of this technology

1447
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,119
but these physicians were excellent

1448
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,960
observers

1449
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:32,559
and they needed two things we generally

1450
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:35,039
have a discrepancy between the kinds of

1451
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,599
drugs we use to treat migraine

1452
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:39,759
there are two treatment approaches there

1453
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:42,318
are symptomatic treatments

1454
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,319
that you take at the time and there are

1455
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:47,679
preventive treatments

1456
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:49,599
prophylactic treatments often these are

1457
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:51,919
different drugs but in the case of

1458
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:54,880
cannabis it was noted that

1459
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,838
it worked in both contexts so it could

1460
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:00,400
be used at the time to treat

1461
00:56:56,838 --> 00:57:02,318
a migraine attack and certainly as a

1462
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:06,160
preventive

1463
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:10,159
and some of the fathers of neurology

1464
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:12,159
were very prominent in recommending

1465
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:13,279
atmosphere migraine and these were

1466
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:16,399
giants real

1467
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,798
intellects and their observations have

1468
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,000
been

1469
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:23,838
very much born uh out to be

1470
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,798
true over time uh so this really was a

1471
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:30,318
situation for about a century

1472
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:33,358
that migraine was

1473
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:37,358
one of the best treatments for migraine

1474
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:39,679
was cannabis between 1840 and 1940

1475
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:41,279
even the father of modern medicine sir

1476
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:44,639
william osler

1477
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,880
said exactly that that cannabis was the

1478
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,679
best treatment

1479
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,720
then prohibition came into play and for

1480
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:55,358
decades we were in the dark about this

1481
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,558
until things really begin to pick up

1482
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:59,920
again

1483
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:01,839
in the 80s and 90s

1484
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,599
so i want to go back to two things that

1485
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:04,078
you said all the way back let's start

1486
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,280
with

1487
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:09,519
um uh taking cannabis

1488
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,440
through the nose because i thought i had

1489
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:14,000
heard it all and i had not heard

1490
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,760
of using taking cannabis nasally what

1491
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,159
was the preparation like

1492
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,720
that could be taken through the nose

1493
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:22,239
well i wish i could tell you exactly but

1494
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:24,399
as best i could figure is

1495
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:26,078
probably raw cannabis and it was

1496
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,760
probably thca

1497
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:33,119
rather than thc uh normally

1498
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:35,520
we'd have to say that's interesting but

1499
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,240
thca doesn't pass the blood-brain

1500
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:39,519
barrier

1501
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:41,358
however in migraine it is

1502
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:43,358
well known that there's a breakdown of

1503
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:44,558
the blood-brain barrier and it may be a

1504
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:47,759
situation

1505
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:50,720
where that is able to get in uh

1506
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,400
so it probably was some kind of aqueous

1507
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:57,199
solution

1508
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:59,200
of cannabis herb and

1509
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:01,118
you know to complicate things and to be

1510
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:04,239
fair um

1511
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:05,200
this was part of multiple herb

1512
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:08,318
combination

1513
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:11,199
and so its relative role would be an

1514
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:14,239
extremely difficult thing to assess

1515
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:16,838
but again in the middle east um

1516
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:18,159
subsequently it's quite clear that

1517
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:20,558
hashish

1518
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:22,719
in particular was used to treat

1519
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:25,839
headaches

1520
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:27,919
that's interesting so so for for

1521
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:30,000
you know everybody who's listening who

1522
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,880
works with patients and is trying to

1523
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,280
create medicine the idea of something

1524
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,559
being

1525
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,519
delivered nasally is exciting because

1526
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,319
you know we've

1527
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:41,440
you know we know you know smoking and

1528
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:43,759
oral capsules and

1529
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,639
tinctures and rectally and you know

1530
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,160
everything that we've

1531
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:49,118
done to help patients that have got

1532
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:52,078
different issues but the nose is new

1533
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,119
so you know i wouldn't really recommend

1534
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,880
it though currently

1535
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,240
all right that's what i'm looking for is

1536
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,519
is this a path that we need should

1537
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:00,479
consider

1538
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:02,000
yeah i don't think so again a little

1539
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,599
complicated but usually we're going to

1540
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,119
be talking about high potency

1541
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:08,160
preparations

1542
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:10,480
as people know very well

1543
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:11,199
this either has to be an alcohol or in

1544
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,358
an oil

1545
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:15,199
and you don't want that stuff in your

1546
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:18,798
nose

1547
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:22,000
really could cause damage um

1548
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:22,960
so i really bite the historical

1549
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,679
precedent

1550
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:29,760
with a very different preparation this

1551
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:32,239
is not something i'd recommend all right

1552
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,079
shoving hatch up our nose is not what's

1553
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:37,598
called for

1554
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,079
no i i think the closest uh corollary to

1555
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,760
this

1556
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:44,079
would be um something that is

1557
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:47,920
administered sublingually or

1558
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:50,960
mucosally in other words uh tear or

1559
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,159
oil base that's held in the mouth uh

1560
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,519
trying to get some

1561
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:58,399
uh absorption through the the

1562
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:59,679
um mucous membranes there and then it

1563
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,880
could be swallowed

1564
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:03,118
there's always going to be some

1565
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,400
combination of absorption

1566
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:08,880
locally and then through the gut um

1567
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,680
but i i really would stay away from the

1568
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,640
nose

1569
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:14,719
all right and and while we are uh asking

1570
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:17,118
uh fun questions you know in these

1571
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:18,159
these old bottles of cannabis sativa

1572
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,559
that we've seen

1573
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:22,239
you know traveling in the cannabis

1574
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,079
museum and such

1575
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:26,000
um you know it's really interesting to

1576
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,720
look at the ingredients because the main

1577
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,599
ingredient

1578
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:30,159
is often cannabis sativa but then they

1579
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,200
often

1580
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:35,279
also have cocaine and morphine in them

1581
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:36,239
um and you know it's it's great for a

1582
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,880
laugh but

1583
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:40,959
um you know for a moment of actuality is

1584
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,760
there a reason that you're aware of why

1585
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,960
they would put together cannabis cocaine

1586
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,799
and morphine together

1587
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,240
is there while they're you know

1588
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:50,880
certainly abusable

1589
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:52,479
drugs the cocaine and the morphine is

1590
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,039
there is there some interplay between

1591
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,440
the three that makes them very effective

1592
01:01:55,039 --> 01:02:00,480
well it sure could be um normally we

1593
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:03,679
don't recommend opioids for migraine

1594
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:06,079
um but it is true that

1595
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:08,318
there were a lot of these combination

1596
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,200
drugs there's one i i like to show in

1597
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:12,558
lectures

1598
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:16,480
uh the combined cannabis uh with

1599
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:20,000
morphine um and uh extract of

1600
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:23,199
of capsicum meaning capsaicin

1601
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:27,838
hot stuff and chili peppers and these

1602
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:31,439
are three vegetable origin items that

1603
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:33,279
play on the endogenous pain systems in

1604
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,159
our body

1605
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:38,079
so it points out why plants are medicine

1606
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:40,639
for humans

1607
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,839
you know these are natural substances

1608
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:45,440
from

1609
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:49,038
plants that happen to be closely

1610
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,960
aligned and similar to and endogenous

1611
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:54,000
chemicals in her bodies

1612
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,400
um so it's a fascinating phenomenon and

1613
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,480
one i always like to throw in the face

1614
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,798
of skeptics who think that

1615
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:05,199
drugs can only be synthetic in capsules

1616
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:06,239
good well we are big on the whole plant

1617
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:09,199
medicine here

1618
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:11,118
so uh that that opinion is popular here

1619
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:14,000
so let's let's circle back around now

1620
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,880
to you um you had started down the path

1621
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,760
of

1622
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,720
of teasing out the differences between

1623
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,359
symptomatic

1624
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:22,719
treatment meaning you know treatment for

1625
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:24,159
the things that are happening in your

1626
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,719
body that you want relief

1627
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:29,118
from and then also secondarily

1628
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,639
prophylactic meaning you're less likely

1629
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:33,680
to get a

1630
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:35,159
migraine in the future now the symptoms

1631
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:37,440
that we've talked about so far

1632
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:39,920
photosensitivity sound sensitivity

1633
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:43,119
nausea body discomfort cloudy thinking

1634
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:47,838
things like this i'm curious if

1635
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:51,519
if these um all are looking at the same

1636
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:54,639
uh modes of use for cannabis

1637
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:55,038
for for their for their relief so are

1638
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:57,118
you

1639
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,480
suggesting you know like for example

1640
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:01,760
when we did the

1641
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,199
parkinson show um you know we spoke a

1642
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:06,880
lot about using

1643
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:10,879
uh full extract ethanol um

1644
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:13,200
oil and also tinctures because they

1645
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:15,280
they built up the cannabinoids in the

1646
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:18,239
system they lasted longer

1647
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,440
and you don't often get the attributed

1648
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:20,959
high

1649
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,880
that you get from smoking so for

1650
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,880
parkinson's patients tinctures are

1651
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:28,160
fantastic

1652
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,119
now for migraine folks um is there a

1653
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:32,239
particular

1654
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:35,838
method that is most called for i mean

1655
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:37,759
the old literature often refers to

1656
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:39,358
smoking of cannabis but that doesn't

1657
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,640
necessarily mean it was the best it just

1658
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:41,519
means that that's what's in the old

1659
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:44,798
literature

1660
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:47,519
sure uh well where

1661
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:50,000
speed is necessary uh there's no doubt

1662
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:51,358
that inhalation is going to be the most

1663
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,480
expedient method

1664
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:56,798
but i would amend that to say that it

1665
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,400
should be by vaporization rather than

1666
01:04:56,798 --> 01:05:02,480
smoking for all the

1667
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:05,920
uh obvious reasons uh so where speed is

1668
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:08,318
of the essence if someone has an aura um

1669
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,440
and you know they're really in a

1670
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:12,400
situation where they

1671
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,679
can't have a crash and burn migraine

1672
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,720
that's going to take them out of the

1673
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:18,358
action

1674
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:21,679
for the rest of the day then

1675
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:23,440
vaporization um is really going to be

1676
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:27,118
the quickest although

1677
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:30,880
um a tincture in the mouth

1678
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:34,318
uh may really do the trick as well

1679
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:36,079
um you know i believe we've talked about

1680
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:40,239
before a suppository

1681
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:43,599
and i'm really skeptical about them um

1682
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:46,479
how applicable they really are

1683
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:47,920
but you know again we make a distinction

1684
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,960
if someone is having

1685
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:53,358
regular severe migraines it really is a

1686
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:56,400
context in which

1687
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:58,880
prophylaxis prevention uh should be at

1688
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,358
the top of the agenda

1689
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,440
yeah usually we're recommending um

1690
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:05,440
suppositories for somebody who's got you

1691
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,559
know a gut issue or they can't keep

1692
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,159
stuff down

1693
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:11,680
and um so so perhaps the the only people

1694
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:12,960
who would be having a hard time keeping

1695
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:14,960
the tincture down are folks with

1696
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,639
migraines with the associated nausea

1697
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,639
because you know i can imagine

1698
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,759
that they may not want to put you know

1699
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:21,920
um high proof

1700
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,119
ethanol into their gut it may and may

1701
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,400
trigger a whole you know

1702
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:28,798
second wave of of of issues you know

1703
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,559
back in you know in the old school days

1704
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:34,079
you know we know that they were

1705
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:35,119
using cannabis that had thc but we don't

1706
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,480
know

1707
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:41,838
um what other cannabinoids may have been

1708
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,880
present and so um what are you know and

1709
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:45,759
these studies don't

1710
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:47,039
you know we don't have a lot of research

1711
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,799
on this and so

1712
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:52,839
whereas our earlier example was thca

1713
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:55,038
so cannabis that has not been

1714
01:06:52,838 --> 01:06:56,400
decarboxylated yet and so it's still in

1715
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,200
its acid form

1716
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,760
but now we're talking about vaporization

1717
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,038
or

1718
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,960
or you know inhalation from

1719
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:07,119
you know combustion or something we're

1720
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:10,159
talking about thc

1721
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:11,440
the non-acid form the converted form at

1722
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:14,639
that point

1723
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,079
um and and we also know nowadays because

1724
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:19,358
we've got the analytics

1725
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:22,480
that when you are you know using a

1726
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:26,000
melange of cannabinoids thc

1727
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:28,559
cbg cbd maybe cbn and maybe even

1728
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,599
some of the acids mixed together that

1729
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,720
when you've got this

1730
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:35,760
this wider range of entourage effect

1731
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:37,919
all of these cannabinoids work together

1732
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,920
you know in a way that's more powerful

1733
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,559
than any one of them

1734
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,400
on their own so so this platform is all

1735
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:47,680
to ask you the question

1736
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,160
do we know which cannabinoids we both we

1737
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:51,919
best

1738
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:53,759
want to target at this point i wish i

1739
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:57,519
had a definitive answer

1740
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,160
we know that thc works quite effectively

1741
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:01,358
and again

1742
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:05,279
historically that is what people

1743
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:08,000
used i think

1744
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,039
cbd on its own probably is not going to

1745
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
be adequate

1746
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:13,039
on that's what we hear from people the

1747
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,798
combination is

1748
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:19,279
always good if nothing else

1749
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:20,079
we can point to the ability of cbd to

1750
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:23,920
allay

1751
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:26,318
thc associated side effects

1752
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,000
and i do think in the long term that cbd

1753
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,440
is probably helpful

1754
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,319
in preventive regimens um as to the

1755
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:35,039
others

1756
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:36,719
um i think what you said is very true

1757
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:41,039
that

1758
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:44,000
the um having a more complete

1759
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:45,519
profile on entourage of substances is

1760
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,158
likely

1761
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:51,600
helpful in this situation but we don't

1762
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:55,599
have a lot of evidence at this point

1763
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:57,520
to say that that's definitively the case

1764
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,039
so let's let's dig a little bit more

1765
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:02,799
into uh method

1766
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:05,519
as well so um you said vaporization

1767
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:06,000
is uh preferred for the obvious reasons

1768
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,199
and and

1769
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,279
for the folks who are new to this um i'm

1770
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:13,198
will guess that you are talking because

1771
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:16,319
a inhalation

1772
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:18,798
of hot uh smoke is not the best for the

1773
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:21,920
lungs and irritates the cilia

1774
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:22,479
and and vaporization is generally going

1775
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,920
to

1776
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:28,238
release the cannabinoid compounds in

1777
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,520
the cannabis in a way that's not

1778
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:31,278
scalding

1779
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,640
to the lungs is is that the point you

1780
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,839
were making

1781
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:39,838
sure okay so so so if that's

1782
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:43,119
if that's true um would you recommend

1783
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:46,479
more vaporization

1784
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:50,000
from an extracted oil in a vape pen

1785
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:52,000
or directly from the flower because

1786
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,238
you know as far as medicine goes they

1787
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,520
are subtly different substances

1788
01:09:54,238 --> 01:10:00,559
sure uh yeah i really prefer

1789
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:01,360
flour in this instance most vape pens

1790
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,080
are

1791
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:05,198
going to be solvent derived usually at

1792
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:08,719
the expense of

1793
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:11,919
a full terpenoid profile so we've got

1794
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:15,039
high thc preparations usually pretty

1795
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:19,359
devoid of anything else

1796
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:22,479
so um and again um

1797
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:24,319
the idea and this kind of treatment is

1798
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:27,359
not to render the person

1799
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:30,639
extra galactic uh in other words

1800
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:33,759
low doses are probably adequate

1801
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:35,679
in this instance vaporization

1802
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,960
should be to the point of symptom

1803
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:40,719
reduction

1804
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:42,840
so if the pain is less if the nausea is

1805
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:45,679
less

1806
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:48,960
um clearly that's a signal

1807
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:52,079
that uh hopefully that's enough

1808
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,640
and then again just coupling that with

1809
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:56,880
the usual behaviors of

1810
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,400
hiding away in a dark quiet place and

1811
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,079
trying to get to sleep

1812
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:02,879
hopefully things are going to be a lot

1813
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:05,039
better on the other side

1814
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,560
so good i like i like that clarification

1815
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:09,519
you made because essentially

1816
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:12,320
we're not talking about oh getting high

1817
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:15,440
from cannabis will help your migraines

1818
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:17,920
it's actually the hey introducing

1819
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:19,039
cannabinoids through vaporization in

1820
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,600
small doses

1821
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,960
can help and then if you keep smoking

1822
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,120
you're likely to get high

1823
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,719
so really what we're talking about is

1824
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:30,238
micro dosing

1825
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:33,600
vaped flower uh ideally

1826
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:36,319
but again um compared to the crash and

1827
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,000
burn experience of a full-blown migraine

1828
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:41,519
i'm not saying that

1829
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:45,039
that getting high is a problem

1830
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:47,840
um but as in any condition

1831
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:48,880
the lowest dose that takes care of the

1832
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,279
symptoms

1833
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,039
is probably appropriate and it's not

1834
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:55,840
usually necessary

1835
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:57,279
uh to go beyond that yeah that's a good

1836
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,480
that's a good clarification because you

1837
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:01,920
know certainly

1838
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:04,639
um you know if if the goal is to

1839
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,920
uh you know i guess dissociate and go

1840
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,159
into a dark place

1841
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,760
and kind of hold your brain together

1842
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:11,920
until it passes

1843
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,079
there's a lot of patients who enjoy

1844
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:17,199
taking a large doses

1845
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,920
a large dose of cannabis so that they

1846
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:20,879
can more

1847
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,079
fully check out and you know while while

1848
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,560
the dose that they may have

1849
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:26,800
needed to you know get started with

1850
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,840
addressing their symptoms maybe a small

1851
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,119
amount

1852
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,000
the amount that they need to get to the

1853
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:34,800
point

1854
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,039
that it's working may actually be more

1855
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,480
and so uh you know this is this is part

1856
01:12:37,039 --> 01:12:40,640
of the beauty of cannabis and

1857
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:43,198
individualized medicine you know the

1858
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:45,039
the episode today is to get people

1859
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:47,759
thinking about how to do this

1860
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:49,519
but really the determination of how much

1861
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,000
and in what way to use it

1862
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:54,560
is really going to be up to the patient

1863
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,198
who should start with low dosages

1864
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,840
and and a familiar way to take it and

1865
01:12:57,198 --> 01:12:59,919
then

1866
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,760
and then you know explore from that

1867
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:05,039
point

1868
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:07,600
sure so oh go ahead

1869
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:09,600
well i was just going to say that again

1870
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,120
to deal with the other aspect of

1871
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,079
treatment the the

1872
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:16,800
preventive treatment it is always going

1873
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:17,279
to be preferable in that instance to go

1874
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,840
for an

1875
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:22,319
oral route of administration so if

1876
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,800
someone has migraines that are frequent

1877
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:25,920
and

1878
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:29,199
severe enough to warrant daily

1879
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:31,119
um preventive medication

1880
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:32,238
that should be taken in a forum that's

1881
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:35,198
going to produce the

1882
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:35,839
least likelihood of side effects and so

1883
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:39,519
this would be

1884
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:42,560
low doses of an agent that would

1885
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:45,600
say be taken twice a day

1886
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:49,679
as a preventive and hopefully with

1887
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,960
no uh great risk of intoxication that's

1888
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:54,239
going to interfere

1889
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:57,520
with the ability to function optimally

1890
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:59,039
so with taking a modern oral cannabis

1891
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,040
preparation you know we

1892
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,399
we can get a lot more specific than we

1893
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:04,560
just did with the

1894
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:06,960
you know in the moment you need relief

1895
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:10,000
right now so that you're gonna have a

1896
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,840
puff of a vaporizer or a

1897
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,198
uh you know or a jointer so you're gonna

1898
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,920
puff something because it

1899
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:18,319
immediately gets into the blood whereas

1900
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:21,600
as the prophylactic you're going to take

1901
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:24,319
a tincture or similar so that you know

1902
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,000
it's just present in your blood so that

1903
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:28,000
you don't get it to begin with

1904
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,079
that's the kind of product that's a lot

1905
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,399
easier to know what your dosage is

1906
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:33,840
versus smoking where it's or vaporizing

1907
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:34,559
where it's very difficult to know the

1908
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,679
dosage

1909
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:38,480
so with that in mind um what dosage

1910
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:41,679
would you

1911
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:44,959
recommend twice a day

1912
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:48,000
as prophylactic care for a migraine

1913
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,239
sure so i begin very slowly

1914
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,439
um what i always say in this kind of

1915
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:54,079
situation is

1916
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:55,198
look you have a chronic condition we

1917
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:58,238
want you to get

1918
01:14:55,198 --> 01:15:01,439
better but we should do so slowly this

1919
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:04,238
is a premium on avoiding

1920
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:06,559
side effects a premium on getting this

1921
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:08,879
to work in a way that isn't going to

1922
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:13,360
create problems of its own

1923
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:14,640
i would start very low 2.5 milligrams of

1924
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:17,679
thc or even

1925
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:20,239
less something that

1926
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:22,480
hopefully isn't going to produce any

1927
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:25,759
level of intoxication

1928
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:27,919
um and then proceed upwards um

1929
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,079
you know again we want to use the least

1930
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,199
amount on a regular basis that's going

1931
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:33,359
to reduce

1932
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:34,879
the frequency and severity of migraine

1933
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:38,000
attacks

1934
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:43,279
so to start it might be 2.5 milligrams

1935
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,279
of thc equivalent twice a day

1936
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:50,238
less even if someone's really sensitive

1937
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:51,599
and then i'd proceed upwards only as

1938
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:53,919
needed

1939
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,360
for some people that small amount may be

1940
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:59,600
sufficient

1941
01:15:55,359 --> 01:16:02,880
for some it'll be five twice a day

1942
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:06,000
once it's generally speaking i

1943
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:10,079
like to avoid going higher

1944
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,079
in preventive situations

1945
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:17,920
trying to see if uh limbing

1946
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:20,879
limiting it to 15 milligrams of thc

1947
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:23,520
equivalent a day

1948
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,560
exceptionally it could be 30 milligrams

1949
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,040
but beyond

1950
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:29,120
that there's a high likelihood that

1951
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:30,000
additional medicine isn't really going

1952
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:32,719
to

1953
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,158
uh be a lot more effective and certainly

1954
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:36,319
will add to

1955
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:38,000
the likelihood of getting associated

1956
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:40,719
side effects

1957
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,158
and you know as as one of the you know

1958
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:44,640
the forefathers of

1959
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:46,559
the entourage effect it's probably

1960
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,239
important to point out that

1961
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,560
um you know we're not really talking

1962
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:53,678
about 2.5 milligrams

1963
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:56,560
of thc isolate if it can be

1964
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:57,119
avoided what what you're referring to is

1965
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,039
is

1966
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:01,439
thc in the presence of the the rest of

1967
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:03,198
the

1968
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:05,439
you know minor cannabinoids and

1969
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:09,279
flavonoids and and all the other

1970
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:11,519
um you know components of the resin

1971
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:13,039
because while we do not understand the

1972
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:16,560
full science yet

1973
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:19,439
um the resin you know complete

1974
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,480
and not reduced to just thc isolate

1975
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:23,359
seems to work

1976
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:24,238
best with the body correct that is my

1977
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:27,439
contention

1978
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:29,119
right on so um so

1979
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:30,799
let's talk a little bit about on the

1980
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:34,000
prophylactic side you know

1981
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:36,320
we understand that when we inhale the

1982
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,238
uh when we inhale cannabis to deal with

1983
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:39,039
our symptoms that happens pretty darn

1984
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:40,959
fast

1985
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:42,479
um when we are talking a pro

1986
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:45,439
prophylactic the

1987
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:46,879
the you know the decrease the likelihood

1988
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:49,198
of a migraine

1989
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,159
you know going all the way back to osler

1990
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:53,439
who you re

1991
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:55,920
mentioned earlier in 1915 says to expect

1992
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:56,719
the treatment to be long-term this isn't

1993
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,039
a fast

1994
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:00,800
thing can you set some kind of

1995
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:04,158
expectation that if a

1996
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:07,440
if a migraine or was to add

1997
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:08,000
you know 2.5 to 5 milligrams of whole

1998
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:10,839
plant

1999
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,679
tincture to their daily regimen twice a

2000
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:17,119
day what kind of results

2001
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:18,319
might they see over time well i'm glad

2002
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:21,439
you asked

2003
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:25,279
so if we're talking about

2004
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:29,119
medicines for migraine in general

2005
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:32,399
i i would use the excuse me the 70

2006
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:35,279
rule that a lot of things are going to

2007
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:37,679
work in 70 percent of patients

2008
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:39,439
and it may be that the first two or

2009
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,239
three things don't work and the fourth

2010
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:43,919
will

2011
01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:47,279
however once you start getting into

2012
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:48,640
multiple attempts the likelihood is that

2013
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:50,960
you're always still going to have a

2014
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:53,520
hardcore 30 percent of patients that

2015
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:56,560
don't respond

2016
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:58,960
i would take that 30 of resistant

2017
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:01,440
patients and say that

2018
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,119
cannabis um use the way we've been

2019
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:06,559
discussing is going to work in

2020
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:09,679
70 to 80 percent of them um

2021
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:11,920
so i think it is uh

2022
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:12,880
quite likely more effective than

2023
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,079
conventional

2024
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:18,000
medicines uh in the situation and

2025
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:20,000
and seems to work where other things

2026
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
don't um

2027
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,760
so i think there's a very high

2028
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,600
likelihood but again

2029
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:29,280
i in this context i didn't like to do

2030
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:32,320
things in isolation

2031
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:34,479
uh every patient was reminded of the

2032
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:35,679
lifestyle factors that we discussed

2033
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:37,599
earlier

2034
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:38,800
and i think they should all be done at

2035
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,600
once

2036
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:43,920
uh if someone's a lot better down the

2037
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:47,039
road and wants to taper off

2038
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:49,119
of the preventive cannabis that's great

2039
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:50,560
and that would be a goal of treatment

2040
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:53,679
but um

2041
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:55,679
i'd never say start with cannabis

2042
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:58,399
without pursuing the lifestyle

2043
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:01,199
adjustments

2044
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:02,399
okay so if someone um let's say that

2045
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:05,519
someone does start

2046
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:07,279
with cannabis tincture though do you

2047
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,679
think that if they're taking it

2048
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:10,960
um you know twice a day as we've already

2049
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:13,359
discussed that

2050
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:14,399
they may start experiencing a reduction

2051
01:20:13,359 --> 01:20:16,319
in migraines

2052
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:18,638
after the first week or is that too fast

2053
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:22,079
to expect it um

2054
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:25,199
no it could well be um the

2055
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:29,119
beauty of this is people find out

2056
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,119
whether they're successful or not

2057
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:37,039
but you know again it's a tough thing to

2058
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,039
to try to judge uh you know

2059
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:41,119
am i taking the right dose you won't

2060
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:44,560
know until or unless

2061
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:47,840
the next attack occurs but um

2062
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:49,039
again i would resist the urge to elevate

2063
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,880
the dose

2064
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:56,719
uh before a person has to um

2065
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:59,679
but in in the olden days um again

2066
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:02,079
people were sent out with similar kinds

2067
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:04,719
of instructions on titrating the dose

2068
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:08,960
upwards as needed

2069
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:12,560
but ideally it's great to check in

2070
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:14,239
every week or two to see if a dosage

2071
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,120
adjustment is necessary

2072
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:18,559
but many patients figure this out on

2073
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:20,559
their own

2074
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,679
this is probably a good place for us to

2075
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:24,800
uh plug

2076
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:27,039
your the the shaping fire sessions

2077
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,079
series that we did with you that's on

2078
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:31,679
the shaping

2079
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:34,559
fire youtube channel one of the uh

2080
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,679
topics that we discussed was keeping a

2081
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,080
patient journal

2082
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:39,679
when interacting and trying cannabis uh

2083
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:42,639
for the first time because

2084
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:43,039
you know when you're self-titrating

2085
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:45,600
you're

2086
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:46,639
you're often changing your dosage and

2087
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,400
you're set and

2088
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:50,800
setting meaning you know the mood you're

2089
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:53,839
in and where you are and who you're with

2090
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:55,920
and um and and then of course you're

2091
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:59,279
going to get different

2092
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,840
physiological benefits based on those

2093
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:02,880
two

2094
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:05,920
and so you've recommended it in the past

2095
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,119
that folks write this down because over

2096
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,199
the course of even just

2097
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:10,719
two weeks if you're taking it twice a

2098
01:22:09,198 --> 01:22:13,119
day and you are

2099
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:16,800
having some variability to your dosing

2100
01:22:13,119 --> 01:22:20,079
it's so easy to forget

2101
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:22,480
right yeah so um

2102
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:23,119
so i think the last thing i want to get

2103
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:26,158
on the

2104
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:28,319
on the prophylactic aspect is

2105
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:29,198
you know some people are they'll start

2106
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:31,920
cannabis

2107
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:32,559
and then they'll have a migraine and

2108
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,399
they'll go

2109
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,960
you know they'll be like damn it didn't

2110
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:39,279
work and then they'll stop

2111
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,520
and and i and i'm i'm always quick to

2112
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:44,000
remind people that

2113
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,280
um you know nowhere in the literature

2114
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,960
does it necessarily

2115
01:22:45,279 --> 01:22:49,840
say that you're going to go from

2116
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:52,480
migraines to zero migraines

2117
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,440
after you know a week or two of cannabis

2118
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:56,959
usage

2119
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:58,158
that you know people are heralding huge

2120
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,039
success

2121
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:02,158
with the reduction of the number of

2122
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:04,079
migraines

2123
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:06,000
so can you can you speak to the

2124
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:08,719
importance of not seeing

2125
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:12,000
the solution as being like a hundred

2126
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:15,439
percent or zero black or white

2127
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:18,719
uh yeah absolutely um you know the

2128
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:22,559
better is defined as fewer

2129
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:25,840
and less severe attacks

2130
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:27,440
everyone would desire the holy grail of

2131
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:30,719
total absence

2132
01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:33,839
of attacks and that certainly

2133
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,480
happens with cannabis cannabis-based

2134
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,840
treatment

2135
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:39,839
but um it's not a reasonable

2136
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,880
thing to expect straight out of the

2137
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:44,960
shoot

2138
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:48,079
we all hope that that will be the uh

2139
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:50,000
the history that eventuates but i can't

2140
01:23:48,079 --> 01:23:54,079
promise that

2141
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:56,560
so yeah we want there to be fewer

2142
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:57,600
less severe attacks that's a goal of

2143
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,719
treatment

2144
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,360
that's fantastic all right so when we

2145
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:04,560
come back

2146
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:07,920
we are going to talk about um uh

2147
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:10,960
blending uh cannabis use

2148
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:13,279
with psilocybin mushroom use

2149
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,079
towards this end of reducing the

2150
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:16,399
intensity

2151
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:17,760
and regularity of your migraine so stick

2152
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:19,679
with us

2153
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,440
you are listening to shaping fire and my

2154
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:25,840
guest today is neurologist

2155
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:27,678
and cannabis researcher dr ethan russo

2156
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,279
for many transitioning to organic

2157
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,880
gardening can be overwhelming

2158
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:32,960
there's so much to learn about soil

2159
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:35,039
biology and fermentation

2160
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:36,000
bioflux fermented plant boost from

2161
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:38,000
everflux

2162

simplifies organic farming so you can

2163
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,079
start growing organically today

2164
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,759
invented by a california farmer growing

2165
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:46,079
organic for 40 years

2166
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,880
bioflux is a fermented natural farming

2167

for those who want a natural micro

2169
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:53,439
booster without having to brew their own

2170
01:24:51,198 --> 01:24:54,879
this extraordinary chemical free growth

2171
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:57,119
and terpene enhancer

2172
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,960
improves root development accelerates

2173
01:24:57,119 --> 01:24:59,760
the conversion of organic matter into

2174
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,840
hummus

2175
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,360
increases nutrient use efficiency and

2176
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:06,079
uptake and increases

2177
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:08,479
beneficial microbe activity in addition

2178
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:11,119
to the bioflux fermented plant booster

2179
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:12,319
everflux also makes an activated biochar

2180
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:14,559
called terraflux

2181
01:25:12,319 --> 01:25:15,519
that is infused with the bioflex plant

2182
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,440
booster

2183
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,120
imagine combining the buffering and

2184

kelp and crabmeal oyster shell and other

2189
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,279
ingredients

2190
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:31,679
i'm using teraflux infused biochar this

2191
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:34,479
summer myself and it smells alive

2192
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:36,239
rich and potent these products have been

2193
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:37,839
scientifically proven to match yields

2194
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:40,000
and increase flower quality and pest

2195
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,800
resistance when compared to traditional

2196
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,880
npk inputs if you are looking for

2197
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,880
reliable organic fertilizers that will

2198
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,760
free you up to focus on other aspects of

2199
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,760
your garden

2200
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:51,600
consider using the range of all natural

2201
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:54,400
regenerative fertilizers and natural

2202
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,800
biostimulants from everflux find out

2203
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:57,839
more

2204
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:59,199
at everfluxtechnologies.com or by

2205
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:02,639
following their instagram

2206
01:25:59,198 --> 01:26:04,799
at everflux one of the reasons why

2207
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:07,039
no-till cannabis growing is so valued by

2208
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,000
farmers is because the mycelium networks

2209
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:10,560
in the soil remain

2210
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,719
established from year to year and we

2211
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,400
know these fungal networks are essential

2212
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,399
because they are the nutrient super

2213
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:18,479
highways that extend far and wide in the

2214
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:20,879
substrate to feed your plants

2215
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:22,479
the trouble with growing in new soils or

2216
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,239
blended cocoa substrates

2217
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:26,319
is that it takes most of the plant's

2218
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:27,599
life just to create these mycelium

2219
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:30,639
highways

2220
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,960
dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

2221
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:36,000
reduces that time and gets your plant

2222
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:38,158
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

2223
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,238
and it's three times the concentration

2224
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:43,359
of the current leading brand in the us

2225
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:45,279
at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal

2226
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:47,119
species selected specifically for

2227
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:49,519
cannabis cultivation

2228
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:51,279
this new product called dinomyco is the

2229
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,199
result of 30 years of research and

2230
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:55,119
trials at the volcani agriculture

2231
01:26:53,198 --> 01:26:57,279
research institute in israel

2232
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:58,800
it has also been vigorously trialled by

2233
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:00,639
cannabis and food growers

2234
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,400
across the us since the product first

2235
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:03,920
arrived here last year

2236
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:05,920
you may have already even heard about

2237
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:09,279
dynamico by its original name

2238
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:11,199
dynamic now dynomico is available at

2239
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:13,198

states for the first time

2241
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:17,279
i love using dynomyco to both speed up

2242
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,760
the growth of mycelium networks in the

2243
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:22,079
soil but also as a biostimulant

2244
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,920
to make clone cuttings more viral you

2245
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:26,000
can see side-by-sides showing the

2246
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:29,279
comparative growth on their instagram

2247
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,279
at dinomyco if you demand reliable

2248

growing results and appreciate the

2249
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:34,479
importance of an active root zone in

2250
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:37,880

welcome back you are listening to

2297
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:09,679
shaping fire i am your host shango los

2298
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:11,198
and our guest this week is neurologist

2299
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:15,039
and cannabis researcher

2300
01:29:11,198 --> 01:29:17,919
dr ethan russo so ethan you know

2301
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:18,960
one of the things that i find most um

2302
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:21,440
you know interesting

2303
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:23,279
about how we're starting to handle

2304
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:26,559
migraines now

2305
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:30,238
is the increased availability of

2306
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:33,520
medicinal psilocybin-rich mushrooms

2307
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:37,519
and the common commonality of people

2308
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:39,120
doing micro dosing for a for a range of

2309
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:41,120
neurological issues

2310
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:43,679
including like we've talked about about

2311
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:46,719
on episode 22

2312
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:49,679
using mushrooms and cannabis together

2313
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:52,158
to help heal traumatic brain injury and

2314
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:54,719
lay down new neural pathways

2315
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:56,719
and so so you know there's not a lot of

2316
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:59,198
research that's been done at this point

2317
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:01,039
on on mushrooms and migraines because

2318
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:03,919
it's a controlled substance

2319
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:06,158
but there's a whole lot of anecdotal

2320
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:09,760
evidence that psilocybin mushrooms

2321
01:30:06,158 --> 01:30:11,519
help with the relief and to decrease the

2322
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:14,960
likelihood of them

2323
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:17,800
um what is the state of the science for

2324
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:19,198
what the the interaction between

2325
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:21,279
psilocybin

2326
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:22,319
the naturally occurring molecule in

2327
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:26,238
mushrooms

2328
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:26,238
and on migraines

2329
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:32,479
well again i think it's helpful to put

2330
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:35,840
this in context historically

2331
01:30:32,479 --> 01:30:38,879
it has been known for centuries that

2332
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:41,279
substances that are psychedelic or

2333
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:44,719
hallucinogenic at high dose

2334
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:48,399
can be used at low doses to treat

2335
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:50,800
migraine um so i mean

2336
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:52,960
probably the easiest way uh to think

2337
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:57,279
about it is in terms of

2338
01:30:52,960 --> 01:31:00,960
looking at the work of albert hofmann

2339
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:02,000
who developed lsd he actually worked for

2340
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:05,119
the sandoz

2341
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:09,119
um company in

2342
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:11,039
switzerland on a series of drugs that

2343
01:31:09,119 --> 01:31:14,238
were ergot derivatives

2344
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:16,639
ergot is a rye fungus

2345
01:31:14,238 --> 01:31:17,359
it's been used medicinally for centuries

2346
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:20,840
but

2347
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:22,399
they were using natural compounds and

2348
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:25,600
semi-synthetics

2349
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:29,039
from ergot treat migraine

2350
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:32,079
both acutely and preventively

2351
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:33,600
um and one of the substances he

2352
01:31:32,079 --> 01:31:37,760
developed was lsd

2353
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,760
which everyone knows about

2354
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:43,679
so back in the 90s when i was really

2355
01:31:41,439 --> 01:31:46,079
getting into

2356
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:47,760
plant-based medicine and alternative

2357
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:50,880
treatments

2358
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:54,480
i actually my study of migraine began

2359
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:57,600
with forbidden drugs

2360
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:59,919
and gradually got into cannabis more

2361
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:04,960
specifically

2362
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:08,079
but again historically peyote

2363
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:11,439
the source of masculine spent

2364
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:12,158
a short period of time as a prescription

2365
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:16,399
medicine

2366
01:32:12,158 --> 01:32:19,519
in the united states to treat migraine

2367
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:22,879
so what lsd uh

2368
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:24,239
silacity mushrooms and peyote have in

2369
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:29,199
common is they're all

2370
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:31,519
tryptamine type psychedelics

2371
01:32:29,198 --> 01:32:34,000
so they have a common mechanism of

2372
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:37,760
action seemingly that relates

2373
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:41,039
as best we know to the um

2374
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:44,400
serotonin type 2

2375
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:46,880
a receptor but what's funny there is we

2376
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:47,679
think we know it works on this receptor

2377
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,880
but

2378
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:51,039
why does it seemingly have this

2379
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:54,239
persistent

2380
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:57,840
effect we usually think of medicines for

2381
01:32:54,238 --> 01:33:00,479
migraine to have

2382
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:02,159
benefit for a few hours or for one

2383
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:03,839
attack

2384
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:05,759
but what's different with the

2385
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:09,520
psychedelics is

2386
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:11,840
in some individuals hopefully often

2387
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:12,960
even a low dose of these substances

2388
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:16,000
seems to

2389
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:19,198
give a long break

2390
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:21,279
to the migraine susceptibility

2391
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:23,839
and it's even more pronounced in the

2392
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:25,920
instance of cluster headaches

2393
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,760
cluster headaches are distinct from

2394
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:30,000
migraine although

2395
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:32,560
they may have drugs in common that help

2396
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,560
them but

2397
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:36,960
clusters are extremely severe and

2398
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:40,800
debilitating

2399
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:41,439
and it frequently is the case that

2400
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:46,400
someone

2401
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:51,119
uses a a very low dose of a psychedelic

2402
01:33:46,399 --> 01:33:54,158
and has a long-term remission

2403
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:55,039
from cluster headache attacks to some

2404
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:57,439
extent

2405
01:33:55,039 --> 01:33:59,840
the same thing can happen with migraine

2406
01:33:57,439 --> 01:34:02,000
but clearly it's the case that these

2407
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:04,960
types of substances

2408
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,079
can be very effective preventives even

2409
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,719
if taken

2410
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:10,238
in extremely low doses on a more regular

2411
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:13,760
basis

2412
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:16,079
in fact i can brag at this point

2413
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,159
that i wrote to albert hoffman back in

2414
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:22,319
the 90s and got a handwritten

2415
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:26,000
letter from him endorsing

2416
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:29,840
my proposal

2417
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:32,880
that super low doses of lsd

2418
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:34,719
be taken preventively as a migraine

2419
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:37,039
treatment

2420
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:40,158
so clearly was related to the kind of

2421
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:40,158
work he was doing

2422
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:45,359
i would have to admit that getting in

2423
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:49,480
another schedule one

2424
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:51,439
drug and trying to develop it as a

2425
01:34:49,479 --> 01:34:53,759
pharmaceutical

2426
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:56,079
would be a little more than i'm willing

2427
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:59,360
to take on at this point but

2428
01:34:56,079 --> 01:35:00,000
certainly that was my interest back in

2429
01:34:59,359 --> 01:35:04,000
that that

2430
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:07,560
day so we we do not know

2431
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:11,279
specifically the mechanism that the

2432
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:14,560
psilocybin is performing

2433
01:35:11,279 --> 01:35:17,679
to interrupt these the

2434
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:22,239
serotonin cycle um

2435
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:24,158
that causes the migraines and so

2436
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:25,919
we know that this interruption is the

2437
01:35:24,158 --> 01:35:29,198
thing we want

2438
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:30,000
because it it acts as a prophylactic

2439
01:35:29,198 --> 01:35:33,439
against

2440
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:37,279
migraines for some period of time now

2441
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:39,839
with that being said the two variables

2442
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:40,800
that that seem to move a lot for folks

2443
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:45,279
is

2444
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:48,159
um the dosage and how long it works

2445
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:49,118
um on the dosage side we've got folks

2446
01:35:48,158 --> 01:35:52,479
who are

2447
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:56,479
um you know taking point

2448
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:59,919
one gram uh

2449
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:03,359
excuse me 0.1 gram of

2450
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:04,480
of a psilocybin mushroom as a micro dose

2451
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:07,920
which they they won't

2452
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:10,238
experience any of the intoxicating um

2453
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:11,039
effects but it's in there it's in the

2454
01:36:10,238 --> 01:36:14,079
chemicals now

2455
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:15,920
in their bloodstream doing its magic and

2456
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:16,319
so some people are getting benefits from

2457
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,800
that

2458
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:20,000
but then you've got other people who you

2459
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,480
know did not

2460
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,198
you know don't get the interruption for

2461
01:36:22,479 --> 01:36:26,559
long term

2462
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:28,399
until you know two or three milligrams

2463
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:30,239
at which point you know that's a that's

2464
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:32,719
a you know a very significant

2465
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:34,079
dosage of psilocybin where you are going

2466
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:37,118
to have

2467
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:38,000
you know euphoric and you know types of

2468
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:40,158
hallucinations

2469
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,079
very likely you know that's an intense

2470
01:36:40,158 --> 01:36:44,399
dose but but some people

2471
01:36:42,079 --> 01:36:46,559
find that they need to take that much to

2472
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:47,279
get you know a week or two off of

2473
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,520
migraines

2474
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:51,359
and so people are asking me all the time

2475
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,080
do i take a microdose do i have to take

2476
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:54,399
a heroic

2477
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:55,439
dose how long should i expect it to last

2478
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:58,319
and and

2479
01:36:55,439 --> 01:37:00,479
all i can do is repeat other anecdotal

2480
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:01,439
information that i received from other

2481
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:03,599
patients

2482
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:05,359
so i'd love to hear what you have to say

2483
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:08,560
about those two variables

2484
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:10,079
about the dose and how long it works for

2485
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,400
you

2486
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:14,719
well again i think this is really going

2487
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:16,879
to depend on the individual and so the

2488
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:20,079
best advice is to

2489
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:22,880
start with a very low dose and see

2490
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:26,238
what's necessary

2491
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:31,359
not everyone can take

2492
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:31,359
time off of work and deal with the

2493
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:36,960
the implications of a heroic dose of a

2494
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:39,760
psychedelic

2495
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,399
and hopefully it would be the case that

2496
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:43,199
less is

2497
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:44,638
adequate but i i mean the kinds of

2498
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:48,960
things you were mentioning

2499
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:51,920
seem to make sense and it depends

2500
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:53,600
on the the type of philosophy mushroom

2501
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:56,560
that's involved

2502
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:57,280
um certainly with the high potency ones

2503
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:02,159
like silas

2504
01:37:57,279 --> 01:38:05,279
b asorescence um

2505
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:08,319
trying to think um four mushrooms

2506
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:10,158
would likely represent something like 10

2507
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:13,279
milligrams

2508
01:38:10,158 --> 01:38:16,319
of psilocybin um it may be that

2509
01:38:13,279 --> 01:38:17,519
less would be adequate for prevention of

2510
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:21,759
headaches

2511
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:25,199
uh 10 milligrams people hopefully or

2512
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:28,639
it's going to be sub threshold for overt

2513
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:31,519
psychedelic effects 20 milligrams

2514
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:33,840
um certainly a good number of people are

2515
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:37,679
going to be affected in that way

2516
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:39,440
and higher than that it's quite likely

2517
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:41,600
um that it's going to be a more

2518
01:38:39,439 --> 01:38:44,719
full-blown experience which

2519
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:46,320
again may or may be more than people

2520
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:50,319
bargained for

2521
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:52,079
um it isn't important that we state at

2522
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:55,359
this time that these are still

2523
01:38:52,079 --> 01:38:56,158
illegal uh we're talking theoretically

2524
01:38:55,359 --> 01:38:58,880
here

2525
01:38:56,158 --> 01:39:00,559
um things may change and it depends on

2526
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,480
the jurisdiction

2527
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,239
uh certainly there are ballot

2528
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:07,519
initiatives to

2529
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:09,759
liberalize um the situation

2530
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:11,040
in some jurisdictions but uh these

2531
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:14,079
substances remain

2532
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:17,279
federally illegal

2533
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:17,600
so um in in determining dosage you know

2534
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:19,679
in

2535
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:21,360
in common parlance when patients are

2536
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:25,279
talking to patients

2537
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:28,799
most folks are using weight measurements

2538
01:39:25,279 --> 01:39:32,639
of the entire mushroom and of course

2539
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:35,360
that is kind of a misnomer right because

2540
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:36,159
you can have the same species of

2541
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:39,198
mushroom

2542
01:39:36,158 --> 01:39:40,559
have different potency based on how it

2543
01:39:39,198 --> 01:39:43,359
was grown

2544
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:44,400
and then you've got different species of

2545
01:39:43,359 --> 01:39:47,439
mushrooms

2546
01:39:44,399 --> 01:39:50,399
that all have got psilocybin

2547
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:50,399
that have got different

2548
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:56,960
potency because of the species that they

2549
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,039
are so to say ah you know i'm taking

2550
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:00,000
this much of a psilocybin mushroom you

2551
01:39:59,039 --> 01:40:01,439
try it

2552
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,039
there's actually you know your mileage

2553
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:05,359
may vary there

2554
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:06,960
um yes so so that's an important warning

2555
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:09,279
just to make sure we mention

2556
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,319
but where i'm going with this is you

2557
01:40:09,279 --> 01:40:13,519
know some

2558
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:17,359
more advanced mycologist

2559
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:20,480
chemists you know they are

2560
01:40:17,359 --> 01:40:23,920
using natural extraction techniques

2561
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:27,519
to have the psilocybin and

2562
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:30,158
um and um

2563
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:31,840
oh it's uh the other component

2564
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:34,559
psilocybin and it sounds just like

2565
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:37,440
silver fiber anyway

2566
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:38,000
thank you silicen thank you so so they

2567
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:40,719
are

2568
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,238
uh causing they're putting the mushrooms

2569
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:45,198
in fluids that cause

2570
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:47,118
these chemicals to precipitate out in

2571
01:40:45,198 --> 01:40:50,319
their crystalline form

2572
01:40:47,118 --> 01:40:50,960
um which uh is wonderful for many folks

2573
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:54,158
because

2574
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,880
uh some people have a a literal gut

2575
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:57,920
reaction

2576
01:40:54,880 --> 01:41:00,480
to mushrooms making their gut upset and

2577
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:02,399
being able to have uh crystal forms

2578
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,479
psilocybin and silicon

2579
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:06,319
you know you're no longer taking the

2580
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:07,919
flesh of the mushroom which has these

2581
01:41:06,319 --> 01:41:10,960
other components that can

2582
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:13,118
give you a tummy ache or or diarrhea

2583
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,480
so all of this is just set up this

2584
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:16,479
question of

2585
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:17,519
you know you and i have talked a great

2586
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:19,919
deal on

2587
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:21,040
shaping fire about the importance of

2588
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,079
whole plant

2589
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:27,519
cannabis medicine where you need to use

2590
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:29,920
the entirety of the flower to get the

2591
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:33,199
best medical results

2592
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:35,679
does this apply also to mushrooms

2593
01:41:33,198 --> 01:41:36,399
where we should be taking the whole

2594
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:39,840
mushroom

2595
01:41:36,399 --> 01:41:40,638
for entourage like results or is it

2596
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,639
really

2597
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:44,319
uh no actually we're just trying to eat

2598
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:46,000
the mushroom to get the psilocybin and

2599
01:41:44,319 --> 01:41:47,920
silicon and if you can precipitate

2600
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,279
that out and take that pure clearly

2601
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:51,039
you're gonna have to change your dosage

2602
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:52,639
but by all means that's gonna be a

2603
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:54,399
cleaner way to get

2604
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,239
access to the chemicals you're trying to

2605
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:59,279
ingest

2606
01:41:56,238 --> 01:42:01,519
yeah there are pros and cons my bias

2607
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:05,519
would be that

2608
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:08,080
that more complete extracts are probably

2609
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,520
more effective but i don't know that

2610
01:42:08,079 --> 01:42:13,039
that's proven here

2611
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:14,080
and in terms of absolute titration of

2612
01:42:13,039 --> 01:42:17,439
dosage or

2613
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:20,719
knowing the dosage it's obviously

2614
01:42:17,439 --> 01:42:24,000
easier to assess that with a pure

2615
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:27,118
crystalline substance

2616
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,000
but as you mentioned psilocybin isn't

2617
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:31,679
the only game in

2618
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:34,238
town there's silicon in some species

2619
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:36,399
there's beocysteine

2620
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:38,319
these are all psychedelic and may have

2621
01:42:36,399 --> 01:42:42,719
similar activities

2622
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:46,479
um so again i can't point you to any

2623
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:50,158
established research that

2624
01:42:46,479 --> 01:42:53,759
can specify major differences

2625
01:42:50,158 --> 01:42:58,319
but i do

2626
01:42:53,760 --> 01:43:02,719
favor natural preparations were possible

2627
01:42:58,319 --> 01:43:04,000
um as far as dosing from migraines you

2628
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:07,279
know

2629
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:10,560
there are a lot of i don't know there's

2630
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:14,158
there's a lot of teachers out there

2631
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:17,440
giving an array of different sorts of

2632
01:43:14,158 --> 01:43:17,920
uh dosing protocols but you know most

2633
01:43:17,439 --> 01:43:22,079
people

2634
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:25,199
tend to go to the paul stamets

2635
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:26,479
dosing protocols and and

2636
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:28,719
you know they're not necessarily

2637
01:43:26,479 --> 01:43:29,279
directed specifically for migraines

2638
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:32,800
right they're

2639
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:35,359
they're for general neurological health

2640
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:37,119
um and in some instances cancer

2641
01:43:35,359 --> 01:43:38,880
specifically if used with you know

2642
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:40,158
turkey mushrooms and other things

2643
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:42,000
but in this case we're talking about

2644
01:43:40,158 --> 01:43:45,679
specifically migraines

2645
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,000
um there is debate about oh you're going

2646
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:49,199
to

2647
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:52,399
take this small micro dose of

2648
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:55,118
of 0.1 gram

2649
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:55,519
of mushroom you're gonna take it once a

2650
01:43:55,118 --> 01:43:58,158
day

2651
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,880
you're gonna take it every every day

2652
01:43:58,158 --> 01:44:00,238
once a day

2653
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,920
some people are like oh no you gotta

2654
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:03,118
need to take it every three days only

2655
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:06,319
two times a week and

2656
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:08,000
there's a lot of variety on this and um

2657
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:10,399
i suspect we're going to end up

2658
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,279
in a conversation like we did last set

2659
01:44:10,399 --> 01:44:13,359
with cannabis

2660
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:14,639
where you know start with a little bit

2661
01:44:13,359 --> 01:44:16,960
and increase

2662
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:17,920
you know from there but is there

2663
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:21,600
anything that

2664
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:23,920
we want to be aware of about frequency

2665
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:25,679
of taking these micro doses so so if

2666
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:26,800
we're going to start with a low dose

2667
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:30,079
anyway just for

2668
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:31,279
safety reasons um are we going to be

2669
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:34,319
wanting to take this

2670
01:44:31,279 --> 01:44:36,479
low dose you know uh daily

2671
01:44:34,319 --> 01:44:38,399
once a week like where's a good place to

2672
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:40,479
start we can always move up but we want

2673
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:43,920
to make sure that we've at least

2674
01:44:40,479 --> 01:44:46,319
hit the threshold of efficacy

2675
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:47,440
yeah i think you've said it um in this

2676
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:50,559
instance

2677
01:44:47,439 --> 01:44:51,519
i guess the best advice would be to try

2678
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:55,840
a low dose

2679
01:44:51,520 --> 01:45:00,560
wait a week if nothing happens

2680
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:04,079
then maybe that's adequate for a time

2681
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:06,000
but um you know i always subscribe to

2682
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:09,118
the philosophy that less is more

2683
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:13,760
if it's successful um and so

2684
01:45:09,118 --> 01:45:17,198
if infrequent dosing is sufficient

2685
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:20,800
to achieve the desired end then

2686
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:23,599
that's terrific in this instance

2687
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,039
i would hope that daily administration

2688
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:27,600
isn't necessary the way

2689
01:45:25,039 --> 01:45:30,000
that we've discussed in relation to

2690
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:33,039
cannabis as a migraine prophylactic

2691
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,520
but it's quite possible that it would be

2692
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:38,000
for some individuals

2693
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:38,800
what we're looking for here is the hope

2694
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,920
that

2695
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:44,480
there will be some prolonged remission

2696
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:46,800
in relation to a certain frequency of

2697
01:45:44,479 --> 01:45:50,638
dosing

2698
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:53,920
um so one of my favorite uh

2699
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:55,279
you know migraineur patients that i

2700
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,960
talked to

2701
01:45:55,279 --> 01:45:59,359
she takes this very seriously because

2702
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:02,480
her migraines are

2703
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:04,880
absolutely debilitating and

2704
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:06,000
she's the one who first started talking

2705
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:09,920
to me about

2706
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:12,560
the you know the how effective taking

2707
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:13,679
psilocybin mushrooms are for

2708
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:17,440
interrupting

2709
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:19,679
the serotonin cycle caused migraines

2710
01:46:17,439 --> 01:46:21,118
and and so you know i i listened with

2711
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:24,239
rap detention

2712
01:46:21,118 --> 01:46:24,880
and and she went so far as to reach out

2713
01:46:24,238 --> 01:46:28,559
to

2714
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:31,679
a mycologist who cultivates an array

2715
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:34,719
of uh mushrooms and

2716
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:38,239
and so she she got a package uh

2717
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:41,520
from her that that was was essentially

2718
01:46:38,238 --> 01:46:44,559
seven different

2719
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:46,639
species of psilocybin rich mushrooms

2720
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:49,039
from different parts of the world

2721
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:49,920
so that she could kind of you know taste

2722
01:46:49,039 --> 01:46:53,920
test them

2723
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:56,158
and and try low and medium-sized doses

2724
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:59,600
of each to find out

2725
01:46:56,158 --> 01:47:01,519
um why some you know if some worked

2726
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,760
better for her migraine and would buy

2727
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:06,840
her more time

2728
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:08,480
my question for you is is she definitely

2729
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:12,079
experienced

2730
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:15,919
different lengths without

2731
01:47:12,079 --> 01:47:19,118
migraines based on the different species

2732
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:22,319
do you think that that is related

2733
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:25,039
only to the different potency of the

2734
01:47:22,319 --> 01:47:26,960
psilocybin in each of these species

2735
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:28,238
or do you think that each of the other

2736
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:30,960
species

2737
01:47:28,238 --> 01:47:31,359
brings things to the table in addition

2738
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,560
to

2739
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:37,759
psilocybin which may be

2740
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:41,199
helping gain her relief from

2741
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:44,000
the migraines well either is possible

2742
01:47:41,198 --> 01:47:47,519
um you know the reductionist is going to

2743
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:50,238
say oh it's all related to the

2744
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:52,320
specific dosage of psilocybin and that

2745
01:47:50,238 --> 01:47:55,359
could be true but i wouldn't rule out

2746
01:47:52,319 --> 01:47:58,319
that there are synergies occurring

2747
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:59,519
in the different species right on that's

2748
01:47:58,319 --> 01:48:01,439
interesting all right

2749
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:03,119
so um so let's talk start talking about

2750
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:06,879
the interplay between

2751
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:09,679
um psilocybin mushrooms and cannabis so

2752
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:11,840
you know if our goal is the cessation of

2753
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:15,279
migraines or at the very least

2754
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:17,039
the decreased likelihood of migraines uh

2755
01:48:15,279 --> 01:48:18,719
the person with migraines is like oh

2756
01:48:17,039 --> 01:48:22,479
okay i'm gonna start

2757
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:25,679
vaporizing uh flour in low doses

2758
01:48:22,479 --> 01:48:28,799
occasionally to uh at first

2759
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:31,199
deal with the immediate onset of a

2760
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:32,079
migraine when when you can feel it you

2761
01:48:31,198 --> 01:48:34,638
know on the

2762
01:48:32,079 --> 01:48:35,920
on the in the shadows of your brain that

2763
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:37,920
you that it's coming on

2764
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:40,239
and then longer term they're going to

2765
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:43,920
use something like a tincture

2766
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:46,479
um should we expect any interplay

2767
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:48,399
between the cannabis and the psilocybin

2768
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:51,678
mushrooms

2769
01:48:48,399 --> 01:48:53,839
well certainly that's possible

2770
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:56,239
you're dealing with two different drugs

2771
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,960
there's some overlap in effect in this

2772
01:48:56,238 --> 01:49:00,000
specific

2773
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:03,600
instance most obvious

2774
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,319
relationship is that many people

2775
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:08,639
use cannabis in conjunction with

2776
01:49:06,319 --> 01:49:11,519
psychedelics to reduce the

2777
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:13,118
associated nausea uh from the

2778
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:16,639
psychedelics

2779
01:49:13,118 --> 01:49:20,399
on for a lot of people in the olden days

2780
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:23,118
it was just a routine uh to use cannabis

2781
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:26,000
in association with the psychedelics

2782
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:26,639
just to avoid the vomiting and nausea

2783
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,439
that

2784
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:30,800
frequently cannot be associated with

2785
01:49:29,439 --> 01:49:33,839
them

2786
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:37,599
so what kind of dosage and what

2787
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:42,560
method of taking the cannabis

2788
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:46,480
would you say would decrease the nausea

2789
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:48,960
most effectively well very low doses

2790
01:49:46,479 --> 01:49:50,879
would be necessary for that it could be

2791
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:53,279
a single inhalation or

2792
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:54,079
something in the range of 2.5 milligrams

2793
01:49:53,279 --> 01:49:57,118
of thc

2794
01:49:54,079 --> 01:49:59,279
equivalent in this instance if it's just

2795
01:49:57,118 --> 01:50:01,279
nausea we're talking about it's possible

2796
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:04,960
that thca

2797
01:50:01,279 --> 01:50:10,880
cbda could also be effective

2798
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:13,279
but um i don't have uh

2799
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:16,079
any anecdotes to go with that that's

2800
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:17,679
just based on theory

2801
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:19,519
right on it's interesting because you

2802
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:20,960
know for folks who are using psilocybin

2803
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:22,000
mushrooms for their hallucinogenic

2804
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:24,399
qualities

2805
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,760
cannabis can help kind of loosen you up

2806
01:50:24,399 --> 01:50:28,238
so that you're more open

2807
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:29,039
to you know sacred geometry and the

2808
01:50:28,238 --> 01:50:32,399
ideas

2809
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:34,158
that people are taking mushrooms for but

2810
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:38,479
if the if the goal is not

2811
01:50:34,158 --> 01:50:40,719
to trip if the goal is to you know do

2812
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:42,238
brain maintenance it's it's really an

2813
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:45,359
entirely different category

2814
01:50:42,238 --> 01:50:47,839
so um you know folks who are used to

2815
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:49,279
taking mushrooms and then taking you

2816
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:52,000
know smoking a joint or

2817
01:50:49,279 --> 01:50:52,719
some you know more significant dosage of

2818
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,279
cannabis

2819
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:56,800
do note that you know that's that's not

2820
01:50:55,279 --> 01:50:58,238
necessary for this you don't

2821
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:00,320
you don't necessarily have to get high

2822
01:50:58,238 --> 01:51:02,000
even though you know that might be part

2823
01:51:00,319 --> 01:51:03,920
of a different kind of therapy of life

2824
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,118
enjoyment you may be doing

2825
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:07,118
you know one of the things that's

2826
01:51:05,118 --> 01:51:09,439
frustrating for folks ethan is that

2827
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:10,960
um you know these these therapies don't

2828
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:13,678
work for everybody

2829
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:14,880
and and also which is sometimes even

2830
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:17,520
crueler

2831
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:18,400
um they work really well for a little

2832
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:21,440
while

2833
01:51:18,399 --> 01:51:23,519
and then they don't work anymore and

2834
01:51:21,439 --> 01:51:24,879
um that frustrates the hell out of

2835
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:27,760
patients

2836
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:28,800
who are looking for relief can you speak

2837
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:31,679
to

2838
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,480
um whatever facet of the human body's

2839
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:36,319
interaction

2840
01:51:32,479 --> 01:51:40,158
with these chemicals that might explain

2841
01:51:36,319 --> 01:51:42,158
why they may work for a little while and

2842
01:51:40,158 --> 01:51:44,879
then not

2843
01:51:42,158 --> 01:51:47,598
not simply but again um we're talking

2844
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:50,880
about migraine it's a complex bio

2845
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:53,440
chemical disorder of the brain and again

2846
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,440
it's multifactorial particularly with

2847
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:58,559
respect to triggers

2848
01:51:55,439 --> 01:52:02,158
i am not ever satisfied to go with

2849
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:05,280
one thing um and that's why

2850
01:52:02,158 --> 01:52:08,519
i have always in my career harped on

2851
01:52:05,279 --> 01:52:11,439
combining the lifestyle factors with any

2852
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:14,560
pharmaceutical or

2853
01:52:11,439 --> 01:52:17,598
medical approaches um

2854
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:21,119
you know basically though i can say this

2855
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:25,119
that um with cannabis treatment

2856
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:28,399
of migraine particularly for prevention

2857
01:52:25,118 --> 01:52:31,679
um it has been much much

2858
01:52:28,399 --> 01:52:36,000
less often that

2859
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:39,118
we see a failure over time

2860
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:41,118
usually it's a persistent benefit and

2861
01:52:39,118 --> 01:52:42,319
that's what was noted in the 19th

2862
01:52:41,118 --> 01:52:44,719
century and

2863
01:52:42,319 --> 01:52:47,599
that's mainly been my experience in

2864
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:49,840
hearing from people all over the world

2865
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:52,560
about their experience using cannabis to

2866
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:55,840
treat migraine

2867
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:57,599
that makes sense um i think i want to

2868
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:00,639
finish with this last thought

2869
01:52:57,599 --> 01:53:03,920
so you know while you

2870
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:07,118
are primarily a researcher and

2871
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:07,840
educator at this point you have a long

2872
01:53:07,118 --> 01:53:10,960
history

2873
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:13,520
of of working in

2874
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:14,719
the clinic with real patients and as we

2875
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:18,000
all know

2876
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:20,239
um there's a big difference between uh

2877
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,920
you know dealing with the research and

2878
01:53:20,238 --> 01:53:23,439
actually trying to

2879
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:26,639
you know interact with a patient who's

2880
01:53:23,439 --> 01:53:29,598
ex you know suffering essentially

2881
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:31,118
what would you say to a patient who is

2882
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:34,639
new to cannabis

2883
01:53:31,118 --> 01:53:37,198
and new to mushrooms

2884
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:39,118
but suffers from terrible migraines you

2885
01:53:37,198 --> 01:53:41,919
know the patient is probably a bit

2886
01:53:39,118 --> 01:53:44,319
unsure of the taboo of cannabis

2887
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:45,840
and is probably very aware of the taboo

2888
01:53:44,319 --> 01:53:48,158
of an illegality

2889
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:49,199
of mushrooms but you know

2890
01:53:48,158 --> 01:53:51,839
pharmaceuticals

2891
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:54,000
have let them down by either not working

2892
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:56,800
or working a little bit with significant

2893
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:58,158
side effects and so you know as is

2894
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:59,599
common the case you know

2895
01:53:58,158 --> 01:54:01,359
we don't usually hear from these types

2896
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:03,279
of patients until

2897
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:04,880
um you know where they're where their

2898
01:54:03,279 --> 01:54:07,679
last possibility

2899
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:09,359
um so so you know there are a lot of

2900
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:10,319
patients who are in this position

2901
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:13,598
listening to us

2902
01:54:10,319 --> 01:54:14,639
right now um what kind of guidance or

2903
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:16,960
insight do you offer

2904
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:17,840
them to kind of get their heads straight

2905
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:21,439
about

2906
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:25,360
about you know trying these new options

2907
01:54:21,439 --> 01:54:25,919
sure well sometimes radical problems

2908
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:29,439
require

2909
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:33,199
radical solutions and uh anybody who's

2910
01:54:29,439 --> 01:54:36,879
suffered with a full-blown migraine um

2911
01:54:33,198 --> 01:54:40,079
is aware that they'll try almost

2912
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:44,560
anything to make this a less

2913
01:54:40,079 --> 01:54:44,559
frequent affliction

2914
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:50,000
fortunately we're facing a situation now

2915
01:54:48,399 --> 01:54:52,479
in most jurisdictions

2916
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,479
that there's been liberalization of

2917
01:54:52,479 --> 01:54:57,039
attitudes and laws

2918
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:58,399
in relation to cannabis the same thing

2919
01:54:57,039 --> 01:55:01,760
can happen

2920
01:54:58,399 --> 01:55:04,960
with psychedelics i hope it does

2921
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:09,039
but again either of these approaches

2922
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:12,480
with cannabis or with psychedelics

2923
01:55:09,039 --> 01:55:15,760
when used properly can be extremely safe

2924
01:55:12,479 --> 01:55:16,479
and offer a kind of relief of migraine

2925
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:19,599
attacks

2926
01:55:16,479 --> 01:55:22,079
that just hasn't been forthcoming from

2927
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:24,400
conventional approaches

2928
01:55:22,079 --> 01:55:26,319
right on that's great well ethan thank
