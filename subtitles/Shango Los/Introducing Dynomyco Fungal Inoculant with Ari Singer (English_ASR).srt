1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,240
hey there I am here with Ari singer of

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,910
dynamite inoculants a new product for

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,679
fungally inoculating your living soil

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,259
the products come all the way from

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,269
Israel and I asked Ari for a little bit

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,550
of his time today here at Indo Expo

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,679
Portland because I'm happy to say that

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,990
Dyna Mike is now a sponsor of the

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,509
shaping fire podcast so that's great so

10
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:26,250
to help introduce everybody to what this

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,720
product is and the great success I've

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,589
been having with it on Vashon Island

13
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,178
where I live

14
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:31,710
I am sorry to give me a few minutes so

15
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:33,058
that we could all hang out so alright

16
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,679
it's nice to see you thank you so much

17
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:36,449
to you again thank you so much for

18
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,429
having me yeah so let's start like it

19
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,579
with the basics right would you explain

20
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:43,829
to us what dynamite does to give people

21
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,100
a frame of context on how to think about

22
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,160
it

23
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,410
alright so assuming someone is watching

24
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,839
this he probably knows a whole bunch

25
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,788
about mycorrhizal fungi from listen to

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,239
your show and the guests who have been

27
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,270
on it

28
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,599
what sets dynamite apart is the

29
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,449
concentration the ease of use it's a

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,430
one-time application thing one and done

31
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:08,340
pretty much when you transplant into

32
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:12,530
your growing media and it can be soil it

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,930
can be cocoa it could be a wide array of

34
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:18,960
growing media's and what the fungus does

35
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:22,560
it creates this secondary network or

36
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:25,139
root system secondary root system so to

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,368
speak it creates a - Network which then

38
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,590
allows the plant to absorb more

39
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:31,049
nutrients water and minerals which are

40
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,270
physically and chemically out of the

41
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,490
plant's reach so that's pretty much what

42
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:37,920
it's essentially making a superhighway a

43
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:40,169
fungal superhighway throughout the pot

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,659
right correct so that it expands the

45
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:46,790
reach of the root zone exactly and if

46
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:50,939
you have if you're growing in let's say

47
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:52,740
companion planting or nature trees and

48
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,629
plants actually use this fungal network

49
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,810
to communicate amongst themselves so

50
00:01:54,629 --> 00:02:00,420
they can actually transfer nutrients and

51
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,759
water in a forest from one tree to

52
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,618
another with this fungal Network so it's

53
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,170
pretty cool stuff yeah well so far I've

54
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:08,250
gotten really good results on it and you

55
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,439
know you gave me a whole bunch of

56
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,639
samples last time we got together and

57
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,590
I've been handing them out to patients

58
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,479
on Vashon Island to use in their grows

59
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,430
and one of the things I've been doing to

60
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,729
explain to them is not only like you

61
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,219
know you're helping your pot have a

62
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:25,109
superhighway of mycelium so that all the

63
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,930
nutrients can be grabbed by the plant

64
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,480
but also you know there's we all know

65
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,330
the benefits of no-till right the idea

66
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,579
that you know traditionally we'll use

67
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,860
new soil every run throughout the old

68
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,400
soil and and so you've always got this

69
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,069
new virgin soil without mycelium

70
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,140
networks in it and so every year you

71
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:49,229
have to that has to regrow right right

72
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,848
and so people love no-till because if

73
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:52,619
you're just gonna if you're just gonna

74
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:56,000
like harvest the other plant and then

75
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:59,219
put your new start next to it there's

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,009
pre-existing mycelial networks so that

77
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,628
that superhighway already exists but

78
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:05,310
what I tell people is that you know if

79
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:08,280
you have to wait through your whole

80
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,739
season for that mycelial network to grow

81
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,689
there's all this time where your plant

82
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,239
is not pulling in all the nutrients that

83
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:17,489
it could be and so you have to wait for

84
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,069
a ramp-up period for your soil to get

85
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:24,900
tasty right right but but but using

86
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:27,000
dynamite I have found an incredible jump

87
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,250
up in my plants from the beginning

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,500
because I take some of the granules and

89
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,250
I make my little hole and I and I dust

90
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,789
it in there and and then I transplant

91
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,479
into that and if you explain this so

92
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:42,479
much better than I do

93
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:46,759
explain the magic that happens when when

94
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:50,899
the roots come in contact with the

95
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:53,399
dynamite grains so there's a

96
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,879
communication a hormonal signal that the

97
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,200
plant will send out to the fungus and

98
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:00,000
it's not like the fungus is just

99
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,708
knocking on every single plant's door

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,620
and you know asking hey can I show up

101
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:07,710
right so the plant will actually send

102
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,770
out hormones to get the fungus to

103
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,450
come to it right and then that's when

104
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,760
the interaction will happen so it's not

105
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:18,089
like every single plant will want a

106
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,620
mycorrhizal Association it needs right

107
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,839
if it's getting everything it can

108
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,259
already it won't have this symbiotic

109
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,239
relationship but if it does work if you

110
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,129
do inoculate it at an early stage when

111
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,170
it doesn't have everything available it

112
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:33,149
will create the symbiotic relationship

113
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,860
and the earlier you inoculate your

114
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:37,169
plants the better off you are because

115
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,819
that way you create this secondary root

116
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,590
system right away right so when you're

117
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:43,889
when your roots are very small and they

118
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:45,869
have nowhere to really grab nutrients

119
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:48,509
from or water right you're in the small

120
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,360
container that fungal Network will

121
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:54,300
really help the plants absorb more at an

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,370
earlier stage and we've seen I mean you

123
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,730
can see literally five six inch

124
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,920
differences in height and also in stem

125
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,900
girth just you know within a month of

126
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,580
inoculating plants that's it's the

127
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:05,789
earlier you get it the better off you

128
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:08,519
are

129
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,780
so I heard you say that before right and

130
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,399
I'm like all right well if the earlier

131
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:13,589
the better I want to use this with my

132
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,539
clones which is not what's on the

133
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:16,859
package right and I'm like well what the

134
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,620
hell it's a free sample I'm gonna give

135
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,110
this a try so so what I did is I took my

136
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,620
my clean spring water that we get on

137
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,000
Vashon and and I you know I took took

138
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,050
some of the granules and I mix it in

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,300
there right yeah and I put that in the

140
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:37,319
water beneath the clones in the tray

141
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,930
with my hope was that some of that would

142
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,420
get soaked up into the plugs and then

143
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,480
the roots would somehow get turned on

144
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,069
and like really reach for those right so

145
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,650
that the rooting would have been faster

146
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:50,759
and it totally worked right so so I

147
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,039
don't know if it was supposed to work

148
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,849
that way but it did and I got I got

149
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:00,330
better routing more roots more fine hair

150
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:02,720
and in a faster period I mean like 12

151
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:05,490
days for that was Rick ridiculous and so

152
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,650
I mean are you and other people doing

153
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,740
that or is that and we've it's it's

154
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:12,959
pretty cool when we launch dynamite we

155
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,800
had two application methods but all of a

156
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,750
sudden you know all these different

157
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,189
growers who have other approaches to

158
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,660
inoculating their play

159
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:21,600
are shown as you know they're sending us

160
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,820
a video of them taking dynamite pouring

161
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,400
it into a bucket of water and then just

162
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:30,689
dunking they're their route riots or

163
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:32,849
their their the rapid rooters whatever

164
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:34,170
there's yeah whatever the plug is and

165
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,240
they're just dipping them in you know

166
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,980
soaking them in the water and that's it

167
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,500
right cuz they I mean the fungi are

168
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:43,590
microscopic so they'll latch on to you

169
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,819
know a media and then obviously you have

170
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:48,089
the people who are just mixing it into

171
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:50,849
their soil or into their cocoa or coco

172
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:52,679
peat whatever it is so it's it's pretty

173
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:55,200
cool every almost every day we get a

174
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,139
video on Instagram of another grower you

175
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,979
know transplant time and one week ago to

176
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:03,449
now seeing these massive differences and

177
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,400
they're playing around with it kind of

178
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,560
exploring the cool thing about Dinah

179
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,060
Mike is that the granules will break

180
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,550
apart the moment they come into contact

181
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,579
with water which is not common with a

182
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,879
lot of other inoculants where they the

183
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:19,109
carrier is very firm yeah so with

184
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,730
dynamite the moment it comes into

185
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,520
contact with water will just break apart

186
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,890
in that way those roots can get you know

187
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,199
can either penetrate those granules or

188
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:31,918
get into contact directly with the the

189
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,719
the spores the hyphae and the root

190
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,849
fragments so it's a whole inoculum a

191
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,669
dynamite and as a user it makes it much

192
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:41,820
easier to break it up with your fingers

193
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:44,099
and do you know by hand applications as

194
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,659
well because some of the other micro

195
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,270
inoculants in the market they are so

196
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,660
hard you're all like boom put this

197
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:53,430
Boulder here boom and so but actually

198
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,020
while we're on the topic of comparing

199
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,569
dynamite to other folks in the market

200
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:59,819
and we won't use any names but it was

201
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:01,709
funny to hear the talk around your booth

202
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,480
here today about some of your

203
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:05,909
competitors coming up to you and saying

204
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,770
like how is this possible right why

205
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:11,070
don't you explain a little bit about the

206
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:12,449
concentration and and and why that was

207
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:15,540
one of the things that makes dynamite

208
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:19,250
especially sweet so because we're

209
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:22,230
dealing with microscopic organisms if

210
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:25,560
your concentration is low the chances of

211
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:27,600
inoculating a plant decrease and the

212
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,970
lower your concentration the slimmer the

213
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,770
chances of inoculation are with dynamite

214
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,740
with what makes it unique is that you're

215
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:37,468
getting 900 propagules a gram of two

216
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,019
species of endo mycorrhizal fungi

217
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:42,479
Akito mycorrhizal fungi don't have any

218
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,789
any relationships with cannabis so

219
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,089
they're not in dynamite we chose to

220
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:50,279
specific fungi which have that have

221
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,900
symbiotic relationships with cannabis

222
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,759
so the concentration is super super

223
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,338
important remember Jeff lowenfeld saying

224
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,220
was that a plant has about 20 billion

225
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:02,910
cells in its roots so if you're trying

226
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:05,810
to take a very low concentrated product

227
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:08,159
and inoculating these 20 billion cells

228
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:10,469
you're gonna have to dump a lot of the

229
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,649
product in there and it might not be

230
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,420
financially feasible or you know it

231
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,338
might not make sense but with dynamite

232
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,588
you're getting a highly concentrated

233
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,720
product so it's at 900 properties per

234
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,850
gram you're getting a very concentrated

235
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,620
product at an application rate which is

236
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,300
just about the same as any of the other

237
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,709
products out there on the market right

238
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:31,919
now so you're getting more bang for your

239
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:33,659
buck exactly exactly and the larger the

240
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,929
concentration the more likely you are to

241
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,789
inoculate your plants successfully and

242
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:41,338
that's one of the things that sets us

243
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:43,379
apart is is the high concentration and

244
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,140
that's part of our IP we don't have a

245
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:48,689
patent on it but we do not reveal our

246
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:50,069
secrets because like I said earlier

247
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,650
today we had someone from a competing

248
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,530
company comment approached us and asked

249
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:57,179
us how we got you do 900 yeah yeah but

250
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,740
it's important to also note though that

251
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,500
like even though this may be the first

252
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,120
time you're hearing dynamite it's not

253
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,809
like they just like whip this together

254
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,360
in a bathtub right this is a product

255
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:11,939
that was researched at a university and

256
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,800
then kind of got spun out into this

257
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,690
for-profit give us just a little snippet

258
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:19,559
of where it's from scientifically 30

259
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:22,050
years 25 years of R&amp;D at volcon II

260
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,629
Institute in Israel which is the leading

261
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:27,509
Agricultural Research Centre in Israel

262
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:28,799
and from there it's spun off and that's

263
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:31,080
what we've been doing ever since we

264
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,149
and you know formulating new products

265
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,310
different concentrations different

266
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:38,820
application methods trying to really

267
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:42,449
dial in on the exact exact combination

268
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,750
of strains of carriers also which will

269
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:48,028
allow plants and growers to maximize

270
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:51,750
their yields and their plans health

271
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:53,639
right on so before we wrap up I know the

272
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,799
product you know you've been giving out

273
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,240
samples all across the US for like six

274
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,069
months which is how I and a bunch of

275
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,899
people have gotten it and we're all

276
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,850
sending you videos and stuff so so if

277
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,159
you want to actually see the the

278
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,470
informal studies go to the dynamic

279
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,179
inoculants Instagram where they're

280
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,730
posting I've all the photos that people

281
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:13,859
are sending along but but but really as

282
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,509
far as it being for sale you've only

283
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,339
been getting registered in the states in

284
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,828
like the last two months alright so so

285
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,850
when people see the video and they're

286
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:22,229
like I want to check this stuff out

287
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,019
where can they get it

288
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,490
so right now grow generation just picked

289
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,528
us up there nationwide they have about

290
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,259
twenty six or seven stores across the

291
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:34,139
nation hope Tech hydroponics in

292
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:37,230
Bellingham fed city hydro in Federal Way

293
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:39,240
so these are Washington local so are

294
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,550
they how many states or is it because

295
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,589
because registration takes time we

296
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:45,059
haven't been able to get into all these

297
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:46,740
stores physically because you're not

298
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,509
allowed to sell them on the shelves yet

299
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,159
until it's registered so we just got

300
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:51,870
registered in California so you can be

301
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,120
expecting to see dynamite be in stores

302
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,730
in California

303
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,179
Portland's coming along so Oregon also

304
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:02,370
Washington State Colorado as well so the

305
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,199
major states were recreational cannabis

306
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,909
has been legalized already so that's

307
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,620
where we're at already right on is there

308
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:10,110
anybody who's selling it online

309
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,820
like any online grow shops where people

310
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,649
in states that you haven't gotten into

311
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,600
goodbye and had it shipped to so Hope

312
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:19,528
Tech hydroponics is one of them grow

313
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,509
generation I'm sure will be also and you

314
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:23,039
can reach out to them and we're gonna be

315
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:25,230
getting to more stories in the near

316
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:28,019
future but we're still we're still a

317
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,220
small company so to speak so this is

318
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,129
what the packaging looks like this is

319
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,959
what you're gonna be looking for and you

320
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:37,828
know if you if you watch the shaping

321
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,659
fire podcast you know that or listen to

322
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:40,679
it or if you or if you watch the YouTube

323
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,409
channel

324
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,909
you know that we don't take money from

325
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:46,528
synthetic nutrients right we are very

326
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:50,759
much into regenerative agriculture

327
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:52,830
healthy living soil growing and so when

328
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,330
I came across Dino Mike and I'm like

329
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,970
