1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:11,129
so they utilize it mr. Peter Tosh their

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,798
famous song we love him you're listening

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,109
to voice of Vashon this is borderlines

4
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:19,140
and guess what we're doing a 420 show

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,470

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,480
stuff last time I met you Shango your

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,640
head was in a beehive I was like four

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,289
years ago and then and then things

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,530
happened and we went on this trajectory

12
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,149
and it found you it seems like yeah not

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,270
doing quite as much beekeeping anymore

14
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,980
but spending most of my time traveling

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,899
the country doing business consulting

16
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:49,109
and teaching how to use cannabis for

17
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:52,079
health responsibly additionally in the

18
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:54,539

00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:06,478
to today very well timed thanks for

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,920
coming in on very short notice like hey

24
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,450
you want to come talk with me well

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,100
that's the that's the advantage of

26
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,750
working from home and working on the

27
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,478
island right if you want meet I'm here

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,239
boom and one thing that's on the table

29
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:22,890
right now on this little wee island of

30
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:25,319
ours is possible marijuana Bam and the

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,349
county's is hearing different opinions

32
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,789
right now Shango why don't we would you

33
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,429
need some finer points about what this

34
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,290
is sure sure I'll break it down so um

35
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,930
for this for the sake of clarity since

36
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,790
that's why you have you have me here

37
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,130
let's address the word damn right sure

38
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,659
because you know on the Facebook pages

39
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:44,519
people are saying we'll wait did varsa

40
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,640
really ask for a ban or do they just ask

41
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,618
for restricted zoning and and and that's

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,359
where that's where the rut is right

43
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:53,399
because as of right now and the reason

44
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,489
why there is no cannabis store on the

45
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,560
island today right is that the zoning is

46
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:02,609
already incredibly restricted on the

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,430
island the cannabis store would have to

48
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:08,008
be in a commercially zoned location okay

49
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,020
and then it also has to be a thousand

50
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,859
feet from any kind of licensed daycare

51
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,360
or school well because we've got a

52
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,390
downtown for that's pretty much the

53
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,710
whole downtown core yeah and then if you

54
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:21,559
look at the other parts of the island

55
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:24,320
you know Burton's not legal the docked

56
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,729
in stores too far Sal's a 2 and it's too

57
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,979
far south to say in business and it's

58
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,659
for sale not for rent the old portage

59
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:31,609
stores in bad shape and has most likely

60
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:33,650
reverted to residential zoning because

61
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,240
it's not used as commercial variants in

62
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,650
so many years kind of mocking and

63
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,700
there's nothing really appropriate in

64
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,330
your mingle MIT so that just means

65
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:43,280
downtown core and so you know in my role

66
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,440
as the founder of the cannabis Trade

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,909
Organization on the island vinia you

68
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,469
know when everybody was hot to trot for

69
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:51,199
getting their licenses and everything

70
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:53,209
you know I was approached by five or six

71
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,129
different groups to help them find a

72
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:57,020
location on the island yeah and so we

73
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,329
dug out the king county parcel viewer

74
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,500
and talked to landowners and and you

75
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,480
know worked out all the numbers and

76
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,569
realized that there's really only about

77
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,369
four locations on the island that could

78
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:10,250
actually even have a recreational store

79
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,230
and those are already occupied by

80
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,449
longtime bachelor on businesses yes so

81
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:16,699
in essence even if someone were to have

82
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:20,149
a license there's not really a location

83
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:22,009
today to put it okay and so we are left

84
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,900
with scratching our heads and going how

85
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:26,329
can we how are we going to do this

86
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,219
exactly and so the challenge with the

87
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,049
varsity posle was that they want to they

88
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:32,120
want to make it even more restrictive so

89
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:34,909
that there couldn't be a store here in

90
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,509
the downtown area if a location were to

91
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:40,969
arise and and and so that becomes a band

92
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:43,729
right because then that makes it 00

93
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:45,709
possibility so so you know they

94
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:47,840
certainly don't call it a ban and and

95
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,099
I've spoken with the vice president of

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,140
varsa this morning we had a nice

97
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:53,479
hour-long conversation and that was not

98
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:57,529
their intention right no they mostly

99
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:59,329
just want to you know keep cannabis out

100
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,599
of the hands of children which I support

101
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,340
that and and they feel that you know you

102
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,079
kind of have to be close to zero

103
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,659
tolerance so that we don't set a poor

104
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,310
example for children and that that we

105
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:13,400
have some difference of opinion on

106
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,728
tolerance because you know my role is as

107
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,250
a patient advocate and and for me I talk

108
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:21,709
to and work with patients on Vashon who

109
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:24,230
get relief every day from Canada's from

110
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,120
their Parkinson's or they're using it to

111
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,980
cure their cancer or they're using it

112
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,959
for their arthritis or they use it

113
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,280
topically for eczema or you know all of

114
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:33,229
these different people they come to me

115
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,239
and we talked and then i recommend for

116
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,480
them products in that they can get over

117
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:42,139
town and say I can't a West Seattle

118
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,530
which is a kind of us an ally of ours I

119
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:48,409
guess I'd say and and and and send them

120
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:50,329
on their way and and it is uniformly

121
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,280
inconvenient for them to go over town

122
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:55,490
and some of the patients you know

123
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:57,109
they're being sick it's expensive and a

124
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,030
lot of these folks they don't have a car

125
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,040
it's hard for them to get over town and

126
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:04,189
it would be so much more convenient if

127
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,770
we had a location on the island where

128
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:08,629
adults could get adult use cannabis for

129
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:10,189
their own enjoyment and you know anxiety

130
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:12,319
relief and just to have a good time and

131
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:14,870
patience could get patient-centric

132
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:19,189
products that they can use to get relief

133
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:23,090
and unfortunately the the VAR suppose

134
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:25,430
ille would take it would just allow that

135
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:27,979
right it was just completely gone and I

136
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:32,360
do encourage listeners to check out

137
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:34,790
varsa network o RG /a own to see their

138
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,560
position it's just in fairness and

139
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,819
transparency it's a good idea to see

140
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,360
what they're talking about the main

141
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:44,959
issues really if you boil it down their

142
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,990
position is that having retailers here

143
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:51,259
in the commercial zone would would send

144
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,269
a message of access and also community

145
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:55,849
talk tolerance and they don't want to

146
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:57,949
set that precedent for kids that's

147
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:01,220
really what it boils down to in essence

148
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:03,979
is just just access intolerance and if

149
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:07,040
you've ever always because I am a parent

150
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,840
of now 18 and 20 year olds but at the

151
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,490
time coming up through school I was not

152
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,189
parent who always got the community

153
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,620
attitudes survey right and I would fill

154
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:17,629
it out and with great interest I would

155
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,310
be short in that web site where the

156
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:21,199
findings I want to see I want to see I

157
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,240
didn't know we see them which is really

158
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,709
annoying cuz i have for your blood sweat

159
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,199
and tears and 10 pages that you know

160
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:29,029
into clicking on all these things and i

161
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,269
want to know I want to know how we roll

162
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:33,739
what is our island sentiment really and

163
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:35,509
even then there's little nuggets on the

164
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,870
website it would be really good to see

165
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:39,610
the entire thing

166
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,290
yeah yeah it certainly would be and you

167
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,270
know one of the interesting aspects

168
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,400
about it is that you know when when I

169
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:47,620
was speaking with them this morning I

170
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:50,679
was pointing out that you know if their

171
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,110
goal is truly to keep cannabis out of

172
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,870
the hands of children the best thing to

173
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,270
do would be actually to support a retail

174
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,730
store on the island because there's no

175
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:03,490
chance that kids are going to go in and

176
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,930
purchase cannabis at a store because

177
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,210
every single canister the store in the

178
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:10,420
state is on pins and needles just trying

179
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:12,009
to keep their license in fact in the

180
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,069
last study in Washington showed that

181
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,300
cannabis stores were ninety-four percent

182
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:18,189
compliant last year and that's ten

183
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,819
percent better than liquor stores were

184
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:24,519
and as we saw when we had Kevin burgundy

185
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:26,670
aerosol dispenser on Islands the the

186
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:29,409
amount of gray market growers

187
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,210
drastically decreased because people

188
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,700
like to be able to go to one location

189
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:36,489
where they can get their same strain of

190
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:38,500
preference for or their medicine in a

191
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,759
repeatable fashion and anybody who's

192
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,410
ever you know gone to buy pot from

193
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,730
somebody you know this is a different

194
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,650
strain every time I mean you have to

195
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,210
meet them on their schedule and it's you

196
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:49,209
know it's not as convenient as a retail

197
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:51,549
location and so the the studies that

198
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:54,310
have been done in both Washington and

199
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:58,060
Colorado show very clearly that when you

200
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,250
create a retail store youth access goes

201
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,350
down because it's sub-plan it's a good

202
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,240
part of the gray market and as an

203
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,180
Islander I mean everybody knows

204
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,340
everybody and you see it kind of walking

205
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,590
past the shop you're gonna know and it's

206
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:13,060
gonna be like somebody on the other side

207
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:14,739
of the islands are going to know you

208
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,110
know quickly yeah those things get

209
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,840
around here really so you can go tiptoe

210
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:22,600
and be stealth there's no hiding so I

211
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,579
like that idea because I mean you're

212
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,129
either out there and it's legal or it's

213
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:29,409
not and it does take kind of that that

214
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:31,420
gray area straight away and I love that

215
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,490
one of the interesting aspects of this

216
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:37,659
though is that while I thought it was

217
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:39,850
important to to alert our community to

218
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:41,559
varsus policy and how they were trying

219
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:44,470
to influence the zoning through the

220
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:46,989
community plan there really isn't there

221
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,680
never really was any likelihood that the

222
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,778
VAR suppl and was going to get adopted

223
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:53,059
I mean you know it's important for

224
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:56,269
people to participate in their democracy

225
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:59,899
and email you know Bradley Clark at King

226
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:01,909
County to to to voice their opinion but

227
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:05,208
King County was very clear that they do

228
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:07,338
not want to make a zoning cut out on

229
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:09,799
Vashon it's the same thing that happened

230
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,930
when editor wanted to move into k2 they

231
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,120
were very clear that they didn't want to

232
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:16,370
change the zoning for EDD appear to make

233
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,649
it unlike everywhere else in the county

234
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:22,580
similarly except now it's on the flip is

235
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:24,919
is you know our good friend councilman

236
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,540
joe McDermott he was very clear leg

237
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:29,149
listen we're not going to make a cut out

238
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:31,069
for Vashon Island just to make it more

239
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:33,708
restrictive than the rest of King County

240
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,980
and as we've been making the community

241
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:40,239
plan no version of it had an increased

242
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:43,850
restriction that being said as a

243
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,649
passionate patient advocate I needed to

244
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,420
make sure that you know we died of the

245
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:50,480
i's and cross the t's and people wait in

246
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:53,539
because you know a of concerned parents

247
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,810
can do a lot of damage sometimes hahaha

248
00:09:53,539 --> 00:10:00,139
so I'm that parent that had weed tests

249
00:09:56,809 --> 00:10:03,919
in my house because guess what they work

250
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:05,539
they totally work and that I think is

251
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,990
one of the best ways that you can nip

252
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:10,969
things in the bud kind of 100 is not

253
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,399
intended but they slip out I'm a

254
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,200
copywriter and you know I Harold that

255
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:16,639
right because you know even though some

256
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,660
people might think that giving your kids

257
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:22,429
a UA is invasive you are doing

258
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:25,100
responsible parenting in your home you

259
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:27,049
know the that kind of instruction should

260
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,709
come from the parent in the home and it

261
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:33,769
should not be something that should be a

262
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:35,479
island-wide regulatory issue correct

263
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:38,179
correct I think there's a lot to be said

264
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,730
for just starting at home and here's the

265
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:43,219
thing complete disclosure has there been

266
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:46,278
weeding my house absolutely do I have a

267
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,050
neurologist absolutely chief neurology

268
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,399
at Swedish is the first person that says

269
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:51,319
let's write this into your medical plan

270
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,078
if gabapentin isn't working for you I

271
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,829
have chronic my lightest I was looked at

272
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:59,888
in 2009 for probable MS and i still have

273
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:01,868
lesions on my spinal cord and it causes

274
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:05,048
whole lot of chaos I live with it every

275
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:07,059
day but did I have weed in my house have

276
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:08,619
I absolutely have I had some really

277
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:12,009
honest conversations with my children

278
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:14,980
had to yeah when and similarly you know

279
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:16,568
when I moved to the island you know the

280
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,369
reason why I finally made the jump I had

281
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:20,528
been coming here for years to visit and

282
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:22,209
volunteer on the organic food farms but

283
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:24,249
I finally made the jump after my brain

284
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,868
injury I had a traumatic brain injury

285
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:27,609
from a dual concussion and my

286
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:29,259
neurologist as well he's all like I

287
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:31,989
really think that medical marijuana

288
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:34,720
would be good for you and so I looked

289
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:37,509
into it and and you know it helped me

290
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,548
with my migraines and and it helped me I

291
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:40,629
don't know reset my neural net you know

292
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:42,338
one of the things that a lot of people

293
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:45,938
don't understand about medical marijuana

294
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:47,790
is you know it is not a bunch of people

295
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:50,588
smoke and joints I mean certainly

296
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:52,719
smoking is the appropriate medicine for

297
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,730
a lot of people no doubt but the vast

298
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,918
majority of them are going to be looking

299
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,980
for something to take orally you know

300
00:11:56,918 --> 00:12:01,119
like us like a tincture and sometimes

301
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,548
inedible and there's so many different

302
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:06,399
ways that you can take medical cannabis

303
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:09,338
it's not it's not no it's not just for

304
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,639
stoners anymore right honestly it didn't

305
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:14,339
used to be either now the cannabis was

306
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,829
seventy percent of the pharmacopoeia

307
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:20,169
before it was prohibited and you know we

308
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:21,789
had used it as a society for thousands

309
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:23,649
of years and then it became politically

310
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:25,748
unpopular and here we are today and here

311
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:28,178
we are today let's get really

312
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:29,918
politically unpopular and play a song by

313
00:12:28,178 --> 00:12:38,438
black uhuru sinsemilla we'll be back

314
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:41,078
right on black o mu stalk of sensimilla

315
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:44,168
and depending on where you look on

316
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:49,448
itunes you'll see it since Amelia since

317
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:51,489
Amina since Amelia sinsemilla you take

318
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:53,558
your pics here's a fun factoid do you

319
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:54,999
want to know what that is it's not as

320
00:12:53,558 --> 00:12:57,129
important as it used to be but you know

321
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:58,689
in the in the 70s and stuff when

322
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:01,149
cannabis was coming from the tropic

323
00:12:58,688 --> 00:13:02,798
areas they were growing it in these huge

324
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:04,989
fields and they didn't separate the boys

325
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:07,088
from the girls and so the girls would

326
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:08,199
get pollinated and they would start to

327
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:10,029
grow seeds and then they would just

328
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:12,128
harvest those and ship I'm here to the

329
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:12,710
United States well then it became the

330
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:14,870
Super

331
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,430
premium cannabis that they would go

332
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,129
through and when they started showing

333
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:21,679
sex they would pull out all the boys so

334
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:24,980
that the females would not spend their

335
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:27,289
plant energy making seeds and so they

336
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,060
started shipping seedless marijuana to

337
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:31,250
the United States and that blew

338
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:33,349
everybody away so that was the thing but

339
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:36,110
now as the US has developed its own

340
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:40,310
industry endure during prohibition and

341
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:42,500
now outdoor as well no seeds is kind of

342
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:44,059
an assumption it's like that's the given

343
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,519
yeah that's the standard and seeds have

344
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:47,659
to be sent out yeah that's true and

345
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,360
they're hard to find good ones sometimes

346
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:51,649
a good seat is hard to find you know

347
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,750
let's go back to what we were talking

348
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:56,209
about a little while ago the

349
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,480
quote-unquote marijuana ban on Vashon

350
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:02,360

351
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,370

388
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,940
I would love to hear about what you're

389
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:40,079
up to these days well I think you're

390
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,550
specifically talking about the

391
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,350
Kickstarter because you know Ivan I

392
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:45,629
travel the country now and I do know

393
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,149
keynote addresses at canvas conventions

394
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:51,450
and and do consulting for new startups

395
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:53,970
and mostly I teach medical care

396
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,009
providers both both licensed doctors and

397
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,500
naturopaths how to use cannabis in the

398
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:03,529
clinic but specifically this week on

399
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:05,850
monday i launched a media campaign

400
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,919
connected with a kickstarter and the

401
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:11,639
idea behind it is that it's far too

402
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:14,039
common that visitors come into a home

403
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,629
that have got cannabis edibles in them

404
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,399
and maybe they're in the fridge maybe

405
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:19,139
they're in a you know in a pantry or

406
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,600
something but they're unlabeled and so

407
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:23,519
the babysitter or the grandma you know

408
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,779
looks at the treats are like those look

409
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,370
like good treats I would like to eat

410
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:30,179
that brownie or that bag of gummy bears

411
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:32,190
or whatever it is and so and so they go

412
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:33,779
ahead and eat them and it is until after

413
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,720
the fact when they're uncomfortably

414
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:38,879
medicated that that they realize that

415
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,800
they that they were that they're getting

416
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:46,759
high and so what's the I pulled together

417
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:49,620
you know nearly a hundred so far of the

418
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:53,879
top cannabis companies in the country

419
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,620
who wanted to support you know labeling

420
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,539
in the home and we started this

421
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,240
Kickstarter which is simply is just

422
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:02,129
providing stickers to people to label

423
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,440
their container that they keep their

424
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:05,578
edibles in in their home and you know a

425
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,980
lot of people say well aren't there

426
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:10,049
already warning stickers on the on the

427
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,970
canvas packages well sure that's true

428
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:13,799
but you know people ignore them people

429
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,690
take that take the edibles out of it

430
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,549
people make brownies at their own home

431
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:20,220
the point is is that we want to start a

432
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:22,740
new habit in the scene we want to make

433
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,660
it a new assumption that if you have

434
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,670
cannabis edibles in your home you have

435
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,250
them in a container that is labeled from

436
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,050
the outside so that we decrease the

437
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,789
likelihood that visitors to our home

438
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:35,039
like babe users will accidentally be

439
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:37,259
medicated because it's just nobody wins

440
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,759
when somebody gets accidentally

441
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:39,420
medicaid's especially if they get over

442
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:42,119
medicated

443
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,950
really unpleasant if somebody if anybody

444
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:46,829
wants to look into it you can check out

445
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,569
that Kickstarter there's a instead of

446
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:53,699
giving it a very long Kickstarter link

447
00:17:48,569 --> 00:18:01,950
you can just go to my website at WWF

448

and and and forward you to the page and

451
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,900

know stickers for your home for as

453
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,130
little as five bucks and you know if you

454
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:16,139
if you are as you manage a you know a

455
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,120
parent organization on the island there

456
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,100
are larger packages for you in case you

457
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:22,769
want to get them and have them available

458
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:25,500
for your members it's just a way for the

459
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:28,559
cannabis industry businesses cannabis

460
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:32,039
enthusiasts and patients to all work

461
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,480
together to address this issue that is

462
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,549
becoming more common because simply

463
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,470
there's more cannabis and more homes now

464
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:40,230
than at any point since Prohibition and

465
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,819
it's something that we can we can

466
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,079
decrease the likelihood odd so we are I

467
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:45,089
have a feeling you're going to get

468
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,789
support on both sides of the fence where

469
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:49,619
this is concerned I totally agree guy

470
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:51,359
obviously people who are cannabis

471
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:53,129
positive they want to keep their

472
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,049
grandmas and babysitters from accident

473
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,790
going dose but but also you know

474
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:59,250
concerned parent types or folks that are

475
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:01,589
more concerned about cannabis at all

476
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,710
they're supporting it as well actually

477
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:06,389
we just launched on Monday and so we're

478
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,950
only four days in we're only we're

479
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,630
already twenty five percent of the way

480
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,850
to our goal because the supports been

481
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,930
pretty heavy-duty this is a great time

482
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,789
to let you know that the views and

483
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:17,420
opinions expressed on this program are

484
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:19,889
not necessarily those of the board staff

485
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:22,200
underwriters or donors a voice of a jean

486
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:24,420
and as an organization vov does not take

487
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,819
political positions we do support our

488
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,110
show host like me and their guests in

489
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:29,549
expressing their views as long as

490
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:31,740
they're not obscene or hate mongering

491
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:33,389

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,579
things related to marijuana first we

516
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:44,959
started with vashon we started a little

517
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:47,579
bit into what chango is doing between

518
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,850
educating the educators basically and

519
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:52,528
and being a keynote everywhere and if

520
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:55,829
you go look at his website under events

521
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:58,200
the man is prolific he's everywhere it's

522
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:59,638
crazy I don't know when you're here like

523
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,990

524
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:02,699
time I say oh my God he's actually only

525
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,288
11 well luckily I mean I try to leave

526
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,509
the island as little as possible because

527
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:09,148
that's why I moved here yeah get out of

528
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:10,649
the city I tend to travel to speak off

529
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:12,449
the island about twice a month or so I

530
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:14,008
try to not do it more than that but then

531
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,990
you know you add a zinnia meeting like

532
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:18,419
actually this is a good point i should

533
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,579
plug the upcoming vimeo meeting so on

534
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,860
may 18th it's a thursday night at the

535
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:26,220
Grange Hall which is located in the

536
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:29,158
north end ferry dock parking lot at 7pm

537
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,899
we are having a guest speaker up from

538
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,929
Portland it's going to be a great fellow

539
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:36,918
by the name of Ben casa de and the topic

540
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:39,149
is all about terpenes and cannabis

541
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:41,909
aromatherapy what a lot of people don't

542
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:45,138
realize is you know they know about THC

543
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:47,580
and CBD as two components of cannabis

544
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:50,219
THC being the part that makes you feel

545
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:53,189
high and cvd the part that replenishes

546
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,079
your endocannabinoid system but they

547
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,909
don't realize that the smell of the

548
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,519
plant is actually incredibly healing as

549
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:02,250
well for you and so Ben's going to be

550
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,259
coming up and speaking to to everybody

551
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,410
who shows up

552
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:09,329
about how terpenes affect your body how

553
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:12,300
to use terpenes in your everyday life

554
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:13,889
even without cannabis and to help people

555
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,759
kind of choose the terpenes that they

556
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,810
might want when shopping for Canada's

557
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:21,089
awesome yeah it's going to be a great I

558
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:23,759
ask a question sure a few questions

559
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:28,439
what's the scoop these days on growing

560
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:31,019
your own sure motto so the overarching

561
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,299
response is that it is illegal to grow

562
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:35,639
your own cannabis in Washington period

563
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:37,769
and that's unfortunate because you know

564
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,530
most of the other states they allow

565
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:43,289
every resident to grow six plants but

566
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:46,609
here in Washington we did not do that

567
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:50,269
and so for you to be able to legally

568
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:53,189
grow at your home you need to have a an

569
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:56,190
authorization from your medical

570
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:58,380
authorization from your doctor and so if

571
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:01,410
you just have that authorization you're

572
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,290
allowed to grow for plants now if you

573
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:06,840
join the state's registry of patients

574
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:09,059
that for plants jumps up to six plants

575
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:12,359
okay and then there's a place at the

576
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:14,429
bottom of the authorization where you

577
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:17,729
can your doctor can write in that you

578
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:20,519
can actually have up to 15 plans if you

579
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,559
show need for it Wow but then you also

580
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:24,930
have to be on the registry and being on

581
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,940
the registry means that you know they

582
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:29,039
can come and check out your grow at your

583
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,870
home if they want yeah which I don't

584
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,309
know a lot of people who want to give

585
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:35,759
out that kind of right you're injured

586
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:37,710
danger yes so the registry has not been

587
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,259
very successful with the state so far

588
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,759
and so to repeat its for plants if you

589
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:44,160
have a medical authorization that goes

590
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,559
to six if you join the registry up to 15

591
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,529
with it written on your authorization

592
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:52,710
but but you know honestly the

593
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:54,690
enforcement of individual growing is so

594
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,000
low that what we have found on the

595
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,920
island is that you know the traditional

596
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,200
what people think of as black market

597
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,450
growers that were so prevalent on Vashon

598
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,190
in the 80s and 90s you know they have

599
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,130
just decreased and decreased because

600
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:11,549
first the medical industry was there and

601
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:14,460
there were there were shops to go to

602
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:16,799
which decrease the number of black

603
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:19,559
market growers and now that is also

604
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,029
and with recreational to a certain

605
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,099
degree the prices are still relatively

606
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:25,200
high in recreational so so you know

607
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:29,219
there still is price competition there

608
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,230
but um but the rise of growing has been

609
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,309
just individual people you know you know

610
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:37,349
retired professors you know parents in a

611
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:40,230
family where either they or their

612
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:41,730
children have got a medical need folks

613
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,750
who just like to get high and they

614
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,490
believe that they should have the right

615
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,140
so you know people get their hands on

616
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,759
seeds and clones you know one way or

617
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,710
another and then they just you know they

618
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,900
grow a handful plans on their back porch

619
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:55,650
just for themselves and that actually

620
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:58,080
has become the highest growing if you

621
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,910
will segment of the growing population

622
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,519
on the island it's a lot less growing

623
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,980
for business anymore and a lot more

624
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:09,869
people just growing just like they do

625
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:12,990
their tomato plants it's a DIY MJ very

626
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:15,569
cool I mean it's it's so for for plants

627
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,549
in the Pacific Northwest any idea what

628
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:20,069
that means in terms of actual usable

629
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:21,990
marijuana well goodness you know the

630
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:24,629
short answer I would say is no because

631
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:27,180
there's very much very very in the yield

632
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,100
of the plant based on the strain and how

633
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,350
well you tend to you know in the kinds

634
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:33,629
of nutrients you give you an error yeah

635
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:35,279
exactly did you think you can you know

636
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,380
you can have a plant that does poorly

637
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,240
and you get an ounce or less over off of

638
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,490
it but that you know you could also grow

639
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,779
a huge plant and get four ounces off it

640
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,950
and feel like a real winner you know

641
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:48,869
loosely when people push me I say you

642
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:52,140
know if you do your job right you know

643
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:53,250
pencil Alex 42 ounces and and when you

644
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,220
do better than that you can pat yourself

645
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:58,200
on the back yeah okay but honestly most

646
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,720
people they just they grow it because

647
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,019
you know what they say they say cannabis

648
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,339
is the gateway to horticulture because

649
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:07,410
people who have never really kept a

650
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:09,629
garden before once they get into

651
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,040
relationship with a cannabis plant and

652
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,930
they and they have that connection with

653
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,619
nature and there they got their hands in

654
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:18,240
the soil and the I don't know if it's

655
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:20,459
called husbandry for plants but there

656
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,309
but with the taking care of another life

657
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:26,579
charm series a very intimate and once

658
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:28,079
you do that suddenly you have achieved

659
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:30,178
changed your relationship with all

660
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,069
plants and so I

661
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:35,548
I see that you know catch on all the

662
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:38,668
time if that works that's a good thing

663
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:40,558
what I mean is an anti-anxiety to grow a

664
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:42,990
plant just adjusters growing in itself

665
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,579
yes and they're done you can either you

666
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,308
know make medicine out of it or a

667
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:49,048
teacher or edibles or just toke it and

668
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:51,240
one way or another it's probably

669

increasing your quality of life they're

670
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,778
actually studies not about growing

671
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,759
marijuana but just having your hands in

672
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:59,069
the dirt it's very cathartic and same

673
