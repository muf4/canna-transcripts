2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,599
it's odd when you get to the point in

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,638
cannabis growing where you realize that

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,888
the best support you can give to a plant

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,559
is simply to create the best soil

6
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:19,320
possible and not to feed the plant at

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,570
all being brought up the way we have to

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,089
try and force feed the plant nitrogen

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,429
potassium and phosphorus the idea that

10
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:29,099
it is our job to feed the soil and then

11
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:30,660
the soil feeds the plant breaks nearly

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,480
all of the traditional rules around

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,340
growing cannabis during Prohibition the

14
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,259
last 60 years of growing cannabis has

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,350
been susceptible to the same pressures

16
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:42,359
as regular food agriculture the idea

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,969
that dumping chemicals on our food would

18
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:48,269
produce more healthier food was a bust

19
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,520
and now according to the UN a future of

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,890
thousands and thousands of smaller food

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,739
farms growing organically as a rising as

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,590
the new best standard the same goes for

23
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,269
cannabis as cannabis cultivation moves

24
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,930
out of the basement and into greenhouses

25
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,118
the more we coax natural systems instead

26
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:07,950
of trying to replace them the more

27
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,590
success we are having producing healthy

28
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,829
cannabis with great terpene profiles and

29
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,840
exceptional yields in the end the more

30
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,359
we can truly emulate the earth and our

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,969
cultivation systems the more success we

32
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,618
will have if you want to learn more

33

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,530
host Shango lows today my guest is

55
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:07,289
geologist and living soil expert

56
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,989
Leighton Morrison Lane has been a

57
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,939
lifelong enthusiasts of both aquaponics

58
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,590
and living soil his obsession with

59
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,750
biosphere 2

60
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,150
led him to set up an aquaculture system

61
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,280
at the Rodale Institute Layton worked

62
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,650
with world-renowned soil biologist dr.

63
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,780
Elaine Ingham blending his aquaculture

64
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,300
byproducts with traditional compost and

65
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,310
worm castings to prove that natural

66
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,799
inputs could effectively replace

67
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,420
synthetics and cultivation Lane

68
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:35,640
currently is founder of Kingdom

69
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,798
aquaponics and invented their line of

70
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,079
living compost and compost tea products

71
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:41,640
Layton is a sought-after public speaker

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,340
and co-founder of the series of

73
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,768
traveling science organic regenerative

74
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,848
cannabis cultivation conferences today

75
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,829
we're going to talk about building your

76
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:53,939
soil to match the Earth's systems

77
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:55,739
welcome to the show Layton J it's great

78
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:57,659
to be here Shango awesome brother so

79
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,370
let's get right into it you know one of

80
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,409
the reasons I wanted to have you on the

81
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,120
show is because when I heard you speak

82
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:07,590
at the regenerative conference in

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:11,069
Michigan last fall you know you have got

84
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,289
a view of soil unlike anybody else that

85
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:15,328
I have met teaching about soil because

86
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:17,759
you know you have a lot to say about how

87
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:19,680
we build our pots for cannabis and how

88
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,689
you know we work with the soil in our

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,230
yards for growing but you've got this

90
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:27,509
like like long geologists view of soil

91
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:28,949
and how it came to being and I think

92
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:31,318
that those of us who are all really

93
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:32,268
getting into living soil in the

94
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,129
rhizosphere

95
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:38,759
would enjoy that perspective and so so

96
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:40,949
let's start there the soil that we use

97
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,019
to grow cannabis has been around for

98
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:44,189
thousands of years and it's moved around

99
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,810
earth in different ways

100
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:49,318
but we all kind of take it for granted

101
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:53,699
so so would you tell us the story of

102
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:56,039
soil and where the hell it came from be

103
00:03:53,699 --> 00:04:00,418
my pleasure my friend it's it's pretty

104
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:01,918
deep so in a situation like this I would

105
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,719
start by saying all right well let's

106
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,930
let's go back to how the planet was

107
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,719
formed and let's look back in time and

108
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:13,139
say you know this this planet was a ball

109
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:15,949
of dust and rock that basically was

110
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:19,139
floating in space with no atmosphere

111
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:22,529
there was no life here and slowly but

112
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,439
surely it cooled down a moon was formed

113
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:27,299
there's different theories about that

114
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:30,769
but then it formed gravity

115
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:35,840
and it's loaded spinning and so it began

116
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:40,560
to allow day and night and that was

117
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:44,429
probably the most important step and it

118
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,220
began to form an axis so you had cooled

119
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,670
or spots and warmer spots I was another

120
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,530
big piece of it so now we've got this

121
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,550
spinning globe floating around in space

122
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:59,250
around the Sun Suns providing heat and

123
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,620
cooling when the sun's not out so then

124
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:06,629
we have an atmosphere that begins to

125
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:10,709
happen and moisture begins to form and

126
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:13,769
therefore weather and bottom line is

127
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:16,469
that weather is what created the soil

128
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:18,209
now the life and how it got here that's

129
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,580
a little bit deeper but we're just gonna

130
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:26,269
stick with the soil yeah we know it's

131
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:30,740
its own o own show so I also oil is

132
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:34,560
formed through erosion and then

133
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,540
transportation so by erosion let's let's

134
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,660
start with ice ice is a great one

135
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,150
because it is unstoppable

136
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:48,870
it'll push through mountains it will

137
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:51,179
create streams rivers ravines and then

138
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,850
you take the Sun the Sun creates heat

139
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,410
well if you look at rock on mountains

140
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,720
you'll often see that there's all these

141
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,610
pebbles and boulders at the bottom of

142
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,919
the mountain that's because of that

143
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,009
heating and cooling so every time that

144
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,779
rock heats or cools their forms a little

145
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:08,550
fissure in it and then the water gets in

146
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:11,969
that little fissure and freezes and pops

147
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,040
off that chunk times out by a billion or

148
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,720
a trillion yeah and now you're starting

149
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,300
to wrap your head around the fact that

150
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,790
that rock can actually pulverize itself

151
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:26,189
down to a small enough particular that

152
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:28,140
it begins to build soil so I think the I

153
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:30,660
think the most important part for people

154
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,689
to understand is that during that

155
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,930
erosion process you're having many

156
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:40,579
different particulate sizes this is

157
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:44,548
where I disagree with soil science soil

158
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:47,489
classifies sand silt and clay because of

159
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:50,338
their particulate size not of their

160
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:53,578
content and to me that makes no sense if

161
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:56,848
I put clay in water it has a completely

162
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:59,278
different specific gravity and reaction

163
00:06:56,848 --> 00:07:01,949
in that water then if I throw sand in

164
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:03,988
there sand when we do what's called a

165
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:07,019
textural test which is basically taking

166
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:09,088
soil throwing it in a jar adding some

167
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,889
water leaving a little air and shaking

168
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:11,879
the hell out of it and then set it down

169
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,129
and walk away

170
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,989
and 36 hours you come back and it you'll

171
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,579
have perfect layers of what's in there

172
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:19,649
the organic matter will be floating on

173
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,569
the top the bottom layer will be sand

174
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:24,988
the second layer will be silt and the

175
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:26,519
last layer will be clay so if you do

176
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:29,068
this and you look at it you'll be like

177
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:31,468
wow that's really dirty water but when

178
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:33,989
you're done two days later the water is

179
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:36,389
clear and everything separated out so

180
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:39,478
there's an obvious specific gravity

181
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:42,209
difference there's an obvious chemical

182
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:44,488
makeup difference or molecular bond

183
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:46,860
difference to these things so so why is

184
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:48,718
soil science not saying well that's clay

185
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,229
because it holds it back down it charged

186
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:54,629
it has some nutritional properties to it

187
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:56,878
where the sand doesn't carry any

188
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:58,229
properties I mean if you take clay you

189
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,028
get it wet you squeeze it into a ball in

190
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,588
your hand it stays there if you get sand

191
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:03,658
wet and you squeeze it into a ball it

192
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:06,509
doesn't stay there or just you know

193
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:09,358
it'll fall apart again depending on what

194
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,399
how pure that is sand so they all have

195
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:13,978
these different properties to them but

196
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:17,428
we're classifying them all based on

197
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:18,868
particulate size so we got a lot of work

198
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:20,968
left to do my friend as far as that's

199
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:24,149
concerned so let me ask you this so I

200
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:27,389
love this image of the the earth being

201
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:30,449
this big rock with all of these jagged

202
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:32,459
edges that are mountains and that you

203
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,438
know moisture forms because the heating

204
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:38,818
and cooling and it gets in between these

205
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:41,278
crevasses and over you know epochs you

206
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:43,458
know it breaks down these mountains into

207
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,799
smaller and smaller pieces that become

208
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:49,359
what we're calling soil but but you know

209
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,759
the wet soil is made

210
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,850
of the you know the the silt and the

211
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:57,299
clay and the sand these different bits

212
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:00,190
did all of these originally start as

213
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:02,139
mountains why didn't the mountain break

214
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:04,329
down into all of the same thing

215
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:06,819
great question brother great question

216
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:09,969
alright so a glacier pushes through a

217
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,220
mountain and what comes out of the

218
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,980
bottom of the glacier mixed with the

219
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,500
water is clay clay platelets tiny tiny

220
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,820
little platelets and if you've ever

221
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,269
studied and looked at these they stack

222
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:24,940
up and when they look like little flying

223
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:26,500
saucers little disks and when they're

224
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,450
magnetically charged and they stack up

225
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,370
what happens is you get one flat one and

226
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,899
then one standing on an edge and then

227
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,480
another flat one lands on top of that

228
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,070
and another one stands up on his edge

229
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,100
that's good soil structure now in

230
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,470
compaction those all lay flat on top of

231
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,870
each other it is that a good enough

232
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,250
visual yeah I'm following it alright so

233
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,039
there's a there's an electric charge

234
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,690
involved with clay platelets there's no

235
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:55,000
electrical charge insult and there's no

236
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:59,199
electrical charge in sand sand is can be

237
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,698
quartz it can be pure mineral it can

238
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:06,399
also be calcium from from past coral

239
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:10,359
reefs which is pretty common with sand

240
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,589
and silt silt is just organic matter

241
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,470
broken all the way down

242
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:15,550
that's why silt comes from rivers and

243
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,820
from streams

244
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:21,309
I see so so even though the process is

245
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,278
the same the breaking down process of of

246
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:27,338
having moisture having it get frozen and

247
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:30,070
then broken down even that is the

248
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:34,149
process but we get these different

249
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:37,839
ingredients to soil because of what the

250
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:41,289
the mountain or the coral reef or the

251
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,390
the river is is made of so it's the same

252
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:45,219
process of breaking making small

253
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:48,519
particles but but they all come from

254
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,769
different part of the earth that was

255
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,990
originally cold and just spinning and

256
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:54,039
you missed one piece and there's a big

257
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:58,600
it was a big piece

258
00:10:54,039 --> 00:11:02,250
it's called biology ya rabbal dude I'm

259
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,980
sorry but life alright so we had a rock

260
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,919
but how do we end up here all right life

261
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,460
had to come here biology had to land

262
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,979
here had to start growing something and

263
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:16,410
plants and animals came from that the

264
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,850
plant says they broke down became the

265
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:21,689
silt hmm

266
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:25,080
so so clay and sand sand that it's not

267
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:27,810
coral based came from the mountain but

268
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:31,460
the silt in the organic matter and the

269
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:33,809
life-form created the coral and the silt

270
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,190
so it's complicated my friend that's

271
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:37,919
interesting too though because that

272
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:41,250
means that as more and more life spawned

273
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:43,079
on earth the soil content got richer and

274
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,440
richer and became kind of like a

275
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:52,740
geometric increase of ability to carry

276
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:55,560
life ah BAM spot-on my friend all right

277
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:59,039
so so we get to this point so you know

278
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:01,259
clearly as as life-forms were evolving

279
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:05,159
and you know we went through these

280
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:08,189
different glacial periods over like huge

281
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:11,879
huge amounts of time about how long ago

282
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:14,250
did we get to the earth and the soil

283
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:17,689
structure as we you know generally see

284
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,690
it today how long ago was that

285
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:25,799
I think the first or the theory behind

286
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:30,500
the first life on this planet that began

287
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:34,319
that process of breaking down or using

288
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:38,700
these ingredients to create biomass or

289
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,550
more life was when the Hydra came onto

290
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,200
the planet and now we had two individual

291
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:46,379
cells that had to communicate and this

292
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,180
gets into endocannabinoids systems so

293
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,730
that's another deep rabbit hole but

294
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:53,459
bottom line it was probably somewhere

295
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,800
around two-and-a-half million years ago

296
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,910
maybe three depending on who the

297
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:02,159
scientist is you're talking to but

298
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:04,230
that's what started the whole process so

299
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,480
we first had a single-cell organism and

300
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:10,980
we had a multi cell organism now we had

301
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:14,289
things in the water I believe the first

302
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:16,389
living thing on the surface

303
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:18,399
the earth as far as plants are concerned

304
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:20,169
was mushrooms which is really really

305
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,230
interesting because fungal kingdoms are

306
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:25,719
a whole nother world and so done those

307
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,550
mushrooms which grow very quickly as

308
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,519
most people know and fruit pretty

309
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:32,229
quickly started building that organic

310
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:35,019
matter first and then all of a sudden

311
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:38,379
plants started showing them and it

312
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:41,379
wasn't trees it was plants we probably

313
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:45,399
call them weeds but they were the very

314
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:48,278
beginning foundation to when this planet

315
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:50,889
became forested then there's another

316
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:52,778
really badass event that happened and we

317
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:55,299
don't know how it happened but grass

318
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:57,549
showed up on the planet and that was you

319
00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:00,338
know that was hundreds of millions of

320
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:02,979
years after trees had had pretty much

321
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:05,790
taken over the planet and that grass

322
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:09,129
shows up in the savannas in Africa and

323
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:11,049
the grass choked out trees I mean you

324
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:13,179
still see it to some degree today these

325
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:16,028
Meadows these rogue Meadows on mountains

326
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:17,769
if you're hiking and so there's all

327
00:14:16,028 --> 00:14:20,198
kinds of debate and and like well

328
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:21,970
where'd the grass come from and did it

329
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:25,359
come from space and it come on a comet

330
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,879
like like life did you know or was did

331
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,500
God just go hey you guys need this or

332
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,720
didn't aliens stop by and see the

333
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,708
friggin seed an area you know we don't

334
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,420
know but moving through succession boom

335
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:40,919
all of a sudden ah we have grass and

336
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:43,599
trees and that's when the real diversity

337
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:46,059
began as far as life is concerned on the

338
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,940
planet as a matter of fact the apes now

339
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:51,518
had to move from one patch of trees to

340
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,350
another as they ran out of food that

341
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,549
kind of forced them to walk on hind legs

342
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,259
so that they could see over the grass

343
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:59,438
and make sure there was a predator that

344
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:01,389
was gonna jump out need him so it's that

345
00:14:59,438 --> 00:15:04,088
with that that combination right there

346
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:07,000
was what I would consider when Earth

347
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:10,389
became more like the Garden of Eden that

348
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,448
that it was until man got crazy in the

349
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:15,310
industrial revolution and really started

350
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:16,688
to mess things up oh well that's a

351
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:19,088
beautiful transition because that's

352
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:21,909
where I'm going next as well so so now

353
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:24,830
that we've got an idea of how you know

354
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:26,269
nature formed you know a thumbnail of it

355
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,270
anyway with a lot of potential rabbit

356
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:31,699
holes to go down but but so then like

357
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:34,669
humans and agriculture show up right and

358
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:38,060
so and so I'm curious that you know did

359
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:40,610
did soil begin to especially change

360
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:43,189
faster after human agriculture showed up

361
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,470
or is our impact relatively small

362
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,990
compared to glaciers and such moving it

363
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:50,420
around alright well let's let's talk

364
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,180
about natural disaster let's talk about

365
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:54,949
earthquakes and volcanoes you know one

366
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:58,489
of the reasons the redwoods are where

367
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,600
they are is because of volcanic ash its

368
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,549
is so fertile

369
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,450
I mean you everybody's heard of azomite

370
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:07,279
I assume it's a wonderful product and I

371
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,650
want to bend your mind a little bit more

372
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,559
and say the reason that those redwoods

373
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:15,079
are concentrated on the Pacific was

374
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,629
because the volcanoes were there and the

375
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,720
wind was blowing from east to west not

376
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:23,870
west to east so that kind of located

377
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,990
them on that part now if the if the if

378
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:30,460
the ash had been blowing east you would

379
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,990
have much more redwood and diversity

380
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,269
going toward the east than you do now

381
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,370
you really don't I mean it's weird you

382
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:39,710
get those high mountain kind of plateaus

383
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,870
where there's a lot of grasslands but

384
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:44,420
you lose the trees as you drive from

385
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,120
Washington from west to east and this is

386
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:49,069
true pretty much you know everywhere

387
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,139
same thing happens in SoCal you know as

388
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:55,400
you go west you get into desert more

389
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:58,610
arid less fertile climates so then you

390
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:01,399
now add in the fact of continental drift

391
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,740
alright so we once just one big giant

392
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:07,629
continent that broke apart and created

393
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:11,539
these different multi climate 'add areas

394
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:15,640
so you know there there's there's a lot

395
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:18,769
more to starting to understand how those

396
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:22,009
soils really formed because I think it's

397
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:24,309
like 80% of all soils on this planet

398
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:26,269
were formed through transpiration

399
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:29,809
transportation in other words the air

400
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:31,400
picked up some dust and blew it one of

401
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:34,639
my favorite stories that I love to talk

402
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,560
about is in 2011 NASA did a study there

403
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,790
basically concluded that all of the

404
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,579
sandstorms in the city

405
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:42,319
era desert we're throwing so much dust

406
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:45,019
into the atmosphere and it was traveling

407
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:49,009
way way up and then it was blowing

408
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:53,059
across the ocean and then somehow coming

409
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:55,309
back down to provide phosphorous for the

410
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:57,799
Amazon rainforest some believe that it

411
00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:00,259
was particularly charged when it hit the

412
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:03,740
I forget what the atmosphere where Tesla

413
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:05,839
wanted to store all the electricity but

414
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,730
basically we have an outer atmosphere

415
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,339
where that's very magnetic and very

416
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:12,890
electrically charged some believe that

417
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,359
those particles got that high and all of

418
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,640
a sudden they started attaching to each

419
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,679
other until they formed small molecules

420
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,170
which now through gravity were forced to

421
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,390
drop to the surface of the earth others

422
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:25,940
say well now it's the moisture and the

423
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:30,800
clouds but you know it's it's deeper

424
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:32,570
than that so and just recently a new guy

425
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,049
grabbed that and ran with it and and

426
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:38,539
come to find out that it wasn't just

427
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:41,599
phosphorus it was fertilizer and that

428
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:44,480
fertilizer came from diatoms and I love

429
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:47,809
to talk about diatoms diatoms produce I

430
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,789
think it's close to 60% of all of the

431
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:51,289
oxygen on this planet it's not coming

432
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:53,539
from the rainforest the oxygen that's

433
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:56,180
growing down in the Amazon rainforest is

434
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:58,339
being used up down there in Brazil it's

435
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,450
not it's not getting up here the reason

436
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:01,519
we're breathing the reason we have

437
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,319
oxygen up here is because of diatoms in

438
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,259
the plants because obviously the plants

439
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:08,089
pull in co2 and they excrete oxygen but

440
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:09,589
the other part of that piece that no one

441
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:11,809
talks about is these little creatures

442
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:14,480
called diatoms we don't even know what I

443
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:16,339
tell them is a diet home you know people

444
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,069
wanted to throw it into the bacterial

445
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:22,279
Kingdom but it has a chloroplast in it

446
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:24,980
which is a tiny little solar array it

447
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:26,779
takes light and creates energy and

448
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,180
allows it to multiply cetera et cetera

449
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:30,950
and live and others want to throw in a

450
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,230
plant kingdom because hey it's got

451
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:35,210
chloroplasts well it doesn't fit into

452
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,880
either one and this is again where am i

453
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,490
bitching science is is that we're trying

454
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,440
to land on Mars but we don't understand

455
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:45,049
what the hell's going on here let's

456
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,450
figure it out alright Jesus Leonardo da

457
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:49,099
Vinci said it back in 1745

458
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,700
we know more about the movement of the

459
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:52,528
celestial bodies overhead

460
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:56,129
then we know about what's underfoot all

461
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:58,440
right why haven't we started to focus on

462
00:19:56,128 --> 00:20:00,418
this I mean we need water to drink we

463
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,558
got into the water cycle and how

464
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:05,788
critical soil is for the water cycle

465
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:07,259
this is this is one of those things

466
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,398
where I've always tell people you know

467
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:12,179
if you're really interested in this

468
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:15,089
stuff by the DVD Symphony for Symphony

469
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,830
of the soil it's 15 bucks it's an hour

470
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:20,009
and 20 minutes of your life and it will

471
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:21,509
pop your cork and in part of that video

472
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:23,759
they have an experiment that was

473
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:25,739
performed down at Rodale where they had

474
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,230
four bottles that they filled soil with

475
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:31,558
the one on the Left I believe was a pure

476
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:33,210
synthetic farming system and the one to

477
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:36,599
the far right I believe was a pure

478
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,889
organic soil system so then he takes 100

479
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,839
milliliters of water something like that

480
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:42,508
and he dumps in into these bottles

481
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,819
containing the soil and the first thing

482
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,139
you notice is on the synthetic one the

483
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:48,989
water comes out all muddy high

484
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:51,329
intrepidity dark and cloudy and there's

485
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:53,190
a lot of it the vast majority of that

486
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:55,589
water moved right through that soil into

487
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:58,460
the bottom of the jug and on the far

488
00:20:55,589 --> 00:21:00,449
right one which is a pure organic soil

489
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,249
the water that came out was

490
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,690
crystal-clear number one and number two

491
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:07,528
there was only a little bit of it so

492
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:10,830
that soil held the water so it also

493
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:14,128
cleaned the water and made it suitable

494
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:17,489
for drinking and so what if what is the

495
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:19,829
effect of all of the disturbing of soil

496
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:23,999
that we're doing right now and then

497
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:26,428
adding in synthetics is it recharging

498
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:29,220
the groundwater no it's destroying it

499
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:32,009
and worse yet we're pumping out of an

500
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,950
aquifer that took millions of years to

501
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:37,259
form and we're sucking out so much water

502
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:40,009
I think tucson arizona dropped by 60

503
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:43,528
feet the Midwest is dropped by 40 feet

504
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:45,628
once you drop in crush an aquifer it's

505
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:47,608
done it's not coming back

506
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:49,769
thanks for another million two million

507
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:52,949
years until the whole process starts

508
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:55,440
over again so we're not cleaning our

509
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,480
water through our soil we're draining it

510
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,798
out of an aquifer that we cannot fix as

511
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,169
a matter of fact a good friend of mine

512
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,460
dr. Kevin Fitzsimmons who works at the U

513
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:06,710
of A University of Arizona

514
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,960
what's called in to deal with the fact

515
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,480
that the aquifer was collapsing down in

516
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,720
Tucson and they were piping in water

517
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:18,829
from NorCal or South Southern California

518
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,750
in these giant canals and they were the

519
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:22,730
canals were getting clogged and they

520
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,920
needed to put fish in there to try to

521
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,298
chew up all this plant matter that's

522
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,230
growing in the canals cuz they're

523
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:32,829
running water through a desert and so he

524
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,940
was there to advise on how to get this

525
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:36,980
organic matter cleaned up out of the

526
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,950
river and he's introduced I believe they

527
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:42,500
were grass carp but as being a part of

528
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,990
this whole system he was exposed to this

529
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,900
water cycle and he found out that the

530
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:50,000
water company had decided to pump that

531
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:53,030
water that was coming from I think it's

532
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,279
the Colorado River one of them pump it

533
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:57,950
down into the aquifer should prevent the

534
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,319
aquifer from collapsing good idea right

535
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,440
yeah sounds like it let's lay a

536
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,599
placeholder alright just to hold it well

537
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,519
you know what it did it remineralized

538
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,589
now they introduced different pH

539
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,690
different minerals and all of the

540
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:14,058
infrastructure all the pipes that are

541
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:17,058
buried underground are now rotting and

542
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:18,918
sending up chunks of metals and minerals

543
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:21,019
in the water you pour a glass of water

544
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:23,690
down in Tucson air on Arizona and it's

545
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:25,460
black it's all filled with particles you

546
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:28,190
can't drink it they destroyed the

547
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,929
aquifer by trying to fix it this is what

548
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,380
man does he just makes a mess out of

549
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:36,440
everything so so back to soils and how

550
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:39,020
critical it is for life and how we're

551
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,808
ignoring it and and just pissing all

552
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:43,519
over it and not thinking ahead about

553
00:23:41,808 --> 00:23:46,039
like wait a minute what are we leaving

554
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,500
behind the good news is hey this planet

555
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:50,298
was a was a radioactive waste a million

556
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,950
years ago or excuse me a few billion

557
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:56,779
years ago and also no matter what we do

558
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,910
to it there's already been six

559
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:01,369
extinctions there'll be another one and

560
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:04,070
it'll come back just fine but in the

561
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:07,250
meantime if we want to move forward as a

562
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:09,678
species and not just wipe ourselves out

563
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:13,910
we better start thinking about soil

564
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:17,240
water and food and that all starts from

565
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,690
the soil right on so so so let's jump

566
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,579
ahead

567
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,830
little bit cuz I know I could listen to

568
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:23,689
you talk about this particular part for

569
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:25,369
hours but we don't have time for all of

570
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,850
that today so let's bring it back

571
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:31,609
towards the the specific point of

572
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:34,788
growing cannabis in these soils so let's

573
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:37,189
jump ahead to agriculture right and so

574
00:24:34,788 --> 00:24:40,220
to what kind of an impact did

575
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:43,220
agriculture have on the quality of the

576
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:47,509
soils in the United States versus how it

577
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:49,970
was prior to agriculture and give us the

578
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:50,599
smaller version of this epic tale all

579
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,409
right

580
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:56,178
the Dust Bowl real simple the people ask

581
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,519
me where is the most fertile soils on

582
00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:00,230
the planet and I say what do you think

583
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:02,298
and they say oh the rainforests look

584
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,419
look at how look how big it is and how

585
00:25:02,298 --> 00:25:08,869
much it grows I say no actually it's not

586
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:13,759
the most fertile soil on the planet is

587
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:15,469
actually a meadow is the prairies the

588
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:18,288
organic matter that's allowed to build

589
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:21,079
up is is insane it could be 20 30 feet

590
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:23,359
deep I've just rich organic matter

591
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:25,428
that's formed in layers so a dust storm

592
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:28,638
blows a little dust and then so you get

593
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:31,070
a layer of dust and then there's a heavy

594
00:25:28,638 --> 00:25:33,288
torrential downpour and this area washes

595
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:34,189
out creates mud nap that puts another

596
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:36,378
layer over it

597
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,298
and then the plants growing and dying

598
00:25:36,378 --> 00:25:40,038
growing and dying growing and dying so

599
00:25:38,298 --> 00:25:42,589
you have all of the nutrients you

600
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,750
possibly can imagine and so a man gets

601
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:47,000
in there and plows open a section it

602
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,648
goes woohoo look at how look at the corn

603
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,388
I grew look at the carrots I grew look

604
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:50,750
at the potatoes I grew look how amazing

605
00:25:50,388 --> 00:25:53,240
this is

606
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,980
and they keep growing in that same spot

607
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,259
and pretty soon they notice well the

608
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,899
plants aren't as big if the fruit isn't

609
00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:02,450
as good it's it's not it's not yielding

610
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:04,518
as much so they go plough open a new

611
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,429
section of the Prairie so what

612
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:11,149
agriculture does is strip the nutrients

613
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:14,750
and actually begin to cave in the soil

614
00:26:11,148 --> 00:26:16,849
create compaction and then plants won't

615
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:19,159
grow there anymore and we did it so hard

616
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:22,209
so bad that we created the dust bowls

617
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:25,340
and we're gonna do it again real soon so

618
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:29,558
how do you fix that how what is the

619
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:31,398
proper form of Agriculture polyculture

620
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:33,469
dragonfly earth medicine

621
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:35,678
I love those guys to death what they're

622
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:38,838
doing is showing people how to

623
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:42,139
continuously year after year produce

624
00:26:38,838 --> 00:26:46,249
amazing results from the same piece of

625
00:26:42,138 --> 00:26:47,028
land and I love Sir Edward what was his

626
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:50,479
name

627
00:26:47,028 --> 00:26:54,528
he was a guy from England I'm he talks

628
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:58,159
about early soil respect and how you

629
00:26:54,528 --> 00:27:00,019
need to leave 57 50 percent behind so if

630
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,759
you're gonna grow corn figure you take

631
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:04,308
50 percent of that the rest of that corn

632
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,899
you chop and drop and that's the

633
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:07,519
minerals and nutrients for next year

634
00:27:05,898 --> 00:27:09,168
season and if you don't do that if you

635
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,298
just keep taking and taking and taking

636
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:13,909
you've stripped all the nutrition

637
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:16,219
nutrients out of the soil and left a

638
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:17,899
dust bowl blind and that's essentially

639
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:19,820
at the heart of I mean we talk about

640
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:22,398
regenerative agriculture and especially

641
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:24,950
about regenerative cannabis agriculture

642
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,738
on this show a lot and like where you

643
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:32,960
have brought us up to this is the heart

644
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:34,999
of the whole game right here I am so so

645
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,319
before we go to our first commercial

646
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:38,179
there's one more thing I want to talk

647
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,928
about and it's a little bit of a non

648
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:43,879
sequitur but you know I want to talk

649
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:45,979
about peat moss so you know there there

650
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:48,648
are a lot of folks who teach organic

651
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:51,169
cannabis growing who for some reason

652
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:52,848
think that that we can use peat moss and

653
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,528
they recommend it and I've always

654
00:27:52,848 --> 00:27:57,348
believed that you know I've got bogs

655
00:27:54,528 --> 00:27:59,749
where I live here on Vashon Island and

656
00:27:57,348 --> 00:28:01,460
and they're very very sensitive and so

657
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:04,429
it's always been my belief that we

658
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:07,069
should not be using any peat moss

659
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:09,259
because they come from bogs that have

660
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:14,148
taken thousands of years to build and

661
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:17,690
it's not a it's not a regenerating

662
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:20,689
resource and so so what is what's the

663
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:23,239
real biologists take on peat moss like

664
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:25,580
is there is there an excuse to use this

665
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:27,259
throughout cannabis like we are or is

666
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,939
sure do we need to like grow up and

667
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:31,338
realize that this is not a resource we

668
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,080
should be using so we should not be

669
00:28:31,338 --> 00:28:33,950
fooling around with peat moss it's a

670
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:37,308
triple negative

671
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:41,298
Shango first of all the peat bogs are

672
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:43,819
water cleansing source second of all

673
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:45,139
they're a carbon sink and a really

674
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:48,048
really big carbon so

675
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:50,330
and third of all they're an ecosystem in

676
00:28:48,048 --> 00:28:52,250
their own self so you've destroyed an

677
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:55,069
Ekans system you've destroyed a water

678
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:57,589
cycle system and you've released a ton

679
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:59,450
of carbon into the atmosphere and we

680
00:28:57,589 --> 00:29:02,629
can't replace it in our lifetimes so

681
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:04,370
yeah the bogs in England have all been

682
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,590
shut down they've stopped all of it

683
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:08,419
they're not removing any more peat and

684
00:29:06,589 --> 00:29:10,428
everybody across the surface of the

685
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:13,090
earth should do the same thing now

686
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:17,660
interestingly enough I met a gentleman

687
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:20,269
montt Hadley years ago down at Rodale or

688
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:22,130
at through Rodale somehow and he was

689
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:25,129
creating this product called pittmoss

690
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:29,830
which I loved and it was basically

691
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:32,570
shredded newspaper as a vehicle for

692
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:34,548
explosive rope root growth for the

693
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:37,220
canvas industry for every every kind of

694
00:29:34,548 --> 00:29:40,429
you know potting you know the flower

695
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:43,370
industry started playing industry you

696
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:46,700
know he wanted to start reusing you know

697
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:50,029
closed-loop use newspapers and cardboard

698
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:53,150
grind it up and make this substrate that

699
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:55,490
would be ideal for growing cannabis well

700
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:57,679
unfortunately he got sharked tanked

701
00:29:55,490 --> 00:30:00,140
he got all kinds of investors and

702
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,100
they've taken it in other directions to

703
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,700
the point where now they're actually

704
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:07,099
making bedding for horses and other

705
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,630
animals which is great again it's a

706
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:09,439
closed-loop you're reusing systems

707
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,900
that's awesome

708
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,600
and I did some studies with them early

709
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:20,900
on with plant growth down at the Phipps

710
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:23,808
conservatory down in Pittsburgh

711
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,620
Pennsylvania and they were trying to

712
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:26,119
figure out how to be more to

713
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:27,529
regenerative in the greenhouse setting

714
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:29,329
because they have these beautiful

715
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:31,910
displays I mean they got trees and

716
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:34,339
bushes from all over the world in this

717
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:36,290
botanical garden and they wanted to be

718
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:38,569
more sustainable and but they needed to

719
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:41,119
grow these container plants fast because

720
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:44,089
every three months they change over the

721
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,829
whole system so and they were looking

722
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:47,449
for fast production they were looking

723
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:49,759
for an alternative to peat moss they

724
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:51,640
wanted to get into soil biology well

725
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:54,679
when I introduced us my soil biology

726
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,800
into their pittmoss my soil biology

727
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,850
basically did the same thing when you

728
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:02,240
introduce more

729
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:04,279
than 20% biochar the bacteria in the

730
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,579
biology says hey I don't need nothing

731
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,019
here

732
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:07,579
I'm all set I'm just gonna live on this

733
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:09,529
newspaper I'm not gonna work for you mr.

734
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:11,449
plant I got everything I need right here

735
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:13,430
and the same thing happens with biochar

736
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,110
the biology goes right to that biochar

737
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,190
it just sets up camp and it's not

738
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:17,750
interested in the root it's not

739
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,279
interested hanging out of the rouse fear

740
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,700
and helping the plant it's got

741
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:25,099
everything it needs so there's there's a

742
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,410
delicate balance to food finding a

743
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:29,509
solution to peat moss

744
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:31,580
I loved coconut coir I looked at doubt

745
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:34,400
for a while and then I started to see

746
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:37,929
how unregenerate of the the the

747
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:41,810
techniques were and cross-contamination

748
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:42,470
assaults packaging shipping it all over

749
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:45,740
the world

750
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:49,250
if that's not regenerative that's that's

751
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:52,940
no good so I think people have to start

752
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:56,509
building their own solution - peat moss

753
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:59,630
and absolutely stop buying it if you

754
00:31:56,509 --> 00:32:01,430
stop buying it now you'll slow down the

755
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,140
destruction you will not stop the

756
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:05,150
destruction because they'll keep making

757
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,590
this stuff and stacking it up as high as

758
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,900
they can figuring that sooner or later

759
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:12,230
someone's gonna come and buy it so to

760
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:14,660
stop that is gonna take years so if we

761
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,269
don't stop now we're screwed and you've

762
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:20,750
heard me I say this repeatedly I praying

763
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:23,539
to God that we make such an impact in

764
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:25,940
the regenerative cannabis world that the

765
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:28,250
rest of Ag across the planet starts

766
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,170
going wait a minute why are we using

767
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:33,410
synthetics only to have to use

768
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:36,769
pesticides why are we looking at plant

769
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:39,769
health and regenerative focus toward not

770
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:41,059
destroying the planet but but enhancing

771
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:44,240
it making it better for the next

772
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:46,339
generation chopping and droppin 50% so

773
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,440
that I don't destroy the soil you know

774
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:50,720
these kinds of practices but oh please

775
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,029
stop using peat moss your your just your

776
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,950
triple killing the planet by using that

777
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:57,980
stuff right on man thank you for making

778
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,450
it very painfully clear so so let's go

779
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,069
ahead and take our first short break and

780
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,259
be right back you are listening to

781
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:07,189
shaping fire and my guest today is soil

782
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:09,049
biologist Leighton Morrison living soil

783
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:11,210
and regenerative cannabis agriculture

784
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:12,649
are surging in popularity and to

785
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,870
implement these biological

786
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:17,000
solutions real science education is

787
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:18,709
vital if you are interested in all

788
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,269
things probiotic growing you will

789
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:22,850
probably want to attend this year's

790
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:25,279

Morrison of Kingdom aquaponics have

795
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:34,340
lined up an incredible array of

796
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:36,259
educators with all new content for the

797
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:38,959
traveling event they're calling it

798
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:39,289
version 2.0 going deeper down the rabbit

799
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,329
hole

800
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:43,819

and many other thought leaders rotating

808
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,500
in and out four different cities so

809
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,410
consult the website to knows who

810
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,910
specifically is coming for each location

811
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,740
there will be a breeding panel a QA

812
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,570
panel with the entire teaching staff and

813
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:11,630
on Saturday night there will be a bubble

814
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,940
hash discussion as well Joshua has built

815
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,890
in significant informal time for you

816
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,990
with the teachers the teaching staff is

817
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:20,299
just as excited to work with you as you

818
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:22,459
are about attending there is also no

819

advertising during the event the only

820
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,690
vendor booths are for cannabis seed

821
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,489
breeders your tuition is what's paying

responsible for everything your company

861
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,769
does you've got so many responsibilities

862
00:35:56,909 --> 00:36:00,420
every single day that often you just

863
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:02,239
don't have the time to really dig into

864
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,200
your marketing as deeply as you'd like

865
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,879
you know there's more that you could do

866

to reach out to new customers and

867
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,940
encourage loyalty and the customers you

868
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:10,559
already have but you certainly don't

869
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,179
have the time for it and you're not

870
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,400
ready to hire somebody full-time for

871
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:17,789

00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:12,989
moon time medicinals calm Kirsten and

898
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:15,029
her team put together a whole brand

899
00:37:12,989 --> 00:37:17,129
package for them built their website and

900
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,720
wrote their sales materials no doubt

901
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,340
this is a paid commercial spot but that

902
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,529
does not mean they bought my opinion

903
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,120
I've worked with blunt branding on five

904
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,980
projects now for various of their

905
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,630
clients and every single time they have

906
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,820
done more than they have promised and

907
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,950
over delivered on results I love how

908
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,690
they generate new revenue and focus on

909
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:36,750
that as the goal instead of just making

910
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:38,309
a pretty logo similarly every single

911
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,960
friend I have referred them to has come

912

I'm your host Shango Lowe's and our

930
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,449
guest this week is soil biologist

931
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,960
Leighton Morrison so during the first

932
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:24,059
set we went we covered a lot of area and

933
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,490
traveled through many years and during

934
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:29,989
second set we're gonna bring it on home

935
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:32,759
to how you can use this knowledge to

936
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:34,649
grow better cannabis so Leighton let's

937
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,550
start at the top you know most everybody

938
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:40,470
is using container still for cannabis

939
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,359
and we're gonna talk about the soil in

940
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:46,500
the ground but but let's start because

941
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:49,170
you know you approach soil structure in

942
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,789
in containers different than anybody

943
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:53,309
else I've come across because most

944
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:55,320
everybody has got like their soil recipe

945
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:57,119
right you put out a big-ass tarp you put

946
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,859
down your start your whatever your base

947
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,349
soil is gonna be you throw your

948
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:03,838
amendments in it you you you you mix it

949
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:05,940
up you put it in the pot Shazam off you

950
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:08,070
go right and then like with you know

951
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,838
over over longer-term hopefully you're

952
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:12,119
not throwing away that soil every year

953
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,549
and you're reusing it and and that can

954
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:17,119
become no-till right but your approach

955
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:22,080
is different you're always talking about

956
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,940
building layers in the containers so I

957
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,059
hand you the floor and I would like you

958
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,789
to teach us why you find that to be more

959
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:35,279
effective and appropriate cool thank you

960
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:37,409
I bio mimic natural systems so the way I

961
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,359
look at anything is like alright well

962
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:41,789
how did nature do it nature did it by

963
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,799
layers and they're called soil horizons

964
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:47,639
and we were fortunate enough to have a

965
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,560
time to do a quick video where you're

966
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:51,449
gonna put it up on YouTube and people

967
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,920
will be able to go look at it and and

968
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:53,659
we're going to talk specifically a

969
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,730
little well

970
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:59,719
touch base on the horizons and why

971
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:03,019
they're so important so diving right in

972
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:04,909
I tell cannabis people you know you guys

973
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:07,340
have been doing this and yeah it works

974
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:10,299
but it's unsustainable because you

975
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:14,210
basically if you're using salts or

976
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:16,250
organic newts you're burning the soil

977
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:19,550
out you're adding too much of some stuff

978
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:21,170
because each phenotype or chemo type

979
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:24,500
pulls different things out of the soil

980
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:26,539
so you stripped this and now you try to

981
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:29,179
grow the same plant well it's not going

982
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:30,889
to do well in that soil and the only way

983
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:32,889
to figure this out it gets really deep

984
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:35,960
it has to be biological chemistry

985
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:39,139
phenotype chemo type understanding the

986
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:42,050
cultivar and your soil your environment

987
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:44,239
you know Sun is much hotter out here in

988
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:48,620
northern Washington than it is out east

989
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:51,169
it's totally different so back to the

990
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:52,519
horizon so I would say to these canvas

991
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,110
guys I'm like yeah you know you build

992
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:57,739
these new packs you build these you know

993
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:59,900
what I want to call organic matter level

994
00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:01,669
uh organic matter over izing that's what

995
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,190
you're doing just building the overrides

996
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,630
I'm sure your plant and it does work

997
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:07,130
proof is in the pudding it's been around

998
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,210
for quite a while and this technique has

999
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,099
been around for quite a while

1000
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,809
problem is its unsustainable and you

1001
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:14,539
have to dump it maybe you get two years

1002
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:16,670
out of it so I was like no no let's

1003
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:19,009
let's copy nature and so I'm recently

1004
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:23,690
working on a project in Colorado a good

1005
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:25,130
size grow indoor and he contacts me or I

1006
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,980
got brought in because of the other

1007
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:30,500
consultants involved and they asked me

1008
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,329
all right well how we gonna build the

1009
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,179
soil and I was like whoa the same way

1010
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:36,730
nature does and explained the horizons

1011
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:39,710
to them and I said you know by the way

1012
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:41,210
what is what is your budget for soil and

1013
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:43,849
I think it was like a quarter of a

1014
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,960
million dollars and I'm like okay well

1015
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:48,500
you know what I'm gonna save you about

1016
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,720
two hundred thousand dollars all right

1017
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,610
and I got his attention pretty damn

1018
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,169
quick so I said alright we're gonna

1019
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:57,079
first of all we're gonna build an

1020
00:41:54,170 --> 00:42:00,590
alluvial horizon and that is basically

1021
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:01,909
just rocks and a little bit of sand and

1022
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:04,000
that only has to be a couple inches

1023
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:06,849
thick and it's right at the very bottom

1024
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,340
then we're gonna build an a horizon

1025
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:12,400
and an a horizon is gonna have sand silt

1026
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:14,829
and clay and some organic matter and I

1027
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,289
can get into the percentages but they

1028
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:19,090
vary depending on what you have locally

1029
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:20,409
because I don't source material in the

1030
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:23,079
East Coast and have it shipped to the

1031
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:26,019
west I go to wherever you are and I find

1032
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:27,759
what your local sources are not all clay

1033
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:29,980
is created equal there are clays that

1034
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,110
have absolutely zero nutritional value

1035
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:35,829
and are dead they do not have a magnetic

1036
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:38,800
charge cation exchange capacity that's

1037
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:40,539
what fuels that is that electrical

1038
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,500
charge that magnetism

1039
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:46,029
so I source these local ingredients and

1040
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:49,269
I blend the sand silt and clay in

1041
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:52,810
organic matter to a certain percentage

1042
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:54,789
and now that is your a horizon then the

1043
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:56,769
top is your o Verizon now we're back

1044
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:59,500
into your guys's mixes where you're

1045
00:42:56,769 --> 00:43:01,110
using rice hulls using peat moss which

1046
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,170
please don't use anymore

1047
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:07,690
compost and other organic matter

1048
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:10,240
materials and so basically what happens

1049
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:13,840
is that what happens is when you water

1050
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:16,629
that organic matter the a horizon below

1051
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:20,860
it will actually wick out excess

1052
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:22,720
moisture so that that soil just never

1053
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:24,430
gets anaerobic that overrides in that

1054
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,769
organic matter and if anyone's ever

1055
00:43:24,429 --> 00:43:28,359
played with a tremendous amount of

1056
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:30,699
compost you can see how much moisture

1057
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,349
that stuff will hold you can grab a

1058
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:33,819
handful of it squeeze it and literally

1059
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:34,650
get the water to come out of it out of

1060
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:39,280
your hand

1061
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:41,079
so you to have pure organic matter is a

1062
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,940
real problem because you're gonna have

1063
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:47,799
anaerobic pockets that you can't control

1064
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:52,500
and worse yet jumping into the biology

1065
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:56,100
side of it what happens to bacteria when

1066
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:59,469
they are on in or a very moist

1067
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:02,110
environment is as that moisture wicks

1068
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:05,559
out the bacteria does something called

1069
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:08,019
cysts so basically what assist is is

1070
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:10,630
when a bacteria forms a wax coating

1071
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:12,280
around the outside of itself and it

1072
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,930
pulls the moisture and the food it needs

1073
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,450
inside that sphere

1074
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:17,809
consider it a bubble I get into the

1075
00:44:16,449 --> 00:44:20,599
physics

1076
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:24,199
behind the bubble and why a dot how it

1077
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:26,989
forms but that's too complicated so when

1078
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:29,929
the bacteria forms this wax coating

1079
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:33,469
around itself outside and that's

1080
00:44:29,929 --> 00:44:35,269
happening exponentially around the

1081
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:37,730
outside of that organic matter as it

1082
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:40,820
dries out you just created a vapor

1083
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:43,340
barrier you just created a way for that

1084
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:45,230
water to not penetrate back into the

1085
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:48,140
organic matter it'll just run off

1086
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:50,150
that's called hydrophobic so now you

1087
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:53,420
have anaerobic pockets and now you have

1088
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:56,000
hydrophobic soil which is locked up you

1089
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:59,450
can't you can't access plant can't

1090
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,579
access and you've you've you've melted

1091
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:03,109
your roots in the anaerobic zone so now

1092
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:05,150
you've made your plan unhealthy and

1093
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:08,660
you've eliminated the plant from being

1094
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:12,559
able to use the organic matter on the

1095
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:14,809
sides and potentially on the top so when

1096
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:16,519
people are building pots what I tell

1097
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:18,440
them is Lally you really need a vapor

1098
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:21,139
barrier around the sides of that pot so

1099
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,990
that there's no way that it can go

1100
00:45:21,139 --> 00:45:26,359
hydrophobic that moisture level inside

1101
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:29,119
that pot is staying at that moisture

1102
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:31,430
level that you're controlling number one

1103
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,139
number two if you're using a no verison

1104
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:35,349
which you have to you need to mulch the

1105
00:45:33,139 --> 00:45:38,659
top of it either with a living mulch or

1106
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:41,420
some kind of hay or some kind of bark

1107
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:43,639
something that won't allow the air to

1108
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,440
wick that moisture out to steal that

1109
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:47,150
humidity that you're trying to keep in

1110
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,119
there for the plant and for the Rio

1111
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:51,769
sphere and for all the biology but you

1112
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:53,480
have to have a way for that water excess

1113
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:56,019
to drain out of it and that's the a

1114
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:59,539
horizon so what happens is the a horizon

1115
00:45:56,019 --> 00:46:01,489
prevents fines call them fines little

1116
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:04,699
tiny particulates of sand silt and clay

1117
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:07,879
from getting down in there and creating

1118
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:10,609
what we would call a compaction zone so

1119
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:13,550
a compaction zone is where moisture and

1120
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:16,010
water cannot move through that soil so

1121
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:17,450
it gets trapped at that zone and the

1122
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,230
roots come down they hit that zone and

1123
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:21,079
bam

1124
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:23,329
oh man it's anaerobic it melts my root

1125
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:25,610
tips now I'm gonna get an infection now

1126
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:27,110
I'm gonna have a problem so that's why

1127
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:29,329
it's so important that you allow

1128
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,619
moisture to move all the way through

1129
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:32,568
these pots

1130
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:35,059
so the alluvial layer at the bottom will

1131
00:46:32,568 --> 00:46:37,338
take up any access moisture the a

1132
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:39,380
horizon will wick the excess moisture

1133
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:43,308
out of the top so as you can see they

1134
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:46,369
all work together to create this magic

1135
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:48,769
called moisture water cycles moving

1136
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:50,450
through gravity does that does that

1137
00:46:48,768 --> 00:46:51,978
answer the question yeah actually I've

1138
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:54,278
just been sitting here with my eyes

1139
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:57,919
closed just listening to you and

1140
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:59,568
picturing these different layers and it

1141
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,358
all fits together like this beautiful

1142
00:46:59,568 --> 00:47:05,058
melody but I do have questions so my

1143
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:06,920
first one to clarify when you're talking

1144
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:09,469
about building these layers in the pots

1145
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,559
I believe you described three layers

1146
00:47:09,469 --> 00:47:14,838
correct you've got a sand and stone

1147
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:18,680
layer on the bottom and then you've got

1148
00:47:14,838 --> 00:47:20,119
a a silt layer in the middle and then on

1149
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:22,669
the top you've got what we would

1150
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:24,680
normally be our soil mix is am i close

1151
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:27,469
is that is so or Mario or am I still far

1152
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:31,149
off no no you're kind of close but the a

1153
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:33,889
horizon is not so it's sand silt clay so

1154
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:35,269
steel sand silt and clay and organic

1155
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:36,710
matter there's definitely some organic

1156
00:47:35,268 --> 00:47:39,199
matter in there too and it's just a

1157
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:43,789
percentage like I think it was seventeen

1158
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:46,699
percent clay thirteen percent silt fifty

1159
00:47:43,789 --> 00:47:48,289
percent sand and that leaves I think 20

1160
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:50,838
percent not would have been the organic

1161
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:53,420
matter so you know of all the recipes

1162
00:47:50,838 --> 00:47:55,788
that I've experimented with and such to

1163
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:59,690
build up my knowledge base I've never

1164
00:47:55,789 --> 00:48:03,200
gone out and bought clay or silt like

1165
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:05,420
what actually do I go to either a in a

1166
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:07,699
perfect world wildcraft what do I go out

1167
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:10,999
and wildcraft or more realistically for

1168
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:13,460
most people what do I go to the nursery

1169
00:48:10,998 --> 00:48:15,558
or horticulture store and buy I mean

1170
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:21,829
I've never heard of a bag of silt does

1171
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:26,329
that you wild Crawford and and basically

1172
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:30,140
what you do is you go to one of my

1173
00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:33,170
favorite places to go shopping is the

1174
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:36,379
golf course industry because they are

1175
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:37,909
building high performance soils they

1176
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,430
bring in stuff from all over the place

1177
00:48:37,909 --> 00:48:42,409
and they generally will know like hey

1178
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:44,419
I'm building a golf course in this area

1179
00:48:42,409 --> 00:48:49,288
so they'll they'll contact all the

1180
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:52,409
samp it's quarrys and they'll they'll

1181
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:54,390
talk to the local contractors to find

1182
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:56,699
some of these sources so that then they

1183
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:59,358
can locally harvest the material blend

1184
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:02,248
it together and build their

1185
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:03,679
high-performance sports fields you know

1186
00:49:02,248 --> 00:49:06,449
I never really thought about it that way

1187
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:09,239
everything that you're describing is all

1188
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:11,998
absolutely necessary information for

1189
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:13,288
golf courses because that's essentially

1190
00:49:11,998 --> 00:49:17,669
what they're selling you do you're

1191
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:18,930
selling you like perfect ground and so

1192
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,190
if they're gonna make perfect ground

1193
00:49:18,929 --> 00:49:22,558
they got to make sure that they are not

1194
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:25,440
making you know wetlands or something

1195
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,509
and so and so and they wouldn't want to

1196
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,490
ship this stuff in from all over the

1197
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:32,190
country because it's super expensive so

1198
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:34,919
they're gonna be finding it locally well

1199
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:38,429
that's very interesting so so so there

1200
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:40,769
are actual like companies that serve the

1201
00:49:38,429 --> 00:49:42,259
golf course is in different regions and

1202
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:45,358
that would be where we'd want to look

1203
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:47,369
right and and to be honest with you you

1204
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:52,170
have extremely fertile soil out here

1205
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:54,329
remember the volcanoes that's clay clay

1206
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:56,789
is made through 2 per tube ways one

1207
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:59,460
volcanic ash the other is a glacier

1208
00:49:56,789 --> 00:50:04,528
pushing through a grinding rock against

1209
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:06,809
rock so so you can find clay locally

1210
00:50:04,528 --> 00:50:08,998
either sometimes I'll reach out to a

1211
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:10,798
pottery company especially if they're

1212
00:50:08,998 --> 00:50:12,358
like a regenerative pottekkatt pottery

1213
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:14,219
company they'll say oh yeah we if we

1214
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:17,400
have different local sources of clay

1215
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:19,409
here sometimes we blend it sometimes we

1216
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,170
don't sometimes we just use it you know

1217
00:50:19,409 --> 00:50:23,879
naturally so there's a there's a good

1218
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:26,039
resource for clay but all you really got

1219
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,849
to do is take a whole you've got clay in

1220
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:30,749
there

1221
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:33,239
everybody does out here so that was that

1222
00:50:30,748 --> 00:50:35,518
would be how I would source my clay and

1223
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:39,199
then the second way to source or the

1224
00:50:35,518 --> 00:50:41,818
other way to source your silt is again

1225
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:44,038
understanding how silt was made silt is

1226
00:50:41,818 --> 00:50:48,119
just organic matter ground up to the

1227
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:50,700
finest possible MA molecule which is

1228
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:52,739
kind of like a human so it silt is

1229
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:54,598
bigger than a human but but it would

1230
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:56,818
soon become human it sounds like you're

1231
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:57,990
talking about like forest Duff I know

1232
00:50:56,818 --> 00:51:00,059
for stuff is

1233
00:50:57,989 --> 00:51:03,419
different that's over eyes silt silt

1234
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:07,409
would come from a riverbed the bottom of

1235
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:10,610
a lake if you if you have say a pool

1236
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:13,500
that that's defunct and filled with

1237
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:15,390
algae and all kinds of leaves that are

1238
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:18,980
gonna rotting on the bottom of it

1239
00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:22,289
that's silt that's organic matter

1240
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:25,440
digesting itself and turning in to

1241
00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:27,539
humates but it's first silt um so I

1242
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:31,650
always go to water sources to find my

1243
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:34,769
cell like creeks or old areas old wash

1244
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:38,970
outs you know one of my favorite places

1245
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:41,099
is and and this is this is the beauty of

1246
00:51:38,969 --> 00:51:43,679
God or the universe Gaia whatever you

1247
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:48,259
believe in but where the rivers meet the

1248
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:50,759
ocean estuaries oh my god it's all silt

1249
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:53,040
and I always tell people if you're gonna

1250
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,110
wildcraft you better wildcraft

1251
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:56,909
respectfully or you're gonna get Sam

1252
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:59,640
you're gonna get with zapped by Gaia

1253
00:51:56,909 --> 00:52:01,170
she's gonna bitch-slap you so you better

1254
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:02,759
bring in if you're gonna go in and get a

1255
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:05,389
couple five-gallon buckets of this stuff

1256
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:08,700
you damn well better bring in a couple

1257
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:12,210
five-gallon compound buckets of compost

1258
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:13,559
or an offering of some kind if you don't

1259
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:16,470
you're gonna end up harvesting some bad

1260
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:17,759
stuff and you're gonna have problems one

1261
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:20,159
of the things that you have to

1262
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:23,400
understand about Wow crafting silt is it

1263
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:25,289
is anaerobic like if you ever walk down

1264
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,690
the side of a river and stepped into the

1265
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:29,400
mud and sunk up to your knee yeah and

1266
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:33,300
then you pull your foot out and it

1267
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:36,420
smells like hell so that silt has to be

1268
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:41,550
blended with a tremendous amount of more

1269
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:43,619
dry organic matter or dry clay so that

1270
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:46,980
that can wick the moisture out of it and

1271
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:49,880
begin to make it aerobic one of one of

1272
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:52,730
the things that I do in my job I harvest

1273
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:56,450
fish manure from from different

1274
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:59,460
fisheries and aquaculture and aquaponics

1275
00:52:56,449 --> 00:53:02,069
systems and the first thing I have to do

1276
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:04,559
is aerobic lee stabilize it so I kill

1277
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:07,680
off the Shigella I kill off all the spy

1278
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:10,559
reom spur Ilham and the only way to do

1279
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:11,489
that is through increased dissolved

1280
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,199
oxygen

1281
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:15,659
the water call so I have to build up the

1282
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,849
oxygen in that water as as fast and as

1283
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:20,460
hard as I possibly can to kill all that

1284
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:22,049
stuff off every batch is different and I

1285
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,809
have to use a microscope to determine

1286
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:26,850
that I've got that deal I mean I can use

1287
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:28,920
a deal meter but it doesn't mean that I

1288
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:30,509
gotten rid of everything yet that deal

1289
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,090
meter is just telling me that I'm in my

1290
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:35,580
ballpark but now I have to watch and

1291
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:37,950
wait till that till that conversion

1292
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,779
happens so it goes from anaerobic to

1293
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:43,349
aerobic and there's a gray area in the

1294
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:45,450
middle too and I could really dive deep

1295
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:48,868
on that at that in itself but I'm not

1296
00:53:45,449 --> 00:53:52,199
I'm gonna stay focus here so the silt

1297
00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:53,789
has to get has to become aerobic as

1298
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:57,109
quick as possible or you're gonna have

1299
00:53:53,789 --> 00:54:00,179
some issues so if your wildcrafting silt

1300
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:02,910
understand that they're you you have to

1301
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:06,989
be use your common sense and be really

1302
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:10,440
responsible about this I have found some

1303
00:54:06,989 --> 00:54:12,149
sources of soap through excavators they

1304
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,980
say oh yeah I was digging I was digging

1305
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,690
over here and I found this layer black

1306
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:18,420
[ __ ] that I don't understand what it is

1307
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:20,429
I'm like oh where is it show me and you

1308
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,659
go over there and now that layer has had

1309
00:54:20,429 --> 00:54:24,419
the moisture wikked

1310
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:27,210
out from the a horizon underneath of it

1311
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:30,090
so it's been aerobic ly stabilized

1312
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:34,949
through gravity and time

1313
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:37,829
Gaia's work so there are ways to do it

1314
00:54:34,949 --> 00:54:40,379
but the easiest quickest source is

1315
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:43,559
usually gonna be Crick's rivers streams

1316
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:45,119
cold lake beds swamps you know that's

1317
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:47,219
where you're gonna get yourself when

1318
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:50,100
you're talking about the the bottom

1319
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:51,959
layer I think you called it the alluvial

1320
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:54,358
layer and that's where the rocks are

1321
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,949
what size of rocks are you're talking

1322
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:57,630
about are you talking about rocks the

1323
00:54:55,949 --> 00:54:59,519
size of the palm of your hand that are

1324
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:03,930
pretty big or are you talking about more

1325
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:06,030
like pebbles I like to use all so

1326
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:09,269
everything now if you're limited like

1327
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:11,550
the gentleman in Colorado my alluvial

1328
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:14,340
layer is only four inches so I could not

1329
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:18,080
use something the size your palm so what

1330
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:21,358
I told him was we sourced out a local

1331
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:24,598
quarry that grinds rocks up and makes

1332
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:26,668
gravels and stuff like that and Krim

1333
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:29,338
we sourced out a material called

1334
00:55:26,668 --> 00:55:31,708
inch-and-a-half - so what that is is

1335
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:33,358
that's gonna be rocks that are the

1336
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:35,219
biggest rock you'll get is inch and a

1337
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:38,880
half but it's gonna be - all the way

1338
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:40,918
down to sand mmm so basically that's the

1339
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,959
way of alluvial layer works I mean like

1340
00:55:40,918 --> 00:55:44,278
you go to the beach you go to out to

1341
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:46,528
Vashon Island go out to the beach you

1342
00:55:44,278 --> 00:55:48,179
see all the big rocks on the top but if

1343
00:55:46,528 --> 00:55:50,059
you dig down you're gonna start to see

1344
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:53,519
smaller and smaller and smaller rocks

1345
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:54,569
and sand and and a little bit of clay

1346
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:57,568
and other things

1347
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:58,949
so again bio mimicking nature I told him

1348
00:55:57,568 --> 00:56:00,568
all right just let's use the inch and a

1349
00:55:58,949 --> 00:56:02,639
half - because that'll be easy to work

1350
00:56:00,568 --> 00:56:05,099
with what's gonna happen is you're gonna

1351
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:06,989
you're gonna layer this stuff in and

1352
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:08,609
then you're gonna just walk briefly

1353
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:10,619
water it down and you're gonna notice

1354
00:56:08,608 --> 00:56:12,478
the sand goes right to the bottom and

1355
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:15,568
the rocks kind of come up to the top and

1356
00:56:12,478 --> 00:56:19,018
and that's now part of your filtration

1357
00:56:15,568 --> 00:56:21,088
system so it's going to it's going to

1358
00:56:19,018 --> 00:56:23,879
allow the water to pull into those

1359
00:56:21,088 --> 00:56:26,728
pockets in between all of the rocks and

1360
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,739
the sand is gonna help to wick it out of

1361
00:56:26,728 --> 00:56:30,629
the top and of course you got to leave

1362
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:33,119
your beds leave a little cracked space

1363
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:35,219
to bottom of your bed so any excess

1364
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,619
water will come out and you have to use

1365
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:39,239
a little filter fabric or something to

1366
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:41,009
prevent the sand from losing out if you

1367
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:43,588
want it to be really neat and clean and

1368
00:56:41,009 --> 00:56:44,998
this guy was he wants to when he walks

1369
00:56:43,588 --> 00:56:46,528
down his rows he doesn't want to see any

1370
00:56:44,998 --> 00:56:49,228
little sand slipping out from underneath

1371
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:51,179
his boxes and his his that was his idea

1372
00:56:49,228 --> 00:56:52,468
to add to filter fabric and at first I

1373
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:53,519
was like yeah and don't add anything you

1374
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:55,199
don't need to and then I'm like yeah I

1375
00:56:53,518 --> 00:56:57,208
understand you don't want it - you want

1376
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:00,749
this place to look sterile and nice you

1377
00:56:57,208 --> 00:57:02,158
don't want you know fine using out from

1378
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:03,478
underneath the sides of your beds yeah

1379
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:06,298
and then eventually he would have to

1380
00:57:03,478 --> 00:57:08,068
replace that in the pot and so might as

1381
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:10,438
well just keep it where it is so right

1382
00:57:08,068 --> 00:57:12,900
alright so before we go to our second

1383
00:57:10,438 --> 00:57:14,989
commercial let's do one nice thumbnail

1384
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:17,548
summary so if I'm hearing you correctly

1385
00:57:14,989 --> 00:57:20,159
my first layer that's going to be three

1386
00:57:17,548 --> 00:57:24,900
or four inches is going to be you know

1387
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:28,169
inch or two size stone all the way down

1388
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:30,209
to very small so so you know two inches

1389
00:57:28,168 --> 00:57:31,739
all the way down to - I think is what

1390
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:34,828
the vocabulary word you were you were

1391
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:36,849
using and then and then my my middle

1392
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:39,220
layer is going to be

1393
00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:41,680
sand silt and clay and you've already

1394
00:57:39,219 --> 00:57:45,699
talked about how we can we can get those

1395
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:48,368
and then and then our top layer is going

1396
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:51,848
to be whatever our preferred living soil

1397
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:54,670
mix that we would normally do and you

1398
00:57:51,849 --> 00:57:57,249
build this layer cake in every single

1399
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:59,318
pot absolutely spot-on the only thing

1400
00:57:57,248 --> 00:58:00,879
you forgot was the organic number in the

1401
00:57:59,318 --> 00:58:03,788
a horizon have twenty percent organic

1402
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:06,640
matter to write on and and I guess while

1403
00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:09,339
we're adding that the the green mulch to

1404
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:12,429
this is the first year that I ran tests

1405
00:58:09,338 --> 00:58:14,259
using you know like little glut grasses

1406
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:17,139
and clovers on the top of my pots and

1407
00:58:14,259 --> 00:58:19,690
it's it's wildly different experience

1408
00:58:17,139 --> 00:58:23,018
you know I've I've gotten a hydrophobic

1409
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:25,720
layer on top of my pots for years and

1410
00:58:23,018 --> 00:58:27,998
years and years and and by midseason the

1411
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:31,028
water is running off the sides of the

1412
00:58:27,998 --> 00:58:33,278
pots but this year actually especially

1413
00:58:31,028 --> 00:58:35,440
the the radishes I used that only in

1414
00:58:33,278 --> 00:58:37,088
Ingham recommended you know I've got all

1415
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,940
these little plants and they all create

1416
00:58:37,088 --> 00:58:42,849
all of these pathways for the water to

1417
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:44,889
go down into the substrate of the pot

1418
00:58:42,849 --> 00:58:49,150
but it also creates like this mini

1419
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:53,739
rainforest and and and keeps the the top

1420
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:57,369
of the top of the pot moisture you know

1421
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:59,079
moist and so I never get that closed out

1422
00:58:57,369 --> 00:59:01,838
so so that would be your top layer than

1423
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:03,940
a green mulch yeah absolutely I mean I

1424
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:05,619
love the living mulches because you guys

1425
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,119
are all big fans of ours here you

1426
00:59:05,619 --> 00:59:09,579
understand how important they are and

1427
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,349
those those little micro roots coming

1428
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:14,259
out of those little micro greens or

1429
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:16,150
living mulches are sending out miles of

1430
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:19,028
rouse fear and those that's where all

1431
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:20,410
your nutrient cycling is so that plan is

1432
00:59:19,028 --> 00:59:22,179
getting those routes for getting those

1433
00:59:20,409 --> 00:59:24,399
organisms to do its nutrient cycling

1434
00:59:22,179 --> 00:59:26,768
what happens when that route crosses

1435
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,719
over the root hair of a cannabis there's

1436
00:59:26,768 --> 00:59:33,488
an exchange that happens they talk they

1437
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:35,650
learn new things yeah I'll trade you for

1438
00:59:33,489 --> 00:59:38,469
these you know and that's that's the way

1439
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:41,019
nature works so having that living mulch

1440
00:59:38,469 --> 00:59:45,460
on the top is critical to preventing

1441
00:59:41,018 --> 00:59:48,308
hydrophobic to continue to grow out the

1442
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:50,710
euro sphere and building soil tilth and

1443
00:59:48,309 --> 00:59:53,800
structure as well as as

1444
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:55,240
critical communication that it happens

1445
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,339
in nature and when you guys just grow

1446
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:58,000
one plan in there you've isolated the

1447
00:59:57,338 --> 01:00:01,299
poor thing

1448
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,639
how is it supposed to communicate how is

1449
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:05,890
it supposed to become fully hit its full

1450
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:08,710
potential when you've you've limited it

1451
01:00:05,889 --> 01:00:11,739
to know nobody's no friends no no family

1452
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:13,389
so this again this is why I love dragon

1453
01:00:11,739 --> 01:00:15,309
fire medicine and the message that

1454
01:00:13,389 --> 01:00:18,190
they're bringing forward is huge and

1455
01:00:15,309 --> 01:00:20,380
that is polyculture don't isolate a

1456
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:23,440
plant it does it that doesn't happen in

1457
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:25,750
nature biomimic nature and if you do

1458
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,338
that the results are insane they're

1459
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:29,769
night and day from what you're used to

1460
01:00:27,338 --> 01:00:31,358
fabulous so with that let's go ahead and

1461
01:00:29,769 --> 01:00:33,159
take our second short break and be right

1462
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:35,289
back you're listening to shaping fire

1463
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:38,409
and my guest today is soil biologist

1464
01:00:35,289 --> 01:00:40,239
Leighton Morrison cultivators who grow

1465
01:00:38,409 --> 01:00:42,250
in living soil are very particular on

1466
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:44,139
what inputs they use in their soil they

1467
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:46,570
educate themselves and painstakingly

1468
01:00:44,139 --> 01:00:48,368
create compost and nutritive teas to

1469
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:50,200
create thriving soils that will produce

1470

the very best expression of the cannabis

1471
01:00:50,199 --> 01:00:55,149
plant many living soil farmers now

1472
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:57,040
believe that over time seeds become

1473
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:59,380
acclimated to the kind of substrate they

1474
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:01,358
are grown in for example a seed that was

1475
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:02,950
bred in synthetic fertilizers may not

1476
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:04,750
immediately know what to do in a living

probiotic growing techniques that way

1484
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:22,088
when you germinate in soil the seeds

1485
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:23,739
genetics will recognize the environment

1486
01:01:22,088 --> 01:01:26,289

back you're listening to shaping fire

1545
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:36,210
I'm your host Shango Louis and our guest

1546
01:03:34,289 --> 01:03:38,730
this week is soil biologist Layton

1547
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:41,159
Morrison so Layton let's jump right back

1548
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:44,190
into it during the last set we talked

1549
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:46,889
about how to properly use these horizon

1550
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:48,990
layers in containers but a lot of people

1551
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:50,670
are growing outside now more than ever

1552
01:03:48,989 --> 01:03:52,859
because people are allowed to grow their

1553
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:55,200
particular number of plants for THC

1554
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:57,960
based cannabis but also we've got all

1555
01:03:55,199 --> 01:04:02,009
these people using these fields now to

1556
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:04,500
grow medical hemp so so let's talk about

1557
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:06,270
the same concepts of using the horizons

1558
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:10,380
but let's assume you're going into the

1559
01:04:06,269 --> 01:04:12,699
soil perfect in any type of situation

1560
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:14,619
where I'm in a field the girl

1561
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:17,230
outdoors first thing I do is what's

1562
01:04:14,619 --> 01:04:20,260
called a perk test so basically I dig a

1563
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:23,199
hole and I look at the soil horizons so

1564
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:24,970
I'm learning and then I pour a

1565
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:27,819
five-gallon bucket of water in there and

1566
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:31,088
I hit the timer and I watch and I wait

1567
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:33,369
to see how long it takes if that water

1568
01:04:31,088 --> 01:04:35,320
does not drain out of that soil pretty

1569
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:41,170
quickly you got a problem

1570
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:43,539
what's pretty quickly within a minute if

1571
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:46,570
that five gallons doesn't dry doesn't go

1572
01:04:43,539 --> 01:04:50,279
dry within a minute then you have what

1573
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:53,829
would be considered compaction zone and

1574
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:56,230
when I'm doing a perk test I dig a big

1575
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:59,589
hole I'm not talking like a little you

1576
01:04:56,230 --> 01:05:01,510
know 10 scoops I'm talking a trench I

1577
01:04:59,588 --> 01:05:03,730
want to get down and see those horizons

1578
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:06,339
I want to see how deep my Oliver Eisen

1579
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:08,199
is how deep my a horizon is then there's

1580
01:05:06,338 --> 01:05:10,449
typically a beat horizon which we didn't

1581
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:12,368
touch on and sometimes that's an

1582
01:05:10,449 --> 01:05:14,199
alluvial layer sometimes it's B then

1583
01:05:12,369 --> 01:05:15,910
sometimes there's a little alluvial

1584
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:17,710
layer underneath to be as sometimes

1585
01:05:15,909 --> 01:05:19,179
there's bedrock under there but all

1586
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:20,800
these things are important to understand

1587
01:05:19,179 --> 01:05:22,989
so I basically tell people you don't dig

1588
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,730
it dig a hole as deep as you think the

1589
01:05:22,989 --> 01:05:27,429
roots are gonna go and if this is a

1590
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:29,710
14-foot monster you better believe those

1591
01:05:27,429 --> 01:05:31,179
roots are going 14 feet in the ground so

1592
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:33,250
you might need a backhoe you might need

1593
01:05:31,179 --> 01:05:38,409
an excavator but you got to go about it

1594
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:40,630
methodically like like you were by uh

1595
01:05:38,409 --> 01:05:42,250
mimicking nature the worst thing in the

1596
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:43,599
world you can do is dig a hole throw in

1597
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:45,909
a bunch of organic matter and plant a

1598
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:47,980
plant what's gonna happen is if that's

1599
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:50,618
gonna turn anaerobic all that all that

1600
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:54,039
all Verizon's gonna do is suck the

1601
01:05:50,619 --> 01:05:55,869
moisture out of the soil and then

1602
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:59,349
there's gonna be up the fines are gonna

1603
01:05:55,869 --> 01:06:02,980
migrate and you're gonna create a lake

1604
01:05:59,349 --> 01:06:06,519
up like a clay kettle for the plant and

1605
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:09,219
the plants not gonna do well so if my

1606
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:11,230
soil doesn't drain and I don't see the

1607
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:13,539
right layering that I need I will go on

1608
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:16,838
top of the soil I build a horizon on top

1609
01:06:13,539 --> 01:06:19,300
so that way I know if it's raining and

1610
01:06:16,838 --> 01:06:22,000
it's pouring and we get this extreme

1611
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:23,980
weather which people hello we're gonna

1612
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,380
get extreme weathers we had lightning in

1613
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:28,210
freaking North Pole we

1614
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,920
Lightning out here we talked about that

1615
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:31,539
earlier so everything is going to be

1616
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,450
extreme and they by extreme I mean

1617
01:06:31,539 --> 01:06:36,969
extreme rain extreme drought so if this

1618
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:39,399
is extreme rain and your plant is in a

1619
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:41,319
cauldron it's gonna fill up and kill it

1620
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:43,180
so you've got to make sure that you're

1621
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,890
looking at drainage and that's a big

1622
01:06:43,179 --> 01:06:47,109
piece of this whole thing so if your

1623
01:06:44,889 --> 01:06:49,210
soil doesn't drain you've got to dig

1624
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:50,950
another hole a little bit higher until

1625
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:52,960
you see that water disappear if the

1626
01:06:50,949 --> 01:06:54,849
water doesn't disappeared your soil is

1627
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,639
pure clay based and it doesn't drain

1628
01:06:54,849 --> 01:07:00,279
then you got to build on top of it so

1629
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:02,319
these giant commercial hemp fields if

1630
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:05,110
you're talking big AG they've already

1631
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:06,820
destroyed the aggregates so bad that it

1632
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:09,039
doesn't matter they're just gonna puke

1633
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:12,120
synthetics on it and then tons of

1634
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:14,860
pesticides to keep the de pests at bay

1635
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:16,299
so that's a different system and we I

1636
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:18,550
don't even want to go down that rabbit

1637
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:21,910
hole I want to stay focused on what your

1638
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:23,740
existing soil system is and if your soil

1639
01:07:21,909 --> 01:07:25,719
does not drain then you have to start

1640
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:27,759
terracing and there's a number of

1641
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:30,339
different ways to do it I always love

1642
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,560
you know finding dead wood on the

1643
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:35,710
property and and using that as the sides

1644
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:37,809
of my raised bed because it does two

1645
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:41,710
things it provides fungal food it

1646
01:07:37,809 --> 01:07:44,799
provides insulation and protection from

1647
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:47,949
the sides getting hydrophobic and again

1648
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:49,780
it's it's it's it's regenerative its

1649
01:07:47,949 --> 01:07:51,609
you're not you're not taking or

1650
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:54,460
destroying something you're just using

1651
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:57,099
something that was already present but

1652
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:59,470
you're using it in a different manner

1653
01:07:57,099 --> 01:08:01,839
than it was intended but the log in

1654
01:07:59,469 --> 01:08:04,929
though in the woods the ditch fall we

1655
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:06,789
call them blow downs that's serving a

1656
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:09,250
purpose to the forest but it can also

1657
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:10,929
serve you a purpose as long as you're

1658
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:14,619
not like harvesting new trees I would

1659
01:08:10,929 --> 01:08:17,529
never do that then why not use these

1660
01:08:14,619 --> 01:08:20,739
logs to raise your vets and if if you're

1661
01:08:17,529 --> 01:08:22,090
gonna try to do commercial AG in this

1662
01:08:20,739 --> 01:08:24,479
method forget it

1663
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:27,300
it's it's it's not really cost-effective

1664
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:31,268
so if your field doesn't drain and

1665
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:32,619
you've got water squishy ground

1666
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:34,029
I'm sorry you're gonna have to find

1667
01:08:32,618 --> 01:08:37,630
another piece of land if you want to go

1668
01:08:34,029 --> 01:08:39,190
big so before you buy anything you know

1669
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:40,929
you really got to do your homework on

1670
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:42,368
this and understand I was their

1671
01:08:40,929 --> 01:08:44,019
synthetics used there because there's

1672
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:46,118
residuals there's there's gonna be some

1673
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:49,269
issues if there was that was if that was

1674
01:08:46,118 --> 01:08:53,618
kind of farmed commercially and non

1675
01:08:49,269 --> 01:08:56,199
regenerative over time what happens is

1676
01:08:53,618 --> 01:08:58,198
the fungi will tie up some of it some of

1677
01:08:56,198 --> 01:09:00,219
it will get broken down in bacteria

1678
01:08:58,198 --> 01:09:02,229
we'll talk a little bit more about

1679
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:05,859
rehabbing soil in the next couple

1680
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:08,439
minutes but you know the goal here is to

1681
01:09:05,859 --> 01:09:10,869
find a place suitable for what you're

1682
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:13,509
trying to do and that the soil is

1683
01:09:10,868 --> 01:09:15,219
functioning in a proper way that it will

1684
01:09:13,509 --> 01:09:17,170
allow you to do what you're doing

1685
01:09:15,219 --> 01:09:19,239
so it sounds to me like when we move

1686
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:22,269
outside and we're actually in the ground

1687
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:26,439
the moral of the story is find out

1688
01:09:22,269 --> 01:09:29,319
whether or not your your soil can remove

1689
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:33,308
the moisture by doing a perc test and if

1690
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:36,579
you if you uh if you are doing you know

1691
01:09:33,309 --> 01:09:38,319
craft or your home grow and your perc

1692
01:09:36,578 --> 01:09:41,259
test fails well you're gonna have to

1693
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:44,769
build a raised bed and if you are trying

1694
01:09:41,259 --> 01:09:47,859
to do you know you know agriculture

1695
01:09:44,769 --> 01:09:51,219
multiple acres and it fails the perc

1696
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:53,139
test you just got to move and then so so

1697
01:09:51,219 --> 01:09:57,939
you figure out that option and then

1698
01:09:53,139 --> 01:10:00,368
either and if your your ground succeeds

1699
01:09:57,939 --> 01:10:02,379
in the perc test whether and in your at

1700
01:10:00,368 --> 01:10:04,689
home or if you're doing craft well then

1701
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:07,449
that's easy you just dig a hole and then

1702
01:10:04,689 --> 01:10:09,069
you follow the recipe that you laid out

1703
01:10:07,448 --> 01:10:12,549
with the horizons that we talked about

1704
01:10:09,069 --> 01:10:14,380
in the second set and you know to be

1705
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:17,349
honest with you all you really need to

1706
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:20,920
do in that case is remove the top 12

1707
01:10:17,349 --> 01:10:23,319
inches because typically you want you

1708
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:26,469
want this plant to get bio intelligent

1709
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:29,018
you want its roots to go down and out to

1710
01:10:26,469 --> 01:10:30,998
the sides you want to give it the

1711
01:10:29,019 --> 01:10:31,748
ability to grow really quickly and

1712
01:10:30,998 --> 01:10:34,599
bust-a-move

1713
01:10:31,748 --> 01:10:36,519
but at the same time as soon as it gets

1714
01:10:34,599 --> 01:10:38,619
to the sides where you your organic

1715
01:10:36,519 --> 01:10:40,599
matter isn't there anymore you want it

1716
01:10:38,618 --> 01:10:44,259
to start weaving itself into the

1717
01:10:40,599 --> 01:10:44,569
indigenous plants that are there so you

1718
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:47,690
don't

1719
01:10:44,569 --> 01:10:49,639
really need to dig a huge hole you you

1720
01:10:47,689 --> 01:10:51,349
do want to see the horizons you do want

1721
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,600
to understand what your soil system is

1722
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:55,460
and you do want to perk at a lower level

1723
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,039
as well as as a top level so you're

1724
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:59,899
really getting a good feeling of of what

1725
01:10:58,039 --> 01:11:02,779
this plant is gonna be what you're

1726
01:10:59,899 --> 01:11:05,679
exposing this plant to be did that

1727
01:11:02,779 --> 01:11:08,149
answer the question yeah it did it did

1728
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:11,270
I'd never really realized the importance

1729
01:11:08,149 --> 01:11:12,949
of the perk test before you know I mean

1730
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:16,490
I guess that's probably because I've

1731
01:11:12,949 --> 01:11:19,010
mostly grown in containers but my god I

1732
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:22,399
can imagine people listening who have

1733
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:24,650
purchased their land to do medical hemp

1734
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:26,659
and it's overly wet and they're

1735
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:29,449
realizing oh my god I didn't do a perc

1736
01:11:26,659 --> 01:11:32,239
test and and now their choices are

1737
01:11:29,449 --> 01:11:35,059
either a spends several seasons and lots

1738
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:37,069
of money rehabbing the land or they've

1739
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:40,280
got to move wow that's a that's a pretty

1740
01:11:37,069 --> 01:11:43,309
heavy-duty thing to miss unfortunately

1741
01:11:40,279 --> 01:11:48,170
the earth moves in geological time yeah

1742
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:53,480
we do not an investment capital even

1743
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:55,690
less yeah so so okay so so you've

1744
01:11:53,479 --> 01:12:01,009
explained to us how that we can we can

1745
01:11:55,689 --> 01:12:03,379
redo these horizons in the soil but

1746
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:05,650
before before we wrap up for the day I

1747
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:09,350
want to make sure we talk about how to

1748
01:12:05,649 --> 01:12:13,069
rehabilitate you know maybe we'll talk

1749
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:16,190
about rehabbing land a bit but we all

1750
01:12:13,069 --> 01:12:19,609
have this experience of having being at

1751
01:12:16,189 --> 01:12:21,889
the end of the season and and our and

1752
01:12:19,609 --> 01:12:23,929
our pots are done and you know some

1753
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:25,730
people will go and they'll they'll put

1754
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:27,380
them you know in one part of the

1755
01:12:25,729 --> 01:12:28,429
property and they'll stack them right

1756
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:31,760
and they'll create all this compaction

1757
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:34,250
or they'll put them in a barn somewhere

1758
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,800
and they'll get like ridiculously dry

1759
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:39,319
and and all the microbes will die out

1760
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:41,329
there's not a lot of people who cut the

1761
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:43,969
pots and they just leave them all out to

1762
01:12:41,329 --> 01:12:46,279
nature so they can stay you know

1763
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:49,389
ferociously alive so so why don't you

1764
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:52,238
hit a couple of the

1765
01:12:49,389 --> 01:12:55,029
the challenges that you see most often

1766
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:59,819
that need to be rehabbed and give us an

1767
01:12:55,029 --> 01:13:03,789
idea of how to go about doing that okay

1768
01:12:59,819 --> 01:13:05,590
you know I'm not a big fan of pots

1769
01:13:03,789 --> 01:13:08,079
I don't everybody be in raised beds

1770
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:12,460
because you can do what nature does you

1771
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:15,368
could biomimic in the fall it falls all

1772
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:17,679
the organic matter falls and that is an

1773
01:13:15,368 --> 01:13:20,259
insulation layer so it's insulating the

1774
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:22,989
soil from freezing like a rock now in

1775
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:25,840
New England we get four feet of frost so

1776
01:13:22,988 --> 01:13:27,908
this this isn't gonna work out here you

1777
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:30,550
don't have that issue and so what I

1778
01:13:27,908 --> 01:13:33,579
would say to people is put your pots all

1779
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:35,889
together and just bury them and leaves

1780
01:13:33,579 --> 01:13:37,719
and hey so that you have that organic

1781
01:13:35,889 --> 01:13:40,389
matter rotting around your plants

1782
01:13:37,719 --> 01:13:43,000
keeping it more meeping it moist

1783
01:13:40,389 --> 01:13:45,520
preventing it from freezing but if it

1784
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,829
does get Frost that's not the end of the

1785
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,869
world you know in New England our ground

1786
01:13:47,829 --> 01:13:52,149
freezes four feet deep and the grass

1787
01:13:49,868 --> 01:13:54,939
comes back in the spring now in the

1788
01:13:52,149 --> 01:13:57,158
forest the ground never freezes and and

1789
01:13:54,939 --> 01:13:59,888
they did an interesting study a couple

1790
01:13:57,158 --> 01:14:02,170
years ago I read it about they basically

1791
01:13:59,889 --> 01:14:06,159
kind of cut all the trees down the

1792
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:08,649
middle the forest and then they measured

1793
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:10,569
the biology and the ups and downs in

1794
01:14:08,649 --> 01:14:12,939
both the area they cut it down and then

1795
01:14:10,569 --> 01:14:15,130
the area where they didn't touch it and

1796
01:14:12,939 --> 01:14:18,099
they found that that the area that they

1797
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:21,250
didn't touch really never froze and

1798
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:24,579
there was always some biological

1799
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:25,899
activity even when the snow was piled on

1800
01:14:24,579 --> 01:14:28,149
it and as a matter of fact the snow was

1801
01:14:25,899 --> 01:14:30,189
another insulator and and they went so

1802
01:14:28,149 --> 01:14:33,698
far in this experiment as to actually

1803
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:37,719
plow the snow off the surface so it got

1804
01:14:33,698 --> 01:14:39,638
exposed to freezing and the wind and it

1805
01:14:37,719 --> 01:14:43,539
was radically different I mean they lost

1806
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:46,150
huge huge colonies and diversity in the

1807
01:14:43,539 --> 01:14:49,000
soil because it froze solid and it

1808
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:51,638
didn't have any kind of roots it didn't

1809
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,880
have any kind of rotten rotting or

1810
01:14:51,639 --> 01:14:57,789
mulching or composting that's happening

1811
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:00,159
naturally so so I would say take your

1812
01:14:57,789 --> 01:15:01,448
pots and if you want to leave them where

1813
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:03,229
they are because they're too big to move

1814
01:15:01,448 --> 01:15:07,369
then you want to build a comp

1815
01:15:03,229 --> 01:15:09,379
pile around them and and or again you

1816
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:11,090
don't want to put a tarp over them you

1817
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:12,619
don't want to let them dry out you want

1818
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:16,039
to let them be exposed to the diversity

1819
01:15:12,619 --> 01:15:18,380
of the environment because that's gonna

1820
01:15:16,039 --> 01:15:20,720
help the organisms that you need to

1821
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:23,150
survive you don't want to spoil them you

1822
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:25,100
want to keep them you know exposed to

1823
01:15:23,149 --> 01:15:27,829
some of this but you also have to

1824
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:31,220
protect the pots keep them warm keep

1825
01:15:27,829 --> 01:15:33,079
them alive so that in spring they're

1826
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:35,539
ready to go but if you let them dry out

1827
01:15:33,079 --> 01:15:38,000
now you've created all of those cysts

1828
01:15:35,539 --> 01:15:40,159
and those cysts are a [ __ ] to get out I

1829
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,109
mean I had some fun back in my early

1830
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:45,019
days screwing around with desert

1831
01:15:42,109 --> 01:15:47,179
inoculant and people go oh that's desert

1832
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:50,450
so everything's dead you know what the

1833
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:52,820
desert is amazingly fertile if you see a

1834
01:15:50,449 --> 01:15:55,670
desert one day and it's dry as a bone

1835
01:15:52,819 --> 01:15:59,090
and then monsoon comes in you come back

1836
01:15:55,670 --> 01:16:02,920
the next day and it's alive it's amazing

1837
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:07,940
how green it turns in 24 hours so that

1838
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:10,970
works because that soil system and the

1839
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:13,819
biology are used to these extremes but

1840
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:15,890
yours aren't your soil systems like I

1841
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:17,988
would take some of this inoculant I

1842
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:21,800
throw it in water and that would

1843
01:16:17,988 --> 01:16:23,779
literally float for days and and it

1844
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:27,110
looked like sand silt it looked like you

1845
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:29,029
know sand and clay so it was coarse and

1846
01:16:27,109 --> 01:16:30,380
rough and I throw it in the vial in the

1847
01:16:29,029 --> 01:16:32,389
test tube so I could look at the biology

1848
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:34,460
in it and this [ __ ] would be floating

1849
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:37,579
and I called Elaine one day I was a

1850
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:39,770
clean what is up with this and she you

1851
01:16:37,579 --> 01:16:41,510
got to give it time wait it'll

1852
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:43,790
eventually sink and then you can look at

1853
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:47,329
the biology but it's it just blew my

1854
01:16:43,789 --> 01:16:49,310
mind that earth could float on water but

1855
01:16:47,329 --> 01:16:53,260
that was the biology that was the

1856
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:56,930
bacteria and so you know in your system

1857
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:59,810
your bacteria and your biology are not

1858
01:16:56,930 --> 01:17:01,940
not going to do well if they cysts up

1859
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:04,400
it's gonna take a long time for them to

1860
01:17:01,939 --> 01:17:07,009
rehydrate and and come out of that

1861
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:09,319
system start to work for you again so

1862
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:12,680
this is why I'm saying you know protect

1863
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:14,268
the pots with hay and leaf straw and

1864
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:18,050
leaves

1865
01:17:14,269 --> 01:17:22,400
so that they have that buffer but

1866
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:24,889
they're not just completely exposed or

1867
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:26,299
unexposed to the extremes of danger it

1868
01:17:24,889 --> 01:17:29,599
sounds like you're suggesting that

1869
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:32,538
really what the best way to rehab is

1870
01:17:29,599 --> 01:17:35,779
actually to do preventive because once

1871
01:17:32,538 --> 01:17:39,050
once your hydro runs your pots have gone

1872
01:17:35,779 --> 01:17:41,359
cysts and have become hydrophobic you

1873
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:44,869
you might as well break down the pot and

1874
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:47,359
start over again because breaking down

1875
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:51,049
the pot and starting over is gonna be a

1876
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:53,569
lot easier and might even you know make

1877
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:55,699
more biological sense as well instead of

1878
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:58,308
trying to undo what has already been

1879
01:17:55,698 --> 01:18:00,529
locked up correct and and the other

1880
01:17:58,309 --> 01:18:02,929
thing is that if you're gonna go that

1881
01:18:00,529 --> 01:18:05,929
way um I would highly suggest that you

1882
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:08,809
compost that soil like like don't just

1883
01:18:05,929 --> 01:18:10,849
throw it off spread it around just make

1884
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:13,849
a layer of it so that it's being exposed

1885
01:18:10,849 --> 01:18:16,309
to the moisture underneath let the

1886
01:18:13,849 --> 01:18:18,550
grasses grow up through it let it let

1887
01:18:16,309 --> 01:18:21,429
give it back to nature in a responsible

1888
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:24,349
method because you know I know guys that

1889
01:18:21,429 --> 01:18:25,849
try to reuse their soil resource oil but

1890
01:18:24,349 --> 01:18:27,949
the nutrients have been stripped of it

1891
01:18:25,849 --> 01:18:31,130
and if unless you want to pay you know

1892
01:18:27,948 --> 01:18:32,689
15 20 30 bucks to test each pot to see

1893
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:35,328
what was stripped out of it by your

1894
01:18:32,689 --> 01:18:38,058
cannabis plan cannabis is a nutrient Pig

1895
01:18:35,328 --> 01:18:40,880
I've never met a plant that sits like

1896
01:18:38,059 --> 01:18:42,800
this it sucks it's it's worse than corn

1897
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,630
it sucks the nutrients right out of

1898
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,420
there and that's why a lot of you guys

1899
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:51,170
in the past had made these new packs to

1900
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:52,998
add to your organic matter to make sure

1901
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:54,199
the plant had access to all the things

1902
01:18:52,998 --> 01:18:56,538
it needs

1903
01:18:54,198 --> 01:18:59,149
that's not regenerative because now

1904
01:18:56,538 --> 01:19:00,859
you're buying bags of stuff that are

1905
01:18:59,149 --> 01:19:03,319
coming from all over the world and

1906
01:19:00,859 --> 01:19:06,529
somewhere someone machines crushing and

1907
01:19:03,319 --> 01:19:09,139
stripping this earth and creating scars

1908
01:19:06,529 --> 01:19:11,748
to harvest this stuff so how do you get

1909
01:19:09,139 --> 01:19:14,599
around that sand silt and clay and

1910
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:18,078
biology and organic matter that's how

1911
01:19:14,599 --> 01:19:19,849
you prevent it from stripping so in pots

1912
01:19:18,078 --> 01:19:21,380
you've stripped it you've stripped out

1913
01:19:19,849 --> 01:19:23,929
everything you need so now you're gonna

1914
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:26,150
have to replace those those minerals

1915
01:19:23,929 --> 01:19:27,529
which are expensive to get and expensive

1916
01:19:26,149 --> 01:19:28,359
to test to find out which ones you need

1917
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:31,248
to replace

1918
01:19:28,359 --> 01:19:34,248
so so let's finish up with a little bit

1919
01:19:31,248 --> 01:19:36,859
of talk about no-till because I what I

1920
01:19:34,248 --> 01:19:39,408
think I'm hearing you saying is that

1921
01:19:36,859 --> 01:19:44,228
you're not actually you don't actually

1922
01:19:39,408 --> 01:19:48,408
believe that the the no-till system is

1923
01:19:44,229 --> 01:19:52,159
regenerative because the plant will use

1924
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:54,348
the nutrients that is in the pot and yet

1925
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:56,748
you're not a big fan I'm gay I mean

1926
01:19:54,349 --> 01:19:59,239
think I'm hearing of add and you know

1927
01:19:56,748 --> 01:20:01,488
adding amendments top dressing and then

1928
01:19:59,238 --> 01:20:03,198
watering them in because you're saying

1929
01:20:01,488 --> 01:20:05,598
that these these amendments are often

1930
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:08,388
taken from other places but but what can

1931
01:20:05,599 --> 01:20:10,550
we do perhaps to wildcraft locally and

1932
01:20:08,389 --> 01:20:12,650
top dress so that we can keep these

1933
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:15,469
mature systems because I love starting

1934
01:20:12,649 --> 01:20:17,208
the year with a and already mature

1935
01:20:15,469 --> 01:20:19,130
mycelium

1936
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:22,099
you know system in the pot and

1937
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:24,828
everything seems to thrive more so so if

1938
01:20:22,099 --> 01:20:28,309
we weren't doing no-till and we didn't

1939
01:20:24,828 --> 01:20:30,618
want to ship in you know exotic stuff

1940
01:20:28,309 --> 01:20:33,498
like seabird guano from islands and

1941
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:35,988
stuff like what how should we think

1942
01:20:33,498 --> 01:20:38,630
about using no-till but wildcrafting

1943
01:20:35,988 --> 01:20:47,388
locally all right you went down a rabbit

1944
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:49,029
hole my friend there's a couple

1945
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:51,800
different things going on first of all

1946
01:20:49,029 --> 01:20:54,109
that mycelium alright first of all let's

1947
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:58,309
start with no-till in my mind no-till is

1948
01:20:54,109 --> 01:21:02,089
soil is fields not pots I don't know

1949
01:20:58,309 --> 01:21:05,150
I've struggled really hard with trying

1950
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:09,139
to think of a pot as as no-till as as

1951
01:21:05,149 --> 01:21:12,138
you know regenerative I don't know if if

1952
01:21:09,139 --> 01:21:14,208
you can ever not amend that at some

1953
01:21:12,139 --> 01:21:16,159
point in your time and I hear you on the

1954
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:18,800
mozillian now the Missal 'i'm you're

1955
01:21:16,158 --> 01:21:20,929
seeing is called saprophytic fungi

1956
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:23,510
there are decomposers there they're part

1957
01:21:20,929 --> 01:21:26,840
of a whole the whole soil food web and

1958
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:29,179
they have a very very important purpose

1959
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:32,208
and function the other side of that is

1960
01:21:29,179 --> 01:21:35,090
the mycorrhizae and that is a dad as a

1961
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:38,208
fungi that works directly for the plan

1962
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:40,279
it is infected into the plant cells and

1963
01:21:38,208 --> 01:21:42,079
it's pulling nutrients from outside and

1964
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:44,449
bringing him right into the in

1965
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:46,850
colonel side of that plant and if you if

1966
01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:50,179
you till you lose your my silly you lose

1967
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:53,930
your my crazy every time takes 90 days

1968
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:55,490
to colonize my crazy which means it

1969
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:57,470
takes 90 days to get it up and running

1970
01:21:55,489 --> 01:21:59,929
fully functional that's time you're

1971
01:21:57,470 --> 01:22:01,850
harvesting your plant for some of you so

1972
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:04,100
how is it that you can get that

1973
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:08,300
colonization to occur in that pot and

1974
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:10,520
then harvest the plant and and hopefully

1975
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:13,039
the mycorrhizae spore out and that

1976
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:14,510
they're still there so that next season

1977
01:22:13,039 --> 01:22:17,539
when you plug in your plant

1978
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:20,390
it's there but I don't know is that's

1979
01:22:17,539 --> 01:22:22,609
that's gonna be true and I have yet to

1980
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:25,550
see anybody you know do some test

1981
01:22:22,609 --> 01:22:28,939
studies to see whether that mycorrhizae

1982
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:32,539
over wintered in that pot without a host

1983
01:22:28,939 --> 01:22:35,000
of some kind so that's one interesting

1984
01:22:32,539 --> 01:22:36,949
piece that the saprophytic will be fine

1985
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:40,430
there they'll dill over winter without a

1986
01:22:36,949 --> 01:22:42,439
plan so I get the whole understanding of

1987
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:44,270
like I like my pot ready to go in spring

1988
01:22:42,439 --> 01:22:46,279
and I go that's where I go back to

1989
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:49,640
composting if you build a compost pile

1990
01:22:46,279 --> 01:22:51,139
on top and a round of that pot then

1991
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:53,600
you've maintained all your

1992
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:59,570
microorganisms you know if you if you

1993
01:22:53,600 --> 01:23:01,220
can find a perhaps a small conifer that

1994
01:22:59,569 --> 01:23:03,079
you could plant in there so that there

1995
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:05,360
was some root systems that are still

1996
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:07,970
moving that there was something still

1997
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:10,489
living in there now unfortunately when

1998
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:13,280
it came time to spring you'd have to

1999
01:23:10,489 --> 01:23:15,710
either rip that thing out or cut it so

2000
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:18,439
that you could grow your cannabis in

2001
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:22,579
there but that's kind of the only way I

2002
01:23:18,439 --> 01:23:24,469
can ever like try to to think that that

2003
01:23:22,579 --> 01:23:26,689
would be a regenerative method to

2004
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:28,579
growing in pots and I'm gonna continue

2005
01:23:26,689 --> 01:23:30,199
to bust my head open on this to try to

2006
01:23:28,579 --> 01:23:32,899
figure out a way that I can tell people

2007
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:34,460
right if you do this to your pot you're

2008
01:23:32,899 --> 01:23:37,279
gonna be okay you're gonna be fine in

2009
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:39,949
spring but I just haven't had the time

2010
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:43,219
and and the money to do the research and

2011
01:23:39,949 --> 01:23:45,859
the testing to really prove that or or

2012
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:47,150
come up with a method to doing that so

2013
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:49,699
I'm kind of just shooting from the hip

2014
01:23:47,149 --> 01:23:51,469
here with with this brainstorming with

2015
01:23:49,699 --> 01:23:53,300
you but I mean that's that's the

2016
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:55,280
direction I'd go is find something that

2017
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:57,800
I can put in that pot that's living

2018
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:59,359
and mulch it like it would be in a

2019
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,250
forest so that it doesn't you know

2020
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:03,469
thoroughly freeze maybe it freezes for a

2021
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:04,550
day or two but that's okay it didn't

2022
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:09,680
freeze all the way through like a

2023
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:11,810
friggin rock I guess that would be that

2024
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:15,079
would be my suggestion for for that

2025
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:17,600
right on well uh thank you for ending

2026
01:24:15,079 --> 01:24:19,699
the show with a surprise you know I kind

2027
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,680
of thought I knew what the no-till

2028
01:24:19,699 --> 01:24:24,109
litany was I was gonna get from you and

2029
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:25,430
you in a totally surprising direction

2030
01:24:24,109 --> 01:24:27,589
which is one of the reasons I was

2031
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:29,869
excited to have you on this show so so

2032

you know there are a couple of times

2036
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:39,380
you've made the hair on the back of my

2037
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:41,809
neck stand up just because I could feel

2038
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:43,940
how excited and how you know passionate

2039

you are about this and and it really

2040
01:24:43,939 --> 01:24:49,909
came through and so you you represent a

2041
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:51,530
very unique perspective and we're all

2042
01:24:49,909 --> 01:24:53,389
fortunate to have been able to enjoy it

2043
01:24:51,529 --> 01:24:54,739
so thanks a lot brother Oh Thank You

2044
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:55,820
Shango it's always a pleasure to talk

2045
01:24:54,739 --> 01:24:57,349
with you and I'm looking forward to

2046
01:24:55,819 --> 01:24:58,090
chopping it up some more with you in the

2047
01:24:57,350 --> 01:25:01,820
future

2048
01:24:58,090 --> 01:25:03,289
so if you want to hear more from Layton

2049
01:25:01,819 --> 01:25:04,849
Morrison there's a couple ways you can

2050
01:25:03,289 --> 01:25:08,300
do that so the first way you can do that

2051
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:11,180
is when Layton was explaining the

2052
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:13,789
different horizons there is a particular

2053
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:16,010
image that he uses in his slide

2054
01:25:13,789 --> 01:25:20,119
presentation that is really helpful in

2055
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:23,690
understanding it and that to me and we

2056
01:25:20,119 --> 01:25:26,479
recorded a video a couple weeks ago at

2057
01:25:23,689 --> 01:25:28,939
my house and he goes through it in a

2058
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:31,009
little more detail while you can look at

2059
01:25:28,939 --> 01:25:32,839
that slide since this is a podcast and

2060
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:35,000
you can't actually see the slide feel

2061
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:37,579
field feel free to jump over to the

2062
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,949

and and see what Layton's up to you or

2067
01:25:49,069 --> 01:25:52,849
if you want to drop him a message the

2068
01:25:51,109 --> 01:25:56,049
best way to do that is to go to his

2069
