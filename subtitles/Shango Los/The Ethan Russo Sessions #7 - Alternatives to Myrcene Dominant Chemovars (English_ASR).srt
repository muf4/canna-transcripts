1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:09,879
so Ethan you know very often when you

2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:12,339
speak you you talk about how so much of

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,139
the present cannabis market is is is

4
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:16,179
kima bars that are heavily meer scene

5
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:18,299
based that you travel down the country

6
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:20,739
and it's like mere Seng everywhere and

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,679
and I always want to ask the next

8
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:25,118
question well dr. Russo if there's too

9
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:28,059
much mere scene in all of the

10
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:31,028
commercially available cannabis what

11
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:33,399
would you like there to be so so let's

12
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:35,558
just say that we could you know pie in

13
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:39,128
the sky if you could wave your hands and

14
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:41,409
and have the existence of particular

15
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:44,468
kima bars that were heavy in particular

16
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:46,089
terpenes or terpene profiles what would

17
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:49,510
you like to see if you could just snap

18
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:52,570
your fingers sure will it be a few one

19
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:55,390
would be alpha Pi mean alpha PI means

20
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,640
hard to find in most modern cannabis

21
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,340
kima verse and it is going to be the

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:04,750
King Creon limiting the short term

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,430
memory impairment that THC produces how

24
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,700
it does this is as an

25
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,380
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,070
acetylcholine is the memory molecule on

27
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:18,399
the brain and by preventing its

28
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:21,938
breakdown there's more of it and people

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,299
can think more clearly and so for the

30
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:27,250
patient who has to work or study while

31
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:30,340
trying to treat their pain or other

32
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:33,099
symptoms having a good bit of alpha

33
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,009
pining in the mix is going to be really

34
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:38,559
helpful as a sidebar if somebody if a

35
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:42,009
patient is does need to work and they

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,070
also need to be using cannabis for

37
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:47,680
relief would it help them to be to be

38
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:50,228
using their THC but also have alpha

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,180
pining in an aromatherapy diffuser in

40
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:54,670
the room would they work together like

41
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,189
that well sure if it were from a natural

42
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:01,960
source mm-hmm so if they were using some

43
00:01:57,188 --> 00:02:04,949
kind of pine based essential oil yeah

44
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:07,959
that could help right uh but ideally

45
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,469
would be better to have a cannabis based

46
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:14,379
medicine that had alpha painting in it

47
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:17,409
hopefully replacing some of the Mersey

48
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:19,780
I should mention Mersin isn't all bad

49
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:22,479
I do call it the couch lock factor in

50
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:27,699
cannabis when combined with THC because

51
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:31,659
of its its mark sedative effect a sort

52
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:34,000
of narcotic effect but it is analgesic

53
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:36,939
painkiller in its own right and

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,560
certainly would help with sleep another

55
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:42,099
component there would be really helpful

56
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,770
to have is limonene limonene is a very

57
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:49,439
powerful antidepressant and immune

58
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:54,370
stimulant and so this brightens up the

59
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:57,280
effects of THC and produces a vibrancy

60
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,680
to the experience that clearly are

61
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,370
bigger advantage for someone with a mood

62
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,980
disorder another one would be Lin Ahlul

63
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,050
Lin Ahlul is the main component of

64
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:11,439
lavender essential oil which is well

65
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:13,360
known as an anti-anxiety agent it can

66
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,389
have some sedative effects but it's not

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,110
a knock you out kind of experience like

68
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:24,729
Mersin can be so this is a good one

69
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:26,650
particularly for patients with seizure

70
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:30,819
disorders because it has an

71
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:32,500
anticonvulsant effect as well fourth one

72
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:36,069
that would be really good to have more

73
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,199
of is carrie awfully carry off lean is a

74
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:40,209
really interesting agent it is a

75
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:43,539
terpenoid but at the same time it's a

76
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:47,230
cannabinoid because it works on the cb2

77
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:51,939
receptor teetsi also works on the cb2

78
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:55,689
receptor but actually carry off alene is

79
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:58,449
more effective on this receptor so it

80
00:03:55,689 --> 00:04:02,500
provides anti-inflammatory benefits and

81
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:05,579
pain relief without psycho activity so

82
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:09,069
clearly this is a good thing to have an

83
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:12,670
additional factor with carry off Alina's

84
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:14,259
that he has an anti addictive effect so

85
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,899
this would be extremely helpful for the

86
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:19,899
patient might have chronic pain and be

87
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,709
taking opioids at the same time as their

88
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:24,448
cannabis base

89
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:27,550
Madison so let's just take these four so

90
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:30,759
having more of these individual terpenes

91
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,370
in terpene profiles in Kiev ours is a

92
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,530
great thing what if we took it to an

93
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,168
extreme and said that we had a keema var

94
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:41,709
that had you know a couple percentage of

95
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:45,129
each of those in it do they work as well

96
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:47,228
together or you know you've talked

97
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:49,060
before that that sometimes these these

98
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:52,000
turkeys and cannabinoids if they're by

99
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,319
themself they'll act as an agonist but

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,259
if they're with other things like that

101
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:58,389
an antagonist because they they they mix

102
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:02,830
and match differently is it generally

103
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:05,740
better to have more terpenes and more

104
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:07,629
variety in most cases or really do you

105
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,329
do you really kind of want to breed your

106
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:13,598
cannabis for particular notes and try to

107
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:16,050
stick with those well having the variety

108
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:19,240
terpenoids is going to create a more

109
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:23,460
interesting experience and probably

110
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:27,939
provide more general symptom relief

111
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:30,209
however again if I know the person's

112
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:33,339
condition what we're trying to treat

113
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:37,388
gives me an idea of what terpenoids we

114
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:39,788
might have them look for on again with

115
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:42,009
the lack of diversity in the current

116
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:45,279
market in most areas this is going to be

117
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:47,620
a hard thing to accomplish but again I'm

118
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,739
thinking of this in an aspirational

119
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:53,590
sense that we know that these things can

120
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,680
be an advantage and we want the market

121
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:59,799
to head in the direction of providing

122
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,590
more varied chemo VARs that can provide

123
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,870
the kinds of profiles that are going to

124
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:07,478
be better suited to treating these

125
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,680
conditions right so if you want to hear

126
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:10,418
more about this I've got two great

127
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,269
sources for you in the first comment

128
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:13,959
there'll be a link to Ethan's paper on

129
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:15,668
this topic

130
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:18,189
taming terpenes and then his follow-up

131
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:20,198
paper as well and then also we did about

132
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:22,209
90 minutes on two different episodes so

133
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,218
I three hours on this topic on the

134
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:27,750
shaping fire podcast so check out links

135
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,750
for both of those below thanks Ethan
