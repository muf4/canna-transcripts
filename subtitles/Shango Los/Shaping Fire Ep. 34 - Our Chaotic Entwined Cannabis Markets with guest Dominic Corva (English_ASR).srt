2
00:00:06,378 --> 00:00:10,500
one thing I can tell you for sure is

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,899
that we're doing it wrong we're not

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,099
really legalizing cannabis our state

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,350
governments are allowing some

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,850
normalization of cannabis so tax revenue

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,789
can be raised to feed they're bursting

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,500
budgets but it's a little more than that

9
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:24,090
also regulation at the state level is

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,649
being implemented mostly by folks who

11
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,539
have little understanding of cannabis

12
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:30,268
markets cannabis culture and they

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,219
certainly don't get cannabis patients so

14
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:34,379
far nearly every state to allow and tax

15
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,210
cannabis has done very little to embrace

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,370
and include the prior Prohibition era

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,259
producers what do you think happens when

18
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:42,390
you allow cannabis culture to flourish

19
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,769
and yet restrict participation by the

20
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,480
heritage growers who produce during

21
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,070
Prohibition well of course they just

22
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,288
keep on producing for the unregulated

23
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,000
market like they always have this could

24
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,570
potentially be a huge mess for the

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,670
future of true nationwide legalization

26
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,530
does this mean a new drug war 2.0 where

27
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,448
law enforcement officers could bust

28
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,460
growers not because cannabis is illegal

29
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:06,090
but because they don't have their tax

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,040
stamp this is Boston Tea Party [ __ ] the

31
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,868
states give lip service to decreasing

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,490
diversion to other states but when state

33
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,349
regulators try to dominate a state

34
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:15,719
cannabis market without including the

35
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:17,309
black market they are directly causing

36
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,530
the diversion of product to other states

37
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,060
and for those who choose not to start

38
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,590
shipping out of state their family

39
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,450
cannabis business must be dismantled

40
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,920
even though they were the ones helping

41
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,960
patients and keeping the flame alive

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,079
during the dark days of prohibition and

43
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:33,239
you know what this mess of diversion

44
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,219
neglected patients and unstable markets

45
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,140
when we blamed on cannabis companies

46
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,140
instead of where the blame belongs with

47
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,180
the regulator's who devised the system

48
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,189
we are doing this wrong this thing being

49
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,470
called legalization what we are

50
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,809
experiencing is industrialization of

51
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:50,728
cannabis and the demise of artisan

52
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,359

welcome to the show Dominic I Shango

92
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,950

awesome so glad to have you here it

94
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:13,469
seems like it's been a long time since

95
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,200
last time we talked during the very

96
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:17,430
first episode so here we are again so

97
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,979
thanks for making the time for it I know

98
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,170
your time is valuable well I'm super

99
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,479
stoked to do it you've really done some

100
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:27,238
amazing work on this podcast since that

101
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,969
first one right on dude so hey the

102
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,590
history of cannabis in America is mostly

103
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:33,330
told through its black markets which is

104
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,129
why we're talking about it today and and

105
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:38,040
while there are certainly new markets

106
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:40,259
being created all around the country you

107
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,629
know these these informal markets have

108
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:45,090
lasted generations do you think that

109
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:47,849
it's unrealistic to think that black

110
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,879
markets will disappear simply because a

111
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:53,759
new licensed and taxable market suddenly

112
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,280
comes into existence well the short

113
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,909
answer is yes but I actually want to

114
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,959
commend you on your use of the plural

115
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:03,289
when you're talking about these things

116
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,810
and also how you're actually using

117
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:09,810
several different concepts black markets

118
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,360
informal markets and so I kind of wanted

119
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,729
to start by just reframing things

120
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,989
conceptually a little bit which is to

121
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:21,689
say that the black market singular is a

122
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,179
super problematic concept in so many

123
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:27,689
ways

124
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:31,230
black markets help us get somewhere

125
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:34,620
by describing the heterogeneous nature

126
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:38,540
of the different kinds of illicit

127
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:41,280
informal markets that were talking about

128
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:44,730
and another another

129
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,109
and related notes I've been encountering

130
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,590
and I have encountered in over the years

131
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,509
you know a certain amount of resistance

132
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:54,599
to the term black market it doesn't come

133
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:56,069
from you know an anti black market point

134
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,660
of view but one that is concerned about

135
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:00,839
you know concepts of race and racial

136
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,490
justice and so a lot of folks these days

137
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,799
are a little concerned because they feel

138
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,930
like it's a racist term I maintain that

139
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,660
it's not but I do want to kind of

140
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:12,090
respect the fact that folks are actively

141
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,360
you know working on the stigma aspect of

142
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:17,250
things when they talk through when they

143
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,150
talk about the black markets or informal

144
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,560
markets or whatever so I will also be

145
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:24,479
using you know the terms a little

146
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,000
interchangeably black market illicit

147
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,569
market here's another one for you

148
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,600
legible and illegible markets and to me

149
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:36,120
that gets it more like what the meaning

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:42,450
of a black market is it is something

151
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:44,240
that is very difficult to read right in

152
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,829
no small part obviously because you know

153
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,689
what we know about it comes from stories

154
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:52,829
comes from anecdotes comes through

155
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:54,540
things that kind of trickle into our

156
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:57,409
consciousnesses either and you know face

157
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:01,860
to face conversations or media headlines

158
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:05,669
and so there's a whole range of values

159
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:09,259
attached to discussions about illicit

160
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:11,819
illegible informal black markets um

161
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:13,949
that's kind of hard to do that work and

162
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,980
still talk about it you know with any

163
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,870
sense of clarity but it's very important

164
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:22,980
to note that's you know what we know

165
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:25,350
about illegible markets are stories and

166
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,460
those stories are framed by interests

167
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:31,590
and those interests have certain goals

168
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:35,969
and certainly broadly speaking you know

169
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:37,769
legal cannabis has as one of its goals

170
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:41,580
that you know the mitigation of the

171
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:43,319
black market and of course that's

172
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,019
one of the problems is that when their

173
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,819
story happens it's very singular and

174
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,669
when they're talking about the black

175
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,430
markets what our policymakers thinking

176
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,740
about they're usually thinking about

177
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:59,030
organized crime they're actually not

178
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,990
thinking about you know the reality of

179
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:05,339
informal markets that are highly

180
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:10,319
decentralized livelihood strategies for

181
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:13,799
many people in the United States so I

182
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,689
think that's when the legal market is

183
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,689
talking about getting rid of the black

184
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:20,639
markets let's give them a little bit of

185
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:22,860
credit because you know what they're

186
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,599
thinking of is not actually the reality

187
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,540
you know it's it's a it's part of the

188
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,890
reality and it's one that we should

189
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,879
acknowledge as well that organized crime

190
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:35,310
certainly you know is part of that

191
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,350
ecology of you know illegible markets

192
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,600
that that we want to be able to talk

193
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,340
about and it is also the one that you

194
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,620
know I think there's a public interest

195
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:48,719
in in mitigating you know fairly

196
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:53,579
strongly at the very least with respect

197
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:56,520
to for example you know very large grows

198
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:58,319
on public lands you know that do

199
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:02,209
environmental damage and so forth

200
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,290
I think that's there's an interesting

201
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:07,379
[Music]

202
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:09,870
economic justice concept lurking behind

203
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:14,629
this legal cannabis desire to get rid of

204
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:17,069
black markets because they're able to

205
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:19,110
frame the issue of canvas unlike with

206
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,490
the rest of society as one in which

207
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,060
we're actually kind of concerned about

208
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:27,000
the commercialization of of our economy

209
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,910
and I think that there's a there's kind

210
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,610
of a I think that there's a channeling

211
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,680
going on frustration with how our

212
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,259
economy works and how we'd like it to

213
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:40,549
work into this debate about you know

214
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:42,870
getting rid of black markets and not so

215
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:45,889
with respect to you know the legal

216
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:48,269
cannabis policy makers goal of

217
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:49,799
especially you know diminishing the

218
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:52,350
structural violence associated with

219
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,149
organized crime and so forth and

220
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,409
particularly you know highly commercial

221
00:08:54,149 --> 00:09:00,028
informal markets

222
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:01,620
I think that I think that the response

223
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:03,600
that has to say well you know what like

224
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,129
actually the other informal markets have

225
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
been doing that work for you for a very

226
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:08,550
long time

227
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,078
and part of the problem here is that

228
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:14,278
you're not enlisting them in your

229
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:17,370
project to actually reduce the harm of

230
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:18,659
highly commercial you know you know

231
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,688
barely different from you know

232
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:24,000
exploitative capitalism you know you

233
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:26,039
know cannabis industry which does exist

234
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,309
and also you know looms very large in

235
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:33,809
legal markets so is it unrealistic yeah

236
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:36,299
it's unrealistic especially because

237
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:37,768
they're using the term black market in a

238
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:41,099
singular fashion they're referring to

239
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:43,049
organized crime when in fact medical

240
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,610
markets in formal markets that are

241
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,909
highly decentralized the ones that

242
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:50,310
actually over the last twenty years have

243
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:53,159
made you know us cannabis consumption

244
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:55,859
you a mostly local issue as opposed to

245
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,909
an imported issue and you know they've

246
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,759
been doing that work they've been

247
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:01,649
getting rid of organised crime by over

248
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,800
growing it you know in the same way

249
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:08,370
that's you know you over over grow

250
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:12,028
essentially prohibition so it's a it's

251
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:15,959
an it's an interesting I think framing

252
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:17,789
issue that's you know policymakers they

253
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:22,679
just simply don't understand they don't

254
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:24,539
get the you know pluralism of illicit

255
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,859
and informal markets and how many of

256
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:28,980
them are actually quite socially

257
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,199
beneficial and this range is not just to

258
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,379
like a small little home grower you know

259
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:38,068
with a few plants in the backyard but

260
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:39,389
you know to me it also applies to for

261
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:42,088
exists for example you know in

262
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,919
California the unlicensed dispensed

263
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:46,410
dispensary system that certainly they've

264
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:49,159
been encountering especially in Southern

265
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:52,588
California and the LA area in particular

266
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:54,600
you know over the last 10 to 15 years

267
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:57,889
and my argument has always been actually

268
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,209
that kind of black market transformation

269
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:03,870
has been quite helpful because it gets

270
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:05,669
cannabis off the streets and and it very

271
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,879
least gets it into you you know a

272
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:11,699
situation where you know people

273
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,320
are not you know doing this you know on

274
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,240
the streets and in public and so forth

275
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,940
but there's like place to go to to do it

276
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,830
so you know the range of like the

277
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,890
concern we have about organized crime

278
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,780
and public safety should also recognize

279
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:26,299
the ways in which black markets have

280
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:29,730
been actually dealing with themselves

281
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:31,979
especially because of you know the

282
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,029
medical cannabis or you know gray market

283
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,850
which is still kind of an informal

284
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:38,789
market but a little more legible you

285
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,529
know action that's been going on a final

286
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:45,839
note on the black market situation is

287
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:48,600
that you know policymakers are attaching

288
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,420
a stigma usually unconsciously to

289
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,950
organized crime and it usually is about

290
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,199
actually brown people not black people

291
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,240
because they use this term you know

292
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,980
cartels and Mexican cartels usually is

293
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:04,080
the stand-in for all organized crime so

294
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,019
it's you know it's rare that you hear

295
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,570
like a policymaker you know talk about

296
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:12,899
you know the problem of you know gangs

297
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:15,870
you know opening dispensaries and to me

298
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,250
again whether you view that as problem

299
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,509
or not really depends on whether you

300
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,149
understand that you know what like this

301
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:23,819
actually gets cannabis off the streets

302
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:27,689
and generally detaches it from other

303
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,310
illicit drugs and drug markets you know

304
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:33,030
I think that's a really good point that

305
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:36,029
you make that that that that the people

306
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:39,439
who you and I both know our artisan

307
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:43,379
growers our family growers are small

308
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,660
undercapitalized producers who we think

309
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:48,600
are the you know the backbone of the

310
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:51,959
American heritage grower movement that

311
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,730
that because legislators do are not

312
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,620
really aware of them and don't

313
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,960
necessarily spend time with them and

314
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:01,259
their interaction with those with those

315
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,790
folks are well actually they think that

316
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,340
those folks are all black market they

317
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:08,849
they think unlicensed people are cartels

318
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:12,210
and mass and so they put everybody who's

319
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:15,690
not licensed in one big basket similar

320
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:18,210
to how all of we cannabis activists put

321
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:21,180
all of our legislators in one basket as

322
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:24,420
well as not understanding and try

323
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:25,949
to limit our freedoms and so it seems

324
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:28,409
like we've got it we've got it we've got

325
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,090
a classic negotiation where where each

326
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:32,850
side doesn't know each other very well

327
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,530
yeah yeah I think so but what are the

328
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,990
stakes of one not knowing the other the

329
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:40,319
stakes so much higher for policymakers

330
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,000
because they are you know entrusted by

331
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,360
the public to actually create policy

332
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,919
that works and you know their lack of

333
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,230
understanding is you know what's driving

334
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:54,809
you know let's let's look at Oregon for

335
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,700
example which are already produced way

336
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:59,279
more than it consumes you know years ago

337
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,620
and then with legal cannabis coming in

338
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,959
you know they licensed a whole bunch

339
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,570
more you know new people and new grows

340
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,670
new license grows they you know they

341
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,850
instead of you know integrating the

342
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:13,879
existing producers in Oregon you know

343
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,800
they doubled their problem and now

344
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:20,669
they're calling you know they're blaming

345
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,669
essentially a situation that had

346
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:25,649
developed a long time ago and is not new

347
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:28,379
for exacerbating their oversupply issue

348
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:29,909
right when in fact the proper thing

349
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:31,200
would have been to do would have been

350
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:32,929
like you know don't issue like new

351
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,280
licenses take the people who are already

352
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:38,819
especially in the medical programs and

353
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,589
and and and and integrate them which

354
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,629
they did it first they really did it

355
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,220
first that's how they started was they

356
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:45,779
they said you know adults over the age

357
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,629
of 21 may now just purchase at

358
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:51,120
dispensaries and and and they we can tax

359
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:54,299
that right away right so they kind of

360
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,080
got off on the right foot but then you

361
00:14:54,299 --> 00:15:02,399
know through their accommodation of you

362
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:04,379
know well capitalized interests who also

363
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,449
didn't understand that they were a big

364
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:08,939
problem actually making any money in the

365
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:11,150
system is incredibly you know saturated

366
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,230
as it was

367
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:14,490
they've create a problem that now they

368
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:19,560
want to respond to you with you know

369
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:21,389
more policing which you know has always

370
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:23,639
been more of a price support for the

371
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:27,259
black market then for black markets in

372
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:32,669
general than a something that actually

373
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:34,139
you know controls or diminishes the

374
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:36,649
informal market activities

375
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:39,269
it seems to me that the the only way to

376
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:41,939
combat air quotes a black market is

377
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:44,549
either to make it smaller by brute force

378
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,980
like you know Duarte is doing in the

379
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:48,959
Philippines or by embracing it and

380
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,700
becoming one with it and it seems like

381
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,650
the way that the market is progressing

382
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,920
you know neither is really happening the

383
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:57,059
war on drugs didn't work legislators

384
00:15:54,919 --> 00:16:00,179
generally get that now and they're

385
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:02,459
embracing it more and more and yet you

386
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:04,979
know you already see people who have

387
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:08,519
already received their license in

388
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,320
California snitching on other people who

389
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,850
have not yet gotten their license

390
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,610
because they're all like now that we

391
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:17,250
have our monopoly we want to keep all

392
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,840
the unlicensed sellers out and and like

393
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,029
you were saying them not necessarily

394
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,980
allowing the heritage growers in I mean

395
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:25,529
that's certainly what happened in in

396
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,960
Washington where we had 18 years of

397
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:29,549
medical marijuana that yeah it could use

398
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,129
some regulation and people should have

399
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:34,769
been doing more you know lab testing

400
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:37,710
once they got access to it but by taking

401
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:40,220
that entire market and saying you can't

402
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:44,250
play in licensed cannabis

403
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:46,350
our Washington 502 market and now we're

404
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:50,070
seeing it happen in Oregon in California

405
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:53,430
it is structurally creating a black

406
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:55,710
market by not letting everyone play and

407
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,839
do you think that they're realizing that

408
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,519
they're doing that or do you think that

409
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,259
the fact that oh my gosh the black

410
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,389
market is sustaining even though we're

411
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:05,369
air quotes letting them have their weed

412
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:07,078
right do you do you think that they know

413
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,039
they're creating this black market or do

414
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:10,709
you think that they are just this

415
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,539
ignorant to how social policy is going

416
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:15,299
to interact with the economic policy

417
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:17,670
well I mean I think that they just lack

418
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:20,159
knowledge whatsoever of the dynamics of

419
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:23,610
cannabis markets I think that that's

420
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,829
probably the biggest issue but I do want

421
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:29,399
to kind of point out something else

422
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:32,609
which is that the the licensed cannabis

423
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,700
market is being set up so that you have

424
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:37,919
to be highly commercial because if you

425
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,850
are not highly commercial and efficient

426
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,930
and able it generates volume at scale

427
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:44,819
you will not be able to stay open

428
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,330
because you will not be able to pay your

429
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:49,668
taxes which are all extremely

430
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:52,129
hi you know you will not be able to pay

431
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,929
your license fees you will not be able

432
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,419
to you know bribe your local city

433
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:58,580
council to not have a ban hey you know

434
00:17:56,419 --> 00:18:01,788
which is how it works especially in

435
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:03,648
California you know what they're doing

436
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:07,278
is actually taking a critique of

437
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:09,018
informal markets that is founded in like

438
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:12,288
basically I think a well-grounded fear

439
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:14,329
of like what commercial you know markets

440
00:18:12,288 --> 00:18:17,148
do which is they don't have any regard

441
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:20,839
whatsoever for you know social or public

442
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:22,579
you know benefits or positive things for

443
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:24,589
society other than generating money and

444
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:27,619
they're creating a system that is just

445
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:30,558
that is just just for commercial highly

446
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:33,288
industrialised exploitative you know

447
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:37,250
for-profit no room to do any good in

448
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:42,500
society you know actors it's it's it's

449
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:44,659
you know yeah and I don't know what to

450
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,599
say about that other than like okay you

451
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:51,019
have a fear of you know unbridled

452
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:56,558
capitalism basically so your response is

453
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:58,929
to create unbridled capitalism you know

454
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,250
and it's it's highly counterproductive

455
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,019
it's like once you're talking about the

456
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:07,190
license market now you assume all the

457
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:08,870
licensed actors are all you know good

458
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:12,048
guys there's no stigma attached to them

459
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:13,489
and especially if they've got a whole

460
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:16,099
bunch of investment money behind them

461
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,210
you know you know from the financial

462
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:20,329
sector which has been wrecking our

463
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:25,069
economy for the last you know who knows

464
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:26,599
how long 30 years roughly Wow you know

465
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:28,480
there's that so that's a lot to chew on

466
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:30,859
you know the idea that the the

467
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,470
regulator's you know they're essentially

468
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:34,038
driving without a map that's that's

469
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,288
scary

470
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:38,329
in and of itself yeah and and the fact

471
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:41,179
that you know by the wave of their pen

472
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:45,500
they are you know destroying small

473
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:48,110
family income and and you know not no

474
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,058
longer holding a place for patients it's

475
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:51,678
an awful lot of power for people who

476
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:53,658
don't know what the hell is going on I

477
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,210
would like to mean maybe I'm too

478
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:58,130
idealistic to think that to the people

479
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,890
who are making policy would at the very

480
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,320
least get consultants who

481
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,870
stand what's going on in the cannabis

482
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:08,029
market is is no one speaking to them and

483
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:10,279
giving them the truth that they can they

484
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:14,930
can make policy bake based on the

485
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:17,000
reality of how cannabis markets work so

486
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:19,820
there's two sides to that I think that

487
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,319
in very highly uneven and localized

488
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,480
fashion there are a lot of

489
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:26,539
municipalities that are more sensitive

490
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,940
to that than others you can look at you

491
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:32,480
know the Bay Area's equity programs and

492
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,070
you know they're criminal the criminal

493
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,079
record expunged meant part of California

494
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:38,960
you can look at LA's appointment of cat

495
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,279
Paco to be in charge of you know what

496
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,259
they're doing and that's someone with us

497
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,649
you know the Civil Liberties and social

498
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:49,039
justice background you know it's

499
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:52,370
happening but it's highly uneven and you

500
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,589
know to some extent it's not just sort

501
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:57,019
of an issue with the policymakers ie the

502
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:59,449
the legislators who are making the laws

503
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:02,180
but it's the bureaucrats making the

504
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:06,559
rules and the bureaucrats making the

505
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:08,720
rules are not that concerned you know

506
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,649
about the reality of markets they're

507
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,870
much more concerned about the reality of

508
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:18,650
politics and in particular federal

509
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:21,649
politics and so you know there's there's

510
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:25,790
an element to which you could argue you

511
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:27,440
know the Washington system it really was

512
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:30,500
not rolled out with any real concern

513
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,049
over you know justice in the markets or

514
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,740
economic justice they just wanted to you

515
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:39,139
know get that system going and do it in

516
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:42,640
a way that modeled deference to federal

517
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:44,900
prohibition and I think that like

518
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:50,120
there's nothing controversial about that

519
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:56,120
statement it's quite clear I think from

520
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:57,829
the LCB director from you know from the

521
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:01,369
folks are particularly well associated

522
00:21:57,829 --> 00:22:03,559
with how our system is gone that's what

523
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:06,679
they're doing is advertising to the feds

524
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:08,210
that the feds you know don't come get us

525
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,000
you know go get somebody else but don't

526
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:12,799
go get us so they'll take you know

527
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,720
confusion with the markets they'll take

528
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,308
a complete breakdown

529
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,640
the traceability system it's supposed to

530
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:20,960
be you know that the cornerstone of why

531
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,990
it is the feds aren't supposed to come

532
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,409
get us they'll take that all day long

533
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:30,558
you know as long as the appearance of

534
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:32,780
deference to you know a federal

535
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,369
department justice is there and I think

536
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:37,399
that that's becoming a little more

537
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:39,949
generalized as well I think that's the

538
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:44,710
way it's evolved towards deference to

539
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:47,569
the feds is a reflection of the licensed

540
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,640
industry's desires not to get crackdown

541
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:51,649
by the feds not just the policy makers

542
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,159
desire not to have you know public

543
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:59,750
employees get arrested I think that as

544
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:03,919
the license you know the license market

545
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:07,640
grows those people are managing risk and

546
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:10,280
the way they manage risk is you know

547
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,840
well who could come get us and if you've

548
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:13,908
got a lot of a lot of investment money

549
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,788
you know your your concern is with the

550
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:18,620
feds it's not with local police it's not

551
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:21,408
with them traceability breakdowns

552
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:24,548
whatever if there are you know millions

553
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:28,039
of dollars in no financial system cash

554
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:29,929
you know propping up your operation yes

555
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:32,750
you want to you want to actually crack

556
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:34,610
down on anybody who's not licensed

557
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:38,298
not just because to protect your own

558
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:42,529
competition but to you know protect your

559
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:43,879
place in the market going forward so you

560
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:46,428
know there's certainly a you know a

561
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,250
greedy aspect to that but there's also

562
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:51,259
just sort of a risk management financial

563
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:55,069
risk management aspect to that that's

564
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:59,179
it's just cold blooded calculated you

565
00:23:55,069 --> 00:24:00,589
know no concern for you know how it

566
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:02,600
affects the rest of society and in

567
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:04,129
particular the people were able to get

568
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:06,558
by because they participate in this

569
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,570
particular informal market yeah that's a

570
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,629
really good point if if if what is

571
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:14,000
making the policy is the folks who are

572
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:16,640
bringing the fresh capital into the

573
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,250
cannabis market and their primary role

574
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,520
is to decrease the risk of the capital

575
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,230
the the the idea of decreasing the risk

576
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:25,430
for the capital does not leave a whole

577
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:28,640
lot of room

578
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:31,279
for for patients and small artisan folks

579
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,080
and the lack of the need of like huge

580
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,430
security systems so so let's go ahead

581
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,779
and take our first short break and be

582
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,910
right back you're listening to shaping

583
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:40,129
fire and my guest today is Dominick

584
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,550
korva of the Center for the Study of

585
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:46,040
cannabis and social policy while I

586
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:48,349
certainly still enjoy smoking joints I

587
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,359
moved over to using vaporizers about

588
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:51,919
three years ago the high was a little

589
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:53,809
different than burning the flower and in

590
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,850
the end I decided I preferred it for

591
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:58,309
daily use especially because I have

592
00:24:55,849 --> 00:25:01,099
asthma more importantly though I could

593
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:02,720
taste my flower so much more it's hard

594
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:04,699
to express to you how significantly

595
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,710
different cannabis with a good terpene

596
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,289
profile tastes when vaped

597
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,640
instead of burned I have brought my vape

598
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:12,559
with me to visit growers and they are

599
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,940
astonished by the clarity of taste and

600
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,490
they say they feel like they're tasting

601
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,370
their flower for the very first time the

602
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:21,769
air vape vaporizer from air vape usa.com

603
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:23,869
is a great device to use on the go or at

604
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:25,700
home when you pick it up and feel

605
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:27,679
satisfying like a medical device

606
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,809
it isn't flimsy like many vape Tsar I

607
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,029
like how the flower is inserted in the

608
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:33,950
top instead of the bottom so travels are

609
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:35,539
shorter path to my mouth with the

610
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,340
cannabis at the top I get a hit that

611
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:39,289
feels more substantial even though I'm

612
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:41,899
just inhaling vapor and not full-bodied

613
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:44,269
smoke since I used this vape for flower

614
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,769
hash and concentrates I really liked it

615
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:47,930
the digital control for the temperature

616
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:49,339
is right there on the front three clicks

617
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,289
of the button and it fires up to the

618
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:53,899
temperature I specify really quickly and

619
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:56,329
discreetly you know vape concentrates

620
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,830
are a milder experience than dabbing but

621
00:25:56,329 --> 00:26:00,019
you still get the potency in your hit

622
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:02,809
also the taste is great as would be

623
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:04,759
expected with a low temp tab I love that

624
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:05,750
this vape gives quick little vibrations

625
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:08,359
when it gets to the right temperature

626
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,829
that way if I'm chatting or distracted

627
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:12,289
while it's heating up it lets me know

628
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:14,869
when it's ready if you are ready for a

629

Shango Louis and our guest this week is

673
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:54,149
Dominic Kaurava executive director of

674
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:56,700
the Center for the Study of cannabis and

675
00:27:54,148 --> 00:27:58,408
social policy so you know before the

676
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,719
break we were talking a lot about a lot

677
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:03,089
about the misunderstandings that

678
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:06,389
legislators have about the cannabis

679
00:28:03,088 --> 00:28:09,598
market as a whole and why they're acting

680
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:11,038
on this through regulation is tending to

681
00:28:09,598 --> 00:28:12,678
both kind of make a mess of the

682
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,239
situation but more importantly

683
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,190
sustaining the informal unlicensed

684
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:19,649
market that they're trying to get rid of

685
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:21,450
and you know we all understand that and

686
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:23,069
that many regulators even though more of

687
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,200
them understand cannabis than there used

688
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:27,418
to be so many of the regulator's just

689
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,229
don't understand that a cannabis is not

690
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:33,509
an unhealthy bad thing but then also be

691
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:35,429
we all know that they want to get their

692
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:37,259
money from the cannabis because they're

693
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:38,940
like oh wow we've got new money to make

694
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:41,909
our budget bigger so that we can take

695
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,979
care of our pet programs but me as as as

696
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:46,320
someone who thinks cannabis is a

697
00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:49,130
positive thing I'm not really all that

698
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,259
into the state adding a sin

699
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:54,530
tax you know si n like they do with

700
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:57,319
alcohol or using of gasoline where they

701
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:59,359
are the attacks kind of discourages use

702
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,460
or says if you want to use this product

703
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,679
you have to pay extra because it's not

704
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:06,700
good for you I don't understand where

705
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,710
the government gets its right to tax

706
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:15,259
cannabis where does that go work

707
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:18,230
historically Dominic well there are a

708
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:20,779
number of things going on here and and

709
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:22,849
first let me say that's you know I'm not

710
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:26,149
sure the the sort of right to tax frame

711
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:28,039
is I mean it definitely gets us going so

712
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:31,250
let's just roll with it you know

713
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:35,299
obviously the government as a term

714
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:38,809
refers to a whole huge ecology of you

715
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:40,940
know public sector bureaucracies you

716
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:43,730
know from the federal down to the very

717
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:46,700
local level and you know in each state

718
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:49,160
there are different powers to tax that

719
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,799
are you know permit or not so obviously

720
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:54,290
in the state of Washington we are not

721
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:58,009
allowed to have an income tax so let's

722
00:29:54,289 --> 00:30:00,559
start there that makes it very very

723
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:04,879
important for the legislature to be able

724
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:07,399
to fund public programs many of which

725
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,770
are absolutely essential such as public

726
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,800
education they've got to find that money

727
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:15,769
somewhere and they can't tax income so

728
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:18,109
they tax property and they do sales

729
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:19,430
taxes well and they have you know taxes

730
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:23,779
and there are the business taxes and so

731
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:26,750
forth most of those business taxes you

732
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:29,480
know also disproportionately punished

733
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,859
small businesses as opposed to large

734
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,740
corporations that can achieve

735
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:35,959
efficiencies of scale and manage

736
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:39,230
departments that you know you know pay

737
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:42,019
people to avoid taxes and you know all

738
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:44,240
sorts of things so the whole thing is

739
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:50,029
already the tax regime in the state of

740
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:52,339
Washington is set up to so really you

741
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:54,230
know it's there because we need the

742
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:55,879
money for public programs some of which

743
00:30:54,230 --> 00:31:00,319
you know we may like some which will may

744
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:02,900
not but we can't tax income which means

745
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,429
that you know this five-year boom

746
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,920
in Washington state especially in King

747
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:08,539
County Seattle around Amazon as the

748
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,180
state has not really benefited from that

749
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:12,859
much at all because they have not been

750
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,110
able to raise money from income so they

751
00:31:12,859 --> 00:31:17,839
have been raising you know property

752
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:20,299
taxes which raises rents you know

753
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:23,000
they've been you know increasing their

754
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:25,220
capacity to find and collect fines you

755
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,779
know so what's happening with cannabis

756
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,850
industry actually has a parallel what's

757
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:31,190
going on in the rest of the state in

758
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:35,689
terms of the relation between taxation

759
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:38,240
and and and the public good now it's one

760
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,620
thing to like sort of like put that into

761
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,990
perspective and say that actually the

762
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:44,899
canvas industry's best move would be to

763
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:48,890
lobby for state income tax to replace

764
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:50,090
sales taxes that would be I think one of

765
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:53,390
the smartest things the cannabis

766
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:54,678
industry could do because the state is

767
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:57,110
raking it in at thirty five percent

768
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:00,500
excise tax and they don't want a penny

769
00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:02,808
less of that right so to replace that

770
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,289
you would essentially have to find a way

771
00:32:02,808 --> 00:32:07,579
to replace that revenue and most obvious

772
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:10,460
place to replace that revenue would be

773
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:12,740
to tax all these higher incomes that

774
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:15,200
have been created in in Seattle around

775
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:17,950
Amazon in particular um

776
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,019
then there's the level of Taxation and

777
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,160
here I actually just stay on Washington

778
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:25,400
for now like you can get to the other

779
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,050
states in it in a moment I want to

780
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,590
actually take a moment to praise mark

781
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:30,529
Kleiman

782
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:31,819
really weirdly enough I who at the very

783
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:34,460
beginning of this one of the things that

784
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:37,159
he did point out was that the state is

785
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:43,519
going to face a challenge not to get

786
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:45,200
addicted to taxes basically that's once

787
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,879
once they start raking in the money

788
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,929
they're not going to stop breaking it in

789
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,510
and they're gonna find different ways to

790
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:51,950
really monetize these revenue flows now

791
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:54,679
especially in the context of the state

792
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,058
budget that remains broke right it's as

793
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:58,940
broke as it was during the financial

794
00:32:56,058 --> 00:33:00,859
crisis ten years ago because again we

795
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,470
haven't been able actually raise income

796
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:05,689
taxes so there's all this wealth around

797
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:09,049
and no money to manage it we have this

798
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:10,580
massive homeless crisis and apparently

799
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:13,490
you no money no money to really deal

800
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:15,649
with that you know we remain completely

801
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,519
in the hole in public education spending

802
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,820
our infant

803
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:22,909
structure you know his you know decaying

804
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:24,950
as in the rest of the country uh and so

805
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:27,049
you know I do think that you know

806
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:29,869
collecting taxes on cannabis isn't

807
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:33,168
necessarily a problem but the problem is

808
00:33:29,868 --> 00:33:35,449
at what rates and and and the justice

809
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:37,038
for that rates gonna depend on well what

810
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,609
kinds of business are being taxed

811
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:43,278
you know if it's small businesses then

812
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:44,989
really high honors taxes is going to put

813
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:47,989
them out of business and centralize the

814
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:49,569
the actual you know legal markets and of

815
00:33:47,989 --> 00:33:52,129
course what that is going to encourage

816
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:53,358
on many fronts is the folks are better

817
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,488
than a below hanging in the legal market

818
00:33:53,358 --> 00:33:58,428
because of the taxes are actually going

819
00:33:55,489 --> 00:33:59,088
to you know create new avenues of the

820
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:02,179
black market

821
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:04,009
right so diversion basically that this

822
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:06,379
is not just simply a function of like

823
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:09,409
criminality it's a function of you know

824
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:11,210
opportunity and also you know what does

825
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:14,048
that business owner facing you know how

826
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:16,730
are they able to pay the rent on

827
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:19,818
facilities that you know have a

828
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:22,398
six-month delay in licensing because the

829
00:34:19,818 --> 00:34:26,088
city hasn't gotten to it yet or the LCB

830
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:28,338
hasn't gotten to it yet and so like you

831
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:30,349
know they're almost forced to you know

832
00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:33,019
operate the ones who come from you know

833
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:35,149
the illicit market in a way that like

834
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:37,788
floats the boat until you can actually

835
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:40,278
get revenue coming in right so you know

836
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:43,069
the high taxes whether or not they're

837
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:45,318
there you know they're just or not they

838
00:34:43,068 --> 00:34:47,869
certainly seem counterproductive with

839
00:34:45,318 --> 00:34:50,449
respect incentivizing diversion in

840
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:55,909
particular and that's you know at every

841
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:57,919
level at the other the other end of it

842
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:59,720
really you know it's because you know in

843
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,880
Washington State we hand it to the

844
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:04,159
liquor Liquor Control Board right and

845
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,068
look patrol board took a look at their

846
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:10,639
own history of you know emerging from

847
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:12,048
alcohol prohibition and you know has

848
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,699
attempted to sort of copy that even

849
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:16,608
though canvas prohibition alfalfa Bush

850
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:18,500
II have are not a very much alike and

851
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:21,199
neither a cannabis and alcohol broadly

852
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,929
speaking you know you could talk about

853
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,548
cannabis and wine you know you could

854
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:28,308
talk about even canvas and liquor when

855
00:35:25,548 --> 00:35:29,789
it comes to you know concentrates and so

856
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:31,680
forth but the end

857
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:36,090
they you have this tax on cannabis

858
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:39,329
products that actually is really really

859
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:41,730
takes a bite out of you know the

860
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:43,949
botanical product you know at the same

861
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,889
level that it takes the bite out of

862
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:49,349
these highly processed edibles

863
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:51,329
concentrates and so forth so the tax

864
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:55,739
regime is kind of just screwed in

865
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:57,599
general its counterproductive is it just

866
00:35:55,739 --> 00:36:01,289
is it right is there right yeah there's

867
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,719
a right to do so but again like what's

868
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:07,139
what's the driving force behind this

869
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:09,119
well driving force is that in you know

870
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:13,259
the beginning of the 21st century our

871
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,509
public budgets are broke and they're

872
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:18,990
broke because of a you know 3040 year

873
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:24,290
long process that is seeing essentially

874
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:27,719
the privatization of gains in society

875
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:30,480
way beyond the ability of the states and

876
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:33,149
legitimacy state to actually collect you

877
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,619
know attacks on the wealth that's being

878
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:37,680
produced by the society that we're

879
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:40,170
creating so there's a long term bigger

880
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:43,710
problem here and that is economic

881
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:46,110
inequality in this country and you know

882
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:49,260
the high taxes here and there have

883
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:54,120
everything to do with that and the

884
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:57,140
question is well you know what do we do

885
00:36:54,119 --> 00:37:00,839
about that how do we fund you know

886
00:36:57,139 --> 00:37:03,239
public spending well first you have to

887
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,190
actually agree on the idea that public

888
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:09,419
spending is a good idea versus a bad

889
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:12,269
idea and I don't know that like I think

890
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:15,420
in this country like we've gone to a

891
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:19,739
place where really like because we don't

892
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:21,480
see much return for what are you know

893
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:22,739
what little pittance we actually you

894
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,800
know provide for public servants to

895
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:28,229
actually create infrastructure create

896
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,490
you know social safety nets and so forth

897
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,099
those are just gone

898
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:34,139
you know we don't spend money on things

899
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:37,650
that actually help the people who need

900
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:40,859
it it is a legitimate kind of revulsion

901
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:42,309
not funding you know that the stuff that

902
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,519
we fund the 280 attack

903
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:47,289
is that are actually you know a large

904
00:37:44,518 --> 00:37:49,748
source of revenue for the federal

905
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:53,979
government right now you know that goes

906
00:37:49,748 --> 00:37:57,488
straight into you know a budget which is

907
00:37:53,978 --> 00:38:00,129
like you know 56% defense and an

908
00:37:57,489 --> 00:38:02,170
ever-shrinking you know percentage of

909
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:05,170
actual you know social safety nets you

910
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:07,479
know spending and so forth so it sounds

911
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:09,699
to me that that actually in how I asked

912
00:38:07,478 --> 00:38:11,558
the question I wasn't actually looking

913
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:15,009
at the perspective large enough it's

914
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:17,949
like yeah maybe a sin tax on cannabis is

915
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:21,130
not really justified or appropriate

916
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:23,438
based on the product but no one's

917
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:25,390
looking at it from that regard they're

918
00:38:23,438 --> 00:38:28,989
looking at it as oh my god we've got

919
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:31,929
this under FUD funded budget and how we

920
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:34,509
do state budgets is wrong and therefore

921
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:36,759
we just need to pour money on the beast

922
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:39,028
to buy us through another budgetary

923
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:43,449
cycle and therefore we're gonna have

924
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:45,759
massive taxes on cannabis because

925
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:47,199
there's not really anybody pushing back

926
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:49,748
and you know even though you've been yes

927
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:51,729
Washington is your examples it seems

928
00:38:49,748 --> 00:38:54,188
like this is the same way it's playing

929
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:56,228
out in every state and is about to play

930
00:38:54,188 --> 00:38:58,659
out in California yes there's no

931
00:38:56,228 --> 00:39:02,558
question I think that that's absolutely

932
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:06,129
absolutely the case well well that

933
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:07,869
certainly is saddening right because I

934
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:12,729
was kind of hoping we'd come out of this

935
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:15,729
with some kind of of path to try to undo

936
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:19,239
cannabis tax and that sounds like it's

937
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:21,548
wildly naive of me because before we can

938
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:24,338
get rid of the cannabis tax even though

939
00:39:21,548 --> 00:39:27,728
they just got it we would have to both

940
00:39:24,338 --> 00:39:29,889
fix how the budget is even made which is

941
00:39:27,728 --> 00:39:32,108
a monumental problem and now you're

942
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:35,679
saying that we would have to replace the

943
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:38,199
money as well and and those those are

944
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:41,108
both a lot bigger a lot bigger than just

945
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:43,119
cannabis so what do you let me give you

946
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:47,048
an example of you know a contradiction

947
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,608
which is you know the founder of the

948
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:52,838
Washington kanna Business Association

949
00:39:48,608 --> 00:39:55,088
Martin Tobias who certainly doesn't like

950
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:56,210
that 37% tax and certainly doesn't like

951
00:39:55,088 --> 00:40:00,049
the 280e tax

952
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:00,849
is also one of the big you know funders

953
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,500
of

954
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:10,010
the folks who keep washing state from

955
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:11,358
having an income tax so it's like if he

956
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:14,990
gets to have his cake and eat it too

957
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:16,670
right which is that like yeah there's

958
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:18,259
high taxes but it's driving out the

959
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,940
smaller businesses and and the bigger

960
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,250
businesses can consolidate and take over

961
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:25,039
the market the cost of those high taxes

962
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:27,710
in the short term is unpleasant but

963
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,420
really like there is no alternative

964
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:31,670
because he's standing in the way of

965
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,800
there being an income tax right and

966
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:38,680
people like him and people like him

967
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:40,760
include again every highly capitalized

968
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:42,588
investment fund investing in marijuana

969
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,290
because those people also work against

970
00:40:42,588 --> 00:40:47,838
actually a just and equitable taxation

971
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:50,179
system and then and and and here we go

972
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:52,639
with really you know one of the issues

973
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:54,739
in legal cannabis besides people

974
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,440
snitching which is that the legal

975
00:40:54,739 --> 00:41:00,199
cannabis people are not interested in

976
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,630
creating a fair or just economy they

977
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:08,179
have no interest in it whatsoever

978
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:10,519
and I think that's the way that they're

979
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:12,529
able to both complain about the cannabis

980
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:14,838
you know taxes but at the same time do

981
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:16,550
you absolutely nothing on their part to

982
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:18,409
you know create a society that actually

983
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:21,650
could in which we could afford to reduce

984
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:26,088
those taxes is to me something worth

985
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:29,000
keeping in mind yeah that makes a lot of

986
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:32,210
sense and it seems to me that going

987
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,608
forward with everybody looking out for

988
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,349
themselves we're probably gonna get more

989
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:40,098
of this the patients are looking out for

990
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:43,490
themselves the the legislators are

991
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:45,380
looking for their own re-elections and

992
00:41:43,489 --> 00:41:47,689
their ability to meet budgets so they're

993
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,970
not embarrassed and the cannabis

994
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:53,420
business owners that are on of a you

995
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:55,309
know a more capitalized size they're

996
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:58,700
looking to protect their markets and so

997
00:41:55,309 --> 00:42:00,829
we've got not very much coming together

998
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:01,879
in the middle let's go ahead and take

999
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:03,769
another short break and be right back

1000
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,809
you're listening to shaping fire and my

1001
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:07,369
guest today is Dominick korva of the

1002
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:08,730
Center for the Study of cannabis and

1003
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:10,980
social policy

1004
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,358
now that the health benefits of terpenes

1005
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,460
have become well-known in the cannabis

1006
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:16,230
industry people everywhere are looking

1007
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,570
for the purest terpenes without

1008
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:20,219
adulterants the problem with most

1009
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:22,289
terpene providers is that they're not

1010
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:24,539
sourced naturally and instead our main

1011
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:27,750
is a byproduct of refining petroleum and

1012
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:29,759
that's so sketchy the terpenes sold by

1013
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:32,760
true terpenes are entirely different

1014
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,859
they are certified organic non-gmo and

1015
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,260
food grade that means they are extracted

1016
00:42:34,858 --> 00:42:39,239
from real plant sources there are no

1017
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,280
solvents of any kind used during the

1018
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:43,828
extraction process they are distilled

1019
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,950
only with steam that's right only steam

1020
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:49,200
in fact terpenes from true terpenes are

1021
00:42:46,949 --> 00:42:50,909
so pure that you can eat them not only

1022
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,919
that but you can stack them with better

1023
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:55,078
results - what I mean is

1024
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,210
other companies terpenes have got a few

1025
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:59,099
percent of impurities and when you stack

1026
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:00,539
those terpenes to make a blend you're

1027
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:03,480
adding a variety of impurities that

1028
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:06,420
degrade your final product true terpenes

1029
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,070

1030

Shango Lowe's and our guest this week is

1091
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,730
dominic korba executive director of the

1092
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,250
Center for the Study of cannabis and

1093
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:25,769
social policy so during the first set we

1094
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:28,500
we talked about why the informal market

1095
00:45:25,769 --> 00:45:30,690
the unlicensed market still exists even

1096
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,760
in states that have got a regulated

1097
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:35,639
licensed market and why they're probably

1098
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,650
going to continue to exist for the

1099
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:39,389
foreseeable future and during the second

1100
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:42,480
set we focus very much on the idea of

1101
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:44,489
taxation and and the reason why that's

1102
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,519
happening and also you know the damage

1103
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:52,108
it's doing in this third set I'd like to

1104
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:55,048
talk about the the kind of market we are

1105
00:45:52,108 --> 00:45:58,019
creating in the license market because

1106
00:45:55,048 --> 00:46:01,318
you know any that the personality of any

1107
00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:04,650
market is created both by the people who

1108
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:08,159
are in it and the regulatory structures

1109
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:10,349
that guide it and I've got real concerns

1110
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:13,250
about the corporatization of cannabis

1111
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:17,010
which historically has been this healing

1112
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:18,269
patient centric even for fun right even

1113
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,710
if you're gonna get high and go out in

1114
00:46:18,269 --> 00:46:22,858
the forest you were out in the forest

1115
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:24,750
being high and hiking and there was no

1116
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:27,179
regulatory structure but this new

1117
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:29,309
regulatory structure and the people who

1118
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:31,739
are coming to the market I'm not so

1119
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:34,559
confident that the the market that we

1120
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:36,349
are creating is all that healthy what

1121
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:40,590
are your thoughts

1122
00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:43,650
well we're we're creating you know an

1123
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:45,269
industrial market right so corporate and

1124
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:48,829
industrial are kind of two terms that

1125
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:53,880
want to tie together but industrial

1126
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:56,009
largely means that's you know it's it's

1127
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,250
it's highly centralized it's it's

1128
00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:02,580
attempting to you know use economies of

1129
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:04,460
scale and branding and marketing to

1130
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:07,139
create value for shareholders

1131
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,940
shareholders in particular not

1132
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:12,000
necessarily for low wage minimum workers

1133
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,200
minimum wage workers trimmers bud

1134
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,610
tenders and all getting paid twelve

1135
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:19,169
fifteen dollars an hour there's a

1136
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,640
there's a difference between like kind

1137
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:25,619
of that model which is you know

1138
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:27,000
corporatists industrial and what we're

1139
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:29,369
talking about we're talking about what

1140
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,690
was good about you know the other kind

1141
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:34,920
of black market which was the

1142
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:39,570
decentralized craft version which sprung

1143
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:41,430
up and in many ways is the one that has

1144
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:45,690
been turning back the tide of you know

1145
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:48,239
industrial cannabis you know imports

1146
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:50,190
from you know mexico by what are

1147
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:51,329
essentially you know black market

1148
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:54,690
capitalist drug trafficking

1149
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:56,099
organizations so i think that it's

1150
00:47:54,690 --> 00:48:01,409
unfortunate we've gotten to the point

1151
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:04,679
where the legal market wants to create

1152
00:48:01,409 --> 00:48:09,899
this industrial corporates you know a

1153
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:14,579
model of what a legal cannabis market is

1154
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:18,450
allowed to be and their main enemy seems

1155
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:21,480
to be you know craft producers who

1156
00:48:18,449 --> 00:48:24,750
really like aren't even in direct

1157
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:27,240
competition usually with with the new

1158
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:29,340
sort of legal cannabis industry which is

1159
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:30,899
you know heavy on the edibles and the

1160
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,269
concentrates and the bait pens and so

1161
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:36,090
forth and you know certainly there's

1162
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:37,440
flour but that flour is not really you

1163
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:41,430
know because it's happening at scale

1164
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:46,110
it's it's just it's it's it's not you

1165
00:48:41,429 --> 00:48:47,909
know it's hard to the consumer to

1166
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:49,440
purchase it based on anything other

1167
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:51,598
you know what's on the package right

1168
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,950
it's not the canvas itself matters it's

1169
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:59,490
the package and so we're we're we're

1170
00:48:55,949 --> 00:49:01,348
allowing for you know the continuity of

1171
00:48:59,489 --> 00:49:03,298
what to me is an economically

1172
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:07,380
destructive model the corporatist

1173
00:49:03,298 --> 00:49:10,920
industrial model from that particular

1174
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:13,079
kind of black market and we're kidding

1175
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,900
it against as though it could possibly

1176
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:18,780
be against you know craft cannabis which

1177
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:21,750
by the way you know isn't suffering from

1178
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:24,930
problem over supply is not having you

1179
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:28,829
know issues with you know pesticides and

1180
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:31,618
so forth and is in fact you know getting

1181
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:33,809
to people who and you know do not have

1182
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:35,608
you know the financial means to purchase

1183
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:39,420
legal cannabis because taxes to all and

1184
00:49:35,608 --> 00:49:41,038
so forth so you know there's a there's a

1185
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,450
limited extent to which those markets

1186
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,030
are really competing with each other and

1187
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:47,129
it's it's to me it's more of the legal

1188
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:49,798
cannabis is creating these new cannabis

1189
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:51,750
products that are aimed towards new

1190
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:53,190
cannabis consumers and older people and

1191
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:56,730
so forth and that's great that's one of

1192
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:58,500
the positive things that's happening and

1193
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:00,510
there's plenty of room for development

1194
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:03,298
on the edibles side and the concentrate

1195
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:06,599
side and the vape pen side for new users

1196
00:50:03,298 --> 00:50:09,599
but for cannabis culture enthusiasts who

1197
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:11,640
prefer flower you know like they don't

1198
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,440
want to buy cannabis based on what's in

1199
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:15,210
the package what's on the package you

1200
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,608
know they want like a direct experience

1201
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:20,849
in the product itself they want the snow

1202
00:50:17,608 --> 00:50:23,219
grape taste great and and even to know

1203
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:25,109
the person is growing it the idea that

1204
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:28,828
that the way the markets work right now

1205
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:31,199
is that you can't go in and open up a

1206
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:33,539
mason jar and get a good whiff of it and

1207
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:35,639
instead you're buying it based on the

1208
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:37,829
copywriting on the package is just

1209
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:41,190
absurd I mean we all know from using the

1210
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:43,410
medicine that that your body reacts to a

1211
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:45,150
terpene profile that your body knows it

1212
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:47,940
needs and so that's what we're used to

1213
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:49,710
going towards and now I mean not not to

1214
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:52,679
men like without even going into the

1215
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:56,130
sustainability of adding so much plastic

1216
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:57,929
to a one-gram right but outside of that

1217
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:01,410
you know the black market will continue

1218
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:01,710
to have this power because you can smell

1219
00:51:01,409 --> 00:51:03,989
the

1220
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:07,320
in advance there's a social experience

1221
00:51:03,989 --> 00:51:10,379
of interacting with your normal you know

1222
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:12,000
your neighborhood provider and and

1223
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,010
there's some more fun too right the

1224
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,079
black market can still use copyrighted

1225
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:18,150
names for example like all the malarkey

1226
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,219
going on around the strain gorilla glue

1227
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:23,099
and the gorilla glue company you know

1228
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:24,929
suing individual retailers for carrying

1229
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:26,880
a product called gorilla glue while all

1230
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:29,250
those crazy names are gonna continue to

1231
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,410
happen in the informal unlicensed market

1232
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:34,530
which just increases the Underground's

1233
00:51:31,409 --> 00:51:36,269
prestige I mean to some extent I mean

1234
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:38,460
what that you're referring to really is

1235
00:51:36,269 --> 00:51:41,219
a branding you know development in the

1236
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,320
unlicensed market that people are trying

1237
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:45,329
to carry over into the licensed market

1238
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,430
so there's you know like we think about

1239
00:51:45,329 --> 00:51:48,569
black markets we usually think about you

1240
00:51:47,429 --> 00:51:51,750
know production and so forth but

1241
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:54,480
actually there's been branding in the

1242
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:56,670
informal markets you know and in

1243
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,780
particular strains are kind of brands

1244
00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:03,869
now and it's helpful to some extent

1245
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:06,390
because you know there's some big

1246
00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:10,710
correlation generally between that brand

1247
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:12,598
name and and what it actually is but

1248
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,490
it's it's it's not that effective and

1249
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:16,260
you know I don't really mourn you know

1250
00:52:14,489 --> 00:52:19,799
you know the issues that people are

1251
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:24,570
having with using branding from the

1252
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:26,430
black market on on the white market I do

1253
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:28,500
think with it it actually was one of the

1254
00:52:26,429 --> 00:52:31,230
problems with the black market is the

1255
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:33,389
extent to which you know these branding

1256
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:36,690
of cultivars has not really matched the

1257
00:52:33,389 --> 00:52:38,519
reality of what it is and I think that

1258
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:42,088
you look at the Philo's bioscience you

1259
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:44,820
know work that they've done you know it

1260
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:47,130
at least shows you you know the fairly

1261
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:49,380
large often very large distance between

1262
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:51,300
what the brand name is on even the black

1263
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:54,599
market and what the product actually is

1264
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:57,380
so it's it's fun to do that and also you

1265
00:52:54,599 --> 00:53:00,030
know those brand names usually have

1266
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:02,519
something to do with you know the crap

1267
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:04,950
us that the cultivar came out of so that

1268
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:07,259
the names that end up happening or not

1269
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:09,750
that random and often contain a little

1270
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:12,210
bit of genealogy in them which helps you

1271
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:14,280
know consumers get educated about you

1272
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:15,659
know well what's a cultivar you know oh

1273
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,559
wait a second

1274
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:24,239
you know there's been innovation and we

1275
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:27,839
can kind of track that but I think it's

1276
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:29,429
I think that it's also important to

1277
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,019
understand too that's you know for

1278
00:53:29,429 --> 00:53:34,048
especially folks on the East Coast and

1279
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:38,400
so forth it's you know I think that we

1280
00:53:34,048 --> 00:53:39,929
are variation of the black market that

1281
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,889
is craft and you can smell it and

1282
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:45,509
everything and you have a lot of choice

1283
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:47,159
isn't that well reflected on the East

1284
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:50,789
Coast necessarily where like you know

1285
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:52,108
stuff goes out in bulk and you know it

1286
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:55,829
may or may not be of the highest quality

1287
00:53:52,108 --> 00:53:58,440
and they haven't developed a small scale

1288
00:53:55,829 --> 00:54:05,039
cultivation system that we have out west

1289
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:06,630
you know as much so I'm not necessarily

1290
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:08,640
sure where I'm going with that but

1291
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,349
because I try to emphasize continuity

1292
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:14,368
rights and I also want to emphasize

1293
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:18,000
heterogeneity and so I want to celebrate

1294
00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:19,380
you know the craft and creativeness

1295
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,690
that's allowed when you don't have

1296
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:24,019
intellectual property lawyers breathing

1297
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,019
down your neck

1298
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:28,880
and also to say that you know that's not

1299
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:32,489
necessarily new either

1300
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:35,338
that there's been you know a little bit

1301
00:54:32,489 --> 00:54:37,949
of you know inconsistency that now you

1302
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:39,599
know has carried over into the white

1303
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:41,338
market probably because of you know the

1304
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,910
Leafly periodic table which is

1305
00:54:41,338 --> 00:54:46,798
completely absurd yeah so I want to

1306
00:54:44,909 --> 00:54:49,108
circle back around before we close here

1307
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:51,449
you know before before I drifted you off

1308
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:53,639
down the the branding path you were

1309
00:54:51,449 --> 00:54:57,419
talking about the commercialization of

1310
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:59,068
cannabis versus social policy and and I

1311
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,809
feel like you probably have something

1312
00:54:59,068 --> 00:55:02,880
more to say on that because you know

1313
00:55:00,809 --> 00:55:06,180
what what do you really think is the

1314
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,160
future of cannabis based on how the

1315
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:12,449
regulatory structures are presently

1316
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:16,139
evolving well the future of legal

1317
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:22,019
cannabis I think that there's definitely

1318
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:24,420
room for well-made well crafted

1319
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:27,298
you know cannabis Allah the microbrew

1320
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:29,250
part of the alcohol industry it is not a

1321
00:55:27,298 --> 00:55:30,420
very large part of the Oh

1322
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,789
all industry but we are definitely

1323
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,980
moving towards you know a system in

1324
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:37,259
which you have you know the cores and

1325
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:42,030
the buds and and so forth kind of

1326
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:43,230
dominating the volume I think it's a

1327
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:47,220
that's where we're headed to with the

1328
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:49,219
current situation and I think that's the

1329
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:53,730
craft aspect to it and the innovative

1330
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:55,980
you know different differences that

1331
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:58,820
inter peeing files profiles and so forth

1332
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:00,809
the the non-standardized you know a

1333
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:05,340
product that results from non

1334
00:56:00,809 --> 00:56:06,750
standardized production systems there's

1335
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,820
gotta be some of it in there but like

1336
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:10,590
we're definitely it favors the very

1337
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:13,019
large sort of industrial corporate

1338
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:14,700
commercial products that I'm not that

1339
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:16,980
interested in for anything else either

1340
00:56:14,699 --> 00:56:19,259
you know like I'm a no logo guy you know

1341
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:22,380
like I'm not into you

1342
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:26,100
you know standardized you know products

1343
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:28,829
made by you know uh sweatshop workers in

1344
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:30,599
China right and of course you know

1345
00:56:28,829 --> 00:56:32,219
that's kind of where we're headed

1346
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:35,519
towards the sweatshop workers in China

1347
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:38,159
model which is a return to you know the

1348
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:41,039
the organized crime model really which

1349
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:43,230
was you know didn't benefit you know the

1350
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:45,719
the laborers who worked in the fields as

1351
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:49,559
much as it benefited benefited the you

1352
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:52,199
know the DTO Chiefs and and the the

1353
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:54,329
government officials they paid off it's

1354
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:55,919
it's kind of like well alright so we've

1355
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:58,230
decided that the legal model is going to

1356
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,659
be the cartel model of production and I

1357
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:03,900
think that that's just ridiculous and I

1358
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:05,250
don't want that and I do feel like

1359
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:09,150
that's kind of where we're headed right

1360
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:11,429
now but California is a place where this

1361
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:15,030
is getting played out in a way with a

1362
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:17,279
lot more resistance you know you have

1363
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:19,019
very very large trade groups there that

1364
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:23,310
are that have been on this since the

1365
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:27,090
beginning a concern about commercial you

1366
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:28,440
know capitalist canvas basically and by

1367
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:30,329
capitalists actually I don't mean

1368
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:34,079
necessarily anything other than

1369
00:57:30,329 --> 00:57:35,519
financial capitalists you know because I

1370
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,840
do believe that you know there are

1371
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:38,460
different kinds of capitalism and

1372
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:42,120
certainly small business capitalism is

1373
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:43,079
is helpful and worthwhile as opposed to

1374
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:44,578
you

1375
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:46,259
the kind of capitalism that devours

1376
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:49,410
small businesses which is financial

1377
00:57:46,259 --> 00:57:52,199
capitalism right on that makes a lot of

1378
00:57:49,409 --> 00:57:54,420
sense and it makes me really hope for

1379
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:55,978
for how California plays out I mean I

1380
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:58,289
know you and I both spend a lot of time

1381
00:57:55,978 --> 00:58:00,509
down there both with the with the the

1382
00:57:58,289 --> 00:58:03,390
heritage producers and with the

1383
00:58:00,509 --> 00:58:04,650
transitioning retailers and and you know

1384
00:58:03,389 --> 00:58:07,528
I spend a little time with legislators

1385
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:09,838
you certainly spend a lot more time down

1386
00:58:07,528 --> 00:58:12,268
there with those folks than I do but but

1387
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:15,568
you know California being as big of a

1388
00:58:12,268 --> 00:58:19,528
market as it is and having so many

1389
00:58:15,568 --> 00:58:23,639
forthright people involved and having so

1390
00:58:19,528 --> 00:58:26,509
many you know really top-notch cannabis

1391
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:29,009
trade organizations in the state

1392
00:58:26,509 --> 00:58:31,139
hopefully there'll be able to push back

1393
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:34,289
against things like the removal of the

1394
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:36,509
the one acre cap and and you know the

1395
00:58:34,289 --> 00:58:39,680
local moratoriums and and pull other

1396
00:58:36,509 --> 00:58:42,778
things that that can could make or break

1397
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:44,940
California so so for those of you in

1398
00:58:42,778 --> 00:58:47,458
California who are listening our hearts

1399
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:50,068
and minds are with you and we really

1400
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:52,228
hope that you that you really do us all

1401
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:54,568
right because you know the way that

1402
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:57,088
California goal goes is probably the way

1403
00:58:54,568 --> 00:58:59,308
that the rest of the country is going to

1404
00:58:57,088 --> 00:59:02,639
go I mean those of us states like us in

1405
00:58:59,309 --> 00:59:06,390
Washington who have you don't bend the

1406
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:09,058
first to you know normalize if not

1407
00:59:06,389 --> 00:59:10,708
legalize we were we were more test

1408
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:12,449
States but California is like the big

1409
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:14,278
leagues now and if they can pull it

1410
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:16,979
together and push back against some of

1411
00:59:14,278 --> 00:59:19,708
these policies that are a mess in in the

1412
00:59:16,978 --> 00:59:23,028
early to regulate states

1413
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:26,429
I think it'll have a lot of impact on

1414
00:59:23,028 --> 00:59:28,559
the rest of the country I share those

1415
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:31,469
sentiments completely yeah we're we're

1416
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:33,839
pulling for you California right on any

1417
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:35,548
way we can but like if things are gonna

1418
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:36,630
change it's gonna be because of you not

1419
00:59:35,548 --> 00:59:38,909
because of what happens here in

1420
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:40,259
Washington Dominic thanks so much for

about a policy transfer between the

1445
01:00:34,349 --> 01:00:39,839
states and how likely it is that early

1446
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:42,539
to adopt states will be influencing the

1447
