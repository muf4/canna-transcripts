00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:10,589
at the end of every cannabis season

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,259
plants are cut low on the stock and

4
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:16,009
taken away to be processed what remains

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,320
is a small nub coming out of the soil

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,210
below in the soil is a very much alive

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,518
and active cannabis root system

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,460
interacting with mycorrhizae microbes

9
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:29,038
and nutrients other than being a trophy

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,960
showing how thriving a plant was before

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,090
it was cut down there's not been much

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,259
use for the plants root ball in modern

conditions as well as beauty today we're

54
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,818
going to talk about Natasha's new paper

55
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,729
entitled cannabis roots a traditional

56
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:15,469
therapy with future potential for

57
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:17,810
treating inflammation and pain as

58
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:19,878
published in the Journal of cannabis and

59
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,979
cannabinoid research and co-authored

60
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:24,469
with world-renowned cannabis expert dr.

61
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:26,598
Ethan Rousseau and david reme yard

62
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:29,479
welcome to the show Natasha well thank

63
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:31,399
you for having me so your paper is so

64
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,619
much more enjoyable to read and

65
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,110
accessible than many others I've read in

66
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,200
science and in some parts it feels as

67
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,269
much like a history text as a scientific

68
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,878
paper what's the difference between a

69
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:45,950
paper like this one and one that is

70
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:50,389
simply reporting the results of an

71
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:52,459
experiment yeah well I don't know about

72
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:55,129
simply reporting the results of

73
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:57,170
experiments because lots of work goes

74
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,870
into reporting that but what's different

75
00:02:57,169 --> 00:03:01,458
about what we've created here is we're

76
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,579
like you said we're going through the

77
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:07,489
history of how cannabis roots were used

78
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:11,750
and then we're trying to find clues from

79
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:14,390
newer research to incorporate some of

80
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,949
that together to show that the active

81
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:17,839
compounds that are found in the cannabis

82
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:20,000
roots even though they haven't been

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,769
studied specifically from the cannabis

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,549
roots there is some other research we

85
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:26,840
can put together where as and when

86
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:29,480
you're looking at a research study

87
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,819
that's reporting on something new or a

88
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:33,469
single compound they're really going

89
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:34,909
into the details of the experimental

90
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:37,280
methods and usually they're showing

91
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:39,560
multiple ways of doing an experiment to

92
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,379
show that there actually can convince

93
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,889
you and prove that their hypothesis is

94
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:46,060
correct

95
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:49,280
whereas this may be more enjoyable to

96
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,859
the non scientist reader because it is a

97
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,680
nice history of how the roots were used

98
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:57,829
and then does a brief summary of some of

99
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,989
the literature showing again like how

100
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:02,689
these octave compounds would have been

101
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,670
used for treating inflammation or pain

102
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:07,539
or other different conditions and then

103
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:10,458
we summarize the research by showing

104
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:12,108
methods of application and it is

105
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,598
interesting you say it's different than

106
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:17,449
other papers because when we first

107
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:19,189
submitted it it was actually to another

108
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:21,589
Journal and they didn't really

109
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:23,089
understand I think so they thought even

110
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:25,129
the title that we weren't actually

111
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:27,500
talking about the roots of cannabis they

112
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:31,009
thought it was like a folksy like again

113
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:33,170
back to the roots right yeah and I had

114
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:37,490
written a lot of there was even more

115
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:40,730
information about kind of forward steps

116
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,360
of how to use the roots in recipes and

117
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,610
things like that

118
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,439
and they even made kind of a snarky

119
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,439
comment like oh this reads like a

120
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:52,250
reader's digest paper oh man that's a

121
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:55,550
dish that's not cool they didn't

122
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,720
understand the paper and so and that's

123
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,270
part of the reason why it took us a

124
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,830
while to get this paper published

125
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:03,439
because really Ethan and I started on

126
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:05,750
this project and my husband Dave

127
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,850
Remillard is also an author so the three

128
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:11,209
of us have been working on this project

129
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:14,450
for about a year and this is really how

130
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:17,599
Ethan and I actually became friends and

131
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:18,918
colleagues was back at ICRS of the

132
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,050
International cannabinoid Research

133
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:25,639
Society meeting in Vancouver in 2013 it

134
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,230
was in Vancouver and that was my first

135
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,870
time going to this meeting and my first

136
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:32,750
time meeting Ethan and so when we first

137
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,939
met I said to him what are you doing

138
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,120
with the roots because he was still with

139
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:40,310
GW Pharmaceuticals back at that time and

140
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,350
he was like Natasha what are you talking

141
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,629
about the roots and so we had a

142
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,960
discussion about it and I'm like well my

143
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:50,060
husband David he's he he's a legal

144
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:51,620
cannabis grower in Canada and he we've

145
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,769
been using the roots to make topicals

146
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,720
and so he was fascinated by this and

147
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:59,149
Ethan went back and he went through the

148
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,720
literature and he put together this

149
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:05,509
really nice 30-point power page or

150
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,160
PowerPoint presentation going over the

151
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,599
whole history of the roots and then he

152
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,310
sent that to me and he was like Natasha

153
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,100
we have to write a paper about this and

154
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:16,430
so that's really why the first part of

155
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,379
the paper really is an overview of the

156
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,228
historical use of it and it's a lot of

157
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:24,310
quotes and so we had to put that

158
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:28,879
together as kind of a story and start

159
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:32,089
putting it in some different themes so

160
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,639
yeah like for fever for inflammation for

161
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:37,129
skin burns for hard tumors even for

162
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,598
childbirth there's many different ways

163
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:40,439
throughout history that people have been

164
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:42,389
using the youth the roots and

165
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,430
I know there's people who are making

166
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:46,919
products these days but in the

167
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,840
scientific realm and in the academic

168
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,640
realm no one was talking about the route

169
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:52,739
so we felt it was really important to

170
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,240
get this information put together

171
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:59,040
published to start getting more interest

172
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,550
and actually pursuing some of these

173
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,110
compounds you know gosh I've got a bunch

174
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,970
of things to say so so let's see lurch

175
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,280
where to start so number one going all

176
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,110
the way back to the roots you know when

177
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,549
I was talking to people about my

178
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,069
excitement about interviewing you on

179
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,569
this show I too had to clarify because I

180
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,189
said oh yeah I'm doing a show on

181
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,899
cannabis roots and they're like didn't

182
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:21,329
you already do the history of cannabis

183
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:23,370
with Sunil Agarwal like in Episode five

184
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:25,529
I'm like yeah not those kind of roots

185
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,090
the rootball and then you could see this

186
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:30,779
look of bling this and then they're like

187
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:32,579
cool you know because you know uh you

188
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:35,009
know mostly you know we throw away root

189
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:36,990
balls but but after your paper I think

190
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:40,079
people are gonna be using them a lot

191
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,850
more and then and then also it's fun to

192
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,370
hear you talk about your your meeting of

193
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,650
ethan cuz i got the other side of that

194
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:49,019
story he and i rat lunch and he saw like

195
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:50,909
yeah natasha asked me about root balls

196
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,109
and he says i lit up and i say any saw

197
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,650
like i knew right away that we'd be

198
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,300
friends you know because he's you know

199
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:58,949
had an interest in root balls too but

200
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,980
had never really actually had a chance

201
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:05,009
to dig into it so right on so you know

202
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,110
since you're reaching back so far into

203
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:10,709
ancient medicine for a lot of these

204
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,259
texts where there's some ailments that

205
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:15,239
were you know enshrouded by outdated

206
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,189
language that you had to do secondary

207
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,870
research just to figure out what they

208
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:22,199
were saying they were using the root

209
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:25,350
ball to cure yeah a little bit and i

210
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,750
tried to clarify especially when they're

211
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:31,620
referring to hard tumors we weren't sure

212
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:34,500
if they're referring to cancer or more

213
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,710
like an abscess or a sore or a type of

214
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,110
ulcer that has like tumor hard tumor

215
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:43,490
like properties so we were pretty

216
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,330
careful in how we interpreted those

217
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,850
interpretations of how're they were

218
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,280
using the roots and even when we looked

219
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:54,180
at some of the compounds in the roots

220
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:56,490
and went into newer studies

221
00:08:54,179 --> 00:09:00,269
with cell culture experiments and animal

222
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,100
studies it they didn't really find much

223
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:05,399
anti-cancer activity with these

224
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,740
compounds so we were careful with how we

225
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,909
covered that part of the routes just

226
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,639
because we know there's so many

227
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:13,169
potential anti-cancer properties with

228
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,569
the cannabinoids and other parts of the

229
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:17,809
cannabis planet but the roots might not

230
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:23,370
be the best for anti-cancer properties

231
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:24,899
the area where it was very exciting and

232
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,259
I see a lot of potential for the routes

233
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:31,339
is more for topical use so putting it on

234
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:34,309
top of your skin and using it to treat

235
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:37,080
inflammatory conditions redness

236
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:39,539
arthritis and also gout there's numerous

237
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,270
mentions like it was almost hard to

238
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:44,730
summarize it all without just going on

239
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:47,100
and on and on about how often the

240
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,860
ancient medicine makers were using

241
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,100
cannabis routes to treat gout so that

242
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,169
was exciting to read about especially

243
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,509
anyone who's ever suffered from gout or

244
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:59,250
tried to find treatments for it

245
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:01,830
a lot of them don't work that well so

246
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:05,159
and actually I should bring up when I

247
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:07,980
was so when Ethan and I were first

248
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,600
working on this paper he invited me to

249
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,000
patients at a time in Baltimore last

250
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,370
year to speak about it and so that was

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,070
great I got to do a talk at the

252
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,899
conference met a lot of amazing people

253
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,459
but this one man came up and he was a

254
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,250
cannabis farmer and he came and talked

255
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:26,429
to me after and he was telling me that

256
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,139
he doesn't consume any cannabis and he

257
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:29,939
was working on a count of his farm and

258
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:32,639
he was like I wasn't touching any of the

259
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,589
cannabis my only job was to handle the

260
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,028
root waste and so he said he was

261
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,339
handling all the root wastes and they

262
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:40,259
were keeping some of it in the freezer

263
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,570
just on the like hey this might have

264
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:45,689
some properties and he said just by

265
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,610
handling the roots his goat and his his

266
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,410
toes had gone away and he had made that

267
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,970
connection and he was just like blown

268
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:52,679
away after he saw him I talked as he was

269
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,079
like oh my goodness just by handling

270
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,739
them my goat had gotten better and so

271
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:59,578
that really intrigued me and so I kept

272
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:03,028
talking about the goat

273
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:07,489
I personally don't haven't experienced

274
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:10,100
any of these types of treatments or like

275
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,899
I don't suffer from many goat or

276
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,580
inflammatory conditions so I can only go

277
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:15,919
on what other people are telling me but

278
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,839
I definitely think it's an application

279
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,629
of the roots that's worth pursuing right

280
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,490
on so I know this next question is big

281
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:24,919
so I'm gonna kind of set you up for it

282
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,180
and let you go here so so you know one

283
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:28,579
of the things that struck me immediately

284
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:29,659
in reading your paper is that you know

285
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,750
you're talking about a whole new

286
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:34,730
community of active compounds then we're

287
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,100
usually talking about with cannabinoids

288
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,420
you know usually when I read papers I'm

289
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,310
pretty familiar with the active

290
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:42,889
components but most of the active

291
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:45,379
compounds in the root are new to me and

292
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:47,629
it's really exciting to have some new

293
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:49,970
healing attributes of cannabis to learn

294
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:52,100
about so before we get into the

295
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,170
historical healing applications for the

296
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,420
compounds after the break before the

297
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:59,659
break would you review that just the

298
00:11:56,419 --> 00:12:02,028
names of the active compounds from the

299
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:05,329
abstract of of the paper to kind of

300
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:06,830
familiarize us with their names so that

301
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,230
when we start talking about their

302
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:12,980
applications folks are a little familiar

303
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,659
with what they are yeah so what's really

304
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,959
interesting about the roots is they're

305
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:22,519
very low and cannabinoids like THC and

306
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:24,889
CBD what they contain is other compounds

307
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,199
so one of the main compounds we talked a

308
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:29,600
lot about in the paper is called free

309
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,480
Delin so this is found in the root set

310
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,370
of oat it has reported from older

311
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,320
studies at twelve point eight milligrams

312
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,350
per kilogram and then there's another

313
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,170
compound called epi free d'leh epi free

314
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,778
to lentil and that's about 21 milligrams

315
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:48,078
per kilogram so these two compounds are

316
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:50,929
triterpene ODEs and they've been

317
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,879
isolated from other plants they're found

318
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:55,370
in many other plants as well as cannabis

319
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,320
and so they've been isolated from

320
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,839
cannabis and characterized but no one

321
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,910
has specifically studied them from

322
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,029
cannabis but they've taken them from

323
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:06,500
other plants and done some preliminary

324
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:08,289
animal experiments and shown that they

325
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:14,028
have really potent anti-inflammatory

326
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:16,490
activity anti pain anti redness they can

327
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:21,139
help prevent the influx of inflammatory

328
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:22,818
cells and so those compounds are most

329
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:24,739
likely the active compounds that are

330
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:27,639
providing a lot of the anti-inflammatory

331
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:30,319
activity there's also some interesting

332
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:34,009
alkaloids that are in the roots called

333
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:37,428
cannabis a Devine and this compound has

334
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:39,318
been isolated from cannabis root but

335
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:41,149
there's no research on it so we don't

336
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:44,208
actually know what this compound does

337
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:46,600
and then another thing that was

338
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:50,528
interesting is there was one report of a

339
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:54,129
group isolating carvone which is

340
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:56,688
monoterpene it has its the major

341
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:58,699
monoterpene found in spearmint so when

342
00:13:56,688 --> 00:14:00,259
you smell that spearmint minty scent

343
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:02,568
that's pretty much carvone you're

344
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:05,749
smelling and so they found that the root

345
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:06,979
had this distinguished smell is what

346
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:08,989
they said and then they want to further

347
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,168
analyze it and found that it was Carbone

348
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:13,999
and Carbone is interesting because it's

349
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:16,428
being studied also as an

350
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:18,350
anti-inflammatory anti-pain compound

351
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:20,298
especially with regards to like

352
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,178
spearmint essential oil there's a

353
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:24,350
clinical trial where they're studying it

354
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:28,578
topically like putting it on your skin

355
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:30,528
for treating osteoarthritis so we can

356
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:32,599
take some of these compounds and then

357
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:34,308
start put that the story together and

358
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,889
realize like oh all these compounds are

359
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:39,618
playing a role and who knows some of

360
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:42,168
these old concoctions may have well had

361
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:44,059
some local sake contamination or

362
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:46,659
whatever cannabinoids from other parts

363
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:50,899
of the plant so realistically I think

364
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:52,668
whole plant formulas that include parts

365
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:56,539
of the roots and the cannabinoids will

366
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:58,360
work best but I think these compounds

367
00:14:56,539 --> 00:15:02,118
and the roots have a lot of potential to

368
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:05,600
also play a role with helping with a

369
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:08,149
variety of medicinal applications

370
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,548
including redness inflammation and pain

371
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:13,220
right on before we go to break one last

372
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:14,869
question you know these these new active

373
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,129
compounds that we're learning about I

374
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:17,778
mean they're not new to science but

375
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:20,480
they're new to a lot of us cannabis

376
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:22,639
medicine folk you know we're suggesting

377
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,899
that they are something other than than

378
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,470
cannabinoids because we're talking about

379
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:28,970
them and cannabinoids yeah you know why

380
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,949
would you say scientifically that

381
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,869
they're not considered cannabinoids like

382
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:34,699
definitionally why are they not

383
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:38,519
cannabinoid

384
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:43,080
well a cannabinoid is a unique compound

385
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:46,259
that's like THC CBD like there's this

386
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,879
it's a class of structurally like you

387
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,129
eat compounds and so these are just

388
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,929
different completely different compounds

389
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,330
though they're just I I want to clarify

390
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:57,419
too a lot of people are really confused

391
00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:00,629
about cannabinoids being found in other

392
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:02,279
plants I saw some people talking about

393
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:05,100
it on Facebook today and arguing about

394
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,959
it and using one of a thens paper to

395
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,790
justify their point but they were

396
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,710
actually arguing the wrong thing so when

397
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:12,899
we say cannabinoids these compounds are

398
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:15,660
specific to the cannabis plant and

399
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,649
that's like THC and CBD and there's many

400
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:19,049
other cannabinoids

401
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:21,899
but there's compounds that in other

402
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:23,699
plants that act like cannabinoids and

403
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,279
can work through the endocannabinoid

404
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,259
system in our body but people are saying

405
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:31,529
oh there's cannabinoids and other plants

406
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:34,590
but there aren't so anyway cannabinoids

407
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:36,240
are a unique family of compounds that

408
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:38,790
are unique to the cannabis plant but

409
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,360
they're not found in large amounts in

410
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,009
the roots

411
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,600
thank you that's that's the answer I was

412
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:45,809
looking for and you took it even farther

413
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,889
along that path you know we had dr.

414
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:51,209
Russo on the show talking about how you

415
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:53,490
know his nutrition paper write a

416
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,889
nutrition to support the endocannabinoid

417
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,810
system and a lot of people took that

418
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,220
paper as you were describing that oh

419
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,659
look there's cannabinoids and all these

420
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,070
a lot of things like well they're not

421
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:04,430
really cannabinoids in these other

422
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:07,350
plants they're just other nutritional

423
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:09,779
plants that support your endocannabinoid

424
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:12,000
system so yeah take your cannabinoids

425
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,619
but also take this other nutrition and I

426
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,680
think that's a good delineation you make

427
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:19,259
yeah and like especially with beta

428
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,930
carrie awfully lot because and there's a

429
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:24,000
paper that kind of is at fault here the

430
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,939
way the title is it's like oh here's a

431
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,250
they call it a cannabinoid but beta

432
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:31,440
carry off lean works through the cb2

433
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,960
receptor and it works through our

434
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,920
endocannabinoids system and can boost

435
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,329
cannabinoids but it is not a cannabinoid

436
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,960
right you know just making it all very

437
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:44,399
very clear yeah yeah so so let's go

438
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,779
ahead and take our first short break and

439
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,470
be right back when we get back we're

440
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:49,869
gonna be talking about

441
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,610
the actual health benefits of using the

442
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:53,018
rootball system you're listening to

443
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:55,119
shaping fire and my guest today is

444
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:58,390
cannabis in cannabis health of

445
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,798
researcher natasha rizz we humans are

446
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,720
attracted to plants because they offer

447
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:03,819
us relief and are a whole lot of fun

448
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,679
sometimes though the best parts are

449
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:08,288
buried inside the plant and we need to

450
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,519
use specialty extraction technology when

451
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,619
it comes to cannabis it is

452
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,720
extraordinarily important to extract its

453
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:15,699
precious oils without changing them in

454
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,980
the process we want to preserve the

455
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,870
properties of the cannabinoids terpenes

456
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,509
and other constituents that all work

457
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:24,759
together since 1994

458
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:27,308
Eden labs has been developing extraction

459
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:29,859
technology and processes to do just that

460
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:31,750
Eden labs was founded by a cannabis

461
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:34,000
loving engineer during the early days of

462
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,609
medical marijuana in California and the

463
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,589
expanded Eden team has been designing

464
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:40,528
and building industry-leading solutions

465
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:43,658
for cannabis extraction ever since

466
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:46,480
Eden labs flagship product is the newly

467
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:48,580
improved High Flow co2 extractor as

468
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,798
other extraction companies enter the

469
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:52,629
market it is the high flow from Eden

470
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,908
labs that everyone chases and tries to

471
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,590
compare themselves with not only that

472
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:59,230
but the improved automation software

473
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:02,408
allows data to be collected stored and

474
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,630
studied Eden labs can outfit your whole

475

ethanol extractor creates astonishing

477
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:11,798
whole plant extracts working alone or in

478
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:14,080
tandem with an initial stream distilling

479
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:15,700
step to isolate monoterpenes before

480
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,278
extracting the rest of the botanical

481
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,190
constituents Eden offers you many

482
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:23,169

extraction

500
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,019

502
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:09,669
extractor together and hire a marketing

503
00:20:07,058 --> 00:20:11,589
company Eden Labs has been listening to

be proud of go to shaping feiyr.com /e

510
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,548
Dhin to find out more now that the

511
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,720
health benefits of terpenes have become

512
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:33,849
well known in the cannabis industry

513
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,519
people everywhere are looking for the

514
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:38,230
purest terpenes without adulterants the

515
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:39,970
problem with most terpene providers is

516
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,740
that they're not sourced naturally and

517
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,960
instead are made as a byproduct of

518
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,720
refining petroleum and that's so sketchy

519
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,730
the terpenes sold by true terpenes are

520
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,669
entirely different they are certified

521
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:53,259
organic non-gmo and food grade that

522
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:55,720
means that they are extracted from real

523
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:57,940
plant sources there are no solvents of

524
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,879
any kind they are distilled only with

525
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:03,278
steam that's right only steam in fact

526
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:05,528
terpenes from true turbines are so pure

527
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:07,329
that you can eat them not only that but

528
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:10,269
you can stack them with better results -

529
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:12,278
what I mean is other company's turbines

530
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,109
have got a few percent of impurities and

531
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:16,179
when you stack those terpenes to make

532
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:17,949
your blend you're adding a variety of

533
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:20,320
impurities that degrade your final

534
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,058
product true terpenes also have

535
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,918

00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:26,259
range of cannabis strains like Durbin

537

welcome back you are listening to

561
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:22,190
shaping fire I'm your host Shango losan

562
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:25,129
our guest this week is cannabis health

563
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,570
researcher Natasha rizz so now we're

564
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,460
getting into the heart of the topic so

565
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:31,669
the theme of the paper seems to be that

566
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,860
historically healers of all kinds use

567
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:36,170
the root ball for a range of

568
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:38,719
inflammatory issues and infections and

569
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:41,300
fevers there are so many different

570
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,009
active ingredients in applications that

571
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:45,139
I actually found it hard to create you

572
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:45,470
know like a cogent path of questions for

573
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,690
you

574
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,519
how do you prefer to talk about the

575
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:53,299
medical applications in a way that

576
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:56,179
people can make sense of it yeah

577
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:59,058
so I parts that I really like to focus

578
00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:01,850
on are the topical applications so

579
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:03,889
putting it on your skin there's hints at

580
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:07,009
various ways of using the cannabis root

581
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:09,650
including oral even as a suppository

582
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:12,619
like indirectly to help with infection

583
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:15,850
but when throughout history anyway when

584
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:19,069
people are using the root orally or

585
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:21,469
indirectly it seems to be more for a

586
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:23,480
specific purpose so like a medical

587
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,400
purpose not necessarily like something

588
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,650
you'd want to do every day whereas the

589
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,900
topical applications like on the skin

590
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:33,259
seem like something that you could use

591
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,730
consistently so when patients are or

592
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:37,129
through history when people were taking

593
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:39,740
it as an oral drink it was more for

594
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:42,110
during childbirth when they were having

595
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,509
issues with like they couldn't stop

596
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:49,000
bleeding and so there's historical

597
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:52,279
accounts in China of using the root

598
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,990
concoction as an oral supplement to help

599
00:23:52,279 --> 00:24:00,049
with bleeding during childbirth whereas

600
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:03,849
there's a richer history and many more

601
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:06,950
accounts of cannabis root bombs and

602
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:11,299
water extractions being used on the skin

603
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:13,279
and even I should bring up like if

604
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,779
anyone's working with cannabis roots you

605
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,428
want to be really careful of where

606
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:18,829
you're sourcing the material from

607
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:21,070
because cannabis is really good at fight

608
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:24,678
over mediation meaning it can suck up

609
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:28,730
bad things from the ground and count

610
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:32,509
is really good at sucking up iron and

611
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:34,730
heavy minerals that can accumulate and

612
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:38,360
could be dangerous if you're using it

613
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:41,089
for medicine so it might be better use

614
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:43,428
roots that are grown through hydroponics

615
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:46,398
or at least in soil that you know

616
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:48,950
doesn't have a mineral contamination or

617
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:50,479
a heavy metal contamination so just keep

618
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:53,619
that in mind so that might also be part

619
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,599
of the reason why taking the route in

620
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:59,480
orally might be you might have to be a

621
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:01,819
little careful about it whereas putting

622
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,919
it on your skin it just seems there's

623
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:05,960
such a rich history of using it that way

624
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,019
especially for as I mentioned several

625
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,399
times gout arthritis and joint pain but

626
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:13,278
the other thing that also came up

627
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:15,618
throughout the historical accounts of

628
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,740
all the hemp root use was water

629
00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:21,199
extraction so we know that cannabinoids

630
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,819
are fat soluble compounds and so most of

631
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,440
the time when we do extractions with

632
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:28,519
cannabis flowers or the parts of the

633
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,610
plants we're using fats or alcohol or

634
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:32,298
things to extract these fat compounds

635
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:33,829
the thing that was really interesting

636
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:36,288
about the roots is throughout history

637
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:40,158
it's very clear that they're using

638
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:43,308
boiling water or some kind of heated

639
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,690
type water extraction and so I'll go a

640
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,908
little bit over of the different ways

641
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:49,970
they're using it one is they're drying

642
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:51,649
the root and using it as a powder and so

643
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,649
there's accounts of just using that

644
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:58,548
powder as like remix it with water and

645
00:25:54,648 --> 00:26:01,308
using it on like a cut or as a poultice

646
00:25:58,548 --> 00:26:05,690
and then there's other accounts of

647
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:07,398
taking the root and shredding it that

648
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,340
might be a bit difficult because the

649
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:12,079
roots are pretty hard and then there's

650
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:14,418
other accounts where they're taking the

651
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:18,710
root cooking it in boiling water and

652
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:21,889
then using that water extraction either

653
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:24,470
to soak like other things in and then I

654
00:26:21,888 --> 00:26:29,839
put that topically like as a compress or

655
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:32,118
they're taking let me see the roots

656
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,339
there oh so they're also even taking

657
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:36,859
that water extraction and like boiling

658
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:41,359
it down to making almost like

659
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:44,658
like a paste or a SAP and then they're

660
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:48,648
using other ways where they're taking

661
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:51,830
even alcohol extractions or the recipe

662
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:54,589
that we used personally at home to

663
00:26:51,829 --> 00:26:56,990
process some of David's cannabis roots

664
00:26:54,589 --> 00:27:00,259
has been actually to take a blend of fat

665
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:04,220
and water and cut that in a crock pot

666
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:06,079
and use that to extract fat soluble and

667
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,519
water soluble compounds and then what

668
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:11,000
you do after that is you put it in the

669
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,798
freezer and then you freeze off the

670
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,419
water and then you can separate the fat

671
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,058
and the water compounds and then do

672
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:19,970
separate things with that so yeah

673
00:27:17,058 --> 00:27:21,678
there's a lot of different things about

674
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,500
the roots that are different than the

675
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,450
way most people are processing the

676
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,388
cannabis plant and so the main thing is

677
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:30,798
the water extraction and the other thing

678
00:27:29,388 --> 00:27:33,740
is that people are mostly using it

679
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:36,918
topically versus you know smoking it or

680
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,990
eating it sure that makes sense and and

681
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:40,880
during the third set we're gonna talk a

682
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,440
little bit more in detail about how to

683
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,840
make those but for the moment I want to

684
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,899
hit on you know I think that it's

685
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:51,308
interesting that that there are all of

686
00:27:47,898 --> 00:27:54,768
these different procedures for getting

687
00:27:51,308 --> 00:27:57,918
the the compounds and touch with the

688
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:59,538
human body but it's interesting that

689
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,519
there was so much experimentation all

690
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:04,419
these different ways to essentially just

691
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:07,759
get the friedlin and carvone and other

692
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:10,639
active compounds just to touch the body

693
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:13,759
right I mean whether it's by boiling or

694
00:28:10,638 --> 00:28:15,319
or cutting it up or making a poultice

695
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,509
it's just like these are these are

696
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:20,720
different methods to essentially do the

697
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:23,839
same thing which is get those essential

698
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,569
active compounds against the skin or in

699
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:30,288
lesser cases into the body through a

700
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:32,599
drink right yeah exactly yeah so

701
00:28:30,288 --> 00:28:34,490
different different you know healers

702
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,230
would use different techniques based on

703
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:38,630
you know what their personal beliefs

704
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:41,569
were or what was what was available to

705
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:45,230
them one of the things that I find

706
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:46,899
interesting about the this approach too

707
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:49,690
is you know

708
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,970
you've talked about a wide range of

709
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:55,410
ailments that helps with you know gout

710
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:58,180
arthritis joint page hemorrhaging from

711
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:01,240
after a pregnancy fever I mean this is a

712
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,890
it was a pretty wide range and normally

713
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,230
when we're talking about cannabinoid

714
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:07,360
medicine we're like oh it's because it

715
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:10,450
supports the endocannabinoid system

716
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:13,059
which is the body's master regulator and

717
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,880
balances so many systems that that you

718
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:17,950
know it all helps the EC s and then the

719
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,120
ec s takes care of rebalancing

720
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,920
everything and then you get all this

721
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,819
relief but that's not what we're talking

722
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,529
about this time and so what's different

723
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:28,329
with this from what it sounds like is

724
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:30,940
that we're actually trying to get these

725
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:34,480
particular active compounds for what

726
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:37,029
they uniquely do to our body's system

727
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,410
themselves so the carvone is doing one

728
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:40,930
thing and the Friedland is doing one

729
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:43,120
thing instead of how we normally think

730
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:45,549
about cannabinoid medicine which is oh

731
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:50,799
it all turns on or off something in the

732
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:53,710
EC s yeah and I mean these the EC s is

733
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,349
so like it's everywhere on our body so

734
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:59,049
I'm I would be surprised if these

735
00:29:56,349 --> 00:30:01,689
compounds weren't somehow targeting the

736
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:04,779
endocannabinoid system and we can kind

737
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:06,400
of think of inflammation pathways in the

738
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:08,319
way we think of the endocannabinoid

739
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,240
system so when we say something's

740
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:12,369
affecting inflammation that's a very

741
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,259
complex process there's many cells

742
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:15,789
there's many types of inflammation some

743
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:18,480
types of inflammation are good some

744
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:21,609
types are bad and then there's early

745
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,950
modulators of inflammation that I like

746
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:26,079
to think of as like cells coming in with

747
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,990
machine guns where they're just you know

748
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:31,329
trying to take out every kind of invader

749
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:36,039
but are also causing a lot of damage to

750
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:37,720
the host and so when we're saying that

751
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:40,299
these compounds are targeting

752
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:44,019
inflammation it's not only bringing down

753
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:47,409
redness and like swelling and it's also

754
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:49,230
bringing down on pain and as most people

755
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,400
know inflammation is an underlying

756
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:54,880
mechanism for many many different

757
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:58,330
diseases so even if you have a condition

758
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,340
that there may be no cure for if you can

759
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:02,798
get the inflammation under

760
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:06,639
control your symptoms will feel better

761
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:09,429
so even just targeting some of these

762
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,100
pathways we're gonna get I mean

763
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:15,150
seemingly like oh it does so many things

764
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:17,829
is this actually real but all of these

765
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:19,990
underlying mechanisms play roles and

766
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:23,109
many many different diseases so we can

767
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:26,019
say something like skin burns and heart

768
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:28,389
tumors and fever may not seem like

769
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:30,548
they're related but they could all be a

770
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:32,590
part of the same condition and so if

771
00:31:30,548 --> 00:31:35,109
you're targeting it's kind of like

772
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:38,500
pulling the string of the yarn ball you

773
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:41,469
know you if you get the the inflammatory

774
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,630
processes under control the whole host

775
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:45,100
will start just feeling better and kind

776
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,350
of the body will work better and be able

777
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:49,898
to sort itself out even if we look at

778
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:51,490
something like modulating stress like so

779
00:31:49,898 --> 00:31:53,918
I work a lot with patients with

780
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,970
inflammatory bowel diseases so Crohn's

781
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,640
and Colitis and these are

782
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:00,940
gastrointestinal conditions that

783
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:06,580
inflammation and pain pay play a big

784
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:08,558
role but stress and psychological just

785
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:11,168
how you're feeling about your body plays

786
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:13,750
a huge role in the disease and when

787
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:15,880
patients are in a state of stress and

788
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:18,398
anxiety their body doesn't work as well

789
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,429
and so it can't work as good and so even

790
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:23,439
just getting that stress under control

791
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:25,000
sometimes that can help get the

792
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,380
inflammation under control and then all

793
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,669
of a sudden the patient starts getting

794
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:34,659
less ulcers and so I think we have to

795
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:38,169
even take these like stress relief seems

796
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:41,020
like such a simple thing but it's it's

797
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:42,820
such a you know an underlying mechanism

798
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,829
for so many diseases that if we can get

799
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:48,519
basic things like stress inflammation

800
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:50,230
just things that really affect everyone

801
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:53,079
and have highs and lows throughout the

802
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:54,819
day but there's so many nutritional and

803
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:56,949
lifestyle factors we can do including

804
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:59,048
cannabis right on that makes a lot of

805
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:01,450
sense you know so often when working

806
00:32:59,048 --> 00:33:03,220
with a cannabis patient we find out that

807
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,720
yeah the cannabis helped them but

808
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,970
actually once they started sleeping

809
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,380
properly they started getting better

810
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,089
just because they were getting proper

811
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,610
sleep you know it's we got to take care

812
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:14,079
of these basic systems you know one of

813
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:16,869
the things I like about how your

814
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,759
paper is laid out is that you know at

815
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,709
the beginning you go through an

816
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:22,390
explanation of you know that gives

817
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:24,130
context and the different active

818
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:27,130
compounds we're working with but then

819
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,690
you go section by section on the

820
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,820
different ailments that you can get

821
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:32,259
relief from and before we move on I want

822
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:34,028
to make sure that we hit a couple that

823
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:35,288
we haven't hit so far because you know

824
00:33:34,028 --> 00:33:37,659
we've we've talked about you know

825
00:33:35,288 --> 00:33:41,349
infection and fever and gout but but

826
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:44,289
let's and and postpartum hemorrhaging

827
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:46,028
but let's talk about a sexually

828
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:49,450
transmitted disease why don't you hit on

829
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:50,740
that yeah so this again we kind of

830
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,860
hesitated to put this one in because

831
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,720
there was one quote to it but it was

832
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:59,589
interesting and I have the paper here so

833
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,509
I mean I'll read it a little bit but so

834
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:05,199
there was one report of cannabis root

835
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:07,509
being used to help with gonorrhea so in

836
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,050
the seventeenth century a german-born

837
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:12,550
botanist employed by the Dutch East

838
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:14,230
Indian company I think it's interesting

839
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:18,599
to get some context of who these people

840
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:21,820
were so anyway he the quote says that

841
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:25,869
the Moors took the route of the male or

842
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:29,740
the flower bearing plant and they used

843
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:33,070
it to feed and who those who were held

844
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:34,868
fast unclean but with gonorrhea I mean

845
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:40,389
these quotes the wording is a little off

846
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:42,338
the old English is really a mess yeah so

847
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:44,858
basically we took that from this account

848
00:34:42,338 --> 00:34:46,779
they were eating cannabis root to help

849
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:49,719
with gonorrhea but it's really unclear

850
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,550
from this account how it was prepared so

851
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:54,699
yeah we just had it in there as a quote

852
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:58,089
saying this because I feel like when we

853
00:34:54,699 --> 00:35:00,368
make and ethan was really a good mentor

854
00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:02,829
for putting this paper together because

855
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:05,980
he was saying even these accounts that

856
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:08,230
may you know have a little comment about

857
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,838
it's our responsibility to put it

858
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:13,358
together so if someone does decide to

859
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:15,130
research that further it's like hey that

860
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:16,509
there was an account of that and someone

861
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,460
was using that and as we know what the

862
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:20,970
cannabis plant it does so many different

863
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:24,010
things that sometimes there's this

864
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:25,899
condition that's seemingly out there

865
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,280
that you're like oh does it do that and

866
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,329
then you find out that it

867
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,320
actually can't help with that condition

868
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:34,989
so yeah I was an interesting quote that

869
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,090
came up so we decided to include it well

870
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:38,799
I think that this paper really does open

871
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:40,780
a lot of doors right because it's not

872
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,250
like this is the final word on any of

873
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,910
this what you're really doing is opening

874
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:48,429
a door to new directions in research by

875
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:51,190
giving you no historical survey of how

876
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:53,109
you know older cultures have used the

877
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,490
rootball for for a wide range of things

878
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,349
and I think that's one of the great

879
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:58,899
things about the paper another one I

880
00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:01,869
want to hit on is the GI tract because

881
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,079
you know we all know that Canada's yo is

882
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:07,329
used by anti mimetic Eunos to stop

883
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:09,400
people from vomiting but also you're

884
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:12,279
you're suggesting the the roots can be

885
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:15,130
used as a you know essentially a tummy

886
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:19,240
tuck a tummy tuck that would help a

887
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:21,809
whole range of ailments yeah and it's

888
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:25,299
interesting because of the accounts with

889
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:28,299
the route bomb in or so the root ball

890
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,860
and reference to Castro intestinal

891
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,930
activity is actually being used to

892
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,970
induce vomiting

893
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:35,619
so yeah I'll read a little bit the

894
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:38,169
cannabis roots have been used to protect

895
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:41,500
against vomiting but also to induced

896
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:44,320
vomiting so in Chile hemp roots have

897
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:47,320
been used as a purge ative and so the

898
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,190
way they were using it they were mixing

899
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:52,960
it polarized with wine and recommending

900
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:56,050
it for weaknesses and pains of the

901
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,099
stomach and so that's really interesting

902
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:02,350
to me again because I know more about

903
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:05,319
how THC and CBD the cannabinoids can

904
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:08,589
affect the gut and play a big role

905
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,860
especially in inflammation and in

906
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:13,840
helping with nausea and vomiting

907
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,849
although we also know that there's a

908
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,490
condition called cannabinoid hyperemesis

909
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:20,230
syndrome or some people respond badly to

910
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:23,469
high amounts of cannabis and it actually

911
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:26,110
can induce vomiting so yeah I think this

912
00:37:23,469 --> 00:37:27,489
whole system and the way cannabis can

913
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:32,230
interact with our gastrointestinal

914
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:33,879
system it's by module so it can induce

915
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:36,909
things and it can also suppress things

916
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,860
and it's all dose dependent and also

917
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:41,049
dependent on the person's Constitution

918
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:43,960
so yeah I think it there's more

919
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:45,400
search that's needed to be done but yeah

920
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,920
it's interesting that the roots also

921
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,420
seem to have some gastrointestinal

922
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,280
activity also I like that word you just

923
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:54,820
used by module that's a new economy

924
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:58,060
thank you for that so um so one of the

925
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:59,769
things that that is curious is that you

926
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:01,509
know the the survey of the research

927
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:04,900
talks about mostly about you know

928
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:07,030
old-school healers but then you know the

929
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:10,300
the last section of the paper really

930
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:12,310
focuses on free de lijn and and it's

931
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:15,190
kind of like once removed right because

932
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:18,969
people have not been doing organized

933
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:21,250
studies on root balls in modern time but

934
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:25,839
free de lijn which is in the root ball

935
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:29,380
there has been research taking place and

936
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:32,800
so under under that flag would you talk

937
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:35,650
a little bit about how free de lijn

938
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,130
impacts both cardiac activity and

939
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:43,539
estrogenic activity sure

940
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:46,630
so yeah with estrogenic activity this is

941
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:48,130
still an area that more research is

942
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:51,039
needed but because there were the

943
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:53,289
mentions of cannabis root being used

944
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:56,050
orally during pregnant Ursaring

945
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:58,420
to help with childbirth and bleeding we

946
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,730
were trying to figure out some rationale

947
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:03,070
why that would be and so we found a

948
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:07,329
little bit of evidence that Freda lien

949
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:09,690
may have some estrogenic activity when

950
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:12,699
it's been isolated from other plants and

951
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:15,490
this one plant that's really rich and

952
00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:19,839
free Deline sorry well I butcher the

953
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:22,239
name Sissis Quan drag ulis I'm not

954
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,550
actually sure what this plant is but

955
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:28,899
it's an edible plant found in hotter

956
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:32,350
parts of India and West Africa and this

957
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:35,440
plant is documented in err Veda for its

958
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:37,389
medicinal use in goat syphilis venereal

959
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,760
disease and also as an aphrodisiac and

960
00:39:37,389 --> 00:39:42,699
it's really rich in free Deline

961
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,520
and then there's also another plant

962
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:49,149
where Frida lien was isolated and they

963
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:51,059
did some work with rat models where MIT

964
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:54,220
didn't have their ovaries and they found

965
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:56,380
that the free Deline

966
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:58,539
section when they fed this to the

967
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,608
animals and improved their sexual

968
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:03,429
behavior and they found that this was

969
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:05,920
related to estrogen activity with an

970
00:40:03,429 --> 00:40:08,559
increase in uterine weight and arise in

971
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,108
serum estrogen so again these are very

972
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,670
preliminary studies but it hints that

973
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:15,009
there could be something more going on

974
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,710
and then the other one oh you brought up

975
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:20,950
was the cardiac activity yeah so this

976
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:24,570
again was another place we had a bit of

977
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:29,169
issues with because there is some

978
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:31,390
confusion where there was a report in

979
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:34,990
the Journal of American Medical

980
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:38,909
Association JAMA thinking that the

981
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:41,500
cannabis roots might be an issue and so

982
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:43,629
the way we spun it was throughout

983
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:46,269
history there's no mentions of any

984
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:49,920
cardiac activity in cannabis roots but

985
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:52,809
then there's this 1971 report in the

986
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,750
Medical Journal and so I'll just read

987
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:57,509
what we wrote it says in 1971 Roger

988
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:00,338
published an account in JAMA

989
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:04,030
recollecting his physician uncle using

990
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:06,279
Indian hemp roots to treat edema in 1931

991
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:09,460
and then this prompted an investigation

992
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:12,760
later on by this other researcher who

993
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:16,358
infused cannabis roots with whiskey into

994
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:19,599
guinea pig hearts and what happens is

995
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:21,369
the heart rates dropped from 240 to 60

996
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:25,838
so they're saying oh this caused the

997
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:28,599
heart to go slower and so they were kind

998
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:32,259
of concerned about this and then but the

999
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:35,800
issue is that we think or Ethan thought

1000
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:38,920
anyway that Roger made this account from

1001
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:42,010
1971 he may have mistaken the cannabis

1002
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,950
root for Indian hemp which is another

1003
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:49,349
plant because that this other plant does

1004
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:53,108
have some heart related issues and so

1005
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:56,890
anyway the long story short we concluded

1006
00:41:53,108 --> 00:41:59,588
that this report was likely untrue and

1007
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:03,098
there actually is no actual toxicity of

1008
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:05,019
cannabis roots and then again this sort

1009
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:08,109
of confusion is avoidable by using

1010
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:09,759
proper or Latin names so

1011
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:13,028
again this stuff needs to be clarified

1012
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:14,498
and more research needs to be done and

1013
00:42:13,028 --> 00:42:16,958
even making sure that there are no

1014
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:18,518
dangers but throughout history in the

1015
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:22,919
quotes we didn't come across any

1016
00:42:18,518 --> 00:42:25,538
mentions of cannabis and heart issues so

1017
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,798
it's so exciting though right because

1018
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:28,509
like it's almost like we're finding

1019
00:42:26,798 --> 00:42:30,728
another cannabis plant like we love

1020
00:42:28,509 --> 00:42:32,708
cannabis we love all the oils that we

1021
00:42:30,728 --> 00:42:34,179
can get out of the trichomes and and

1022
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:35,978
we're just beginning the research on

1023
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:37,690
that and then all of a sudden now we're

1024
00:42:35,978 --> 00:42:40,118
talking about root balls with an entire

1025
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:42,130
different set of active compounds and

1026
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:43,959
it's like oh wow look there's you know

1027
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,700
what there's nine different sections in

1028
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:47,588
the paper and it's like wow there's

1029
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:49,838
there's tons of room for research in

1030
00:42:47,588 --> 00:42:52,989
each of the nine second in each of the

1031
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:54,699
nine sections it just opens it up so so

1032
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:58,119
this is a call out to all you citizen

1033
00:42:54,699 --> 00:43:00,598
scientists out there to to get on it

1034
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,979
after the break we're gonna talk about

1035
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,940
how to do some of these preparations

1036
00:43:02,978 --> 00:43:09,639
with as much of instruction as we can

1037
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,778
pull out of Natasha so stay with us

1038
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:12,248
we're gonna take a short break and be

1039
00:43:10,778 --> 00:43:14,139
right back you're listening to shaping

1040
00:43:12,248 --> 00:43:17,528
fire and my guest today is cannabis

1041
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:19,358
health researcher and Natasha rizz if

1042
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:20,949
you grow cannabis with sunshine you can

1043
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:23,199
often feel limited by the seasonal cycle

1044
00:43:20,949 --> 00:43:25,119
you want to grow sustainably and save

1045
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:26,949
money so you use as little electricity

1046
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,660
as possible but if you haven't studied

1047
00:43:26,949 --> 00:43:30,219
or implemented light deprivation

1048
00:43:28,659 --> 00:43:32,288
techniques into your greenhouse you're

1049
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:33,818
leaving a lot of money on the table by

1050
00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:35,528
incorporating light deprivation

1051
00:43:33,818 --> 00:43:37,028
solutions into your greenhouse you can

1052
00:43:35,528 --> 00:43:39,130
often add two or three additional

1053
00:43:37,028 --> 00:43:40,719
growing cycles to your year when you

1054
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,640
pencil out the financial benefit of

1055
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:44,559
those additional cycles you'll realize

1056
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:46,509
why commercial scaled light deprivation

1057
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,140
technology is remaking the cannabis

1058
00:43:46,509 --> 00:43:49,478
industry

1059
00:43:47,139 --> 00:43:51,458
what used to be done by pulling tarps

1060
00:43:49,478 --> 00:43:52,899
over hoop houses has been scaled up over

1061
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:54,669
the last few years in such a way that

1062
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,349
has become mechanized easy and

1063
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:59,199
affordable to even small-scale

1064
00:43:56,349 --> 00:44:01,298
commercial cannabis operations forever

1065
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,190

leader in light deprivation greenhouse

1067
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:06,999
design and operation for the commercial

1068
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:08,618
cannabis industry their team of

1069
00:44:06,998 --> 00:44:10,149
greenhouse experts have been in the

1070
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:11,469
fields of Northern California for

1071
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,088
decades and they're now building

1072
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:15,849
greenhouses for commercial cannabis

1073
00:44:13,088 --> 00:44:17,440
companies across the country if you are

1074
00:44:15,849 --> 00:44:19,209

Eric Branstad up forever flowering I

1078

00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:33,880
incorporating light depth techniques

1082
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:35,679
there are so many aspects of utilizing a

1083
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,690
greenhouse that can go wrong from

1084
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,789

back you're listening to shaping fire

1136
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:28,900
and I'm your host Shango Louis and our

1137
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:32,139
guest this week is cannabis health

1138
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:34,329
researcher Natasha rizz so you know so

1139
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:34,929
far in the show we have talked about why

1140
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:37,690
the root

1141
00:46:34,929 --> 00:46:40,659
all is so healthy and all the different

1142
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:44,200
ways that healers of all sorts have been

1143
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:46,659
using it you know where they live over

1144
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:49,598
the years but you know there's not

1145
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:52,118
really a lot of information in the

1146
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,329
archives of how they actually made the

1147
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:57,250
preparations so I know that I'm gonna be

1148
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:59,140
asking you questions Natasha that you

1149
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:02,318
are probably haven't been provided

1150
00:46:59,139 --> 00:47:06,219
answers for but but you know we all know

1151
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:08,500
that that after growers are hearing the

1152
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:10,989
show that they're gonna be doing some

1153
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:13,389
experimentation with root balls come

1154
00:47:10,989 --> 00:47:17,199
this fall because you know who wouldn't

1155
00:47:13,389 --> 00:47:19,420
and so I want to go through four of the

1156
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:22,659
preparations that are talked about in

1157
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:24,519
your paper and just give me the best you

1158
00:47:22,659 --> 00:47:26,440
know the best information that you have

1159
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:28,659
gleaned and I understand that there's

1160
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,119
going to be some some vacuum there and

1161
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:33,279
and we'll just tell people to try it so

1162
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,269
so here so here here are a handful of

1163
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,510
questions that you may not know the

1164
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:39,730
answer to so so the main one that I was

1165
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:42,160
attracted to is the decoction by boiling

1166
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:44,469
and you know the idea of boiling

1167
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,719
something that seems easy enough but but

1168
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:48,879
just generally I'm curious from you you

1169
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:51,669
know when you boil it do you cut it up

1170
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,309
into slices first how much water might I

1171
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:57,579
use how long might I boil it and then

1172
00:47:54,309 --> 00:48:00,970
when I'm done do I want to reduce the

1173
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:05,230
water so that the the finished liquid

1174
00:48:00,969 --> 00:48:07,989
agent is actually more dense yeah those

1175
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:10,329
are all great questions and I I'm

1176
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:12,338
anticipating there's gonna be so many

1177
00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:15,010
interesting concoctions coming up of

1178
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:18,159
different ways to prepare them so the

1179
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:20,890
ways that we've tried is first off

1180
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:25,029
cutting the roots is very difficult

1181
00:48:20,889 --> 00:48:26,858
we had like they're very hard and so I

1182
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:30,160
still haven't figured out the best way

1183
00:48:26,858 --> 00:48:31,420
to process them into pieces so at this

1184
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,058
point in time we've just been breaking

1185
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:36,159
them as best we can

1186
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:37,510
I've also heard someone suggest putting

1187
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,548
them in liquid nitrogen and then

1188
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:41,410
crushing them that way would be a good

1189
00:48:39,548 --> 00:48:45,818
way to try it but I haven't played

1190
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:48,889
someone with on so that might be the

1191
00:48:45,818 --> 00:48:53,239
solution to that issue

1192
00:48:48,889 --> 00:48:55,759
and then basically putting as much water

1193
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:58,819
and root together I mean the more the

1194
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:02,930
better to just you have to like even a

1195
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:04,809
one to one if it possible and so again

1196
00:49:02,929 --> 00:49:09,859
when you're making water extractions

1197
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:11,840
there's issues of microbial or bacterial

1198
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:13,820
or mold growth because as soon as you

1199
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:16,970
have water and a compound the shelf

1200
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:18,530
stability isn't as great so that's one

1201
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:20,269
of the reasons I haven't played as much

1202
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:21,650
with the water extractions but I think

1203
00:49:20,269 --> 00:49:24,190
if you were gonna do a water extraction

1204
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:26,720
you would wanna like you said

1205
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:28,550
concentrate it down after and so that

1206
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:30,139
there was reports of people doing that

1207
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,650
where they would take other roots in the

1208
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:33,259
water

1209
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:37,789
I mean chopped or is chopped up as you

1210
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:39,530
could get them and then infuse that in

1211
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:41,389
the water and then again what are the

1212
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:44,540
proper temperatures what is the proper

1213
00:49:41,389 --> 00:49:46,759
timeline I can't give much suggestion to

1214
00:49:44,539 --> 00:49:48,679
that except the throat history it was

1215
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:52,010
boiling so I'm guessing it's gonna be a

1216
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:53,329
heavier boil I don't know what the I'd

1217
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:55,550
have to look into what the exact

1218
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:57,380
temperature timepoints for compounds

1219
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:59,450
like free tooling and those things to

1220
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:01,640
potentially be breaking down I'm not

1221
00:49:59,449 --> 00:50:03,829
sure what that is but and then you'd

1222
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:06,500
also have to experiment with how long

1223
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:09,559
are you boiling it for because when a

1224
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:11,300
lot of people make their even like their

1225
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:13,429
cannabis flower infusions

1226
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:15,230
in coconut oil or something sometimes

1227
00:50:13,429 --> 00:50:16,940
they're cooking that for a 30-minute

1228
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:20,679
infusion or they're doing a three-day

1229
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:22,940
infusion right so I think depending on

1230
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:25,940
the length of infusion you're gonna do

1231
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:28,700
you're gonna extract four compounds and

1232
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:30,920
again there's water extractions there's

1233
00:50:28,699 --> 00:50:32,779
fat extractions and then I haven't

1234
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,360
experimented with alcohol extractions

1235
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:38,000
yet but I think that's gonna be a really

1236
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,890
nice way to bring out both the fat and

1237
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,909
the water soluble compounds from the

1238
00:50:39,889 --> 00:50:46,730
roots and then yeah I think once you get

1239
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:50,920
either your root powder or your root

1240
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:53,300
extract or the water or the fat

1241
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,070
extraction or your boiling that down

1242
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:58,940
after you've done the water extraction

1243
00:50:55,070 --> 00:51:01,829
to get really like a gum tar resin then

1244
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,670
I think that will be your your comp

1245
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:05,369
that you're then gonna have to

1246
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:08,400
incorporate into other bases so like

1247
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:11,219
your base cream for instance and like

1248
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,298
when working with cannabinoids there's

1249
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:14,608
many different things you have to

1250
00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:17,818
consider when you're putting making

1251
00:51:14,608 --> 00:51:21,028
topicals and a big one is absorption so

1252
00:51:17,818 --> 00:51:23,219
with the fat soluble cannabinoids a lot

1253
00:51:21,028 --> 00:51:24,630
of them stay in the surface of the skin

1254
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:25,858
and that's why a lot of people like them

1255
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:29,039
is because they don't go systemically

1256
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:31,318
but there's also permeation enhancers

1257
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:33,450
and compounds you can add to your blends

1258
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:35,699
that can help boost absorption and maybe

1259
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:38,248
get some of these compounds into your

1260
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:40,949
body and systemically so of course when

1261
00:51:38,248 --> 00:51:44,848
you're making these hemp or the cannabis

1262
00:51:40,949 --> 00:51:47,009
root concoctions and you're putting them

1263
00:51:44,849 --> 00:51:49,380
into your final blend and those are

1264
00:51:47,009 --> 00:51:52,108
things you'll have to consider is do you

1265
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:54,209
want this blend to stay on the surface

1266
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:56,818
of your skin or do you want it to absorb

1267
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:58,558
into your skin and so that will depend

1268
00:51:56,818 --> 00:52:01,829
what kind of formulation you put and

1269
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:06,269
then again you're also gonna have to

1270
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:09,660
consider what kind of what's your target

1271
00:52:06,268 --> 00:52:14,248
for this for this formula are you is it

1272
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:17,219
for a soar is it for a burn is it for

1273
00:52:14,248 --> 00:52:18,988
inflammation and pain is it for just you

1274
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:21,199
know a hand cream because your hands are

1275
00:52:18,989 --> 00:52:23,639
dry because then that will depend again

1276
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:26,489
what kind of blend you're gonna put

1277
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:28,259
together and how you're gonna I always

1278
00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:32,458
like to think of who my end user is

1279
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:35,190
before I make a formula just because if

1280
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:36,989
it's nice it smells good it absorbs good

1281
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:39,208
but it's not for the right application

1282
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:40,769
no one's gonna use it so I think the

1283
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:42,538
same thing with the roots is there's

1284
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:45,298
many different ways to prepare it and

1285
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:48,239
then again are you gonna make like if

1286
00:52:45,298 --> 00:52:49,889
you're concerned about drug testing and

1287
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,499
having THC in these compounds

1288
00:52:49,889 --> 00:52:55,170
um the roots are nice because they

1289
00:52:52,498 --> 00:52:57,718
wouldn't test for THC or any of these

1290
00:52:55,170 --> 00:53:00,930
other compounds so you might want to

1291
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:02,608
just make your root blends alone or if

1292
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:05,489
you want them to work even better I

1293
00:53:02,608 --> 00:53:07,858
would add the cannabis flowers in there

1294
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:09,769
too because of course the cannabinoids

1295
00:53:07,858 --> 00:53:11,309
and teepsy CBD those are going to make

1296
00:53:09,768 --> 00:53:15,359
everything work

1297
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:18,690
a bit better for topicals especially so

1298
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:21,720
yeah so we talked about that trying to

1299
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:23,369
think oh yeah oh I I think it's um I

1300
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:24,839
I've just realized while you were

1301
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:27,269
talking that I'm gonna have to find a

1302
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:29,940
lab that actually tests for free Toulon

1303
00:53:27,269 --> 00:53:33,150
because I bet you that my you know my

1304
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,740
local cannabis lab that's probably not

1305
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:36,150
one that they're checking for all the

1306
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:37,619
time I'm gonna have to check in with

1307
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:39,690
them and find somewhere because now I'm

1308
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:41,730
gonna you know I'm I'm devising these

1309
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,380
little citizen science tests that I want

1310
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:45,030
to do myself this fall with the root

1311
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:48,150
balls and I bet you that I'm not going

1312
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:50,820
to be the only one so let's let's talk

1313
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:52,710
about pull test a little bit so we got

1314
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:55,380
the decoction by boiling pretty clearly

1315
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:57,119
you know poultice I think the only time

1316
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,820
I ever actually come across that anymore

1317
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:02,549
is like in like survival movies you know

1318
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:05,820
where you know some some ancient you

1319
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:08,070
know Yoda heal or you know take some

1320
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:09,840
some you know moss or something off the

1321
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:12,180
ground and then they littered against

1322
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,789
this and then it's magically healed in

1323
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:16,019
the next scene you know I'm so but but

1324
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:20,429
you know how would you actually make a

1325
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:22,769
poultice out of the the root ball um so

1326
00:54:20,429 --> 00:54:24,839
a poultice is basically just like a mash

1327
00:54:22,769 --> 00:54:28,019
of herbs that you're putting together in

1328
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:32,220
something like like cheesecloth or one

1329
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:35,219
of those like even just like a

1330
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:39,000
tablecloth like a cloth that the liquid

1331
00:54:35,219 --> 00:54:41,429
can then permeate through and so it

1332
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,079
would be similar to how you're doing

1333
00:54:41,429 --> 00:54:45,539
like even what you could do is you could

1334
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:48,960
put a root mass in there and kind of

1335
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:51,960
close it off and like a dish cloth tie

1336
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,000
it up at the top and then you could like

1337
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,130
boiled out in water and then that

1338
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,630
poultice you could then remove it kind

1339
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:59,490
of squeeze out the excess and then put

1340
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:01,559
it on topically so that would be more

1341
00:54:59,489 --> 00:55:04,500
for like spot treatments like say you

1342
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:06,900
had a rule ankle or your knee was

1343
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:09,150
hurting or you had a wound somewhere

1344
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:13,320
then you'd want like and a poultice

1345
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:16,220
isn't necessarily the most it's the word

1346
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:20,039
like convenient because it's a big

1347
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:21,689
massive plant you're in this concoction

1348
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:24,170
that you have to hold on to your thing

1349
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:26,970
so it's more of a home treatment I guess

1350
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:29,639
but what's cool about again with the

1351
00:55:26,969 --> 00:55:32,759
poultice you can combine other herbs and

1352
00:55:29,639 --> 00:55:34,829
other plants so again what your and who

1353
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,080
your end user is and what the condition

1354
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:39,599
is will depend on what herbs and what

1355
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:41,639
plants you put together when you make

1356
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,400
your poultice it sounds like one of the

1357
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:47,129
common issues amongst all of these is

1358
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,099
just breaking down the root right to get

1359
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:52,470
it to you know to either cut it or mash

1360
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:54,869
it or or put it on the cheese grater or

1361
00:55:52,469 --> 00:55:57,029
whatever you're gonna do getting it smut

1362
00:55:54,869 --> 00:55:59,250
into smaller pieces is going to be the

1363
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:01,320
the challenge the the next one that's in

1364
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:03,630
the paper is pulverized and mixed with

1365
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:06,930
wine so tell us a little bit about how

1366
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:09,059
that would look yeah so I haven't

1367
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:10,759
experimented with that one at all but

1368
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:13,969
I'm guessing it would be similar to

1369
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:16,620
getting and again we could talk about

1370
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:18,480
are we talking about older roots are we

1371
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:20,480
talking about younger root because I

1372
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,949
think there's another whole spectrum of

1373
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,630
playing with the root and trying to

1374
00:56:22,949 --> 00:56:27,719
figure out different medical

1375
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:30,960
applications because if you're using an

1376
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:32,459
early root I mean we'd have to look at

1377
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,349
how these different compounds are

1378
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:37,550
developing because they're not even

1379
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:40,949
really saying in the papers like how old

1380
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:42,810
the root was when it was analyzed so if

1381
00:56:40,949 --> 00:56:45,809
we were using younger root it would be

1382
00:56:42,809 --> 00:56:47,789
easier to break up and mash and make

1383
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:50,219
some of these concoctions but maybe it

1384
00:56:47,789 --> 00:56:52,079
doesn't have the compounds you're

1385
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:54,209
looking for whereas the older root might

1386
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:56,789
be harder to work with but might have a

1387
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:58,760
different profile of compound so again

1388
00:56:56,789 --> 00:57:02,659
those types of analysis need to be done

1389
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:06,630
and alcohol why would be a nice

1390
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:08,579
extraction basis because it can bring

1391
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:10,769
out all the fat soluble and the water

1392
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:14,429
soluble compounds and it doesn't have

1393
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:16,500
the risk of microbial like bacteria or

1394
00:57:14,429 --> 00:57:19,019
mold growth to the same extent that just

1395
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:21,539
water does so it you can get some better

1396
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:24,360
shelf stability if you're using alcohol

1397
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:26,309
versus water and what wine generally

1398
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,289
just makes everything better yeah

1399
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:30,960
especially with the bitter medicine so

1400
00:57:28,289 --> 00:57:34,139
the last one is raw juice and I was just

1401
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,849
imagining if if we're trying to struggle

1402
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:37,739
for what to break it down what

1403
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:41,369
a cannabis root ball would do to my

1404
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:43,499
macerating juice or god help us but it

1405
00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:46,710
seems to me that maybe maybe an apple

1406
00:57:43,498 --> 00:57:48,449
crusher would would might be more the

1407
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:49,519
appropriate tool for the job than

1408
00:57:48,449 --> 00:57:53,368
something in the kitchen

1409
00:57:49,518 --> 00:57:56,038
yeah when I saw the juice I was I was

1410
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:58,349
same thing like how I don't put that in

1411
00:57:56,039 --> 00:58:00,569
here juicer yeah so again I'm wondering

1412
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:04,349
if they're using younger roots because

1413
00:58:00,568 --> 00:58:07,380
they've got some more give to them

1414
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:08,519
versus the older roots which would I

1415
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:12,470
mean I don't think they were using

1416
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:16,618
juicers back in the ancient maybe though

1417
00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:17,699
but yeah that one I haven't played with

1418
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:21,088
it also

1419
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:23,219
that's readers please give me your her

1420
00:58:21,088 --> 00:58:25,558
listeners please let me know how that

1421
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:26,939
one goes yeah totally I think that's one

1422
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:29,460
of the great things about both your

1423
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:31,200
paper and the show today is really this

1424
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:33,568
is not a show about having all the

1425
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:36,298
answers this is about this is a show

1426
00:58:33,568 --> 00:58:38,338
about all the new questions and I think

1427
00:58:36,298 --> 00:58:39,599
that's really exciting thanks so much

1428
00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:41,099
for joining me on this show today

1429
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,318
Natasha this is really groundbreaking

1430
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:44,400
work and I bet you there's a lot of

1431
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:46,739
people who are listening who are as

1432
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,710
excited to play with root balls as I am

1433
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:52,318
now yeah and I'm really excited to hear

1434
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:54,778
about all these experiments and I'm

1435
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:57,449
excited to see how people come up with

1436
00:58:54,778 --> 00:58:59,940
some new treatments and oh is harnessing

1437
00:58:57,449 --> 00:59:02,038
the cannabis plant to help us right on

1438
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:04,619
so so if you want to read the paper you
