2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,199
there are two aspects of teaching

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:14,079
cannabis medicine that stand out as

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,959
most challenging to me the first one is

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,679
that cannabis

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,640
educators and caregivers must do a lot

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:23,359
of personal work to be good at the job

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,960
a caregiver cannot be overreacting to

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,760
the challenges the patient is going

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,560
through

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,880
while also not making light of them a

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,479
good

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:35,280
caregiver is a difficult blend of stoic

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,718
educator and friend of last resort to

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,039
the patient

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,280
several times in the last decade i have

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,759
sat down with a terminally ill person

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,480
who has asked me how to use cannabis in

19
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,280
their last

20
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,640
days so they can be lucid saying goodbye

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,039
to their family

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,359
this is heavy duty humanity this is a

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,840
very serious conversation

24
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,759
that patient doesn't want my tears or

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,840
concerns for them most often

26
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,320
they want me to stick to business and

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,159
give them the information they require

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,680
give them good product recommendation

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,680
and be gone

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,040
it is a role of service and to do it

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,200
right it takes a lot of

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,880
self and situational awareness by the

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,280
caregiver

34
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,359
the second especially challenging aspect

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,560
is that cannabinopathic medicine keeps

36
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,719
changing

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,240
as the paucity of cannabis knowledge

38
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,719
we've had is replaced by

39
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,319
modern studies with more participants

40
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,719
and better analytics

41
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,719
we have to constantly update ourselves

42
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,039
on the latest understanding because that

43
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,879
understanding is constantly evolving

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,280
these days

45
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,560
if you are a doctor or caregiver who

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,280
found part one

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,200
of endocannabinoid mechanics and has now

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,719
returned for part two

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,640
thanks for your dedication to the

50
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,640
caregiver service role

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,159
the humans under your care will be all

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,399
the better for it

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,520
and if you are here for yourself as a

54
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,920
cannabis patient

55
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,239
like me know that this material is

56
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,000
presented to you so we can all learn and

57
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,359
grow and heal together

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,200
it is as simple as that if you want to

59
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,959
learn about cannabis health business and

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,439
technique efficiently and with good

61
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,038
cheer

you are listening to shaping fire and

83
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:49,199
i'm your host shango los

84
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:51,439
today my guest is miyabi shields phd

85
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,318
dr shields is co-founder of real

86
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,878
isolates which

87
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,479
ironically focuses on the importance of

88
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:57,919
secondary plant components and

89
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,238
synergistic plans

90
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,158
so essentially whole plant medicine

91
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,158
miyabi received their phd in

92
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,000
pharmaceutical sciences focusing on the

93
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:06,560
biochemistry of the endocannabinoid

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,680
system

95
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,479
from northeastern university in 2018.

96
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,400
miyabi has authored or co-authored six

97
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,759
peer-reviewed publications and presently

98
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,920
has a patent under review

99
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,120
for a novel fungus and plant extraction

100
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,359
method

101
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,640
miyabi also has a substantial list of

102
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,720
honors and awards

103
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,479
including a 2016 international

104
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,359
cannabinoid research society

105
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,238
pre-doctoral research award their tick

106
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,280
tock channel

107
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,519
at miyabi phd has 130

108
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,799
000 followers and is where i first met

109
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,439
miyabi

110
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,239
today is part two of endocannabinoid

111
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,840
mechanics

112
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,319
and during the first set we'll talk

113
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,239
about how certain cannabinoids function

114
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,598
the second set is all about comparing

115
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,080
the various ways

116
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,878
we get cannabinoids into our bodies and

117
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,040
the third set

118
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,199
is about dosing thresholds for cannabis

119
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,318
efficacy for chronic and other serious

120
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,598
patients

121
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,000
welcome back to shaping fire miyabi hey

122
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,238
happy

123
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,919
to be here excellent me too i had really

124
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,560
enjoyed our first conversation and it

125
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,878
got a

126
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,799
really popular response people people

127
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,840
dug the quality and kind of information

128
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,719
that you share

129
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,039
so let's go ahead and and do some more

130
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,519
so

131
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,560
let's jump right into it people say

132
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,639
offhand

133
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,600
that taking thc a is a lot like taking

134
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,040
cbd and that makes sense to me in use

135
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,000
but like what does that really

136
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,479
mean at a chemistry level that statement

137
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,319
is too vague to really be useful to most

138
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,758
caregivers and patients

139
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:39,040
is it just that thc a

140
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:42,800
heals without the euphoria

141
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,720
of thc like cbd does or does it work on

142
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,319
similar receptors or perhaps still

143
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,520
something else

144
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,079
well you pretty much answered the

145
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,319
question yourself there with that one

146
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,560
yes so it's interesting i actually this

147
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,000
is so weird without my model

148
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,720
yeah in your hands yeah um but so thca

149
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,279
is the acid right it's the acid version

150
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,080
of

151
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,758
um thc which means that it has a extra

152
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,279
carboxylic acid group

153
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,759
um and carboxylic acid is a carbon

154
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,359
that's bonded to two oxygens and it's

155
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,400
really negatively charged and it's

156
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,800
pretty big

157
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,519
um so that changes the shape of the

158
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,680
molecule

159
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,799
and that change in shape affects like a

160
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,240
couple of things

161
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,160
the first thing it affects is the

162
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
ability for the molecule to get into the

163
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,439
brain

164
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,479
generally speaking the more charged

165
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,079
something is like

166
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,079
this in this case having a negative

167
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,478
charge um will decrease

168
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,000
its brain penetration so that's one way

169
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,599
in which they're different

170
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,038
the next way is how it binds to the

171
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,960
actual receptors

172
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:45,519
um there has been uh evidence that thca

173
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,478
does bind to like the cb1 and cb2

174
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,918
receptors but it's

175
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,959
far less than thc and really interesting

176
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,758
about people saying

177
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,599
qualitatively that it's similar to cbd

178
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,240
for me what's interesting about that is

179
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,439
that

180
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,918
both thca and cbd

181
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:06,478
activate or turn on the serotonin 5ht1a

182
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,918
receptor and that's actually the

183
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,399
receptor that's been linked

184
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,439
to the beneficial mental health effects

185
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,638
of cbd

186
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,160
in mouse model research so i think

187
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,600
you're right on the money there when you

188
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,039
say that thca

189
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,439
and cbd interact similarly

190
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,800
to serotonin receptors and that's why

191
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,439
people think that they

192
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,280
feel the same way that actually makes a

193
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,800
lot of sense in practice the fact that

194
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,399
the thc

195
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,918
a molecule hits the same receptors

196
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,560
though let more light more lightly than

197
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,959
cbd

198
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,800
because a lot of folks who well you know

199
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,719
at this point ever most people have got

200
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,000
access to cbd one way or another but

201
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,720
but you know a couple years ago pre cbd

202
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,319
being everywhere um people who only had

203
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,080
access to thc

204
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,520
through the um the heritage market

205
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:03,279
would just be able to go and and enjoy

206
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:06,079
uh und carbed flower

207
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,439
and it would give them the same kind of

208
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,839
you know anti-anxiety

209
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,680
and anti-depression benefits similar-ish

210
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,198
to cbd

211
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,038
and and people use it that way the other

212
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,720
thing that's interesting about thca is

213
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:17,279
it seems to be kind of universally give

214
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,759
people

215
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,879
serious munchies you know so it's very

216
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,038
very useful

217
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,959
for folks who have lost appetite let's

218
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,719
take this let's go one step deeper down

219
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,038
to this so let's talk about these other

220
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,000
novel cannabinoids the the acid forms

221
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,759
and and probably

222
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,399
the varan forms as more novel

223
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,038
minor cannabinoids are studied and bred

224
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,478
for

225
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,918
we're all going to get the opportunity

226
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:44,639
to learn and smoke the acid forms the

227
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,758
the unheated unaged forms of these

228
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,960
cannabinoids

229
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,800
and also their varying forms of thc and

230
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,680
cbd and the others

231
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,000
to most folks thc is the queen of course

232
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,400
and cbd is seriously helpful

233
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,399
but few folks understand the nature of

234
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,478
the acid and variant forms other than

235
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,560
knowing that thcv

236
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,680
tends to inhibit appetite and stops the

237
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,759
munchies

238
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,720
so i'm going to kind of hand this to you

239
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,919
in a basket

240
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,280
will you explain what the acid forms of

241
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:16,399
cannabinoids are

242
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,878
in relation to their non-acid versions

243
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,318
and then either during or after do that

244
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,680
same thing for the varins

245
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,840
so however you think it's going to be

246
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,560
explained more carefully the gist of the

247
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,918
question is

248
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,280
give us a better understanding what the

249
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,198
acid and variant forms of these

250
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,359
cannabinoids are

251
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,240
right so i mean the acid forms are it's

252
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,800
it's very

253
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,918
simple you just add a carboxylic acid to

254
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,278
the same position

255
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:42,399
um it's on the phenol or benzene

256
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:45,600
ring portion of the of the molecule

257
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,039
and it is like i said earlier it changes

258
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
the structure and the shape

259
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,519
and also you know the charge it's it's

260
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,720
called electronegativity but there's a

261
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
negative charge

262
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,639
on the acid versions of these and so

263
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,720
they display

264
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,159
very unique pharmacological profiles

265
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,680
meaning that

266
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,439
if you change the structure it will

267
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,159
change the receptors that it interacts

268
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,920
with it also

269
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,838
changes like i mentioned earlier about

270
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,958
like brain permeation like permeability

271
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,560
or the ability

272
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,799
uh for these molecules to get into the

273
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,679
brain um so it changes like the

274
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,759
distribution

275
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,599
of where these molecules end up

276
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,919
interacting in your body

277
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,000
um like it's there's been some pretty

278
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,879
interesting research done

279
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,919
i believe it's in australia on the acid

280
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,759
versions

281
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:33,519
of both thc cbd cbg

282
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,838
so you know thca cbda cbga and i think

283
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,000
cbd va

284
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,680
also um to mix up both the acid and the

285
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,200
variant form there

286
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,120
um there's been a lot of really

287
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,519
interesting research that's being done

288
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,720
on like anti-epileptic properties

289
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,200
specifically

290
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,480
um being linked to the these forms and

291
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,200
epilepsy shares

292
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,240
uh pathophysiology with a lot of other

293
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,399
um

294
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,159
a lot of other disorders that people use

295
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,720
cannabis for like migraines

296
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,399
cluster headaches um and so i think it's

297
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,800
gonna be really really interesting to

298
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,559
see

299
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,039
more research come out and also to see

300
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,679
more qualitative information come out

301
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,480
as people are able to you know

302
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,799
experiment

303
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,639
and see see what it what are the

304
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,838
therapeutic applications of it because i

305
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:20,159
definitely believe that there are unique

306
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,000
therapeutic applications for these rare

307
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,838
variations it's really interesting that

308
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,159
we're at this time where

309
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,000
patients are able to literally do

310
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,120
citizen science because

311
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,078
a prohibition for so long has has

312
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,240
stunted

313
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,439
scientific research and people who are

314
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,919
desperate for

315
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,279
relief you know take cannabinoids just

316
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,759
to say well all right they're safe

317
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,000
enough

318
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,360
let's just see what happens to them and

319
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,039
so we patients

320
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,480
stumble upon things and then we tell

321
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,120
people and we tell other they tell

322
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,320
people

323
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,480
next thing you know there's something

324
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,800
coming up from the underground that the

325
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,000
more formal scientific you know

326
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,958
community needs to

327
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,440
to you know jump on and get get evidence

328
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,599
to

329
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,519
um to back it up you know how you

330
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,079
describe the differences between the

331
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,399
acid forms and the regular forms

332
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,159
you know they're so different you know

333
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,759
how they access the brain or don't

334
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,919
access the brain is different

335
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,360
the receptors that they attach to are

336
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:14,958
different and it sounds like in

337
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,560
different amounts

338
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:22,239
it kind of gives me the idea that

339
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,599
we should not consider the acid forms to

340
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,879
even necessarily

341
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,800
be related in quality to

342
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:33,759
their their non-acid forms like cbda

343
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,639
doesn't necessarily act or do what cbd

344
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,679
does

345
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:41,039
thc a does not really act or

346
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,599
necessarily do what thc does and

347
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,039
it re it sounds like their their names

348
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,320
you know cannabidirol

349
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:52,159
for example that has more to do with

350
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,760
the the structure of the molecule

351
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,879
chemically and the the addition or

352
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,519
removal of this

353
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,639
acid component really makes it an

354
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,679
entirely different

355
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,839
cannabinoid than

356
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,039
you know it's more common non-acid

357
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,880
namesake

358
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,159
yeah i mean that structurally they're

359
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,240
very similar right

360
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,399
because the only difference is one

361
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,399
carbon two oxygens and then depending on

362
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,240
the ph there's a hydrogen there or not

363
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,600
um so like this like in structure

364
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,759
they're super similar

365
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,639
um and that's why they sit you know thc

366
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,759
and thca

367
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,600
cbg and cbga you know et cetera um so

368
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,399
they are very similar but in terms of

369
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,360
like small

370
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,839
yeah small changes in a molecule will

371
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,159
have

372
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,079
really really large changes in in

373
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,439
therapeutic effects profiles

374
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,199
so in terms of like considering them

375
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,560
different things like i would just like

376
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,639
say as an example

377
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,359
um you know in in the pharmaceutical

378
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,000
world as an example there are different

379
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,680
benzodiazepines they are

380
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,159
very similar um classes right but they

381
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,000
are all

382
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,439
slightly different structurally and

383
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,639
that's something that's kind of like the

384
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,120
same here where like

385
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,399
we have the cannabinoids but all the

386
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,480
rare cannabinoids are

387
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,919
similar but they do have slight

388
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,079
differences in structure

389
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,799
that can have really large overall

390
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,479
effects on like the therapeutic profile

391
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,078
right on so let's talk a little bit

392
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,120
about the varanz so

393
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:16,559
the varan's are of course you know

394
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,679
so hot right now because they're so hot

395
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:22,159
so hot because you know for for most of

396
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,679
us we all started with thc and then cbd

397
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,879
came out and kind of like rocked the

398
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,199
whole cannabis world

399
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,320
and then as people realized oh my gosh

400
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,920
if cbd

401
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,839
you know is such a big deal all these

402
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,919
other novel cannabinoids

403
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,760
uh we're all hungry for those now and to

404
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,240
learn about them and so we're diving

405
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,958
you know very you know diving deep into

406
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,079
them

407
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,399
and then you know the the varans

408
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:46,399
seem to be the ones that are going to be

409
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,958
hitting the scene next as these

410
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,480
as these seeds uh become available this

411
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,799
this coming summer

412
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,600
and really all i all i really know about

413
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,879
the varanz

414
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,159
is that um they are there there's not a

415
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,240
lot of them there have been

416
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,399
uh very few of them because they've been

417
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,440
bred out of cannabis more or less as

418
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,559
people

419
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,000
focused on breeding for thc and i am

420
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,759
told that thcv

421
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,440
is an appetite suppressant though i

422
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:16,559
haven't really had that experience

423
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:20,720
uh myself because i haven't had a varan

424
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:24,000
dominant thc varan dominant plant yet so

425
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,519
with all of that said what are you

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,440
unique to the varanz

427
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,959
so as they start coming on in the market

428
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,079
in the next year people have a little

429
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,759
bit of frame of mind

430
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,599
of what the hell people are even talking

431
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,439
about so the

432
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,959
the difference between the varians and

433
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,240
the parent molecule so like we're

434
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:42,000
talking about the parent

435
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,039
um molecule being thc or cbd for that

436
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,278
matter

437
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,198
those molecules have like if anyone

438
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,120
who's seen my videos i call them a fatty

439
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,919
tail i call it a fatty tail

440
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,959
those molecules have on the end of it a

441
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,360
five carbon

442
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,078
it's called a pentyl chain because

443
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,600
pencil for

444
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,078
five it has a 5-carbon chain at the end

445
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,320
of it

446
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:05,120
and that's just a really it's a fatty

447
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,959
tail it's just

448
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,560
a piece of the molecule that is very

449
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:12,879
sticky

450
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:14,799
sticky like butter greasy um and that

451
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,879
has a very unique like chemical property

452
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,679
that interacts with receptors um

453
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,198
the varins only have three carbons

454
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,319
instead of five

455
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:27,120
so they're shorter and there's a smaller

456
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,879
fatty tail so that changes the way that

457
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,320
it interacts with receptors

458
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,240
one of the things i think is really

459
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,199
interesting about

460
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,680
thcv specifically is its interaction

461
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,519
with

462
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:42,719
a receptor called trpv1 adolfo

463
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,240
are familiar it um stands for transient

464
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,240
receptor potential

465
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,360
vanilloid one it's not a very sexy name

466
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,278
for a receptor

467
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,600
um but it's it's a receptor that's an

468
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,198
ion channel that also interacts with the

469
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,680
endocannabinoid system

470
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,399
um and it's been shown to be important

471
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,198
for like pain management

472
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,600
anti-anti-inflammatory things and i

473
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,039
i'm wondering if it somehow is related

474
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,240
to its interaction with

475
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:09,120
trpv1 um that it causes this you know

476
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,759
this effect but i i haven't seen too

477
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,879
much

478
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,000
research on thcv yet i'm really excited

479
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,679
to see more of it

480
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,240
i think part of the reason why it's

481
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,838
difficult to study thcv is because it

482
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,919
falls underneath the

483
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,440
class of molecules that are regulated

484
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:27,039
since it's an analog

485
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,800
of thc um that is

486
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,240
at least why i think there's less on

487
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:34,000
thcv than say

488
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,600
cbd but i'm really excited to

489
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,600
to learn more about it i actually tried

490
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,759
um years ago i tried

491
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,639
like a i think it was a one to one to

492
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,039
one

493
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,079
micro doser like uh tab i think it was

494
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,120
called a tab lingual

495
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:51,278
was what it was called um and it was cbd

496
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,440
cbg and thcv if i remember correctly

497
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,480
um and it was very interesting but i

498
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,480
mean it you know that

499
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,680
it's there's a number of variables there

500
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,360
that i'm changing

501
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:00,958
um but it was a very interesting

502
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,600
experience i really enjoyed it

503
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,359
and i mean just the the pro the

504
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,000
therapeutic profile of it was completely

505
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,359
different

506
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,400
from thc when you're looking at the

507
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:15,359
molecular level for the varanz um

508
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,160
while we don't have a lot of research on

509
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:21,359
them yet for a host of reasons

510
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,279
do you as a chemist have you know

511
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,639
educated guesses on what you think the

512
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,399
veran's will do

513
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,079
or is it or are the are these

514
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,320
cannabinoids so different from each

515
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,079
other where you're all like

516
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,000
only god knows what's good the barons

517
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,879
are going to do after we test them

518
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,759
yeah i mean i guess i don't i guess i

519
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,679
don't know

520
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,359
necessarily like off the top of my head

521
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,679
what i would predict although i think

522
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,319
it's

523
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,320
interesting that so the shortening like

524
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,558
the shortening of that fatty tail

525
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,399
basically makes it structurally more

526
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,960
similar to

527
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,240
less fatty molecules of which there are

528
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,160
many in the body

529
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,679
um so i definitely think like without

530
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,038
without saying anything like for sure

531
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,960
that i definitely think that it has

532
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,720
unique pro like it has a unique profile

533
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,400
it probably has unique transport

534
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,240
around the body as well um and

535
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,919
i i know i would be really excited to

536
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,440
see it i mean i also think it's you know

537
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,400
this is just something that

538
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,160
um is difficult to think about when

539
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,440
we're talking about receptor receptor

540
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,360
pharmacology which is

541
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,480
you know how molecules interact with

542
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,159
receptors

543
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,240
um when we look at these things and we

544
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,798
test them we're testing one thing at a

545
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,120
time

546
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,879
and we're often looking at something for

547
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,199
a very specific reason

548
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,120
you know many of the rare cannabinoids

549
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,400
have not been tested against some of the

550
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,759
more classic

551
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,000
system um targets right like dopamine or

552
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,359
opioid or serotonin some of them have

553
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and there's definitely some information

554
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,879
out there

555
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,720
um but usually when we discover a rare

556
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,640
cannabinoid or we find something that's

557
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,240
structurally related to the cannabinoids

558
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,840
obviously the first thing you think is

559
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,480
to test them on the endocannabinoid

560
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,959
system

561
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,240
uh but it's just you know anyways just

562
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,640
research tends to get

563
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,759
categorized if i'm i'm trying to phrase

564
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,080
this correctly

565
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,839
um like the based on the grant funding

566
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,960
structure of of research

567
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,798
and how research is is funded um you end

568
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,919
up like having categories of research

569
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:11,599
where labs will

570
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,280
hyper-specialize in something because

571
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:14,959
you need to that's what you have to do

572
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,038
to get the funding to

573
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,880
do your research and do the papers so i

574
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,960
think that i mean i think as

575
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,440
as we expand beyond that and start

576
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,679
looking at crosstalk between systems

577
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,279
and and interactions like on on larger

578
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,600
scales which is starting to happen

579
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,319
already we're going to find some really

580
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,759
interesting

581
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:35,439
interactions between all of these alone

582
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,960
and then there's a whole nother level

583
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,960
when we start talking about putting them

584
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,960
together

585
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,360
yeah the the the crosstalk between the

586
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,558
systems is something that is huge and uh

587
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,319
honestly i have to give you credit

588
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,440
you're the one who taught me or or

589
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,918
turned me up

590
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,279
turned me on to start thinking about it

591
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,520
and also that is

592
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,038
potentially an entirely uh additional

593
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,200
show so

594
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,679
yeah don't don't get me started on the

595
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,200
crosstalk of endocannabinoid system with

596
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,120
others

597
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,798
right on well let's hold that aside and

598
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,558
we'll approach that another day

599
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:11,918
so so um let's talk about the feeling

600
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:13,119
that cannabinoids uh give us um we've we

601
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,240
talked a lot and

602
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,839
in part one about the the mechanics and

603
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,960
how the receptors work

604
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:23,199
and how um you know the cannabinoids can

605
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,558
block block each other from the

606
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,798
receptors

607
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,599
and we talked a lot about that mechanics

608
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:29,200
but but

609
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,000
you know that you know that sigh of

610
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,159
relief that folks get from a cocktail

611
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,400
at the end of a work day like when the

612
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,360
alcohol hits the bloodstream you can

613
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,200
feel your body

614
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:43,038
shift down a few gears and you go like

615
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,120
and then like everything feels a little

616
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:48,240
bit easier right

617
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,399
that also happens similarly

618
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,759
but but kind of different with cannabis

619
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,038
as well right we

620
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,960
you know for those of us who prefer

621
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,279
cannabis we'll we'll have a bit

622
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,360
and then it hits our bloodstream and it

623
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,399
comes on and we have like that similar

624
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,599
sigh

625
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,280
and we're kind of like you know

626
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,199
depending on the kind of canvas it is

627
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,720
where you're floating or in the zone

628
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:12,319
but whatever it is we can feel that

629
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,600
downshift from the intensity

630
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,200
of production mode right whether that's

631
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,279
like being at work or

632
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,200
or you know watching the kids or you

633
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:25,200
know whatever we happen to be doing

634
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:28,240
it shifts us down into some sort of

635
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,558
ease mindset what is

636
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,000
happening then right and and if it helps

637
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,119
to say what's happening with

638
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
with alcohol and then compare that to

639
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,519
to cannabis i'm all for that but but

640
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
there's something very specific

641
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,319
mechanically that happens in that moment

642
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,038
when when the first of the cannabinoids

643
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:50,319
hit the hit the bloodstream after work

644
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:52,240
and we shift down into not work

645
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,759
and i'm i think we're all curious what

646
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,440
what that is

647
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,519
so i'm gonna answer this ques we're

648
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,880
gonna get really abstract here i'm gonna

649
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,679
i'm gonna answer this question with

650
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,440
something

651
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,960
um an answer that is pretty much

652
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,360
something that can't be proven

653
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,038
but that is also absolutely true okay um

654
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,199
which is that everything in the brain is

655
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:12,240
subjective to contrast

656
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,640
um and in my opinion what we're

657
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,519
describing here is the shift

658
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,759
in your perception right it's this

659
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,480
contrast and that and how that initial

660
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,519
shift

661
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,558
like the first like the first hit right

662
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,000
versus like the second third fourth or

663
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,839
like what you were describing the first

664
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,038
drink at the end of the day right

665
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:36,959
um is that that initial change that

666
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:39,599
very first alteration in your perception

667
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,000
will always feel different than the

668
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,639
continuation of an altered state

669
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,480
um and that's just because everything

670
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,919
that we interpret in our brains

671
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,599
is is relative to what has happened

672
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,919
before i mean this that's also just true

673
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,678
like

674
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,320
in life and everything in general right

675
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,360
like every single thing that our

676
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,759
brain has is built upon a contrast of

677
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:04,719
the things that it's already experienced

678
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,200
and our brains are very used to um what

679
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,798
is the

680
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,240
way i want to describe this our our

681
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:09,759
brains are very used to getting into

682
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,079
like a status quo

683
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,079
um you know keeping everything the same

684
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,038
and then when you cause like a dramatic

685
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,558
shift in that

686
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,000
that initial shift it's like you know

687
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,119
when you're on a hot it's like it's a

688
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,200
hot day like

689
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,798
it's been really hot here recently and

690
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,319
you're in the air conditioning and then

691
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,400
you take your first step outside and

692
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,639
you're like whoa it is hot and humid

693
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,880
out here like and it's almost like when

694
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,240
you step outside for the first time or

695
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,760
vice versa in the winter you're in the

696
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,279
heat and you go out and it's cold

697
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:36,720
and you almost like can't breathe for a

698
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,240
second because you're like wow that

699
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,200
change in temperature was

700
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,079
dramatic like that was a dramatic change

701
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,919
um and then

702
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,199
you're you're out there for less than 30

703
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,799
seconds or a minute and you're more used

704
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,120
to it

705
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,400
it's something more similar to that

706
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,199
except in

707
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,240
your processing of your brain and in

708
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,400
that status right

709
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,519
um because absolutely like the

710
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,000
cannabinoids have

711
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,400
anxiolytic effects right like they in

712
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,798
general they can they're relaxing

713
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,919
um and that's true all the time but in

714
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,798
that initial

715
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,360
that first initial phase of changing

716
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:11,038
your

717
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,399
like altering your pharmacology and your

718
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:14,158
brain um

719
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,000
that initial change will feel different

720
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,080
and i think that that has to do with the

721
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,519
fact that it's in contrast

722
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,960
to what you were like before yeah that

723
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:24,960
that makes a lot of sense and you know

724
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,798
that that plays out with how

725
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:32,880
we experience it as a human too because

726
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:35,119
on on our harder days sigh of relief

727
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,000
seems to be more intense right if you've

728
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,439
had absolutely

729
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,720
yeah if you if you have a light day and

730
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,798
you come home and you puff you're like

731
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,400
ah today was a pretty good day oh my my

732
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,759
my cannabis is pretty good too i'm gonna

733
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
have a good evening right it's kind of

734
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:46,640
like

735
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,840
like a uniform but if you've had you

736
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,159
know a really

737
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,240
challenging day that has pushed and

738
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,760
pulled you emotionally

739
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,440
and you get to the end of the day and it

740
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,919
hits your bloodstream you're like oh my

741
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,278
god

742
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,520
my favorite thing thank god you know and

743
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,558
that makes sense the contrast aspect to

744
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,599
it

745
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:08,399
you also mentioned the anti-anxiety

746
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,558
um aspects of it um would you hit that

747
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,759
on a molecular level like what what is

748
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,038
actually happening

749
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:18,158
to kick off that uh did you call it an

750
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:20,240
anxiolytic yeah anxiolytic

751
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,159
so this is a kind of a honestly this is

752
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,960
kind of a complicated one to explain

753
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,400
because

754
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,840
the cb1 receptor so thc activates the

755
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,798
cb1 receptor

756
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,399
that receptor has been associated with

757
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,158
decreasing anxiety or having an

758
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,038
anxiolytic effect at like lower

759
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,360
concentrations

760
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,919
it's also possible that it causes

761
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:43,278
anxiety so there's this whole like

762
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,440
very delicate balance going on um with

763
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,919
why this happens but in in general

764
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,759
um at least at low concentrations

765
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,799
activating the cb1 receptor is

766
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,919
responsible

767
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:55,839
for reducing some types of anxiety

768
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,520
um it's not really i'm trying to think

769
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,639
of like in terms of like

770
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,319
research that's been done um most of the

771
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,080
most of their research has been an

772
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,319
animal models although some of it

773
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,439
has been like repeated in humans and it

774
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,439
seems like

775
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,200
um it's called a biphasic effect it

776
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,360
seems like at a high

777
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,319
concentration there's a second threshold

778
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,240
that you'll reach

779
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,558
where all of a sudden it reverses and it

780
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,599
causes anxiety or it causes paranoia

781
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:21,119
right

782
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,879
and one thing i've been really

783
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,359
passionate about educating people about

784
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,240
is that

785
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,759
our our thresholds are different every

786
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,558
one of us will have a different

787
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,839
you know threshold for that second level

788
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:33,678
of that effect

789
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,759
so for some people they might never get

790
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,519
anxiety right

791
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,200
and others it might be a side effect

792
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,720
that it's you know it's very easy for

793
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,798
them to to come across

794
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,519
i would be in that second category and i

795
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:48,639
got to tell you it's made me very aware

796
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,918
of you know in in the scene people talk

797
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,120
about puff and tough right

798
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,919
you know it's like like you know how

799
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,918
have more

800
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,120
finish the joint have another hit you

801
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,480
know we we

802
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:02,079
part of cannabis is definitely

803
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,159
you know there's pressure to always use

804
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,960
more right and um

805
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,960
and i find that i think that that really

806
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,400
stems from a lack of understanding by

807
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,319
most folks that

808
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,080
of this biphasic effect where you know

809
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,399
if you have a bit

810
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,319
you have the decrease of anxiety and the

811
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,840
increase of euphoria

812
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:23,359
and and your joy increases that's that's

813
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,319
wonderful

814
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,678
but where that that tapers off and and

815
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,240
becomes

816
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,278
anxiety causing is different for every

817
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,440
person and i for myself i know that

818
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,038
you know i can smoke a certain amount

819
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,600
and it'll put me right where i want to

820
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,879
be

821
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:43,199
but if i go beyond that i can feel

822
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,919
i actually don't know what i feel i feel

823
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,960
i mean i think about it as

824
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,440
my my adrenaline turns on that's that's

825
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,798
how i

826
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,720
explain it i'm like oh you're your

827
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,240
flight your fight or flight okay so good

828
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,919
right well i'm not that far off so so

829
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,839
i'll have that little bit more and i'll

830
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,200
just like feel it turn on

831
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,278
like like you would feel an air

832
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,200
conditioner in your hvac come on i was

833
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:04,880
like oh air conditioner camera or oh

834
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,960
first time the heater came on for the

835
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,640
fall you know you can feel the house

836
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,720
rumbling well the same thing

837
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,559
i will smoke a bit and i'll have a great

838
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,440
time and then i'll and then i'll smoke a

839
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:17,119
bunch

840
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,679
and i'll feel the adrenaline kick on and

841
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,199
you know i've been smoking for so long

842
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,120
now that i'm like oh okay

843
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,960
time to go outside for a walk time to

844
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,119
step out outside of the party

845
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,798
time to you know like whatever to do a

846
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,199
little bit of self-care

847
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,319
and check in on my set and setting so

848
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,759
that i don't get

849
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:37,599
upset however we do have to be aware

850
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,038
that we all have got a different

851
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:41,599
threshold for that and

852
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,558
some people may never hit the anxiety

853
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:44,158
causing part

854
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,398
and then there are other people like me

855
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,520
who it my body tends to kick it in

856
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:51,038
pretty low

857
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:53,038
so you know i know that i need to check

858
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,798
myself earlier i run into this actually

859
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,398
at conventions a lot right where people

860
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,398
are outside and everybody's puffing and

861
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,678
trying each other's stuff and everybody

862
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:00,798
wants me to try their stuff because

863
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,880
they're proud of it and i want to

864
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,398
celebrate how great their their grow is

865
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,720
but at the same time i'm like if i do

866
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:06,798
that

867
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,319
a few times in a row suddenly i'm so

868
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:09,679
anxious i can't go back into the

869
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,678
convention right

870
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,159
so so we will use you know will you

871
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,080
speak to that aspect of it about

872
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,600
um you know like what happens

873
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,000
mechanically if you will

874
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:20,959
when we when we hit our biphasic

875
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,519
threshold

876
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,519
well absolutely so i'm also i am right

877
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,240
there with you i'm a total lightweight

878
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,879
um specifically when it comes to anxiety

879
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,960
and

880
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,880
paranoia um and i mean i'm at the point

881
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,759
now where like i actually don't usually

882
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,080
smoke anything

883
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,919
from anyone else because i mix things

884
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,359
very specifically for me and other

885
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,759
people are welcome to smoke with me like

886
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,599
i

887
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,119
would love to smoke i'd love to smoke

888
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,519
you out at some point like we got to do

889
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,639
that

890
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:51,200
but but uh you know i'm

891
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,640
very sensitive um and it's been one of

892
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,120
my passions to understand

893
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,799
this biphasic effect and it has to do

894
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,079
with what's called endocannabinoid tone

895
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:59,359
and i know we discussed this a little

896
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,079
bit on the previous

897
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,278
um the previous talk and we were talking

898
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,678
about dr russo's

899
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,640
clinical endocannabinoid deficiency but

900
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,480
it

901
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,640
in general endocannabinoid tone

902
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,798
describes the levels of circulating

903
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,159
endocannabinoids in your body and then

904
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:19,278
also the levels of the receptors the cb1

905
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:22,000
cb2 receptors probably also trpv1 and

906
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:24,000
some of the gprs

907
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,679
these things are all different for each

908
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,798
of us this is also a way of just

909
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,480
it's one way of describing

910
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,398
neurodiversity for those of you who are

911
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,798
familiar with neurodiversity

912
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:33,839
neurodiversity is describes just

913
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:35,918
differences

914
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,918
in the way that our brains can all

915
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,399
process and have information

916
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,278
um and we are all like we are all very

917
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:42,639
similar

918
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,240
in the way that our brains process

919
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,000
information and then we are all very

920
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,558
very different and one of those ways

921
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,679
has to do with endocannabinoid signaling

922
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:50,960
and the actual levels of

923
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,440
endocannabinoids

924
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,240
um so in terms of being really really

925
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,399
sensitive

926
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,480
it means that for for both you and i

927
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:02,000
when it comes to like anxiety or

928
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,399
or paranoia there is probably that we

929
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,119
have

930
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:08,000
an increased level of cb1 receptors in a

931
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,239
very specific part of our brain

932
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,119
that maybe people who do not have a high

933
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,519
threshold of that

934
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,518
have lower levels of cb1 receptors and

935
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,000
are not as sensitive to that

936
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,519
it's also why to a certain extent if you

937
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,200
develop levels of tolerance

938
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,960
sometimes certain side effects will go

939
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,600
away because

940
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,679
tolerance is usually it's associated

941
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:28,719
with a decrease in the number of cb1

942
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,240
receptors

943
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,079
so some people when they develop

944
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,599
tolerance will realize that like certain

945
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,720
effects go away i mean generally when

946
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,719
you develop tolerance

947
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,480
you know all of the effects go away

948
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,038
without using more but

949
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,880
for it's usually like certain effects

950
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:43,839
one at a time right like some of them go

951
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,880
away first

952
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:49,038
um and that has to do with changing the

953
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,120
levels of cb1 receptors in very specific

954
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,839
areas

955
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,439
right on so before we move on i think i

956
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,359
want to just make a very intentional

957
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,120
plug i mean we made the case very

958
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,158
obvious for folks but

959
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:05,518
if you are a listener and you have

960
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:08,960
um you know a low biphasic threshold for

961
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:11,278
anxiety so you you puff a little

962
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,240
and you get your no your anxiety

963
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,919
decreased

964
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,720
and then you puff more and your anxiety

965
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,360
increases my friend do not let people

966
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,798
bully you

967
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,798
into taking more thc really not

968
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,798
and if you are one of these people who

969
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:27,200
have got a very high threshold for this

970
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:28,879
and

971
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,720
let's say that you're you know you're

972
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,399
dabbing and you can puff with everybody

973
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,038
and you can puff all night

974
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,599
please do not bully those of us who uh

975
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:40,000
have got a lower biphasic threshold

976
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:41,759
into smoking with you for sure offer it

977
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
to us but please don't bully people into

978
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,720
it

979
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,759
because it really is different for folks

980
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,360
and if you are

981
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,960
if you care for that person enough that

982
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,119
you want to get them high

983
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,399
also be you know have enough care for

984
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:54,879
them to

985
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,639
let them tell you that you know they've

986
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,760
had enough because we don't want to

987
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,840
you know you don't want to make your

988
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,839
friend anxious so so anyway

989
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:04,319
uh i'll get off my soapbox on that one

990
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,839
but i absolutely agree with that because

991
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,678
all of us are trying to just have a good

992
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,439
time right like everyone

993
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,038
we're all trying to increase quality of

994
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,399
life essentially

995
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:14,720
and i think that's going to be that's

996
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,319
going to be different for all of us and

997
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,480
i think it's important to know and also

998
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,960
as another psi i would love

999
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,919
for people to start regularly saying

1000
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,880
like oh yeah my biphasic threshold for

1001
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,320
thc

1002
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,240
i would love to make that a regular

1003
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,960
thing it's actually thc is biphasic for

1004
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,240
a number

1005
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,000
of effects it's not just anxiety um so

1006
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,679
it's true that each of us has very

1007
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,839
specific side effects that we're you

1008
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,640
know prone to i'm also prone to getting

1009
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:42,240
very cold

1010
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,799
are you prone to that django um i'm not

1011
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,480
actually um i'm familiar i'm familiar

1012
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:49,440
with it i actually get cold

1013
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,360
from um allergy medications how

1014
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,000
interesting my extremities specifically

1015
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,798
i get like cold

1016
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,599
fingers and stuff huh histamine

1017
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:58,798
receptors

1018
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:00,480
yeah interesting um all right so so

1019
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,558
let's hit one more question on this on

1020
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,319
this tolerance and cannabinoids thing

1021
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,639
before we go to the break so

1022
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:07,918
so you know we talked about like the the

1023
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,440
having that end of

1024
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:15,200
day toke and how it shifts us down

1025
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,159
and decreases our anxiety and

1026
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,078
um you know anybody who's told and who

1027
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,679
really appreciates that aspect has

1028
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,039
probably also come home

1029
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,280
and have a toke and nothing happens

1030
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,960
and and you talk and you're like you

1031
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,800
know something's not

1032
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,280
working and you know depending on the

1033
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,839
person they might blame the flower

1034
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,879
or they might say that oh it's my

1035
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:39,358
tolerance

1036
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,799
but but you know as somebody who studies

1037
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,960
this in the lab

1038
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,159
what are your thoughts on what are the

1039
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,878
most common i mean

1040
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,800
do you think it's more often than not

1041
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,878
like a tolerance response or

1042
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,079
are there also just some days that we're

1043
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,559
not gonna get high

1044
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,919
because of the chemical blend in our

1045
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,838
brain that day

1046
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,118
so so i think that there's a number i

1047
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,279
mean tolerance definitely

1048
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,200
may play a part in it but i've always i

1049
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,880
mean set in setting which is usually

1050
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:06,799
talked about in psychedelics right

1051
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,358
usually that's a more common

1052
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,119
um it's a more common thing that people

1053
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:12,799
talk about in psychedelics i

1054
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,400
really feel like the endocannabinoid

1055
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,640
system and serotonin system

1056
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,880
share an extremely strong synergy i

1057
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:21,118
consider cannabis a soft psychedelic

1058
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,079
um there are certainly near psychedelic

1059
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,599
experiences or

1060
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,280
i would even i would classify them as

1061
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,320
psychedelic experiences that i've had on

1062
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,519
cannabis

1063
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,720
um i think that set and setting are

1064
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,838
really important

1065
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:35,279
and i think that we don't often you know

1066
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,599
we don't often think about

1067
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,280
so set being like the mindset that

1068
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,800
you're going into and then setting being

1069
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,400
the environment sometimes your

1070
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,119
environment can be like

1071
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,160
you're like the stress levels of the day

1072
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,160
and what you're planning

1073
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,799
what you are planning or anticipating on

1074
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:55,199
doing um all of these things play a role

1075
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:57,839
in your neurochemistry and i definitely

1076
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,039
feel like alterations in your

1077
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:01,599
neurochemistry

1078
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:04,079
will affect the way that you know

1079
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,640
molecules feel when you take them

1080
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,280
and it's not always going to be the same

1081
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,879
and i

1082
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,480
i know that like what we're looking for

1083
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,480
is for something to always be

1084
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,079
exactly the same effect but even with i

1085
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,199
mean everyone if we're going to make the

1086
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,760
the same um metaphor with alcohol

1087
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,319
it's the same way you know sometimes

1088
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,160
it's

1089
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,519
it's a generally generally speaking you

1090
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:24,799
have a effect right

1091
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,159
but sometimes you have a really great

1092
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,000
night and then other times like you're

1093
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,598
sad and you cry

1094
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,199
you're angry yeah that's a really good

1095
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,559
example you're right about that i hadn't

1096
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:34,480
made that connection before

1097
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,000
yeah but it's pretty similar right

1098
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,039
because your brain so

1099
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,239
the way that our our brains sort of like

1100
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:44,079
function and perceive the the world is

1101
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:45,759
always in response our brain is always

1102
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,720
changing like we are always

1103
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,960
in flux we're always going our brains

1104
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,358
always responding to something and it's

1105
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,838
always

1106
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:55,679
changing so like right now you and i

1107
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:58,719
having this conversation

1108
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,199
our brain is in a transition from what

1109
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,719
it was

1110
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:02,559
two minutes ago to what it's going to be

1111
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,919
two minutes from now what it was

1112
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,880
yesterday to what it's going to be

1113
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,720
tomorrow

1114
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,079
what it was last month to what it's

1115
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:10,639
going to be next month

1116
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,640
etc there are changes that are going on

1117
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:15,598
on every scale of time

1118
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:16,078
in the brain all the time and so that

1119
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,079
will

1120
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,920
be different depending on a number of

1121
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,000
factors and like you brought up

1122
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,920
having stress having a really bad day be

1123
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,400
you know feeling really negative

1124
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,079
um that will alter your neurochemistry

1125
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,800
it's been shown and proven that when

1126
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,760
you're happy

1127
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,200
right like you actually see more your

1128
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,240
your vision is clearer

1129
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:38,000
and you notice more things um i won't

1130
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:39,439
get too deep into positive psychology

1131
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,039
because that's like a whole nother

1132
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,800
that's a whole nother rabbit hole that

1133
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,400
along with crosstalk that we could go on

1134
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,039
to for forever but

1135
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,079
i am a very big believer in positive

1136
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,199
psychology

1137
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,039
i think that there are subconscious

1138
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,919
things that we cannot change and that we

1139
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,519
can't alter

1140
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,280
but i also believe that there are

1141
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:58,960
conscious things that we can change

1142
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,359
in our minds and that we can really

1143
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,240
focus on and behaviorally modify in

1144
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:05,279
ourselves

1145
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:07,919
that has an impact on our neurochemistry

1146
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,839
um whether or not these things can be

1147
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,960
measured at this exact moment like

1148
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:15,759
i i couldn't tell you but i

1149
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,720
know for a fact that set and setting in

1150
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,520
the way that we

1151
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:20,399
approach like an experience really

1152
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:22,000
changes

1153
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,838
the outcome of the experience i mean

1154
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,920
that that's part of why cannabis has

1155
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:29,679
such a high placebo effect right

1156
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,599
um is the expectation and what we are

1157
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:34,000
like wanting to receive from the

1158
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:37,039
experience having a having a big impact

1159
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,838
i love the idea that some positive

1160
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,920
soft talk some some you know thoughts in

1161
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:44,480
your brain or some mumbling to yourself

1162
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,960
about you know self-care and self-love

1163
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,199
and you know being worthy could actually

1164
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,800
make our high better i think i think

1165
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,838
that's a beautiful thing and i think

1166
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,880
that we should make that

1167
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:57,599
the uh the custom oh i

1168
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,200
i i absolutely feel like that's you know

1169
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,559
that's true that's why meditation goes

1170
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:02,639
so hand in hand

1171
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,078
right now cannabis and other and other

1172
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,480
psychedelics right like

1173
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,680
awareness fantastic all right viaby

1174
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,960
we're gonna go ahead and take our short

1175
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,118
break and be right back

1176
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,800
you are listening to shaping fire and my

1177
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,890
guest today is cannabinoid

1180
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,118
for years organic cultivators have been

1181
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:21,920
looking for a replacement for using peat

1182
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,920
moss

1183
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,440
peat moss has long been the go-to soil

1184
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,480
amendment for water retention and

1185
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,559
container growing

1186
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,400
but organic growers know that peat moss

1187
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,239
is an unsustainable resource

1188
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,880
and the mining of peat bogs destroys

1189
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,719
habitat and releases sequestered carbon

1190
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,240
but peat moss works so well that many

1191
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,239
have continued to use it

1192
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,078
but now there's finally a revolutionary

1193
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,039
replacement for peat moss that shares

1194
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,079
the same benefits

1195
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,400
while also being sustainable pit moss

1196
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,160
sounds and axe like peat moss but

1197
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,119
instead of being mined from fragile

1198
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:52,719
ecosystems

1199
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,640
it actually is made from upcycled

1200
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,799
organic paper and tree bark

1201
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,319
pit moss is excellent at retaining water

1202
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,119
in your substrate and creating air

1203
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,599
pockets and

1204
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,320
tiny living environments for microbes

1205
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,880
pit moss

1206
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,519
instantly increases aeration nutrient

1207
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,240
absorption

1208
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,280
and water conservation too carefully and

1209
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,279
locally sourced

1210
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,599
pit moss is the result of decades-long

1211
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,640
research into the use of recycled paper

1212
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,039
fibers

1213
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:19,358
pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat

1214
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:22,239
moss and handles exactly the same

1215
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:24,159
and like peat moss pit moss is inert so

1216
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,000
it won't change your ph

00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,279
look for in a horticultural lighting

solution

1241
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,720
i've bought those cheap lights online

1242
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,559
and they're difficult to work with and

1243
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:24,559
fail in no time in contrast my bios led

1244
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:25,119
light is industrial grade to last a long

1245
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,318
time

1246
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,838
it is ip66 wet rated so little foliar

1247
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:31,679
overspray won't harm it

1248
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:33,679
it is easy to clean without taking it

1249
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:34,318
down and of course the most important

1250
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,719
aspect

1251
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:39,199
is built for the exact light spectrum i

1252
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:39,919
want for great yielding healthy cannabis

plants

1254
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,519
and it doesn't hurt that their lighting

1255
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,760
rigs look badass too

1256
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,358
many horticultural led lighting systems

1257
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,359
are based on irrelevant performance

1258
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:50,639
metrics and people love to argue online

1259
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,559
about these numbers

1260
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:54,960
i prefer to judge on par photon

1261
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,639
efficiency and how happy my plants are

1262
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,960
and the bios lights exceed my

1263
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:01,279
expectations in these categories

1264
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,000
bios lights have an optimized broad

1265
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,079
spectrum that

1266
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,559
maximizes photosynthesis and plant

1267

growth while also providing the ideal

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,000
back you are listening to shaping fire i

1346
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,079
am your

1347
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,838
host shango los and our guest this week

1348
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,359
is cannabinoid pharmacologist

1349
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:58,078
miyabi shields phd so miyabi we've

1350
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:01,358
talked about

1351
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,359
these different um methods of

1352
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:04,880
bringing the cabin cannabinoids into our

1353
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:06,480
body but anybody

1354
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,079
who has spent a lot of time with

1355
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,880
cannabis and has

1356
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,880
you know smoked and had edibles and

1357
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,280
maybe try to sublingual

1358
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,640
they know that they all hit different

1359
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,079
and and when i say

1360
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:21,679
hit different i mean that they come on

1361
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:25,039
at a different rate

1362
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:27,838
and they feel different in the body

1363
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:29,920
and often they will have different

1364
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:33,199
medicinal effects depending on

1365
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,440
how we ingest them

1366
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,358
so would you please explain the

1367
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,079
differences in how our body

1368
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,039
absorbs the cannabinoids that method of

1369
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,440
action

1370
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,159
and then the differences chemically so

1371
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,358
we as

1372
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:50,639
patients can use the best mode

1373
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:53,358
for our desired relief yeah

1374
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:53,759
absolutely so i'm gonna hit the first

1375
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:56,078
two

1376
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,000
the two largest and most significant

1377
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,000
routes of administration

1378
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
which is edibles which is an oral

1379
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,480
administration or smoking

1380
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,079
um so with edibles there's well there's

1381
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,039
three differences in the two routes the

1382
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,960
first one is

1383
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:13,279
like the actual absorption right um so

1384
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,079
that means when when and where do the

1385
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,800
molecules

1386
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,000
enter your body and how are those

1387
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,960
molecules entering your

1388
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,559
entering your body when you smoke all of

1389
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,039
the cannabinoids are absorbed in the

1390
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:25,679
lungs

1391
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,800
they get from the lungs into the blood

1392
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:28,480
and go to the brain

1393
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,240
directly and it happens all at once i

1394
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,559
mean it happens in like

1395
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:34,799
less than a second that isn't there also

1396
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,559
just for every also a psa like don't

1397
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,400
hold in your hits like it happens really

1398
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,239
really quickly you don't have to like

1399
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,240
don't hold your breath like that's no

1400
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:43,759
don't do that and let's

1401
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:45,439
since we're going to hit that and let's

1402
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,079
also reference

1403
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,838
uh from the robert littman episode all

1404
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,720
on cannabis and breathing

1405
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:54,799
that not only is it not necessary to get

1406
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:55,279
your cannabinoids out as miyabi is

1407
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,440
saying

1408
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,599
but the longer you hit your hit the more

1409
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,960
damage you are causing your lungs and

1410
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,400
your cilia

1411
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,159
from having the hot heat in your lungs

1412
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,440
and like smoke particulates and other

1413
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:09,279
things that will come over

1414
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,760
the longer you're holding your breath so

1415
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,040
definitely yeah no holding of breath

1416
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,359
it happened anyways it happens really

1417
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,119
quickly so all of the cannabinoids get

1418
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:18,318
absorbed like let's say within one

1419
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,318
second of each other

1420
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:21,838
all of them go to the brain and then

1421
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:23,599
have their effect that's why

1422
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,358
um usually it's like 10 minutes right

1423
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,240
there's like a 10 minute onset between

1424
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:28,159
the blood

1425
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,399
going from your lungs your heart pumps

1426
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:32,799
it up to your brain really really quick

1427
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,920
um with edibles you eat them they go

1428
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,359
through your stomach

1429
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,599
and then they're absorbed in the small

1430
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:38,558
intestine they actually have to pass

1431
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,599
through the liver

1432
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:43,200
first before then your your body pumps

1433
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,400
them all the way through and then it

1434
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:46,480
gets to your brain

1435
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,920
um so in terms of absorption it takes a

1436
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,519
really long time i mean it could take

1437
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,200
anywhere between like 30 minutes to

1438
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,559
sometimes like three hours i've heard

1439
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,960
people say that like

1440
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,160
an edible has hit them like four to six

1441
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,760
hours later

1442
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,440
it also depends a lot on like what

1443
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,559
you've eaten that day what does your

1444
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,679
diet look like

1445
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:06,079
do you have any gi issues or gi motility

1446
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:08,159
issues that you struggle with right um

1447
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,920
so these things can all alter like the

1448
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,159
length of time and that's has to do with

1449
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,000
absorption um that's the first thing is

1450
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:15,598
absorption the second difference is

1451
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
metabolism

1452
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,440
so in the smoking example when you're

1453
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,239
smoking it in the lungs it goes straight

1454
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,599
to the brain

1455
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:25,358
there is no metabolism between that

1456
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,800
between that stage between it going from

1457
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:29,838
your lungs to your brain

1458
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,680
there's no metabolism so it's thc

1459
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:33,679
and they in terms of like getting

1460
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:35,679
metabolized or deactivated it also

1461
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:37,440
happens all at once which is kind of why

1462
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:38,879
smoking hap like has a very short

1463
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,159
duration of action

1464
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,838
um that's because as um

1465
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:44,960
as the smoke is like after it goes to

1466
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,639
your brain then it goes to your liver

1467
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,639
and it all gets metabolized

1468
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,239
um as opposed to edibles they get

1469
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,078
metabolized first

1470
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:53,679
so when you eat an edible gets absorbed

1471
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,000
in the small intestine goes through the

1472
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:58,639
liver and gets metabolized

1473
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,358
most of us make 11 hydroxy as the

1474
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:02,480
primary

1475
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:05,679
metabolite which is more potent and has

1476
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,199
stronger effects um i think there's so

1477
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:08,879
there's another metabolite it's a

1478
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:10,879
carboxy version of it

1479
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,280
that is inactive i do think that a

1480
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,079
significant portion of people who cannot

1481
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,960
feel edibles

1482
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,318
create that metabolite i would love for

1483
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,400
someone to study that

1484
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,079
um because there is a significant

1485
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,440
portion of the population that can't

1486
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,839
feel edibles that's like a whole

1487
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,280
other topic um but for those of us who

1488
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:30,000
can feel edibles your

1489
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,960
your body metabolizes thc into 11

1490
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,960
hydroxy

1491
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,240
that is actually the molecule that will

1492
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,240
go into your brain

1493
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:38,399
and cause effects which is part of the

1494
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,000
reason why edibles feel different

1495
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,680
and then like i said earlier about the

1496
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,318
absorption happening more slowly over

1497
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,318
time

1498
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:45,838
that means that 11 hydroxy is present

1499
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:47,279
more slowly over time it'll last much

1500
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:48,318
longer that's another reason why the

1501
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,359
duration of action

1502
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:53,119
is longer before it gets deactivated

1503
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:54,960
and then the third difference which

1504
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:58,079
people don't usually talk about

1505
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,039
is um transformation at high

1506
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,680
temperatures

1507
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,558
so cannabinoids are pretty sensitive

1508
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:04,879
molecules

1509
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,119
and when you heat them to temperatures

1510
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:10,160
that are above say like 300 degrees

1511
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:12,480
fahrenheit you know

1512
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,558
you're causing a significant change in

1513
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,039
in molecular structure for a significant

1514
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,519
portion

1515
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:19,759
of of the cannabinoids that are present

1516
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,119
uh for example like i think at 300

1517
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,079
degrees fahrenheit

1518
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,680
uh studies done on thc it was about 30

1519
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,559
of the thc converts

1520
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,000
into cbn or cannabinol uh that's a

1521
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:33,119
dehydration reaction

1522
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,760
so basically um two hydrogens are

1523
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,039
removed

1524
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,880
from um is it two

1525
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,880
there's there's two extra double bonds

1526
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,880
in the in the top ring

1527
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,720
um and it changes the actual formulation

1528
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,400
and actually this is like my main this

1529
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,239
is my main research focus so i

1530
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,079
maybe maybe stop because i'll go on

1531
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,639
forever and ever about this one

1532
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,000
but um basically if you're smoking and

1533
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:57,759
you're using a lighter

1534
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,119
a lighter can reach temperatures well

1535
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,040
above a thousand degrees

1536
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,880
fahrenheit right if even if you're

1537
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:03,440
smoking a j right or like spliff or

1538
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,559
something

1539
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,358
you have an ember the actual that's a

1540
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,280
whole different

1541
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:10,719
chemistry because the actual area of the

1542
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,319
ember is a different temperature than

1543
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,159
the area right above it

1544
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:16,400
and so there's this i mean joints are

1545
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:19,838
very complicated which i i also love

1546
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,639
um but you get this this very high

1547
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:22,880
temperature

1548
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:25,519
transformation and a significant amount

1549
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,720
of the cannabinoids are transformed so

1550
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:27,920
you get a different formulation and

1551
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:29,279
that's the third

1552
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,920
the third difference because most

1553
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,599
edibles are made to preserve

1554
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:37,760
thc or more recently also now cbd

1555
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,599
and that is part of the reason why

1556
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,760
smoking feels so different is because it

1557
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,318
is actually a completely different

1558
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,920
formulation of cannabinoids all right

1559
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:48,318
that idea that um

1560
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,599
the the lighter can change the

1561
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:53,279
cannabinoids that in

1562
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,000
itself is like a huge thing that i put

1563
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,440
into my notes

1564
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,639
that we should talk about later because

1565
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,000
we could we could do the rest of the

1566
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,239
show on that but let's

1567
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,039
let's hold that aside for a moment and

1568
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:04,318
focus on

1569
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:07,519
on first the um the

1570
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:10,880
the two different forms of

1571
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:13,119
thc or or cannabinoids that can come

1572
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,400
out of the liver um you said we could

1573
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,800
you know that's a whole new path but

1574
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,760
let's

1575
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,000
let's hit that path so so there are you

1576
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,520
know

1577
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,280
there are patients that talk to me

1578
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:24,559
regularly who

1579
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:27,200
who are concerned slash annoyed

1580
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,160
that they eat edibles and nothing

1581
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:30,719
happens to them

1582
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:32,480
or they can you know they can eat a

1583
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:35,919
hundred milligram

1584
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,719
uh thc rich

1585
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,960
edible and like get a little high and

1586
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,959
and they're both frustrated because it's

1587
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,679
much more expensive for them and if and

1588
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,599
if they are a patient who needs edibles

1589
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:50,000
then they're in a very difficult

1590
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,160
position and and and you said that

1591
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,039
when the cannabinoid goes through the

1592
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:55,759
liver it

1593
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:57,358
it'll break into 11 hydroxy or or a

1594
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,480
second one that i that i actually miss

1595
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:01,759
the name of

1596
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:05,280
so are you suggesting that that

1597
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:08,640
each human has got their own ratio of

1598
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,599
thc into the liver and then coming

1599
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:12,239
out is this different percentage between

1600
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,599
these

1601
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:19,118
the 11 hydroxy and the secondary one

1602
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:21,280
and and if it's less 11 hydroxy

1603
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,680
you may have to eat a whole lot more

1604
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,599
edible in order to get the results and

1605
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:27,358
the relief that you're looking for

1606
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,119
yeah this is actually a problem that

1607
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:31,679
this is a problem that i brought up

1608
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,680
um to other scientists a couple weeks

1609
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,279
ago at an international conference for

1610
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:37,519
like cannabis science and like

1611
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,359
no one had had heard of this phenomenon

1612
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,159
i would not be aware of this phenomenon

1613
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:43,039
if it wasn't for

1614
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:44,000
tick-tock actually i'd never heard of it

1615
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,679
before

1616
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,119
i think that there are three possible

1617
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:48,879
there are like there are some

1618
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,599
possibilities for why this happens to

1619
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,838
people

1620
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,680
um and i and none of these have been

1621
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:55,199
proven yet um but they are just all

1622
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:56,558
theory right the first one is like a

1623
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:58,318
problem with absorption

1624
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,400
there's some sort of problem where the

1625
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,800
thc doesn't really get absorbed at all

1626
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,318
um i do not think this is a this is a

1627
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,800
likely problem because of

1628
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:07,358
like how thc is it's such a fat soluble

1629
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,280
molecule

1630
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:11,440
it comes over membranes really really

1631
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,040
easily so i don't think that that's a

1632
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,800
possible like i don't think that's

1633
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:16,639
like the possibility for most people but

1634
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,519
it's it's an option right some people

1635
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:20,879
might have

1636
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:22,719
an altered microbiome for example or

1637
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,800
differences in absorption and then they

1638
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:27,679
just are are not actually absorbing

1639
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,119
the the thc in the small intestine um

1640
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:30,879
the next two pro the next two

1641
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,760
possibilities have to do with metabolism

1642
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,240
so

1643
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,119
there are two phases of metabolism uh

1644
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,279
phase one

1645
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,240
was the one i was talking about with

1646
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,640
hydrox the

1647
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:42,719
the the formation of 11 hydroxy phase

1648
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:45,519
one is normally just oxidation

1649
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:47,519
so you add an oxygen and the other

1650
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:48,559
option was a carboxy i don't want to

1651
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:49,679
name the whole name because it's just

1652
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,240
like numbers and

1653
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:54,399
not fun but the second version of it is

1654
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:55,039
a carboxy which is just a carboxylic

1655
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,960
acid

1656
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:59,039
instead of a hydroxyl group which is

1657
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,000
just another it's basically one extra

1658
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:01,519
oxygen

1659
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,639
um similar to what i was talking to

1660
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:08,159
about uh thca right a carboxylic acid

1661
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:10,480
versus thc in this case though um

1662
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:12,639
the our bodies add the carboxylic acid

1663
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,960
to the 11 position which is right at the

1664
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,000
top

1665
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:19,199
of the molecule um that one is it so

1666
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
that carboxy metabolite is inactive

1667
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:24,078
and the determining factor of which one

1668
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,920
of those molecules our body makes has to

1669
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:29,200
do with our our metabolic

1670
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,240
enzymes in our bodies like so our body

1671
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:33,039
is absorbing

1672
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:33,519
uh the thc goes to the liver in the

1673
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:35,759
liver

1674
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:36,960
there are enzymes present and those

1675
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,000
enzymes determine

1676
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:42,079
what happens to that molecule um maybe

1677
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,519
it's a mutation in the enzyme maybe

1678
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,440
it's a variation in the the levels

1679
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:49,119
of these different enzymes that are that

1680
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,119
are present right

1681
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,119
but it's possible that for the people

1682
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,760
who can't feel edibles their body is not

1683
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,880
making 11 hydroxy it's only making this

1684
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,079
inactive version

1685
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,599
so they're taking they're eating the

1686
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,079
edible the thc goes in and then your

1687
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,838
body turns it into something inactive

1688
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,680
that's not to say that that metabolite

1689
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,679
doesn't have any effects i

1690
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:10,078
i haven't seen a lot of research on it

1691
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:11,919
honestly so it could be doing something

1692
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,680
but it's not having the psychoactive

1693
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,440
intoxicating effects

1694
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:19,440
um because it's it's not active right

1695
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,039
and then the the other option has to do

1696
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,119
with phase two metabolism

1697
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:24,719
which is the second phase uh what our

1698
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:27,440
body does is it takes

1699
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:28,399
the molecule and it adds a a sugar acid

1700
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,519
like a glucose

1701
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,358
molecule it's called glucuronidation

1702
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:34,639
and that inactivates the molecule as

1703
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:36,239
well if you think about it it just takes

1704
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:38,078
a sugar molecule you snap the sugar

1705
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:38,479
molecule on it boom the thing is turned

1706
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,720
off

1707
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,798
it's inactive so there's an another

1708
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:46,639
option which is that people might have a

1709
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:48,639
very very fast phase two metabolism

1710
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:49,759
so perhaps someone that's taking an

1711
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,239
edible

1712
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,040
for specifically for thc they can't feel

1713
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:54,798
it because

1714
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:56,239
they take the edible their body does

1715
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:57,759
phase one metabolism but then it

1716
00:56:56,239 --> 00:56:58,959
immediately does phase two and then

1717
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,000
everything is inactive

1718
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:05,358
wow um i would love to

1719
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,480
see research on this um and also

1720
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:08,318
there is the option that there's

1721
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,079
tolerance right like there's there's

1722
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:12,558
some option there that

1723
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,640
you know some people who are really

1724
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,280
heavy cannabis users develop a tolerance

1725
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,279
and then

1726
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,880
you know you don't you don't see these

1727
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,559
marked effects with edibles although i

1728
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,160
have seen people say they've taken

1729
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:22,559
hundreds and hundreds of milligrams and

1730
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:24,078
so

1731
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,680
that just doesn't add up when you take

1732
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,079
into account that these people also

1733
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:28,000
probably

1734
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,280
smoke flour and can feel a hundred

1735
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,880
milligrams of thc

1736
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,640
right yeah totally if they smoked it

1737
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,280
they would they would get hit upside

1738
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:34,639
yeah

1739
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,640
exactly so i mean it just it just

1740
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:38,159
doesn't that doesn't match up to me that

1741
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:40,400
it means to me that there's a problem

1742
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:41,039
with like absorption or metabolism and

1743
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,639
actually

1744
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:44,480
this is something i'm collaborating with

1745
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:48,000
another pharmaceutical scientist on

1746
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:51,599
to like establish like how how

1747
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,119
prevalent it is um in the population and

1748
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,200
her name is riley she's also a

1749
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:58,559
pharmaceutical scientist and riley and i

1750
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:00,318
used tik-tok actually to pull how many

1751
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,839
people could feel that it's a

1752
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:04,480
significant population

1753
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:05,440
of people who can't feel them um and i

1754
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,039
think it's something

1755
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,960
worth worth looking into to figure out

1756
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:10,400
at least at least why

1757
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,159
all right so then let's thread the

1758
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,358
needle so if we've talked about

1759
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:17,598
um smoking on one side being

1760
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:18,960
fast and heavy hitting and then we've

1761
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,079
hit on

1762
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:25,199
edibles which are significantly slower

1763
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:29,280
but can be stronger and more

1764
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:31,919
i don't know time released longer acting

1765
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:34,160
what about sublinguals because you're

1766
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,559
not smoking it it goes in the mouth

1767
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:38,480
but it also doesn't go through the gut

1768
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:41,839
it goes through your

1769
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:45,119
your you know your mucosal membranes

1770
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:46,719
excuse me um so so what what is that

1771
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,838
intake like chemically

1772
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:49,039
okay so when we're talking about

1773
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:51,519
sublinguals like are we talking about

1774
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:53,358
like tinctures that you put under your

1775
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,719
tinctures that you or or a sublingual

1776
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:58,239
spray or

1777
00:58:54,719 --> 00:59:00,000
normally it is a cannabis oil that has

1778
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:02,879
got a little bit of residual

1779
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,679
um ethanol in it so that when it hits

1780
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,400
your

1781
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:08,639
your mucosal membranes or just like the

1782
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,920
the the tissue in your mouth

1783
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:14,719
the um the the residual ethanol takes

1784
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,000
the uh the whole plant medicine over or

1785
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:17,519
through the tissue

1786
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,280
yeah so like i don't know if something

1787
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:21,759
is wrong with my mouth

1788
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,760
but i have never been able to feel

1789
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,040
sublinguals successfully so i'll just

1790
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,680
talk about it in theory

1791
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:29,519
um in theory when you absorb something

1792
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:30,558
either sublingual or subbuckle which is

1793
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:32,798
like a cheek

1794
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:33,760
there are some cheek swabby products

1795
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:36,000
that i've seen

1796
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,359
before on the on the market so both of

1797
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,838
those methods of action

1798
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:40,880
should bypass first pass metabolism they

1799
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:44,000
should be really quick

1800
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:46,318
similar to smoking in the lungs um

1801
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,199
and be i guess have comparable

1802
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:50,159
advantages

1803
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:51,919
uh as smoking um no transformation

1804
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:54,078
obviously because there's no heat

1805
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,079
um but you know just like personally

1806
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:57,760
anecdotally i haven't like had tons of

1807
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:00,079
success with that and then also

1808
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,440
if we are talking about a tincture and

1809
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,039
you put it under your tongue and then

1810
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,400
eventually you do swallow it

1811
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:07,119
that then becomes inedible like whatever

1812
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,599
is left

1813
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,519
that that didn't yeah that that that's

1814
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,960
true you know they're they're the the

1815
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:17,280
the street wisdom on this at any way

1816
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,358
is that there's there's a small amount

1817
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,240
of fluid in a tick in a tincture

1818
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:22,078
normally

1819
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:24,239
and you put it underneath your tongue

1820
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,359
and you know you might hold it you might

1821
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:27,519
not depending on

1822
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:28,400
on what the tincture is made out of it

1823
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:30,559
may burn

1824
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,240
too much to hold it there but whatever

1825
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,920
you you put it in your mouth

1826
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:35,759
you swish it around a little bit and you

1827
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,720
swallow it and

1828
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,280
when i talk to folks anecdotally folks

1829
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,078
believe

1830
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,880
that the thc is absorbed in their mouth

1831
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,760
and then

1832
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,039
if they swallow it you know they're it's

1833
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,520
it's a long road

1834
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:50,639
from the mouth to the gut and it's going

1835
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:52,400
you know through the throat and the

1836
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:54,639
esophagus and all this kind of stuff

1837
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,599
on their way down and that the rest of

1838
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:58,719
it is actually

1839
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:59,599
soaked in on the way down in in before

1840
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:03,039
it gets to

1841
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:05,359
the intestines and therefore it

1842
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,558
never becomes an edible how does that

1843
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:09,199
hit for you

1844
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:10,000
um i don't agree with that right on it's

1845
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:11,439
fine it's fine

1846
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,798
for people to think that though i don't

1847
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,280
i don't have any proof that that doesn't

1848
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:15,440
happen

1849
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,440
but i i think it becomes inedible that's

1850
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,480
my my personal opinion is whatever

1851
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,960
doesn't get absorbed

1852
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,798
in the mouth then when you swallow it

1853
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,318
maybe there is like trace absorption in

1854
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:27,440
like the esophagus or the

1855
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:29,039
uh the stomach but in like in general

1856
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,838
the small intestine is what's built to

1857
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:31,519
absorb

1858
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:33,519
like exogenous like in general the small

1859
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:36,079
intestine is where our body like absorbs

1860
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:37,920
all like when you eat food there is it's

1861
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,519
like very dissimilar there is some

1862
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,480
sublingual absorption then when you eat

1863
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:42,719
it like

1864
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,280
very i would say like i don't know the

1865
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:47,439
statistics on this i'm not a gi person

1866
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,200
but i think most of the absorption

1867
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,720
happens in the small intestine

1868
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:52,960
yeah yet another thing we've hit on

1869
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:54,879
today that needs more study

1870
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,318
yeah i mean i i don't know what's wrong

1871
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,200
with my mouth

1872
01:01:56,318 --> 01:02:00,159
i can't i can't feel i cannot feel

1873
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:02,798
sublinguals

1874
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,639
ever pretty much with i i don't know i

1875
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:06,639
feel them like an edible like way later

1876
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:10,159
you know all right so

1877
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:13,118
let's let's move on to um the ever

1878
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:14,960
popular method of suppositories and you

1879
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,880
know even those suppositories get a

1880
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,559
little bit of a giggle because we're you

1881
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,440
know we're popping something into our

1882
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,359
rectum

1883
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,559
um there are a lot of patients that i

1884
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:26,480
have worked with

1885
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:29,440
that um you know it when they discover

1886
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,159
this they they literally cry with relief

1887
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,920
and joy

1888
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:34,558
because um either they have got severe

1889
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,880
stomach

1890
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,559
problems and they have a hard time

1891
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,760
eating anything

1892
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:44,960
or b um they have

1893
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,760
a um you know they've got an issue in

1894
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,000
the liver

1895
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,319
where they are not making the 11 hydroxy

1896
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,719
so they're not feeling anything and for

1897
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:54,798
whatever reason they can't smoke

1898
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:56,078
or they're cancer patients and they're

1899
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:59,358
trying to

1900
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:02,559
you know take in absurd amounts of

1901
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:05,679
of cannabinoids all at once and

1902
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:08,480
and you know taking it orally

1903
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:09,919
gets them super duper high and so they

1904
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,480
introduce them

1905
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,559
the cannabinoids to their body as a

1906
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,838
suppository

1907
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:21,119
um so there is absolutely a

1908
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:22,719
need for it and and honestly some people

1909
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:24,559
just say that they like the high better

1910
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,558
i mean i've definitely run into

1911
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,920
folks who are using their cannabis

1912
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,000
recreationally

1913
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,440
as a suppository and you know that's

1914
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,119
pretty darn rare

1915
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,639
but you know people are into all sorts

1916
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,640
of stuff um

1917
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:39,199
so so let's talk about it so you know

1918
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:41,838
the as as i understand it

1919
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:43,439
the the suppository will will break down

1920
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:47,279
and then the cannabinoids

1921
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:49,200
are absorbed by the tissue along the

1922
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,079
walls of the rectum but i really don't

1923
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:52,719
understand

1924
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,880
what the chemistry is beyond that point

1925
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:57,598
so i believe that suppository is also

1926
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,119
bypass first pass metabolism which means

1927
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,640
that it's interesting that you mentioned

1928
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:03,119
that the high is different

1929
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:04,879
from suppositories um because that

1930
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,440
indicates that there is

1931
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:09,039
like a difference in the metabolism or

1932
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,318
the absorb like well not the absorption

1933
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,200
but the metabolism

1934
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:13,599
well also the location of absorption um

1935
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:15,598
you know

1936
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,519
so that there's no metabolism which

1937
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,200
means that it's not 11 hydroxy right so

1938
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:19,838
it gets absorbed and then it goes to the

1939
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,239
brain

1940
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:24,159
um i believe it's also faster because it

1941
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:27,279
doesn't have to go all the way through

1942
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:28,879
your stomach to your you know your um

1943
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,240
small intestine and through the liver

1944
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,400
and get metabolized

1945
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:34,639
um you know i think it's like in terms

1946
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,838
of like stigmatization and talking about

1947
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:36,639
things that have to do with like our

1948
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:38,960
private parts

1949
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:41,358
like you know this is a really important

1950
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,639
method that i think is very valuable for

1951
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:44,078
the reasons that you've

1952
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:46,239
mentioned like people who have severe

1953
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,839
nausea it's also really i've heard that

1954
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:49,679
it's been i'm i'm assigned female at

1955
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:52,078
birth and i have a menstrual cycle

1956
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:54,000
and i have heard that suppositories are

1957
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,880
really really useful for people who have

1958
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,519
pmdd

1959
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,039
or who have other sorts of like hormonal

1960
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:02,880
or like painful

1961
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:05,680
um painful issues like endometriosis or

1962
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,798
cysts and i've actually heard

1963
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:08,480
qualitatively from

1964
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:10,559
from quite a few people actually i've

1965
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,679
i'm gonna blank on her name but there's

1966
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,359
a there is a

1967
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:15,598
research scientist who's looking into

1968
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:18,078
this um specifically

1969
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:19,599
and i think that in terms of like method

1970
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,440
and and options i think i would just

1971
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:24,720
describe it as like a very

1972
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:26,559
like a very very useful option a very

1973
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:29,199
very useful therapeutic method

1974
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:30,240
that has definitely deserves its place

1975
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:32,239
amongst like

1976
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:34,318
cannabis products and i actually you

1977
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:36,078
know when i see them and they sell out

1978
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:37,679
here like crazy like i actually

1979
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,839
haven't been able to get my hands on one

1980
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:41,759
ever they sell out like immediately

1981
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:43,119
yeah demand is really high and you know

1982
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,000
a lot of people go through a lot of

1983
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:48,160
effort

1984
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,719
online to make um you know fancy ones

1985
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:50,960
with like

1986
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:52,078
shea butter and coconut oil and they put

1987
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,639
them in

1988
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:55,680
um you know little little formed ice

1989
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:57,118
trays and

1990
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:59,440
and put them in the freezer so they

1991
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,480
harden and you know it's always a little

1992
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,240
giggle when you

1993
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,719
when you know when you when you when you

1994
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:06,078
put it there because of it being cold

1995
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:09,679
but

1996
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:12,000
i know enough patients who

1997
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:14,480
do this you know a couple times a day

1998
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,239
where they just don't even bother

1999
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:20,880
making the the the proper shea

2000
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,838
buttery coconut suppository and they

2001
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,358
just take a

2002
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:25,838
um cellulose capsule put the rso in

2003
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:28,880
there

2004
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:31,920
and then apply it because the

2005
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:34,798
the fluid that is in the rectum is

2006
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,798
plenty to break down a cellulose capsule

2007
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:38,480
and and and there you go so you know you

2008
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:40,318
can be fancy and gentle

2009
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,079
or you can just like get her done and

2010
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:44,079
and you know and as we know

2011
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,119
really sick people they usually just go

2012
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,599
for the get or done

2013
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,559
option yeah absolutely and i mean in

2014
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:51,519
terms of like not

2015
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:52,798
needing to well that's that's it that's

2016
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,559
fascinating i never thought about the

2017
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:55,838
do-it-yourself method for that i always

2018
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:58,480
thought there was some sort of fancy

2019
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:58,480
contraption

2020
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:02,159
like an applicator i don't know well i

2021
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,280
mean i mean i mean there are there i

2022
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:04,558
mean you know the pharmaceutical

2023
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,680
industry they can make everything more

2024
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,440
complex right

2025
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:08,480
right i'm sure i'm sure there will be

2026
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,519
i'm sure there will be i'm sure there's

2027
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,880
something about that

2028
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:14,960
you know one thing that you said that

2029
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:17,358
really stands out for me is that um

2030
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,880
you know you said that since a

2031
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:22,318
suppository would

2032
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:25,358
skip the the level one

2033
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:28,719
uh uh in the in the

2034
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:29,920
liver and so the 11 hydroxy is not being

2035
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:34,519
made

2036
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:37,119
a suppository would be the only

2037
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:42,318
non-smoking option that actually

2038
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:45,358
delivers thc

2039
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:47,838
the brain unchanged in

2040
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:48,798
in theory sublingual too right but oh

2041
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:50,480
yeah that's true too

2042
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:52,480
right yeah in theory and then and then i

2043
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,199
know and then i know yeah in theory for

2044
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,280
me

2045
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:56,239
other people with normal mouths that

2046
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,079
happens

2047
01:07:56,239 --> 01:08:00,239
um i know also that there's been a lot

2048
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:02,960
of research into transdermal

2049
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:04,399
applications but to my knowledge um no

2050
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,679
one has been able to crack the

2051
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,200
transdermal

2052
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:09,358
situation where it actually enters the

2053
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:11,118
bloodstream so like so so far to my

2054
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:12,480
knowledge like transdermal which i love

2055
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,400
topicals also like

2056
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,838
i think they definitely have therapeutic

2057
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,520
validity but they don't enter the

2058
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:20,640
bloodstream right it's like a very high

2059
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,640
local concentration

2060
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,000
hmm all right well that would be that

2061
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:25,919
that well all right let's let's

2062
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,039
let's go for it so so all right so let's

2063
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,640
talk about that

2064
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:31,838
so the uh at one point i agreed with

2065
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,239
that statement

2066
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:35,519
but but i have come across enough people

2067
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:39,278
who are

2068
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:42,480
using a topical that has got a

2069
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:45,520
an ethanol component and they

2070
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:47,678
they use a thc rich topical

2071
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,040
and then if they use enough of it they

2072
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:52,960
actually feel

2073
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:56,399
the uh the intoxication from the thc

2074
01:08:52,960 --> 01:09:00,079
and um i have heard just anecdotally

2075
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:03,679
that people will who don't smoke will

2076
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:07,439
will test positive on a urine analysis

2077
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:09,039
after only using thc rich topical

2078
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:11,119
so are you saying that you have

2079
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:13,920
explanations for that or

2080
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:15,198
okay no i'm really interested also in

2081
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,279
terms of like the ethanol

2082
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:19,119
topical that makes people feel

2083
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,400
psychoactive effects i want to talk to

2084
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:22,798
you more about that but first

2085
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:24,000
about about the drug testing um a lot of

2086
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:25,838
the drug tests are

2087
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,158
not testing for thc they're testing for

2088
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:30,640
the metabolites

2089
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:33,119
and so that's actually possibly it's

2090
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,880
possible with with any of the topicals

2091
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:36,479
because your body will metabolize them

2092
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,880
and the metabolites can stick around for

2093
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:38,879
like

2094
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,400
months right it's the question of

2095
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,119
whether or not it gets in the blood and

2096
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:43,599
up to the brain

2097
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:45,039
in like its active form interesting so

2098
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,440
wait the metabolites

2099
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:48,479
your body will produce metabolites even

2100
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:51,838
if the thc

2101
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:53,838
doesn't reach the blood or like by

2102
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:55,840
i think what my thought process was by

2103
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:58,559
the time the thc reaches the blood and

2104
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,480
like is being cleared out of the topical

2105
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,719
from topicals is that it already has

2106
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:04,639
been metabolized and that's why

2107
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:06,640
you don't get any activity because it

2108
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:08,719
doesn't enter into the brain and

2109
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,320
this is just that's just my like thought

2110
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,880
process behind it i don't actually know

2111
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:14,000
i should

2112
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,520
i'll look it up actually later um but

2113
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,520
interesting that you said that you've

2114
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,120
had people who've felt a psychoactive

2115
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,280
effect from topicals do you know did

2116
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:22,000
they apply it in a very specific place

2117
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:25,119
on their body

2118
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,880
or is there well i can give you two i'm

2119
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:30,158
going to give you two answers for that

2120
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:33,119
so okay the the first answer is um

2121
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:34,079
i normally find people say they have

2122
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:37,039
felt it more

2123
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:37,600
when they have to cover a large area

2124
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:40,319
right

2125
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,039
so this is usually people who have got

2126
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,319
back

2127
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:46,479
and hip or leg issues where

2128
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:47,840
interesting they're covering their back

2129
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:50,079
their shoulders

2130
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,920
their their you know their hip bones

2131
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:55,198
maybe their their tush

2132
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,399
and so so you know it's it's not common

2133
01:10:55,198 --> 01:10:57,919
as a matter of fact i've never come

2134
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:58,319
across it with somebody who's using it

2135
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,679
for

2136
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:04,479
like um like hands yeah hands

2137
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:04,960
elbow arthritis tennis elbow stuff like

2138
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:06,639
that

2139
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,239
because it's a very small area it's

2140
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,800
always been people who are

2141
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:12,319
taking care of a large swath of the

2142
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,320
human body and then

2143
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:15,759
second you know i have been making

2144
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:18,238
tinctures for myself

2145
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,199
for over a decade for my brain injury

2146
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:22,158
and i know

2147
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:23,919
that um i had to start wearing gloves

2148
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:26,079
when i made my tinctures because if i

2149
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:29,279
had a spill and i cleaned it up

2150
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:32,800
the the alcohol with

2151
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:35,519
um the suspended cannabinoids in it

2152
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,800
would i'm assuming soak through my hands

2153
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,880
and i would

2154
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,239
get like hella high and have to go lay

2155
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,719
down and i'm like oh all right guess

2156
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:45,119
who's going to start using latex gloves

2157
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,399
and so and so that's my own personal

2158
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:49,760
experience

2159
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:52,719
so so my belief is certain that

2160
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:55,280
that thc can be carried through the skin

2161
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:57,198
with ethanol and then the topical people

2162
01:11:55,279 --> 01:12:00,079
who i have you know learned from

2163
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:01,198
have said you know you know the emu oil

2164
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:02,880
and all these other things

2165
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:04,399
are all good for the skin but if you

2166
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,239
really want to take cannabinoids to the

2167
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:08,719
skin there has to be an ethanol

2168
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:11,519
component for efficiency and expediency

2169
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:12,158
i'm not a topicals expert so i am not

2170
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,480
standing

2171
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:15,679
here saying that this is all to be true

2172
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:18,319
uh i'm just

2173
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:18,800
saying this to inform the question that

2174
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:20,639
is

2175
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,560
so fascinating and i'm gonna go home

2176
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:25,119
today mix my topicals with ethanol and

2177
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:27,199
cover my back in it like

2178
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:28,238
i am so interested in that i mean with

2179
01:12:27,198 --> 01:12:29,519
the back that's

2180
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:31,759
it's interesting because you know the

2181
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,199
spinal cord is the central

2182
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,719
place where the peripheral and central

2183
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:35,279
nervous system like interact with each

2184
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:37,198
other

2185
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:38,639
so obviously there's a lot going on

2186
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:40,879
there um but i

2187
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,960
i'm fascinated by that also like many

2188
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,000
many scientists would be fascinated by

2189
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,600
that because there's been a lot of

2190
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,439
studies about penetration

2191
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,960
like skin penetration like specifically

2192
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:50,799
and um

2193
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,319
wow that's that's awesome information

2194
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,679
i'm definitely going to you know

2195
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:55,359
i'm going to home trial that home

2196
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:57,199
experiment right now

2197
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:59,359
it's nice that that we happen to be

2198
01:12:57,198 --> 01:13:00,719
working with a plant that we can home

2199
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:02,238
trial stuff right i mean i mean

2200
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:05,039
anybody who listens to the shows knows

2201
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:06,718
i'm a huge fan of citizen science

2202
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:08,319
and i understand that often citizen

2203
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,679
science can kick out bro

2204
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:11,599
science and that's that's something we

2205
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:14,000
always have to watch out for

2206
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,760
but uh you know the even though we have

2207
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,158
a larger and increasingly

2208
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,119
larger scientific community around

2209
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:23,119
cannabis

2210
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:25,359
we have a hell of a bigger community of

2211
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:27,039
cannabis patients who are trying to do

2212
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,238
their own research at home to relieve

2213
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,238
their suffering

2214
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:31,439
and there's so much to be learned from

2215
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:33,519
those folks

2216
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:36,158
oh yeah it's exponential like the power

2217
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,920
is in the people i'm a huge believer of

2218
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:40,479
personal experience because like

2219
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,158
when it comes down to it we are all

2220
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:43,519
different so no one's going to know you

2221
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:46,238
as well as you know yourself

2222
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,760
like no one is going to understand you

2223
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:49,198
and the way that you feel the way that

2224
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,960
you do

2225
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:52,719
yeah you know it's weird though not all

2226
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,000
scientists are into citizen science you

2227
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:57,920
know i have spoken with

2228
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,119
uh cannabinoid researchers who will i'll

2229
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,960
talk to at conventions and they will

2230
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:02,479
talk trash about the patients doing

2231
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,079
their own stuff and i can understand

2232
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:06,319
their frustration because

2233
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:08,719
there's a lot of inaccurate science

2234
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:10,639
that's handed around by patients but

2235
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:12,319
at the same time i don't think that's a

2236
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,320
reason to discount

2237
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:15,519
citizen science it just means that it

2238
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:18,000
needs to be checked

2239
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:20,000
just like i have to check regular you

2240
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,600
know professional scientists to find out

2241
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,359
who's paying for their studies you know

2242
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,679
any kind of research needs to be looked

2243
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:26,000
at

2244
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:27,679
um you know with open eyes i think that

2245
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
that just means that we should put more

2246
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,840
effort

2247
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,600
into public education so that people

2248
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,679
doing the citizen science are

2249
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,079
more educated in scientific theory and

2250
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:37,039
like able to execute it themselves i

2251
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:39,600
think that this

2252
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:42,000
like the idea that we shouldn't be

2253
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:44,960
experimenting on ourselves is just naive

2254
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,198
like every single human in your entire

2255
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,319
life all you're doing is experimenting

2256
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:50,879
all the time like it's it's an n equals

2257
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,319
one

2258
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,840
or you know when you find your person

2259
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:55,279
and n equals two or for people who are

2260
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:58,880
polyamorous and n equals

2261
01:14:55,279 --> 01:15:02,399
x like number of people right but

2262
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,719
no i i think that um i agree that it can

2263
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:06,158
be

2264
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:07,679
there can be negative like myths and um

2265
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:09,198
like what did you do you called it bro

2266
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,679
science right yeah yeah

2267
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:14,238
i agree that there are problems that

2268
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:17,600
that arise from that and that you know

2269
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:19,439
that's unfortunate that people can

2270
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,199
believe that that's true at face value

2271
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:23,359
but i also think that there's been some

2272
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:25,519
pretty important things that come out of

2273
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:26,238
qualitative experience and historically

2274
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,400
that was like

2275
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:29,439
all we had yeah in the past like

2276
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:32,319
previous 4

2277
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:32,879
000 years yeah that's a good point i

2278
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,439
mean

2279
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,480
a lot of the new cannabis knowledge is

2280
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:38,399
is just because

2281
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:39,839
of the machinery that we're using to

2282
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:41,599
look at it with

2283
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:43,520
which comes with with like a bunch of

2284
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,920
assumptions i mean i love my field i'm

2285
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:48,000
obsessed with molecular pharmacology but

2286
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,920
i mean we would we'd need a whole other

2287
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,198
show for me to just explain to you all

2288
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,279
of the assumptions

2289
01:15:51,198 --> 01:15:54,559
that go into what i did which is in

2290
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:56,639
vitro pharmacology

2291
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:59,199
right which is actually like screening a

2292
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,640
drug molecule against a target and i i

2293
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:02,559
did structural biochemistry of

2294
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,960
endocannabinoid system targets

2295
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,159
there is just an exponential number of

2296
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,920
assumptions that

2297
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:09,198
you make in research science that

2298
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,359
doesn't you know they call it the

2299
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:14,158
transition from bench to bedside

2300
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:15,519
right from from the laboratory bench to

2301
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:18,879
the bedside of a person

2302
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:19,760
and i think that like discounting human

2303
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,239
experience

2304
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,320
is and like i'm invalidating it i think

2305
01:16:22,238 --> 01:16:26,079
that that's detrimental to the cannabis

2306
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:28,719
industry as a whole because

2307
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:29,760
we have so much information out here and

2308
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:31,279
so much power

2309
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,199
and people who are trying to increase

2310
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:34,880
the quality of lives and so much

2311
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:36,479
information that gets lost because we're

2312
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,400
just going to devalue it you know

2313
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,238
yeah you know i i'm chuckling to myself

2314
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:40,799
how much fun it would be to do a show

2315
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:43,839
called

2316
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:49,119
uh invalidating cannabinoid science

2317
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:49,119
and we just go into all the trash about

2318
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:53,279
are we going to eat some mangoes and

2319
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,679
then yeah totally

2320
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:57,119
so he could be more high all right um so

2321
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,679
thank you for that viabi let's go ahead

2322
01:16:57,119 --> 01:16:59,279
and take that

2323
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:01,199
uh second break and get that out of the

2324

way you are listening to shaping fire

there is no doubt that autoflowering

2414
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:58,399
over the years shaping fire has been

2415
01:19:56,238 --> 01:20:00,079
invited to sponsor several cannabis cups

2416
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:02,079
and i've said no to them all

2417
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:03,439
it wasn't until the autoflower cup that

2418
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:04,079
i really wanted to help promote

2419
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:05,839
something

2420
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:08,399
and the producers sebastian and carla

2421
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,400
didn't even invite me i approached them

2422
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:12,399
i told them that autoflower cup was

2423
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:14,079
important to me for three reasons

2424
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:15,759
first it was obvious that they were

2425
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:17,439
going for a friends and family vibe

2426
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,719
instead of some sort of commodified

2427
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:20,559
cannabis vibe

2428
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:22,158
this event was going to gather really

2429
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,320
cool folks

2430
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:26,638
second the event had a ton of cool stuff

2431
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:29,039
to do and to learn and to participate in

2432
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:30,400
the event isn't just about cannabis it's

2433
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:32,800
about living life fully

2434
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:34,479
enjoying community eating together

2435
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:37,279
laughing and listening to music

2436
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:38,319
and mushrooms third and most important

2437
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:40,319
to me personally

2438
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:41,599
the event was authentically for the

2439
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:43,279
autoflower community

2440
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,639
and the autoflower community needs a

2441
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:46,559
place too

2442
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:48,480
autoflower is about getting high sure

2443
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,400
but i find that much of the autoflower

2444
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:51,279
community is still focused on cannabis

2445
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:54,238
patients

2446
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:54,880

2449
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:00,960
share with the event

2450
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:03,039
and i wanted to make sure i did my part

2451

2499
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,719
you get high because it helps and this

2500
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:43,439
is

2501
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:46,000
this is untrue and let's get it directly

2502
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:48,000
from a scientist please break it down

2503
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,198
i believe that if you believe it will

2504
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,238
make you higher that

2505
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:53,839
it will that's what i normally say

2506
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:55,599
well you know it's it's placebo right

2507
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,679
essentially it feeds into set and

2508
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,079
setting right if you believe it to be

2509
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:00,960
true

2510
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:02,559
your your your brain tends to you know

2511
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,158
tell you that you're right

2512
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,520
so let me if i break it down to like

2513
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:06,079
what people normally talk about it's

2514
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,520
mercy

2515
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:09,840
right people are normally talking about

2516
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,239
the terpene that is present in mangoes

2517
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:14,079
that will then make you feel higher

2518
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:16,158
um from what i've seen about like the

2519
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:18,800
bioavailability of mercine and the

2520
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:20,719
amount of mercine that is present

2521
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,239
in mangoes which means that when you eat

2522
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:23,198
it like how much of it actually enters

2523
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:26,319
your system

2524
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:28,158
um our body metabolizes terpenes really

2525
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:29,198
really quickly specifically if you're

2526
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:32,479
going edible

2527
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:34,879
route of administration right um so

2528
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:36,718
i it's hard for me it's difficult for me

2529
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,279
as a scientist to believe that eating a

2530
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:39,359
mango

2531
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:41,039
which has relatively low amounts of

2532
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:43,039
mercine that are bioavailable that then

2533
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:44,560
get metabolized almost immediately

2534
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:46,399
would like make it to the brain to have

2535
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,960
like a significant effect

2536
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:50,638
um but i i'm much more convinced of the

2537
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,319
fact that if you were to believe that

2538
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:54,079
that were true and you had that in your

2539
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:54,559
head that that would absolutely happen

2540
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:55,920
for you

2541
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,159
and like i don't think there's anything

2542
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:00,480
wrong with the placebo effect like while

2543
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:02,000
we're just on the topic of placebo like

2544
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:03,439
ultimately at the end of the day what

2545
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,719
are we trying to do we're trying to

2546
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:06,479
we're trying to

2547
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:08,158
have an effect you're looking you're

2548
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:10,638
looking for an experience

2549
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:13,198
so people ask me sometimes like about

2550
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:15,359
like i take cbd every day

2551
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:16,719
and i it helps me a lot and people have

2552
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:18,158
asked me about it being like how are you

2553
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,920
sure it's not a placebo

2554
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:21,279
and i'm like you know what i actually

2555
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,119
could not answer that

2556
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:24,479
for you with a hundred percent certainty

2557
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:26,479
because no one can

2558
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:28,399
and i don't think it matters whether or

2559
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:28,959
not it's a placebo because it works for

2560
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:30,479
me

2561
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,960
and so i think that like coming to like

2562
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:35,279
mango and the science and

2563
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:37,359
um yeah from what i've from what i've

2564
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:39,439
seen i don't believe like scientifically

2565
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:42,559
that anything biologically is going on

2566
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:43,359
other than altering your expectation of

2567
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,760
what it will feel like

2568
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:47,759
right on that's in line what uh dr ethan

2569
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,320
russo shared with us during the shaping

2570
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,800
fire

2571
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:52,319
uh sessions video too when we were

2572
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,639
talking about eating food to support

2573
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:54,880
your

2574
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:56,840
your endo cannabinoid system he also

2575
01:24:54,880 --> 01:25:00,000
agrees with you that it is

2576
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:01,440
um um it's just expectation

2577
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,600
and there's nothing going on at a

2578
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:05,519
physiological level but you know that

2579
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,960
doesn't mean that uh any of this

2580
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,840
mango uh mythology is going to slow down

2581
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,119
one iota

2582
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,960
so so let's go ahead and move on so

2583
01:25:13,119 --> 01:25:17,679
so in here in set three i want to talk

2584
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:20,639
about uh dosing thresholds for efficacy

2585
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:21,440
because um in serious and chronic

2586
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,520
patients

2587
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:24,719
um this is something they're constantly

2588
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,679
struggling with

2589
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:28,480
um so many patients fall into like the

2590
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:31,440
overall

2591
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:33,839
bucket of immune disorders uh rheumatoid

2592
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:36,158
arthritis multiple sclerosis lupus

2593
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:38,000
hashimoto epstein-barr i mean there are

2594
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:40,319
so many of these people when you put

2595
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,158
them all together

2596
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:43,439
and they're so many of them are using

2597
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:47,439
cannabis now

2598
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:50,879
some cannabis seems to help a lot

2599
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:54,638
more cannabis helps some people

2600
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:56,639
but heroic doses are hard to determine

2601
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:59,199
and may not give increasingly better

2602
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:04,000
results and so even though somebody is

2603
01:25:59,198 --> 01:26:07,039
really sick more cannabis may or may not

2604
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,520
be the solution though

2605
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:10,238
maybe it is because of their their um

2606
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:13,440
tolerance

2607
01:26:10,238 --> 01:26:15,678
so so my question for you is what is the

2608
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:20,158
efficacy threshold point

2609
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:22,960
um uh between these serious imbalances

2610
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:23,599
and knowing what is the maximum they

2611
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,439
should take

2612
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,280
that makes sense because we don't want

2613
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:28,638
patients wasting money on too many

2614
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:31,359
cannabinoids

2615
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:32,079
but the difference between 50 milligrams

2616
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:35,359
of whole plant

2617
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:36,319
plant cbd and 200 milligrams of whole

2618
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:38,238
plant cbd

2619
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:39,439
really can make a difference in certain

2620
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:41,359
patients

2621
01:26:39,439 --> 01:26:43,359
oh absolutely so okay i also have to

2622
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:43,920
just say like just a little disclaimer

2623
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:45,839
here

2624
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:47,920
i am not a medical professional or

2625
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:50,239
doctorate i'm like a research scientist

2626
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:52,000
my right like all of my expertise is

2627
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:53,119
just on like molecular pharmacology of

2628
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,079
cannabinoids

2629
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:57,359
in the body but i will speak to what i

2630
01:26:56,079 --> 01:27:00,639
personally believe

2631
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:04,079
um about efficacy and dosing right

2632
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:06,079
which is that i think in general what

2633
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:08,880
you're looking for for every person

2634
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:09,279
is what's called the therapeutic minimum

2635
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,920
that

2636
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:12,880
is the amount of cannabinoids that you

2637
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,440
need to take in

2638
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,920
so that you have a therapeutic effect

2639
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:17,919
but

2640
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,840
not any more than that because when you

2641
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:21,520
start taking in more than what would be

2642
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,199
the therapeutic minimum you can start

2643
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,080
getting negative effects like tolerance

2644
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:26,638
or withdrawal

2645
01:27:24,079 --> 01:27:28,399
right or like off-target effects and in

2646
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:29,679
terms of like what is that therapeutic

2647
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:30,719
minimum i mean this is where

2648
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:33,039
unfortunately

2649
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:34,719
it's again with what we were talking

2650
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:37,439
about earlier between you and i

2651
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:37,760
it's it's dependent a lot by the person

2652
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:39,359
and

2653
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,760
what therapeutic indication they're

2654
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:44,719
looking for um

2655
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,920
and you know what it's it's so

2656
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:48,960
complicated because there

2657
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:51,359
is no one-stop fill-out like

2658
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:53,359
form for saying you are this tall you

2659
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:55,119
weigh this much and so this much

2660
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:57,519
is the amount that i mean you know that

2661
01:27:55,119 --> 01:27:59,279
very well um and this is something that

2662
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:02,320
we've actually been struggling with

2663
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:04,158
in terms of like adding like uh medical

2664
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:05,840
validity to cannabis it's something

2665
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:06,399
that's a that's a big barrier i think in

2666
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,480
my mind

2667
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:09,839
is that um some people can't wrap their

2668
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:12,238
brains around the fact that we

2669
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,600
we can't actually tell you what dose is

2670
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:15,919
beneficial like

2671
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,360
largely that responsibility is going on

2672
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,600
to the consumer or the patient

2673
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:21,599
right like more and more like what you

2674
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,840
were talking about with citizen science

2675
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,360
we're realizing that it's up to us to do

2676
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,560
this experimentation to figure out what

2677
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:28,399
it is and

2678
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:30,159
a lot of people in the general public

2679
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:33,839
feel like not

2680
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:35,599
capable of making that decision right um

2681
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:37,039
so i'm just going to explain something

2682
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:39,280
that um and

2683
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:41,359
this is it only works for people who can

2684
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:43,679
monitor their symptoms with a number

2685
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:44,799
um but it's basically call it's called a

2686
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,840
titration

2687
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,600
and a titration means adding something

2688
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,119
slowly until you reach like an

2689
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:54,400
equilibrium

2690
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,359
that's like the i guess the layman's way

2691
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:57,920
of explaining it

2692
01:28:55,359 --> 01:28:59,279
and whenever you go to a doctor and i'm

2693
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,560
think i'm talking mostly right now

2694
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:02,158
mental health is probably the

2695
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,320
the easiest example you go to a

2696
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:06,000
psychiatrist um they usually start you

2697
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:07,439
on the lowest dose of something

2698
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,198
and then you go back and you see them

2699
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:10,479
like once a week for like a few weeks

2700
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:12,079
and then they decide like okay we have

2701
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:13,359
to increase it right

2702
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:14,880
and then you increase it and then you

2703
01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:16,238
see them once a week for a couple weeks

2704
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,760
and then like maybe you increase it

2705
01:29:16,238 --> 01:29:20,319
maybe you stay the same

2706
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:21,440
what they are doing is a titration which

2707
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:23,198
means that they're starting at the

2708
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:27,439
lowest possible dose and then

2709
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:31,439
monitoring the effects of that molecule

2710
01:29:27,439 --> 01:29:33,678
on you specifically as a patient um

2711
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:35,279
so in lieu of being able to do that with

2712
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:36,560
cannabinoids with with the

2713
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:37,920
depending on your your medical

2714
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,199
professional which also if you have a

2715
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,000
medical professional that you can be

2716
01:29:39,198 --> 01:29:42,079
honest with

2717
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,600
that would be the best case scenario and

2718
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:44,880
you take down the information and you

2719
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46,079
give them that information

2720
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,000
and then they give you you know they

2721
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:49,519
give you what they think about it but in

2722
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,079
in lieu of that you could also do that

2723
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:53,360
yourself

2724
01:29:50,079 --> 01:29:54,960
so you keep a journal or an excel sheet

2725
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:56,960
or you know any sort of

2726
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,560
um you know has to be written down

2727
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,279
though and you and you write everything

2728
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:02,159
down

2729
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:03,039
you write down what you're using and why

2730
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:04,799
and you give

2731
01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:06,639
your symptoms that you're trying to

2732
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:09,520
reduce a number

2733
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:11,119
you you quantify them and i know it's

2734
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:13,440
going to be subjective and i know

2735
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:14,880
that it's going to be biased right

2736
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:16,559
because you're the one writing it

2737
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,159
but it's more information than you would

2738
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,760
have otherwise and it's it's a

2739
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:21,920
it's a good way to look at something

2740
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:25,840
with numbers sometimes and see

2741
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:27,760
um and so then you write everything down

2742
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:29,600
and you see that's also the easiest way

2743
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,119
to decide or determine whether or not

2744
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:34,719
you're developing a tolerance

2745
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:36,158
right and eventually like for people who

2746
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,880
are just getting to know themselves for

2747
01:30:36,158 --> 01:30:38,879
for people like

2748
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,719
like you and i who've been you know

2749
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,319
using cannabis for years and years

2750
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:44,560
um you know you end up just kind of with

2751
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:47,519
an inherent knowledge

2752
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:49,039
of yourself i think um but for people

2753
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:52,159
who are just getting started

2754
01:30:49,039 --> 01:30:52,719
you know i say start small like it's

2755
01:30:52,158 --> 01:30:54,479
always

2756
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:56,239
great to start small and then to

2757
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:57,759
increase and like give depending on what

2758
01:30:56,238 --> 01:31:00,479
what you're looking at

2759
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:02,079
at improving um you know you could give

2760
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:05,519
it a little bit of time because certain

2761
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:06,719
effects take time to um to see

2762
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,960
you know there's there's different

2763
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:11,039
effects level there's acute effects of a

2764
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:13,039
molecule which is like immediate so

2765
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:14,880
the acute effects of thc would be the

2766
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:16,479
high right

2767
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,880
but then there's like more long-term

2768
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:20,399
effects like the down regulation of cb1

2769
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,679
receptors that might take more time it

2770
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:23,359
might take like a week or two weeks

2771
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:24,560
might take three weeks uh depends on the

2772
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:26,479
person

2773
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:28,480
and if you're writing everything down

2774
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:30,158
and if you're being very intentional

2775
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:31,678
about your use and i realize this sounds

2776
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:33,198
like kind of a lot of work

2777
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:35,039
but once you get in the habit of doing

2778
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:38,000
it it really just kind of becomes

2779
01:31:35,039 --> 01:31:39,359
um habit there also are apps out there

2780
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,520
that will help you

2781
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:44,079
like tracking apps and habit apps and

2782
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:47,360
things on on the phone that i think are

2783
01:31:44,079 --> 01:31:50,079
that can be really really useful um in

2784
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:51,920
in helping you to to find out like what

2785
01:31:50,079 --> 01:31:52,719
is the dose that's working and how is it

2786
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:55,600
working for you

2787
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:57,198
and i think that unfortunately this this

2788
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,960
type of like self-evaluation

2789
01:31:57,198 --> 01:32:00,559
is really useful for people who have

2790
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,679
symptoms that are that are outward

2791
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:05,199
facing right

2792
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:06,719
like that you can see um

2793
01:32:05,198 --> 01:32:08,319
it becomes much more complicated when

2794
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:10,880
you talk about something like cancer and

2795
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:13,519
you can't see your tumors or your mets

2796
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:14,400
right yeah well at least in some of

2797
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,280
those cases

2798
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:18,879
um we can look at analytics but we'll

2799
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:20,158
talk more about cancer in a minute on

2800
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:23,279
the on the

2801
01:32:20,158 --> 01:32:25,198
you know what you are saying is is

2802
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:26,880
accurate right essentially you're so

2803
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:27,599
you're calling for patients to try trade

2804
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,960
up

2805
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:33,039
and then journal their results to get to

2806
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,760
know their cannabinoid tone and their

2807
01:32:33,039 --> 01:32:36,800
body

2808
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:40,079
uh and how that matches with

2809
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:41,920
their relief goals and and you know

2810
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:43,920
shaping fire is big fans of of

2811
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:46,319
journaling and titration

2812
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:48,319
um and and not to discount this but at

2813
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:50,158
the end that just means that the answer

2814
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:51,920
is trial and error which is what these

2815
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:53,759
patients are already doing

2816
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,920
you know it is and it's the it's the

2817
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,880
appliance it sucks that we don't have a

2818
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,440
better

2819
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:00,480
answer for these folks because doing

2820
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:03,359
that you know that

2821
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:04,399
trial and error that that titration and

2822
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:06,799
journaling

2823
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:08,719
you're probably gonna hit like over

2824
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:11,760
medication a couple times and have

2825
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:13,279
some crappy paranoid experiences you're

2826
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,760
probably gonna have to be

2827
01:33:13,279 --> 01:33:16,719
patient when you're feeling impatient

2828
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,679
because

2829
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:20,319
you're you're experiencing symptoms from

2830
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:22,239
whatever's

2831
01:33:20,319 --> 01:33:23,679
you know going on for you and you have

2832
01:33:22,238 --> 01:33:24,479
to deal with those symptoms while you're

2833
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:27,600
trying to

2834
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:29,919
figure out if you need 20 50 or 200

2835
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:32,719
milligrams of cbd a day

2836
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:34,960
like like that can take so much time

2837
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:36,719
especially if a patient has got

2838
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:38,319
you know somebody who's got you know

2839
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:41,359
hashimoto epstein bar

2840
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:44,639
and ra plus migraines

2841
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:47,839
it's like it's it's a total mess of

2842
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:49,600
of of of symptoms that you're trying to

2843
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:53,119
work your way through

2844
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:55,199
and um and you're right all we can do is

2845
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:56,960
you know suggest titration and and

2846
01:33:55,198 --> 01:33:58,238
taking a journal and talking with other

2847
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:01,359
patients but

2848
01:33:58,238 --> 01:34:03,198
golly that's a disappointing

2849
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:05,119
that's the best i can offer folks and

2850
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:07,519
that's something it's honestly

2851
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:09,119
one of the things that i would be i that

2852
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,960
is most interesting to me is like

2853
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:12,719
formulations and understanding how

2854
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:13,920
specific formulations come into play

2855
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:15,760
with this because

2856
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:18,158
i think it's a huge i think it's a huge

2857
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:20,000
problem and i also think that um in

2858
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:20,479
terms of titration the other option is

2859
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,880
to go

2860
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:24,638
is to go outside in as i would say those

2861
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:27,520
the other option that's not try

2862
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:29,199
so titration is slowly increasing until

2863
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:31,600
you reach equilibrium right

2864
01:34:29,198 --> 01:34:32,879
um the opposite of that would be outside

2865
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,039
in which is

2866
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:36,800
taking the smallest dose and seeing what

2867
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:37,840
you feel and taking the largest dose

2868
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,880
you're comfortable with

2869
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:44,480
and seeing how you feel and then go

2870
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:46,560
working your way in from that if that

2871
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:49,198
makes sense yeah wow taking that biggest

2872
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:50,960
dose uh that sounds sketch

2873
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:53,118
yeah i mean that's not that's why i

2874
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:54,480
don't i don't recommend it usually i am

2875
01:34:53,118 --> 01:34:55,679
just putting it out there as the

2876
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:59,439
alternative option

2877
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:01,440
of the in in general i believe in some

2878
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:02,319
ways in some forms of engineering that's

2879
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:05,039
a fast way

2880
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:06,079
of finding the optimum yeah maybe maybe

2881
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:09,679
i would recommend that

2882
01:35:06,079 --> 01:35:11,840
for all the cannabinoids except for thc

2883
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:12,800
yeah i think that it's like it's a good

2884
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:16,880
one for cbd

2885
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:18,800
or cbg all right so

2886
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,920
all right so then let's talk about uh

2887
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:22,239
for cancer and

2888
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:23,039
unfortunately it may be a similar answer

2889
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:26,158
so

2890
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:26,880
um you know taking tinctures for

2891
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:30,638
symptoms

2892
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:32,639
right so let's say um you know primarily

2893
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:35,199
probably thc but certainly there are

2894
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:37,199
applications for cbg and cbd

2895
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:40,079
but let's just say generally 10 to 20

2896
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:43,519
milligrams a day for thc

2897
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:46,238
spread out over the day is a very common

2898
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,119
dosage for folks who are in cancer

2899
01:35:46,238 --> 01:35:48,479
treatment

2900
01:35:47,118 --> 01:35:50,079
just to help with the side effects you

2901
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:51,118
know so they they can get back their

2902
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:54,319
appetite

2903
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:57,279
they feel uh some muscle relaxation

2904
01:35:54,319 --> 01:35:59,198
they just feel better in this body that

2905
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:00,319
they are inhabiting right so you know 10

2906
01:35:59,198 --> 01:36:03,919
to 20 a day

2907
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:04,880
that's pretty typical versus the large

2908
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:07,760
doses

2909
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:10,239
of full extract cannabis oil also known

2910
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,639
as rso for cancer patients who are going

2911
01:36:10,238 --> 01:36:12,959
for

2912
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:13,920
a cure right for people who are going to

2913
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,639
a cure

2914
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:18,079
that 10 to 20 milligrams a day you know

2915
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:19,199
depending on where they are in the cycle

2916
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:23,198
will be 300

2917
01:36:19,198 --> 01:36:26,319
to 750 milligrams a day which is like

2918
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:30,000
like a whole hell of a lot of thc

2919
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:33,039
and and the thing is is that you know

2920
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:36,479
the the go-to protocol

2921
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:40,319
has been 60 milliliters

2922
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:43,678
of of cannabis oil over 90 days

2923
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:47,359
and and that usually takes a big thwack

2924
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:49,359
at the cancer and um either the person

2925
01:36:47,359 --> 01:36:52,880
will decide to do another round

2926
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:54,399
or it's solved or the patient

2927
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:56,079
doesn't want to do it anymore either

2928
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:57,839
because their

2929
01:36:56,079 --> 01:37:00,000
psa numbers haven't gone down for

2930
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:02,880
example or

2931
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,118
or they just can't handle that much thc

2932
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:06,960
in their life it's a lifestyle choice

2933
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:08,799
so so all of that is to set up this

2934
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:13,359
question which is

2935
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:16,400
you know how do we is is it even known

2936
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:18,960
what the efficacy is against big

2937
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:22,799
monsters like cancer

2938
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:25,118
for thc or is this simply

2939
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,159
you know how it's been done in the in

2940
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:28,559
the past of

2941
01:37:26,158 --> 01:37:29,279
let's throw thc at it and see if it

2942
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,199
sticks

2943
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:33,279
and it just hasn't been updated with

2944
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:36,079
appropriate science yet

2945
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:37,920
so so the cannabinoids show anti-tumor

2946
01:37:36,079 --> 01:37:40,079
anti-tumor genic properties like

2947
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:41,279
it's it's been established but the the

2948
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:43,439
way that we test this

2949
01:37:41,279 --> 01:37:45,279
in the lab has a lot to do with usually

2950
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:48,399
uh usually it's either a cell culture

2951
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:49,920
or or animal model right um and then we

2952
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:51,039
have all the human information out there

2953
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,000
right like what you're describing all

2954
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:53,600
the people

2955
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,118
with the protocol with the protocol and

2956
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:58,400
using really really high doses

2957
01:37:55,118 --> 01:37:59,679
of of cannabinoids um so like is there

2958
01:37:58,399 --> 01:38:02,559
science behind it yes

2959
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:03,039
do i know or can we can we say like what

2960
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,080
does

2961
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:07,118
uh what threshold is the are the

2962
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:09,279
anti-tumor

2963
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:10,399
properties going to have effect no which

2964
01:38:09,279 --> 01:38:12,960
is also why

2965
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:14,879
i think people lean towards more because

2966
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,560
in general yes like if you're gonna err

2967
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,440
on the side if you want anti-tumor

2968
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,280
properties

2969
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:20,799
and you're trying to err on the side of

2970
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:24,479
getting those then

2971
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:27,199
in in theory more or a higher dose would

2972
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:29,279
be better than than less i had a patient

2973
01:38:27,198 --> 01:38:31,198
tell me that she was gonna go big or go

2974
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:32,719
home right she's all like if i'm not

2975
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:34,960
gonna do chemo i'm gonna take

2976
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:37,279
all the thc that i can pack into my body

2977
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:39,039
because that's where all my chips are

2978
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:40,399
you know this is this is unrelated i

2979
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:42,238
mean it's not unrelated from the

2980
01:38:40,399 --> 01:38:44,079
endocannabinoid system but it's

2981
01:38:42,238 --> 01:38:47,599
unrelated to cannabis um

2982
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:49,279
but i think um one thing of interest of

2983
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:52,639
whenever cancer comes up that i

2984
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:55,679
i mentioned is fasting and the effect of

2985
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:58,719
ketosis and which ketosis

2986
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:59,760
is when your body runs out of sugar and

2987
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:02,560
begins

2988
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:04,159
burning ketones for energy instead it's

2989
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,840
fat you're burning fat

2990
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:07,599
the endocannabinoid system is a fat

2991
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:09,440
signaling system it's involved in this

2992
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:11,039
there's a big shift that occurs

2993
01:39:09,439 --> 01:39:12,799
so it is related to endocannabinoid

2994
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:13,279
system not necessarily related cannabis

2995
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:15,119
but

2996
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:17,439
there's a lot of evidence out there that

2997
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:20,639
fasting is very beneficial

2998
01:39:17,439 --> 01:39:22,000
um in terms of it's like anti-tumor

2999
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:24,000
properties like anti-metastatic

3000
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,399
properties um and it also just it's

3001
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,760
beneficial in general this is like

3002
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:29,279
this isn't the topic that we're on

3003
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,320
whatsoever it's just something that i

3004
01:39:29,279 --> 01:39:32,479
thought was worth

3005
01:39:30,319 --> 01:39:34,479
mentioning um actually it's kind of on

3006
01:39:32,479 --> 01:39:37,039
topic here let me tie it in for you

3007
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:38,000
because so many of the patients who are

3008
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:41,279
on

3009
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:45,039
um high thc dosage

3010
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:47,198
um full extract cannabis oil for cancer

3011
01:39:45,039 --> 01:39:49,359
you know it's a very common that they

3012
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:51,919
get sleepy right they just nap

3013
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:54,000
all day long and their caregiver needs

3014
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:56,800
to arouse them to get them to eat

3015
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,719
and to go to the bathroom and and one of

3016
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:00,320
the challenges with patients is to make

3017
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:02,480
sure they keep their weight

3018
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:03,679
up um because they're spending so much

3019
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:05,919
time sleeping

3020
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:08,000
and they they get over the munchies part

3021
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:11,679
of cannabis really quickly

3022
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:15,118
and and so generally patients

3023
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:18,480
lose weight um in the

3024
01:40:15,118 --> 01:40:20,799
last you know say four to five weeks

3025
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:23,118
of of using a full extra cannabis oil

3026
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:26,159
for cancer and wouldn't that be

3027
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:29,599
interesting if it is the decreased

3028
01:40:26,158 --> 01:40:31,519
calorie intake which in causes the boost

3029
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,800
to the immune system which is playing a

3030
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:34,800
big role in that

3031
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:36,239
i would think that it's synergistic for

3032
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,600
sure although i i also

3033
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:39,198
like we have to mention that like

3034
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,520
obviously getting proper nutrition and

3035
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:41,279
like

3036
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:43,040
not losing a significant right the goal

3037
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:43,840
is to not lose weight but it tends to

3038
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:45,760
happen so

3039
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:48,239
important you know absolutely but it's

3040
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:50,719
there's i mean in terms of like

3041
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:52,879
so cancer is the overactive and i'm not

3042
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:53,600
a cancer expert like whatsoever also i

3043
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,239
just but but

3044
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:57,360
just in general right like cancer is

3045
01:40:56,238 --> 01:40:59,359
what happens when

3046
01:40:57,359 --> 01:41:01,439
there's a mutation in your cells and

3047
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:04,639
then they're over they overactively

3048
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:06,479
um reproduce and grow and they they

3049
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:08,480
are evading the immune system like

3050
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:10,079
normally normally um

3051
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:12,718
if our immune system was to be

3052
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:14,719
functioning uh authentically or

3053
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:16,319
correctly then the immune system would

3054
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:18,719
identify those i mean

3055
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:20,799
we have mutations in our cells all the

3056
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:22,560
time we have we have errors every single

3057
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:25,039
one of us like probably right now

3058
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:26,320
has at least one cell in our body i

3059
01:41:25,039 --> 01:41:26,639
could probably guarantee it there's at

3060
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:28,158
least

3061
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:30,079
one cell in our body that's doing

3062
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:32,399
something wrong all right like

3063
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:33,920
with the our our bodies aren't perfect

3064
01:41:32,399 --> 01:41:35,679
um but we have a system

3065
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,199
in place that like identifies those

3066
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:40,079
errors and fixes it

3067
01:41:37,198 --> 01:41:40,960
and cancer occurs where somehow the

3068
01:41:40,079 --> 01:41:44,800
cancer cells

3069
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:46,319
are evading that system right um

3070
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,840
and yeah i think that and and the

3071
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:50,479
endocannabinoid system

3072
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,960
is integrally linked to immune function

3073
01:41:50,479 --> 01:41:54,319
and to

3074
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:55,600
energy uh you know energy homeostasis or

3075
01:41:54,319 --> 01:41:57,519
energy balance

3076
01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:00,400
uh and cancer cells take up a lot of

3077
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:01,760
energy they're replicating very rapidly

3078
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:03,039
and so there's there's all the

3079
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:04,639
anti-tumor properties of the

3080
01:42:03,039 --> 01:42:06,158
cannabinoids as well but then there's

3081
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:08,000
all the endocannabinoid system

3082
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:09,920
interaction with the immune system

3083
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,118
you know it's it's really complicated

3084
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,118
and um i

3085
01:42:11,118 --> 01:42:15,359
i could not imagine what i would feel

3086
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:16,799
like if i was if i was diagnosed with

3087
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:19,839
cancer so i can't

3088
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:21,840
i can't speak for sure what i would

3089
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:22,560
definitely do in that scenario because i

3090
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,840
know that when

3091
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:26,400
that happens and when you get that

3092
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:28,239
diagnosis your life changes forever and

3093
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:29,839
um you know i could be saying something

3094
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:31,519
now that i believe i would do and i

3095
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:34,800
maybe wouldn't do it right right

3096
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:36,480
um but it is my belief currently that if

3097
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,960
i were to be diagnosed with cancer that

3098
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:40,638
i would

3099
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:42,079
use cannabis and fast um and then i

3100
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:43,440
would also be open to chemotherapy

3101
01:42:42,079 --> 01:42:46,800
i mean i would be open to it but i think

3102
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:49,759
it would not be the first um

3103
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:50,639
stop right on i wanna go back and i'm

3104
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:53,520
gonna bite

3105
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:55,840
like i heard you used a subtle change in

3106
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:57,040
your intonation when you use the word

3107
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:58,960
normally

3108
01:42:57,039 --> 01:43:00,800
and then in your next sentence all the

3109
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:02,800
places that you would have used normally

3110
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:06,000
you swapped out that word

3111
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:08,560
and i want to bite why did you

3112
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:11,279
not choose to use the word normally to

3113
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:14,000
describe a function of the body

3114
01:43:11,279 --> 01:43:15,599
i don't think yeah that's funny shango

3115
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,800
that you picked up on that

3116
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:19,199
um i don't think that i don't like the

3117
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:22,480
word

3118
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:25,678
normal just i i dislike that word

3119
01:43:22,479 --> 01:43:28,000
almost in every context or

3120
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:29,760
way that you could in any way that you

3121
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:33,279
could use that word to describe

3122
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:34,639
human functionality it doesn't fit um

3123
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:36,960
so i think that's just kind of where

3124
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:38,960
that came from is that i i even do i

3125
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,960
slip up all the time i used the word

3126
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:42,560
normally and then i think about it and

3127
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,840
i'm like you know that's not the most

3128
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:46,960
correct way

3129
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:50,319
to say that um and that normal

3130
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:52,639
and using the word normal implies

3131
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:54,479
uh it implies that we have an

3132
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:56,239
understanding of human

3133
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:57,519
diversity and functionality that we just

3134
01:43:56,238 --> 01:44:00,638
don't have

3135
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:02,639
so it's my personal opinion that i don't

3136
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:04,079
i don't like using the word normal to

3137
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:05,279
describe anything having to do with

3138
01:44:04,079 --> 01:44:08,719
humans

3139
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:09,920
right on i'm with you and uh and and it

3140
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:12,800
assumes that there

3141
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:13,520
is an established standard that doesn't

3142
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,760
exist

3143
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:17,199
it just doesn't exist yeah you just yeah

3144
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:19,600
you hit you hit that on the head with

3145
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:21,279
that one i i slipped up i do it all the

3146
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:23,119
time i don't believe there's a normal

3147
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:24,719
right on well cool thank you because i i

3148
01:44:23,118 --> 01:44:27,359
heard you know how you can

3149
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:28,719
hear someone's mind thinking as they

3150
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:30,559
build their sentence

3151
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:31,920
and i heard i heard you play with that

3152
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,840
i'm like oh there's something going on

3153
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:36,079
there i want to know

3154
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:38,719
so so let's finish up this episode

3155
01:44:36,079 --> 01:44:40,800
with a follow-up question from part one

3156
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:43,198
that we did a few weeks back

3157
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:44,320
um you know we talked a lot about

3158
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:48,399
tolerance breaks

3159
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:51,759
uh during um part one of of this endic

3160
01:44:48,399 --> 01:44:54,879
endo cannabinoid mechanics series and

3161
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:58,400
um and the number one com

3162
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:59,840
question i got from folks was about

3163
01:44:58,399 --> 01:45:02,079
taking a tolerance break from

3164
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,360
cannabinoids that are not thc

3165
01:45:02,079 --> 01:45:05,279
because you said something really

3166
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:07,359
interesting you talked about how often

3167
01:45:05,279 --> 01:45:09,359
you do thc tolerance breaks

3168
01:45:07,359 --> 01:45:11,359
and how they're good for you but you

3169
01:45:09,359 --> 01:45:12,000
also said that you don't take tolerance

3170
01:45:11,359 --> 01:45:14,639
breaks from

3171
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,880
cbd and that's what everybody was asking

3172
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:19,039
me about they're like ask her why she

3173
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:22,079
doesn't take them for cbd

3174
01:45:19,039 --> 01:45:25,198
doesn't she need to um you know

3175
01:45:22,079 --> 01:45:28,639
doesn't miabi need to take a break from

3176
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:29,198
uh you know cbd because they may be

3177
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:32,639
getting

3178
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:34,559
a a tolerance from cbd as well

3179
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:36,000
and then i got the same questions well

3180
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:38,800
how about thca

3181
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,359
and how about cbg then because patients

3182
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:42,840
are all

3183
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:44,799
taking these various non-thc

3184
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:48,400
cannabinoids and

3185
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:51,520
and they all expect that they need

3186
01:45:48,399 --> 01:45:54,238
to take a break from them uh

3187
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:56,719
just like they would thc but by your

3188
01:45:54,238 --> 01:45:58,959
comment that you don't take one from cbd

3189
01:45:56,719 --> 01:46:00,480
left everyone in a quandary so will you

3190
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:02,639
flesh that out

3191
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:04,799
so i realized that i actually misspoke

3192
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:06,880
because i use full spectrum products

3193
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:08,480
so i don't actually technically take

3194
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:10,480
breaks from thc either

3195
01:46:08,479 --> 01:46:12,158
because even there's even trace amounts

3196
01:46:10,479 --> 01:46:14,158
in your cbd stuff

3197
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:16,000
yeah there's small amounts and then i i

3198
01:46:14,158 --> 01:46:17,439
use how i smoke hemp flour right so

3199
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,960
there's gonna be small amounts of delta

3200
01:46:17,439 --> 01:46:21,198
eight in there as well

3201
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,480
um but you know that's it's small

3202
01:46:21,198 --> 01:46:25,599
usually it's well under

3203
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:27,439
it's gonna be well under one percent um

3204
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:28,639
so i don't take breaks from the

3205
01:46:27,439 --> 01:46:32,719
cannabinoids i guess

3206
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:34,239
in general there we go

3207
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:37,359
that would be the main way of putting it

3208
01:46:34,238 --> 01:46:41,599
but in terms of like thc and like larger

3209
01:46:37,359 --> 01:46:44,238
like relatively larger doses of thc um

3210
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:44,800
i i currently am taking like a one to

3211
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:47,279
one

3212
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,119
um cbg cbd extract every morning and

3213
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:49,920
then like it has small amounts of thc

3214
01:46:49,118 --> 01:46:52,158
present

3215
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:54,319
um and a bunch of other things right

3216
01:46:52,158 --> 01:46:56,638
like whatever else is in is in the plant

3217
01:46:54,319 --> 01:46:58,559
but um it's interesting because like do

3218
01:46:56,639 --> 01:47:00,159
i need to take a tolerance break from

3219
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,520
these okay so what is a tolerance break

3220
01:47:00,158 --> 01:47:03,679
and what is that what is the point of a

3221
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:07,679
tolerance break for people right like

3222
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:09,039
uh in in general the added benefit of a

3223
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:10,880
tolerance break there's a couple added

3224
01:47:09,039 --> 01:47:11,840
benefits like the first added benefit of

3225
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:13,359
a tolerance break

3226
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:16,159
is going to be to decrease your

3227
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:16,799
tolerance um that means that you are

3228
01:47:16,158 --> 01:47:18,879
going to

3229
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,400
be able to get a larger therapeutic

3230
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,960
effect from less

3231
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:24,399
right that's the that's the number one

3232
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,118
reason why people want to take tolerance

3233
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:29,118
breaks

3234
01:47:25,118 --> 01:47:29,679
um i don't use to from my experience

3235
01:47:29,118 --> 01:47:32,319
with

3236
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:34,158
cbd and the trace amounts of thc and now

3237
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:37,118
cbg that i'm experiencing with

3238
01:47:34,158 --> 01:47:39,039
i don't experience a tolerance effect

3239
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:40,960
because i'm using them at relatively low

3240
01:47:39,039 --> 01:47:42,399
doses so it just means that like i'm not

3241
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:43,920
taking more every day i'm taking the

3242
01:47:42,399 --> 01:47:45,599
same amount every single day and i'm

3243
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,920
still getting the therapeutic effect

3244
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:49,440
so i'm not experiencing tolerance so for

3245
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:51,118
that reason like in number one like

3246
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:52,000
there is not really a need for a

3247
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:54,880
tolerance break

3248
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,000
in that one way um in terms of like

3249
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,960
that's the first reason to have a

3250
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,238
tolerance break

3251
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:59,679
the second reason is kind of like a

3252
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:00,799
lesser reason to have a tolerance break

3253
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:01,760
would be just to like judge your

3254
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:03,520
perspective

3255
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:05,119
of like whether or not something is

3256
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:07,280
working for you whether or not it's

3257
01:48:05,118 --> 01:48:10,479
having a negative effect on your life

3258
01:48:07,279 --> 01:48:11,679
um i have taken breaks for

3259
01:48:10,479 --> 01:48:13,678
for that reason that's actually one of

3260
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:15,039
the main reasons why i take regular thc

3261
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:16,719
breaks it's the reason why i stopped

3262
01:48:15,039 --> 01:48:18,880
drinking a couple years ago

3263
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:19,840
um just to like re just to check in

3264
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,359
right to check in

3265
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:23,600
being like how is this affecting my life

3266
01:48:21,359 --> 01:48:25,759
how is this affecting my health um

3267
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:27,679
and i think that that's important to do

3268
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:30,400
but for me personally

3269
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:31,118
the giant added therapeutic benefit that

3270
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:34,399
i get

3271
01:48:31,118 --> 01:48:35,439
from you know cbd now cbg and trace

3272
01:48:34,399 --> 01:48:38,000
amounts of thc

3273
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:39,359
plus plus whatever else is in the plant

3274
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,520
that we're talking about right like

3275
01:48:39,359 --> 01:48:43,118
the terpenes and the flavonoids and you

3276
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,920
know bioactive fatty acids and

3277
01:48:43,118 --> 01:48:47,039
everything

3278
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:48,960
like those benefits that i receive that

3279
01:48:47,039 --> 01:48:51,519
increase my quality of life i mean it

3280
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:53,118
far to me it is far outweighing any

3281
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,520
negative effect that it's having on my

3282
01:48:53,118 --> 01:48:56,399
health

3283
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:57,520
of which i don't see um any negative

3284
01:48:56,399 --> 01:48:59,679
effect on my health

3285
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:01,040
um that's obviously subjective that's

3286
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:02,239
something that i'm determining for

3287
01:49:01,039 --> 01:49:04,000
myself although

3288
01:49:02,238 --> 01:49:06,399
um i have seen doctors that say that i'm

3289
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:09,359
healthy so there's that

3290
01:49:06,399 --> 01:49:12,000
um i want to bring us back to the the

3291
01:49:09,359 --> 01:49:15,118
sharp edge point on the question though

3292
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,399
we're talking about uh you know we we've

3293
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:19,679
been talking about so far in

3294
01:49:16,399 --> 01:49:21,598
this answer like thc and how

3295
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:23,760
you do your tolerance breaks but

3296
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:27,279
specifically the question is

3297
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:30,480
are tolerance breaks beneficial for

3298
01:49:27,279 --> 01:49:33,599
cbd cbg and thca

3299
01:49:30,479 --> 01:49:34,959
they work the same way yes yeah and

3300
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:36,239
they're acting on different receptors

3301
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:37,039
though so i mean i think that that's

3302
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:38,638
like the main

3303
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:40,319
thing to point out is that all of these

3304
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:41,440
rare cannabinoids that have different

3305
01:49:40,319 --> 01:49:43,439
pharmacologies

3306
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:45,359
when you take tolerance breaks from them

3307
01:49:43,439 --> 01:49:45,678
you'll be affecting different receptors

3308
01:49:45,359 --> 01:49:47,198
and

3309
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:49,199
it'll be a similar thing though where

3310
01:49:47,198 --> 01:49:51,759
you're like re-sensitizing

3311
01:49:49,198 --> 01:49:52,638
your your body to the molecule although

3312
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,639
i haven't really

3313
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:56,000
seen a lot of people developing tau

3314
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:59,118
unless they're taking very very high

3315
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,880
doses um i guess it just depends

3316
01:49:59,118 --> 01:50:02,559
i and i'm i'm not like the most

3317
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,319
knowledgeable person on this i would

3318
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:06,480
love to hear from other people

3319
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:08,238
uh what they think about this but you

3320
01:50:06,479 --> 01:50:08,559
know developing a tolerance it seems

3321
01:50:08,238 --> 01:50:10,479
like

3322
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,679
at least thc develops a pretty rapid

3323
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:14,399
tolerance like

3324
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:16,719
it's easy for the cb1 receptors to be

3325
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:19,839
down regulated and then for you to get

3326
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:23,599
less of that intoxicating effect i have

3327
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:25,039
not um seen that and i maybe

3328
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:26,719
with the other rare cannabinoids and

3329
01:50:25,039 --> 01:50:28,238
maybe i also haven't looked hard enough

3330
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:29,679
because to be fair like

3331
01:50:28,238 --> 01:50:31,279
there's not a lot of information out

3332
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:33,359
there on the um

3333
01:50:31,279 --> 01:50:34,800
other rare cannabinoids i would be very

3334
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:36,639
interested to hear from people

3335
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:38,560
if they develop tolerance to the other

3336
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:39,440
rares and like what that looks like and

3337
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,639
what

3338
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:43,198
it would look like for them to take

3339
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:46,079
tolerance breaks i'm interested

3340
01:50:43,198 --> 01:50:46,559
the the common the common background of

3341
01:50:46,079 --> 01:50:49,118
this

3342
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,560
is uh since this whole set three is is

3343
01:50:49,118 --> 01:50:52,880
focused on

3344
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:54,880
dosing thresholds for efficacy in

3345
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:57,199
chronic and serious illness

3346
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:58,800
these are generally folks that have got

3347
01:50:57,198 --> 01:51:02,638
some

3348
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:03,920
combination of of serious things like

3349
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:07,118
you know ms and ra

3350
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:08,639
lupus and r.a you know lupus hashimoto

3351
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:11,519
epstein-barr r.a right like

3352
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:13,840
like people who have got serious

3353
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:17,520
dysfunctions in their body

3354
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,239
and these folks describe this experience

3355
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:21,360
of

3356
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:22,319
going bouncing from solution to solution

3357
01:51:21,359 --> 01:51:25,439
because

3358
01:51:22,319 --> 01:51:28,479
their body adapts to the solutions

3359
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:29,359
quickly and their suffering returns and

3360
01:51:28,479 --> 01:51:31,359
so

3361
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:32,799
it is incredibly common for me to hear

3362
01:51:31,359 --> 01:51:36,399
from these these these

3363
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:39,119
these high difficulty patients that

3364
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:40,960
yeah i did you know cbd worked for five

3365
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:43,759
weeks and then it stopped working

3366
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:45,359
and so i moved on to cbg and cbg helped

3367
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:47,280
decrease the inflammation for a few

3368
01:51:45,359 --> 01:51:49,198
weeks and then it stopped working

3369
01:51:47,279 --> 01:51:50,800
and then they moved on to mushrooms and

3370
01:51:49,198 --> 01:51:52,000
then that worked for a while and that

3371
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,440
stopped working

3372
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,760
and then they're like so then i went

3373
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:56,879
back around to cbd oh cbd was now

3374
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:58,719
working again

3375
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:01,118
and so so many of these patients they

3376
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:04,399
hop from method to method to method

3377
01:52:01,118 --> 01:52:05,279
to to i mean and and they're even

3378
01:52:04,399 --> 01:52:08,079
switching

3379
01:52:05,279 --> 01:52:09,840
from drugs that have different methods

3380
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:11,279
of action right so it's not even always

3381
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:15,039
the method of action

3382
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:17,679
it's as if they need to keep um

3383
01:52:15,039 --> 01:52:19,439
goosing their immune system with

3384
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:22,158
different solutions to

3385
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:23,678
refreshing it right and so it's these

3386
01:52:22,158 --> 01:52:27,279
folks that are looking for

3387
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:30,800
any way to refresh their body's reaction

3388
01:52:27,279 --> 01:52:34,399
to these natural plant medicines

3389
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:36,320
and you know when you said you know

3390
01:52:34,399 --> 01:52:37,679
you know inaccurately that you take a

3391
01:52:36,319 --> 01:52:40,559
break from from

3392
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:41,840
cbd people were all over this because

3393
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:43,920
they're like oh

3394
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:45,760
you know do should we not be taking our

3395
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:48,079
breaks from cbd and i think that the

3396
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:49,679
answer is actually yeah they should be

3397
01:52:48,079 --> 01:52:51,679
well i think it also depends so for

3398
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:53,520
people who have really high inflammatory

3399
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:54,960
and chronic disorders like this is again

3400
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:57,040
i'm not a doctor i'm not a medical

3401
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,359
professional i'm not a nutritionist i'm

3402
01:52:57,039 --> 01:52:59,840
just

3403
01:52:57,359 --> 01:53:01,039
a scientist and this is just my opinion

3404
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,719
of my life but

3405
01:53:01,039 --> 01:53:04,399
you know it's not just the cannabinoids

3406
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:05,520
that i use to manage my chronic

3407
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:08,399
disorders i have

3408
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:09,199
altered pretty much every other aspect

3409
01:53:08,399 --> 01:53:12,319
of my life

3410
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:15,359
that you could that you could i

3411
01:53:12,319 --> 01:53:17,519
shape my entire life around

3412
01:53:15,359 --> 01:53:18,639
my chronic mental health chronic pain

3413
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:21,199
and chronic gi

3414
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:22,159
issues i try and maintain the lowest

3415
01:53:21,198 --> 01:53:24,319
possible

3416
01:53:22,158 --> 01:53:25,679
like systemic inflammation levels i mean

3417
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:26,238
we talked about inflammation in the last

3418
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:28,000
one

3419
01:53:26,238 --> 01:53:30,158
i think inflammation is at the heart of

3420
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,760
a lot of these problems specifically

3421
01:53:30,158 --> 01:53:35,359
immune system problems

3422
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:37,840
um and so i would say as just as advice

3423
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:40,000
um in my opinion is that you have to

3424
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:41,679
find a way to potentiate

3425
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,840
the cannabinoids you have to find a way

3426
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:45,118
to make them more effective

3427
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:47,360
and there are a number of ways you can

3428
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:48,719
do that right like by modifying your

3429
01:53:47,359 --> 01:53:50,399
diet modifying your

3430
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:52,239
fasting or like your eating window i

3431
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:52,719
take i take cold showers and do

3432
01:53:52,238 --> 01:53:54,319
breathing

3433
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:56,158
exercises right like people who've heard

3434
01:53:54,319 --> 01:53:58,238
of them hoff um

3435
01:53:56,158 --> 01:53:59,519
and then there's like stretching yoga

3436
01:53:58,238 --> 01:54:01,759
mental health work like

3437
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:03,920
cardi like low grade cardio strength

3438
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:05,599
training like working out like there's

3439
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:07,440
there's all of these other options that

3440
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:09,760
you could do that potentiate they

3441
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:10,960
increase the efficacy of the

3442
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:13,360
cannabinoids

3443
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:15,039
um and i know that for a number of

3444
01:54:13,359 --> 01:54:16,559
reasons those things are extremely

3445
01:54:15,039 --> 01:54:17,840
difficult to implement in your life and

3446
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:19,199
they feel like this all

3447
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,560
i mean when i say all of them out loud

3448
01:54:19,198 --> 01:54:21,439
it's like oh my god i can't believe i do

3449
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:23,920
all of those

3450
01:54:21,439 --> 01:54:25,439
things um so it's really like about one

3451
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:26,960
at a time and certain things will work

3452
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:30,158
for certain people more

3453
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:31,679
more than others right um but i can't

3454
01:54:30,158 --> 01:54:33,519
tell you what has worked for me or

3455
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:34,800
like has any of the have any of those

3456
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:37,360
one things work for me or

3457
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:38,719
is it the combination that of all of

3458
01:54:37,359 --> 01:54:41,759
these things that

3459
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:44,639
that are somehow working together um

3460
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:46,239
you know i i don't know um that that's

3461
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:48,719
actually a really good point is to

3462
01:54:46,238 --> 01:54:50,158
to bring us back to the holistic nature

3463
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:53,198
of this and while i

3464
01:54:50,158 --> 01:54:55,759
while i know that the the

3465
01:54:53,198 --> 01:54:57,039
the inflammation patients that you know

3466
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:00,079
i i've worked with

3467
01:54:57,039 --> 01:55:02,479
would would howl at the idea that that

3468
01:55:00,079 --> 01:55:04,319
they do weight training right

3469
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:05,519
and that they they lift things because

3470
01:55:04,319 --> 01:55:09,279
most of them feel

3471
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:11,760
so broken and weak um the body doesn't

3472
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:13,118
really know i mean for this application

3473
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:15,119
the body doesn't really know the

3474
01:55:13,118 --> 01:55:15,519
difference between a one pound weight

3475
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:18,238
and a

3476
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:18,560
20 pound weight all it knows is that

3477
01:55:18,238 --> 01:55:20,879
it's

3478
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:22,400
it's being put into a stress and release

3479
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:25,760
of the muscle sets

3480
01:55:22,399 --> 01:55:27,118
and so it is going through the the body

3481
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:29,599
actions

3482
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:30,559
um that that respond to that and there

3483
01:55:29,599 --> 01:55:33,920
is healing

3484
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:36,080
and efficacy in that and so

3485
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:37,118
you know i i like the fact that you

3486
01:55:36,079 --> 01:55:39,679
recognized the

3487
01:55:37,118 --> 01:55:40,319
mental impossibility of that for these

3488
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:43,118
patients

3489
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:44,639
oh it's and yet just find something

3490
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:46,559
heavier than nothing

3491
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:48,239
or just or just nothing just body

3492
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,760
training start with what you know start

3493
01:55:48,238 --> 01:55:51,678
with what is good for you like i'm

3494
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:53,440
i have hypermobility issues i injure

3495
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:55,599
myself really really easily

3496
01:55:53,439 --> 01:55:57,039
i don't lift like i mean now that i've

3497
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:57,760
been lifting for a while i've been able

3498
01:55:57,039 --> 01:56:00,639
to increase

3499
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:02,000
like my weights but um you know it's

3500
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:02,560
it's all about what you're comfortable

3501
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,560
with and

3502
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:06,159
what actually brings things to to your

3503
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:06,880
life and that are that are manageable to

3504
01:56:06,158 --> 01:56:09,118
you

3505
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:10,400
um to do i think that's like the

3506
01:56:09,118 --> 01:56:11,839
starting point and then like what you

3507
01:56:10,399 --> 01:56:13,279
said about a one pound weight i mean you

3508
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,880
do a one pound weight for six months

3509
01:56:13,279 --> 01:56:16,399
it'll turn into a five pound weight

3510
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:17,920
you do that for another six months it'll

3511
01:56:16,399 --> 01:56:21,198
turn into a 10 pound weight

3512
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:23,920
and then you'll get to 20. you know well

3513
01:56:21,198 --> 01:56:24,638
uh miyabi thank you so much for joining

01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:32,480
the part one

3548
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,000
it is fabulous and you should definitely

3549
01:57:32,479 --> 01:57:35,279
check it out if you just started with

3550
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,719
this one

3551
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:38,800
if you would like to learn more from

3552
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:40,319
miyabi i strongly suggest that you

3553
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:42,480
follow their social media

3554
01:57:40,319 --> 01:57:43,439
which is just absolutely filled with

3555
01:57:42,479 --> 01:57:46,158
rich content

3556
01:57:43,439 --> 01:57:48,158
and how i found out about them uh the

3557
01:57:46,158 --> 01:57:50,960
more reliable platform

3558
01:57:48,158 --> 01:57:51,839
for that right now seems to be instagram

3559
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:55,359
and their

3560
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:58,560
instagram is at miyabi phd and that's

3561
01:57:55,359 --> 01:58:01,759
m i y a b

3562
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:03,039
e p h d so instagram seems to be the

3563
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:06,159
best place to go

3564
01:58:03,039 --> 01:58:07,599
um however um uh you know

3565
01:58:06,158 --> 01:58:09,279
the the secret is that the tick tock

3566
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:12,079
material is actually more fun

3567
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:12,880
for the moment and the tick tock but

3568
01:58:12,079 --> 01:58:15,439
keep keep

3569
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:16,239
tick tock keeps deleting miyabi's

3570
01:58:15,439 --> 01:58:19,839
account

3571
01:58:16,238 --> 01:58:23,759
but for now it is also at miyabi

3572
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:27,279
hd so follow both the instagram account

3573
