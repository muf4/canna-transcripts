2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,429
everything's just fine in the greenhouse

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,320
until it's not the cannabis plant is

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,790
highly adaptive but she also tells you

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,649
right away of growing conditions are

6
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,839
slipping and she's not feeling so well

7
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,489
being able to read the condition of the

8
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,989
plants and then correlate that to what

9
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:23,929
is happening in the growing environment

10
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:26,429
takes some serious experienced

11
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:27,719
professional growers are finely tuned to

12
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:30,118
sense the changes in the growing

13
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,919
environment so they can adapt sometimes

14
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,950
though you can find yourself in a bad

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,800
way fast in times like these you better

16
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,450
have some rescue skills if you want to

17

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,359
and has become one of if not the most

50
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,549
important voice in cannabis greenhouses

51
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,039
you may remember Eric Branstad from

52
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,159
shaping fire episode 13 when he was here

53
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,868
to talk about greenhouses and light DEP

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,969
eric is the recent founder of green

55
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:58,379
house Advisory Group after spending over

56
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,629
a decade with forever flowering

57
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:02,158
greenhouses chances are if you've

58
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,530
attended a cannabis convention in the

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,350
last five years you've seen Eric speak

60
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,538
about light down during episode 13 we

61
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,818
focused on the pre-planning and building

62
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,079
of your cannabis greenhouse on this

63
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:14,969
episode we're going to

64
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,100
about what to do when greenhouses go bad

65
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:20,729
today we're talking about greenhouse

66
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:21,599
rescue welcome to show Eric hey Shango

67
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:23,069
thanks for having me

68
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,389
it's always great to have you back man

69
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,819
you know I always get such great

70
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:29,009
feedback whenever we do an interview and

71
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,870
I always learn a lot too so so let's get

72
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:32,699
right to it you know let's let's set a

73
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,590
context for people who are not really

74
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,810
familiar with greenhouses yet and bring

75
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,969
them up to speed before we get into the

76
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,659
nitty-gritty so what are the attributes

77
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:46,439
of a greenhouse that attracts so much

78
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:48,930
people to growing cannabis I mean

79
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,030
originally when it was people growing

80
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,209
cannabis in Northern California was to

81
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,819
protect from the rains outdoor plants

82
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:59,310
would get rained on right before harvest

83
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,549
and would actually disrupt that harvest

84
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,900
in the sense that it might you know

85
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,910
contaminate the flowers or do something

86
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,340
to create mold and these problems so the

87
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:12,240
greenhouse was like the shelter to help

88
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,250
ensure a successful harvest and then

89
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,469
there's also a lot of people that now

90
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,489
look to cost of production so when you

91
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:22,199
look at a legal business in cannabis you

92
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,390
know the cost of production is really

93
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,909
important these days because your cost

94
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:29,159
of production dictates almost if you're

95
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:30,930
gonna make any profit or not it's easy

96
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,389
to spend a lot of money to grow cannabis

97
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,640
we've all figured that out and I think

98
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:37,708
the art now is to see how cheap we can

99
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,049
grow it not to grow it cheap and crappy

100
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,810
but I just mean how can we grow it to

101
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,160
not spend a ton of money on nutrient

102
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,780
soil and all the other things that

103
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,400
generally were the norm and so you know

104
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,129
a lot of people look to the green house

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,189
is an indoor grow room with the free Sun

106
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,069
and that's not the best way to look at

107
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:00,689
it even though that's kind of the first

108
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:03,030
common-sense I guess thought to say Oh a

109
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:05,189
green house I could get rid of my

110
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,019
electricity bill or the lighting bill at

111
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:08,789
least and we can use the Sun and let's

112
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,689
go get a green house type of thing and

113
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:15,090
so if you've primarily come from indoor

114
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:17,160
growing there's a little bit more of a

115
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,790
stumbling block I think than people that

116
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,680
have been accustomed to growing outdoors

117
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:25,860
but you know for the most part a green

118
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,699
house also outfits or has the ability to

119
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,710
do the light

120
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,810
privation technique which creates the

121
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:32,849
more you know a photo period so people

122
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,550
can get multiple harvests using the Sun

123
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,370
so there's more advantages to using a

124
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,870
greenhouse in cannabis nowadays more

125
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,459
than ever compare it you know compared

126
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,430
to way it used to be but you have to

127
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:46,109
understand the method to the madness or

128
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,120
else your cost of production is gonna go

129
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,949
through the roof or you might not even

130
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,780
met you know the failure rates really

131
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:53,250
high yeah right on and I'm actually

132
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,109
really looking forward to going through

133
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,319
that list when you and I talked to set

134
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,120
up this interview the the list of issues

135
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,829
that come up when people are

136
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,170
inappropriately using their greenhouse

137
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:07,500
is really long it sounds like it might

138
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,629
as well be outdoor so it'll it'll be fun

139
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,970
to go through these so so now we

140
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:13,529
understand why greenhouses are useful

141
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,290
and but let's also give people an idea

142
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:19,019
of how much these things cost cuz I know

143
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,760
that there's a whole continuum of cost

144
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,859
so will you give people a general idea

145
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,079
of what a company might spend on a

146
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,540
greenhouse and just roughly what they're

147
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,939
gonna get for that kind of money yeah

148
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,590
there's there's you know I like to look

149
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,750
at greenhouses in three different

150
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:36,899
categories there's the hoop houses the

151
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,290
traditional you know round arch or the

152
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:43,259
hoop house for the lack of better words

153
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,879
and pay can be fairly affordable from

154
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,889
one greenhouse company to another

155
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,670
they're more of the entry-level season

156
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:53,459
extender type of greenhouses and so they

157
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:57,000
also can be in different sizes of metal

158
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:59,189
for the most part or thicknesses but for

159
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,839
the most part hoop houses are affordable

160
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:03,389
ones they can be a couple dollars a

161
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,369
square foot for the greenhouse and then

162
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:07,079
you have the Gothic shape frames which

163
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,180
usually are a little beefier they have a

164
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,449
little bit more of a point to the to the

165
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,639
roof than a hoop house and they

166
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,439
generally can handle a little bit more

167
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,269
snow that a lot of times built with a

168
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,839
little bit thicker or bigger metal than

169
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:25,709
a traditional hoop house and they can

170
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,659
start to jump up into the 19 to 25

171
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:30,509
dollars a square foot depending on how

172
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,640
big or small you get now you outfit them

173
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:34,199
and then when we get into the a-frame

174
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,389
category that's the more commercial

175
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:40,709
looking greenhouses that we see that our

176
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:44,159
gutter connected and you know really

177
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:46,529
taller and bigger and wow you know like

178
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,210
the impressive greenhouses I guess you

179
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:50,879
could say in the commercial space and

180
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:52,829
the a-frame greenhouses typically

181
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,949
handled the most snow loads and wind

182
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:57,930
loads and and have more features and

183
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:00,479
abilities than the hoop or the gothic in

184
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,590
most cases and so those start anywhere

185
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,450
from 25 to 35 dollars a square foot for

186
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:08,639
those greenhouses depending on what you

187
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:11,909
outfit them with and that can be you

188
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,519
know the the different benching systems

189
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,530
from automated irrigation heating and

190
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,629
things like that the cost of the

191
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:21,089
greenhouse can the price per square foot

192
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:23,490
starts to go up the more bells and

193
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:25,739
whistles you add to it and the a-frame

194
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,920
really gives you the most options for

195
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,199
those bells and whistles I can imagine

196
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,569
that you have seen some jaw-dropping

197
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,800
stuff in the last year because you know

198
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:37,170
you've been doing this for a long time

199
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,990
10 plus years and you've seen you know a

200
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:42,509
lot of kind of you know you know ghetto

201
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,490
humble you know greenhouses that are

202
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,050
gonna get blown away and then people

203
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,040
getting more professional and then

204
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,889
getting multiple professional

205
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,080
greenhouses but with the venture capital

206
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:53,789
coming in and people really thrown their

207
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,539
money around trying to solve solutions

208
00:07:53,790 --> 00:08:01,110
with it I'm sure you've seen some really

209
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:02,640
incredibly tricked-out greenhouses yeah

210
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,250
I've been pretty fortunate in that

211
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,129
regard and I'm feeling more and more

212
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,750
fortunate all the time I mean now that

213
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:11,909
I'm doing my own thing I'm actually

214
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:15,420
invited to a lot more places that I

215
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:17,550
hadn't been previously and so that is

216
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,500
also given me the opportunity you know

217
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,389
honestly to see some greenhouses that

218
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,819
I've wanted to see for a long time it

219
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,319
because I was on a different team so to

220
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,610
speak it wasn't really something that

221
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,790
was gonna happen

222
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,199
and now that's happening and so I'm

223
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,480
actually able to see a lot of these

224
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,909
things that I've been really wanting to

225
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,889
see because I knew that they were you

226
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,019
know new designs different you know

227
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:43,559
techniques and things like that and so

228
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:45,509
for me to really be able to advise and

229
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,369
do the things that I'm doing now I need

230
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:50,189
to be able to see all this stuff so I'm

231
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,710
I'm really being proactive to to get out

232
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,370
there and get into more places that I've

233
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,310
been eyeballing for a while

234
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,710
and yeah it's exciting I just went to

235
00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:03,159
one recently in Southern California and

236
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:07,360
it was definitely state-of-the-art

237
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:09,730
impressive impressive facility and yeah

238
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,320
it's it's exciting yeah right on we

239
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,940
might as well go ahead and plug green

240
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,500
house advisory group right now because

241
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,900
anybody who's followed you knows that

242
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,120
you've been in the green house scene for

243
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:21,819
over a decade but now you're newly

244
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,980
independent and so you still have all of

245
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,560
the you know more than a decade of

246
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,289
experience and know-how plus being you

247
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,599
know oh gee Nora Cal guy and have mad

248
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:33,759
connections but you formed green house

249
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,070
advisory group and you're working with

250
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,110
everybody all comers all kinds of you

251
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,340
know builders and designers and

252
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,779
customers side and anybody who wants to

253
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:47,710
leverage your experience tried pretty

254
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:49,329
much have the idea right correct yeah

255
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:53,860
I'm trying to pull everybody together

256
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:55,810
that I can to get people what they need

257
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,930
as far as access I mean a lot of people

258
00:09:55,809 --> 00:10:01,929
are going to one manufacturer or one

259
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:04,509
consultant and kind of getting one view

260
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:07,659
so to speak and it's good to get a big

261
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:11,919
perspective and do the due diligence to

262
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:13,360
get a few views bids and scenarios in

263
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,659
order to really wrap your head around

264
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,550
what's gonna work or not for that area

265
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:20,469
for that particular customer and a lot

266
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:23,259
of people also you know even though a

267
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,910
lot of the companies that help out fit

268
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:28,269
these green houses you know with the

269
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:29,860
fans and filtration systems odor

270
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:33,699
controls and things like that people

271
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,529
also want to talk to the you know the

272
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,570
main person from those companies even

273
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:40,569
though you know one green house company

274
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:43,750
or certain these companies don't sell

275
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,580
direct you know they all typically try

276
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,080
to do it through one green house company

277
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,330
or something like that that leaves the

278
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,460
customer you know only dealing with the

279
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,100
sales rep from the green house company

280
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,050
and they just get you know that

281
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,149
information however it's interpreted or

282
00:10:56,049 --> 00:11:00,759
relayed so I really think it's good to

283
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:02,949
actually connect a lot of the dots so if

284
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:04,960
somebody has you know serious odor

285
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,370
control questions let's talk to the odor

286
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,009
control guy you don't have to doesn't

287
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,289
necessarily hear it from me

288
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:12,450
yeah right on right on and that way it's

289
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:14,459
you're kind of making a an all-star team

290
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:18,720
of the top people for their particular

291
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:20,070
areas yes I have a connection with all

292
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,290
these people so it's not like I'm

293
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:24,300
employing all these people and and

294
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:27,120
whatnot but they all are part of this

295
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:29,759
team that we all want to be together on

296
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,460
you know that them as much as me to get

297
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:35,220
the customers to access they need to the

298
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,050
information so that they can make good

299
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,639
decisions so that they can vet the

300
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:40,169
consultants and the people that they're

301
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,360
working with because at the end of the

302
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:43,769
day you know that like you said the

303
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,259
venture capitalists and people are

304
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:48,029
coming in and so who's designing these

305
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:49,860
greenhouses and what what are they

306
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:51,779
basing it off of you know what I mean

307
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,730
like yeah

308
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,439
you know I don't know there's a couple

309
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,970
farms in particular I won't name any

310
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,470
names but you know I see their

311
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,879
greenhouses and they're beautiful

312
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,800
state-of-the-art and they've had a lot

313
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,100
of problems in them and then they're

314
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:07,169
going to build new greenhouses and so

315
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,870
where do they get the you know base

316
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:11,370
metric for saying okay let's do this new

317
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,200
design if they have a state of the art

318
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,259
facility that's not even doing that

319
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,300
great you know like I mean is it really

320
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,710
that facility or is that the growing is

321
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:22,889
designing a new state-of-the-art

322
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,240
facility gonna make it easier like I'm

323
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:26,039
just dying to get into some of these

324
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,159
places and ask some of these questions

325
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,019
because I feel like it's just going on

326
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:34,019
one person's idea after the other and

327
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,850
it's not necessarily proved right and

328
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,949
this is where your whole idea that you

329
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,139
mentioned to me at NCI a of green house

330
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,120
rescue right so you've hired right

331
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,879
you've hired a company and they've built

332
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,769
you a box and they don't really know how

333
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,230
the green house works properly for

334
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,789
cannabis and so you're rolling in with

335
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,230
your experience and going in Internet

336
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:54,899
let me let me show you how to do this

337
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,250
and so so let's let's start before we go

338
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,419
into our first commercial break in a

339
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,080
little bit I want to get into a little

340
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:03,990
more meat for the people who have got

341
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,759
greenhouses and they've got problems you

342
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,440
and I made a list of a whole bunch of

343
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,419
issues that can come up with your

344
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,430
greenhouse before the show and let's

345
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:13,079
start going through those and and start

346
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:15,299
knocking them down you know the one

347
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,060
thing the one problem that I think most

348
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:21,449
anybody in the National Canada scene has

349
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:21,959
heard you speak on is heat because oh my

350
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,300
gosh you

351
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,009
ray'll on that so so I'm gonna I'm gonna

352
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:28,199
hand you the mic and why don't you start

353
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:30,720
talking talking about heat issues in

354
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,759
greenhouses yeah that's great I mean I

355
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,379
got a Dean last night that asked me to

356
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,139
come out and talk about how they can

357
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:40,200
make their greenhouse cooler cool things

358
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,939
down because they have too much heat

359
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,220
associated with their greenhouse and it

360
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,830
makes sense because you know greenhouses

361
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,230
were made for trapping air so that that

362
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:52,379
air will heat up I mean greenhouses were

363
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:55,350
invented for wintertime not for summer

364
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:57,210
and so it's what I say all the time

365
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,220
you're right because a lot of people

366
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:02,090
want to take this contraption and throw

367
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,950
it out in the hottest sunniest place and

368
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,629
it doesn't necessarily make sense when

369
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,520
you think about it from the angle of

370
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:10,559
okay greenhouses were invented for

371
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,289
wintertime if you trap air it heats up

372
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,239
the first thought is in my mind isn't

373
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:17,250
okay let's go to Desert Hot Springs and

374
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,919
set up a Death Valley and set up a

375
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,600
greenhouse like you know even though

376
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,729
people are doing it you can do it don't

377
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,370
get me wrong when you don't have those

378
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,200
thoughts in your mind you go to a

379
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,909
greenhouse company or you design a

380
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,259
greenhouse yourself without those

381
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:33,149
thoughts in your mind and it's easy

382
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:35,669
create something that's not gonna

383
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:37,829
function right or it's gonna create more

384
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:41,729
of a hostile environment than what

385
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:43,800
you're already dealing with and so the

386
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,509
greenhouse rescue is a hot topic right

387
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,339
now because we have a lot of people that

388
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:50,610
are coming into it imagining what they

389
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,889
think they need and you know what they

390
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,570
end up having is heat issues all the

391
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:56,220
time it's always heat because we're

392
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,410
trapping air and it heats it up the

393
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,480
other thing that happens is the clear

394
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:03,149
the cover the more intense the Sun is

395
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,710
and so we have leaf surface temperatures

396
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:06,809
that go up it's not always just air

397
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,790
temperature that increases that's the

398
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:12,089
obvious one but the surface temps

399
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:14,969
increase the metal the ground the soil

400
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:17,759
the grow bags or the containers and then

401
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,980
the leaves themselves and when plants

402
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,350
heat up they have to sweat and when we

403
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,779
get sweaty plants that results in

404
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,940
condensation and condensation what

405
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:29,059
everybody is what everybody's fearful of

406
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,680
and definitely doesn't want to get but

407
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:34,529
and then we go into okay how do we do

408
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,849
you mid afire how do we you know mop up

409
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:37,980
this condensation and

410
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,139
the thought isn't backup let's figure

411
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,360
out how to stop the plants from sweating

412
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,100
first of all and a lot of times the

413
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,379
other default is okay put in a cooling

414
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,440
system you know an HVAC or whatever and

415
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:51,389
you know when we start plugging in a ton

416
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,490
of things we're taking the green out of

417
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:55,590
the greenhouse and we were talking about

418
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,990
our cost of production earlier needing

419
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,910
to go down and so we can easily take a

420
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,980
greenhouse and start to plug all this

421
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:04,620
stuff in run all this equipment and

422
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,050
watch our power bills start to go up and

423
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,330
then we go did this really save us any

424
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:12,179
money in the long run especially with

425
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,770
the increased hostility and failure rate

426
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,409
that's happening because we start to see

427
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:18,600
the russet mites and the powdery mildews

428
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:21,029
and the you know botrytis and all these

429
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,040
you know even spider mites in the basic

430
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:25,620
forms start to take over and so we have

431
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,349
people that are not growing cannabis as

432
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:31,080
much anymore I'd like to say they

433
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,149
they're waging war you know they're out

434
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,160
there spraying you know this I spray

435
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:37,019
that and I spray this and some people

436
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,299
even say I'm in the battle of my life

437
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,730
right now to get these rude aphids

438
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:43,349
knocked back I'm in the you know a huge

439
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,759
battle you know and it's just like men

440
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,629
everywhere you go we're going to this

441
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,370
war zone and it's not it's not as fun as

442
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:52,830
it used to be people lose their passion

443
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,799
really easily people get complacent and

444
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:58,020
do you know stupid things I guess you

445
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,399
could say and well let's let's let's

446
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,990
roll it all the way back since the

447
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,939
beginning of that whole train of thought

448
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,559
which is the heat right and the heat can

449
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,959
cause this one problem and then another

450
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,119
and another and they're they chain all

451
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,310
the way down until you're giving up hope

452
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,529
and you've lost morale you started out

453
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:16,500
by saying that you know the the the the

454
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:20,220
greenhouse was meant to keep the heat in

455
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,049
and it gets too hot is it as simple as

456
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:26,519
opening the windows and are all

457
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:27,899
greenhouses made with opening windows no

458
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,670
I mean a lot of people right now

459
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,620
actually and that's a good point or

460
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,509
topic in the sense that there's a couple

461
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:35,429
ways to run a greenhouse for ventilation

462
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:38,069
there's the passive ventilation which

463
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:40,320
means opening up side vents and roof

464
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:42,149
vents and doors even and then there's

465
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,129
mechanical ventilation which means the

466
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:46,500
greenhouse is virtually sealed up and

467
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,630
the only entry point for air is that the

468
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,140
intakes at one end of the greenhouse and

469
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,610
the

470
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,009
the air travels through the greenhouse

471
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:56,609
and out the exhaust fans the other way

472
00:17:53,009 --> 00:18:00,299
and so you know when we're designing a

473
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:02,429
greenhouse people often not you know

474
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:04,500
forget or just don't bother with the

475
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,660
passive ventilation and just do strictly

476
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,309
mechanical ventilation because there's

477
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,560
this idea to have this controlled

478
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:14,069
environment if I open up these openings

479
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,289
bugs are gonna come in and and with

480
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:18,240
mechanical ventilation you're still

481
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:20,159
exchanging a ton of air I mean the

482
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,859
outside air is coming in through the

483
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,720
greenhouse and so a lot of people forget

484
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:27,269
the fact that you know opening the roof

485
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,980
or the sidewall may be different than

486
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:32,849
turning on the fan but we're still

487
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,710
accessing air from the outside it's you

488
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:37,169
know so it's not much different and so

489
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,210
yes when you design a greenhouse I like

490
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:41,039
to say design it for flexibility and it

491
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,650
may cost more but having passive and

492
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,690
mechanical ventilation is important but

493
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:48,990
no opening up the greenhouse alone isn't

494
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:51,600
enough because greenhouse covers will

495
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,819
magnify the light they don't just you

496
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,889
know transmit the light exactly how it

497
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:59,189
is it actually will magnify the light

498
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:01,680
and create more intensity so what you

499
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,809
end up happening is that you can have a

500
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,940
passively ventilated greenhouse and

501
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:08,490
still have a high leaf surface

502
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,470
temperature and and as example of that

503
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,329
is that I was in Santa Barbara County

504
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,420
where it's near the coast pretty

505
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:17,789
temperate climate but I was in a big

506
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,310
50,000 square foot wooden greenhouse

507
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:22,859
wasn't fancy state-of-the-art it had a

508
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:25,139
fairly clear film on it their frosted

509
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:27,209
films they so they don't completely

510
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,420
clear like glass but they're still

511
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:33,450
transmitted quite a bit of light and it

512
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,250
was 75 degrees inside the greenhouse so

513
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,830
it was fine you know the air temperature

514
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,019
was fine but with using my infrared

515
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:41,909
thermometer I shot the leaf surface of

516
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:43,950
these plants that were you know probably

517
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:46,320
teens there were small plants it was a

518
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:49,680
nursery and the leaf surface temperature

519
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:52,319
was already 94 degrees and so that's a

520
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,840
pretty big swing from having an 80 75

521
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,629
degree air temperature to a 94 degree

522
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:00,059
leaf surface temperature we know at that

523
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,610
point the plants are heating up and

524
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,879
they're needing to transpire or sweat to

525
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:04,619
keep

526
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,110
themselves cool they're using that water

527
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:09,839
not for photosynthetic availability but

528
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:11,789
for survival at that point and so of

529
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,220
course the greenhouse is feeling more

530
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:16,170
humid you know they're wanting to pull

531
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:19,200
shade cloth to try to calm down the

532
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:21,000
sun's intensity and so it's not just air

533
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,799
temperature that it well air

534
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,960
temperatures what everybody's trying to

535
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,490
fight or battle or deal with to mitigate

536
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,910
all these surface temps and you don't

537
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:33,059
have to do it that way I can actually or

538
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:35,910
we the stuff that I've done over the

539
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:37,950
course of my history of greenhouses is

540
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:40,200
using actually a diffused greenhouse

541
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:43,410
cover that spreads the light uniformly

542
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,330
and scatters infrared and it actually

543
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,980
helps lower the leaf surface temperature

544
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:49,740
almost like if you were using shade

545
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,360
cloth but shade cloth restricts the

546
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,980
light and we're trying to get as much

547
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,019
light as possible to grow cannabis

548
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,849
that's always super important for

549
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,529
cannabis growers is to get more light

550
00:20:56,849 --> 00:21:00,569
you know they don't want any shade

551
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:03,450
shadowing or anything like that and so

552
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:05,519
to get more light the obvious thing is

553
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,440
to try to get clear materials but then

554
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,869
they put out a shade cloth to restrict

555
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,160
the light when it gets too hot so you

556
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,259
know it's kind of this chasing the tail

557
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,240
syndrome that I see going on and so by

558
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:17,700
using a properly diffused greenhouse

559
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,029
cover we usually don't have to use shade

560
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,710
cloth because the diffuse cover actually

561
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,750
mimics or acts almost like a shade cloth

562
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,000
would in the sense that it is diffusing

563
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,619
the light but in a sense it's creating

564
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,680
more light particles rather than

565
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:33,719
restricting them because of the

566
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,390
diffusion properties in that greenhouse

567
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,339
cover and so what I found over the

568
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:42,110
course of time that it's much easier to

569
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:45,629
support the plants and cool them down

570
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:49,079
with the process of using diffuse covers

571
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,850
passive ventilation circulation fans we

572
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:53,250
actually get the plant temperature down

573
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:56,669
rather than the air temperature because

574
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,890
at the end of the day using certain

575
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:01,050
equipment wet walls and things like that

576
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:03,240
to cool a greenhouse to actually get it

577
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:05,970
down to that temperature doesn't always

578
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,490
happen the air conditioning or wet wall

579
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,049
cooling systems in greenhouses sometimes

580
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:12,410
depending on where you are and the

581
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:15,629
humidity the relative humidity outside

582
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,710
you don't get a temperature drop and if

583
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,360
you do sometimes

584
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,250
it's only ten degrees so if it's a

585
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:22,349
hundred degree day getting it down to 90

586
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,509
degrees in the greenhouse doesn't really

587
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:27,058
help anybody that much and it's terribly

588
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:30,898
humid inside I remember I remember back

589
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:33,509
in 2015 or so you got your hands on one

590
00:22:30,898 --> 00:22:35,969
of these infrared temperature gauges and

591
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:37,408
it was funny as hell man because like I

592
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,179
remember watching you in social media

593
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:41,039
you're like live-streaming this or that

594
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:43,350
and like you're just walking around

595
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,750
greenhouses and you're just like

596
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:47,730
pointing at stuff and and it was funny

597
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,130
because those of us who are watching our

598
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:53,579
minds were being blown at seeing for

599
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,649
example hey this room is 75 and oh look

600
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,869
this you know this this piece of metal

601
00:22:55,648 --> 00:23:00,000
or whatever is is you know 102 or

602
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:02,519
something and something in these huge

603
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,980
swings and and and those of us who are

604
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,778
watching we're watching you blow your

605
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,788
own mind while you were blowing our

606
00:23:06,778 --> 00:23:12,119
minds and then from that on forward you

607
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:16,769
are all about the the diffuser film and

608
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:19,709
so will the diffuser film solve the

609
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:22,889
problem with the overheating flat

610
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:27,390
surfaces in a greenhouse just like it

611
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:31,230
does solve the problem on the leaf it

612
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:33,210
does help I mean on the leaf actually

613
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:35,610
does the most or the plant because it's

614
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:37,319
made of water it's pooling water from

615
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:40,319
its roots up through its system it's

616
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:42,629
like a radiator almost you know plants

617
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,058
are you know like we pump blood through

618
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:49,080
our veins in our system water is pumping

619
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:51,119
through those plants and so the way I

620
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:54,449
like to look at it is it's easier to

621
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:56,308
cool the plants than it is to cool the

622
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,308
air to do the same thing and so the

623
00:23:56,308 --> 00:24:01,019
surfaces actually aren't as easy to cool

624
00:23:59,308 --> 00:24:03,269
like the plants are because they're not

625
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:04,980
made of water but what happens is is

626
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:06,720
people use the wrong colors in the

627
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,669
greenhouse and so the other thing I

628
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,269
learned with that infrared thermometer

629
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:15,299
the laser shooter deal is that you know

630
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:16,950
black surfaces and darker surfaces will

631
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:20,069
heat up more than lighter colored

632
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:22,288
surfaces and it's really easy to go to

633
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:24,480
the gardening store and grab some ground

634
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:27,058
cover that's on the shelves at Home

635
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,419
Depot or you know wherever and it's

636
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:31,578
usually black a weed block

637
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:33,739
and most of the containers that we grow

638
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:36,618
in you know historically you have always

639
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:40,759
been black I know that now we're into

640
00:24:36,618 --> 00:24:43,398
the new era with the the the reusable

641
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:45,979
grow bags and in the soft containers you

642
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:48,048
know things the fabric pots and things

643
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:50,899
in that now they're making those in tan

644
00:24:48,048 --> 00:24:52,608
colors and white colors because what I

645
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:54,858
found out over the course of time is

646
00:24:52,608 --> 00:24:57,108
that black stores energy it doesn't just

647
00:24:54,858 --> 00:25:00,378
generate it or attract it it actually

648
00:24:57,108 --> 00:25:01,848
will store it and so what what that

649
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:03,858
means is when it gets cool at nighttime

650
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:06,138
you can touch the ground cover or the

651
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:09,199
grow bags and you can still feel the

652
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:11,118
heat and so that's not a good thing when

653
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,729
we're you know using those containers

654
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:16,578
out in the hot Sun whether we're outdoor

655
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:20,328
or in a greenhouse though that surface

656
00:25:16,578 --> 00:25:22,519
is gonna greatly increase compared to

657
00:25:20,328 --> 00:25:24,168
tan or white and so same with the ground

658
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:25,608
cover we see a lot of people using the

659
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:27,649
white ground cover that's one of the

660
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:29,569
things that you know I was it was really

661
00:25:27,648 --> 00:25:32,148
important to me to find white ground

662
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:35,838
cover because the black just wasn't an

663
00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:37,368
option and you know I tried to coin two

664
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:39,739
different modes though there's winter

665
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:41,718
mode and summer mode so those of you

666
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:44,389
that are using greenhouses in the winter

667
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:46,700
time and you should be yeah you can

668
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:49,038
switch to the darker colors to encourage

669
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,838
more free heat in the wintertime you

670
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,700
know it's not gonna make a lot and it's

671
00:25:50,838 --> 00:25:54,348
not gonna save the garden so to speak

672
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,649
but like I always say every degree

673
00:25:54,348 --> 00:26:00,648
counts and if we can create another

674
00:25:57,648 --> 00:26:03,588
degree or two for free or easy or we can

675
00:26:00,648 --> 00:26:05,808
decrease another degree or two for free

676
00:26:03,588 --> 00:26:07,999
by using these colors in conjunction

677
00:26:05,808 --> 00:26:09,648
with the right season then we're

678
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:11,828
actually trying to do our best in

679
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:14,689
practices and support of the plant

680
00:26:11,828 --> 00:26:17,088
because again everybody's in a lot of

681
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:19,759
cases battling bugs and battling things

682
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:22,519
but also the battle for this heat you

683
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,429
know battling the heat is another you

684
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:27,950
know it's just war out there sometimes

685
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:29,869
people and it doesn't have to be that

686
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,808
way it doesn't at all I mean these are

687
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:35,238
simple methods that work really well we

688
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:38,808
you know try didn't tested it over the

689
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:41,328
course of many years and so I see a lot

690
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:43,220
of benefit in people using these things

691
00:26:41,328 --> 00:26:47,538
and you can get not just

692
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:49,450
a diffused poly woven films or poly

693
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:51,349
woven plastics you can get diffused

694
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:54,529
polycarbonates you can get diffused

695
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:56,599
glass now so it's not you know it's not

696
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:58,399
that you can't you got to get the cheap

697
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:59,750
stuff or you got to get the films and

698
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,280
somebody goes why use the rigid

699
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,859
polycarbonate sand that wouldn't work

700
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,019
for me you can get it diffused whatever

701
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:08,359
you just have to go around and talk to

702
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:10,339
the right people and understand the

703
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:13,490
product but again most greenhouse

704
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:15,168
companies for the most part didn't get

705
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:17,900
into cannabis they've been a greenhouse

706
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:21,080
company for already a long time and so

707
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:23,390
all of their knowledge in information in

708
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:25,038
their you know their business is set

709
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:27,679
around creating a greenhouse that's

710
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,150
optimal for wintertime and then you have

711
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,470
cannabis growers that show up and go

712
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,970
well I'm going to use it primarily in

713
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:37,069
the summertime and they go oh okay yeah

714
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:39,048
you know use a wet wall or something and

715
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:40,668
those don't work everywhere one of the

716
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:42,379
things that I find interesting is how

717
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:44,299
you know you mentioned your summer mode

718
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:47,360
and your winter mode that you coined and

719
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:50,869
that you know some folks when they're

720
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:53,209
thinking about keeping prices or costs

721
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:56,178
down they don't like the idea of

722
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:58,759
swapping out their their ground cover

723
00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:01,490
from black to white or swapping out

724
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:03,650
their fabric pots and they're like oh

725
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,419
well that's just wasting money the thing

726
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,490
is though it's not like the old days

727
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:09,530
when when people would have four or five

728
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,538
grow locations and two or three would

729
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:13,879
get busted leaving you with two or three

730
00:28:11,538 --> 00:28:16,970
and and so you had to you had to make

731
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,100
everything severable right you know

732
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:21,740
nowadays we're talking about legal grows

733
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:24,740
that are scaled for commercial

734
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,900
production and that difference of one or

735
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,058
two degrees could be a huge difference

736
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,830
being on where you live because if you

737
00:28:29,058 --> 00:28:32,899
live somewhere that's hot as hell and

738
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:34,788
you're trying to bring down the

739
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,740
temperature those two degrees well that

740
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:37,970
you're gonna spend way more on air

741
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,788
conditioning that you're gonna then

742
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:43,100
you're gonna pay on swapping out some of

743
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:44,419
these seasonal parts right and the same

744
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:46,969
thing the difference if you're trying to

745
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:48,830
increase your temperature in a cool area

746
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,089
well switching everything to black is

747
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:52,129
going to help you there I think that

748
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:53,669
people are still getting used to the

749
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:57,420
ideas that

750
00:28:53,670 --> 00:29:01,740
at scale even a degree or two is worth a

751
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:03,900
lot of money it's it's huge it really is

752
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,450
and I people are starting to wrap that

753
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:09,900
around their minds right now because you

754
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,910
know whatever we can do in in some cases

755
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,640
let's say for free you know if you

756
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:16,170
already have the containers and the two

757
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,530
things you're just swapping them out

758
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:21,150
like people are already used to

759
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:22,920
historically buying new stuff every year

760
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,450
you know people throw away their def

761
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,420
tarps and get a new one

762
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:30,029
throw out their soil get new soil like

763
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,500
all these things are kind of over with

764
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:33,660
people are trying to figure out how to

765
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,119
save their soil people are you know

766
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:38,759
making use of you know refurbishing

767
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:40,919
things and I don't mean you know just

768
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:42,480
the craft growers I mean people all the

769
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,190
way up to the acre a couple acre

770
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,079
greenhouses that are in the Santa

771
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,059
Barbara County Monterey County and

772
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,829
things like that it's like we need to

773
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:53,190
make do with what we got and make it

774
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:54,539
work and try to make you know a business

775
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,370
out of this because one of the other

776
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:58,859
things I see in the greenhouse rescue

777
00:29:56,369 --> 00:30:00,989
side of it is is people spending way too

778
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:03,389
much money fixing something up that they

779
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,910
could have just gone in and planted and

780
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,370
made a couple rounds out of it and then

781
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:10,230
use some of that money to to fix things

782
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:12,119
up yeah totally you can prove their

783
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,829
bread prove that their systems are

784
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:16,649
working before they go spending even

785
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:18,269
more money totally well I mean you don't

786
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,490
have to have a state of the art facility

787
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:23,400
to grow some some dank cannabis you just

788
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:25,049
got to go grow it really and so even if

789
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,720
you have a dilapidated piece-of-shit

790
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:31,259
wooden greenhouse from the cut flower

791
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:34,019
era in Santa Barbara or carpenter or in

792
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:36,569
Monterey County I mean I see a lot of

793
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:38,400
people go way over and above fixing

794
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:40,079
these things up where if it was me I'd

795
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,280
put in some hoops with the delet you

796
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,009
know with the roofs caving in and

797
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:49,049
everything and just pull some tarps like

798
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:50,819
you know basically all real yeah and

799
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:52,559
then they go fix all these things up and

800
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:54,750
spend so much countless money and

801
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,889
there's no I don't know where people get

802
00:30:54,750 --> 00:31:00,720
their their metric for saying okay this

803
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:03,840
is what we got to do or we got to fix it

804
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,279
up to this point like they just go until

805
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,139
they run out of money and then they have

806
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,720
to pack it up and another cop

807
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,880
he moves into that same space and they

808
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,410
try a shot at it and and a lot of times

809
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,330
these people don't grow anything they

810
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:17,310
keep fixing and fixing and fixing until

811
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:19,799
they run out of money and it's just like

812
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:22,409
I do the opposite I'd be growing growing

813
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:23,369
growing and then fix [ __ ] up later there

814
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:26,820
you go there you go that way you're

815
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:28,529
making money as you go so so um so after

816
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:30,329
the break we're gonna go ahead and talk

817
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:31,769
about some more issues like pests and

818
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:33,990
mold but I wanted to get heat out of the

819
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:35,789
way because that's like clearly the big

820
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,170
gorilla in the room so we're gonna go

821
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:39,180
ahead and take our first short back

822
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,920
short break and be right back you're

823
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,110
listening to shaping fire my guest today

824
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,710

agriculture are surging in popularity

828
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:54,569
and to implement these biological

829
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,669
solutions real science education is

830
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:58,349
vital if you are interested in all

831
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,900
things probiotic growing you will

832
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:02,730

just beginner stuff like you get at most

872
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,500
conventions this is an intensive for

873
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,890
people like us who totally nerd out on

874

regenerative organic cannabis calm

876
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:37,149
that's regenerative organic cannabis

879
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,000
cut through all the misinformation out

880
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:46,630
there and don't miss this opportunity to

881
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,519
learn real soil science as a listener of

882
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:50,260
shaping fire you already understand the

883
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:52,690
importance of living soil when growing

884
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:54,759
cannabis when you have active microbe

885
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:56,920
communities in your substrate you go way

886
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:59,470
beyond simply fertilizing with nitrogen

887
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,120
phosphorus and potassium having active

888
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,009
microorganisms in your substrate

889
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,869
supports vigorous plant growth

890
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:07,259
throughout the plants root zone making

891
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:09,940
for higher yields and thriving flowers

892
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:12,489
mammoth pea is the first organically

893
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,898
derived microbial inoculant that focuses

894
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:16,539
on your plants nutrient cycling

895
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:18,279
processes to release soil phosphorus and

896
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:20,559
other micronutrients from they're bound

897
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,169
forms making them more available to the

898
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,820
plant increased levels of phosphorus

899
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:26,679
will also keep internode shorter and

900
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,840
focus your plants energy on bud

901
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,909
production not only that but the

902
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,929
microbes act as a defense shield for the

903
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:33,970
plants rhizosphere

904
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:36,490
by out competing potentially harmful

905
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:38,378
pathogenic microbes pretty cool right

906
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:40,509
mammoth pee not only unlocks the

907
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:43,418
nutrients in your soil but it also helps

908
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,770
protect your plant from disease mammoth

909
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:47,980
Peas beneficial bacteria

910
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:50,579
act like micro bio reactors continually

911
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:52,750
producing enzymes that release nutrients

912
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:54,819
mammoth pee was developed at a u.s.

913
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,769
university has been extensively tested

914
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:59,170
by Colorado growers and independent

915
00:34:56,769 --> 00:35:02,259
laboratories mammoth pee is proven to

916
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:03,730
increase growth and enhance blooming one

917
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,530
of the great things about supplementing

918
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,389
with microorganisms is that they won't

919
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:09,730
compete with whatever fertilizer program

920
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:11,559
you're already running simply dose on

921
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,900
top of your fertilizer schedule for

922
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:15,489
increased benefits to learn more and to

923
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:19,599
find out where you can buy mammoth pee

924
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:22,509

thriving cannabis mammoth pee welcome

928
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:31,240
back you are listening to shaping fire

929
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,070
I'm your host Shango losan our guest

930
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:33,799
this week is cannabis greenhouse expert

931
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:36,440
air

932
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,380
branstad from greenhouse advisory group

933
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,210
so Eric during the first set we hit heat

934
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,400
really hard because there is no doubt

935
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,019
that seems to be the the the gorilla in

936
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,780
the room that everybody is dealing with

937
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:49,789
but I know that you talk a lot with your

938
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,680
clients about pests right because as you

939
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:53,630
talked about during the first set you

940
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,909
know if you want to do some passive

941
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:57,710
ventilation and open the damn windows a

942
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:58,969
lot of people are like no we don't want

943
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,190
to do that because we need to have a

944
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:03,529
closed sterile environment because we

945
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:05,599
don't want to attract pests also we've

946
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,550
got the opposite problem where if you

947
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,440
already have say for example a two spot

948
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,840
spider mite in the greenhouse and the

949
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,849
temperatures go up well suddenly now

950
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,860
you've created this awesome breeding

951
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:18,589
ground for the little bastards so you

952
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:20,660
know when it comes to pests what kind of

953
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:24,140
advice do you give your clients on how

954
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:26,929
best to manage and even maybe a design

955
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:28,609
build their greenhouses that's a good

956
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:30,710
question and I actually have been

957
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:33,470
working on in the last month on this

958
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:36,110
pretty heavily you know with myself and

959
00:36:33,469 --> 00:36:38,869
a couple other people because I'm

960
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,610
bouncing some ideas off of them to get

961
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:43,219
where I'm trying to go with that but

962
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:45,559
basically yeah in a nutshell everybody

963
00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:48,439
comes across pests or our deals with

964
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:51,739
pests I mean people are getting you know

965
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,840
pests or spider mites at minimum from

966
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:57,739
the nursery that they get their clones

967
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:59,630
from and you know when it when I we

968
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:02,000
talked about sealed environments versus

969
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:06,860
passive and things like that I've been

970
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,500
to many many sealed secure tight ship

971
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:11,480
indoor rooms that don't take any air

972
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,460
from outside unless it's filtered and

973
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,550
all these crazy things and and they deal

974
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:19,039
with pests too so I mean pests can get

975
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:22,220
wherever they want to go in the long run

976
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:24,559
and the way I look at it is that pests

977
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:27,319
are looking for invitations to a party

978
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:29,239
they're not just flying by going oh this

979
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,860
is drinking and I'm gonna land here and

980
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:32,959
this is the plant you know I'm a set up

981
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:37,400
shop they're asked to actually be

982
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:41,269
conditions that hosts that specific bug

983
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:43,460
or pathogen and so you know yeah molds

984
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:45,559
can be flying around in the room and or

985
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,269
in the air or in the world for that

986
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:49,578
matter but they don't necessarily

987
00:37:47,268 --> 00:37:51,318
just go get on a cannabis plant because

988
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:54,019
it's cannabis and it happens to be there

989
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:56,119
it's a little bit more detailed than

990
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:59,629
that and two things that we got to pay

991
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,759
attention to are the environments and

992
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:04,099
why I say to there's two environments to

993
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:06,798
look at there's the environment up above

994
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:08,599
which is the the air and the you know

995
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:11,298
like we talked about the temperature and

996
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:13,429
humidity and things like that and then

997
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:15,798
there's also the environment underground

998
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:18,889
and so you know that's not necessarily

999
00:38:15,798 --> 00:38:21,559
my specialty but I have been working

1000
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:23,688
more and more with soil people because

1001
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:25,669
I'm seeing the fact that we can fix the

1002
00:38:23,688 --> 00:38:27,978
environment all we want but if people

1003
00:38:25,668 --> 00:38:29,898
actually have you know the up above

1004
00:38:27,978 --> 00:38:31,398
environment we can fix that all we want

1005
00:38:29,898 --> 00:38:34,248
and get the air movement and get things

1006
00:38:31,398 --> 00:38:37,938
right take the hostility away but if we

1007
00:38:34,248 --> 00:38:39,889
have really bad soil conditions whatever

1008
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:43,608
environment I helped fix isn't gonna

1009
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:45,168
change the problem and so it's kind of a

1010
00:38:43,608 --> 00:38:47,088
two part thing and that's why with the

1011
00:38:45,168 --> 00:38:48,408
green house advisory group I'm kind of

1012
00:38:47,088 --> 00:38:51,828
pulling together a few of these

1013
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:54,588
different resources or professionals in

1014
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:58,939
these areas because it's it's a it's

1015
00:38:54,588 --> 00:39:00,708
kind of a it's I can't just do it by

1016
00:38:58,938 --> 00:39:02,239
myself I don't know enough to do it all

1017
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:04,428
by myself it almost sounds like

1018
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,599
biodynamic growing you know where you

1019
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:09,289
are considerate you're you're thinking

1020
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,269
about nature holistically outdoors with

1021
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:13,639
biodynamic growing but you're all like

1022
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:16,218
no we need to take that same holistic

1023
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:19,369
mindset and bring it into the greenhouse

1024
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:22,039
and and it's the it's the soil and it's

1025
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:23,719
the diffusion film on the roof and it's

1026
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:26,359
whether what kind of glass were choosing

1027
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:28,298
is a whole system that works together so

1028
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:31,639
you down will better plan it in advance

1029
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:34,219
you've got to and and we can't just go

1030
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:36,259
to one greenhouse company or another and

1031
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:39,108
let them necessarily give us the advice

1032
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:40,789
if they haven't had any cannabis

1033
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:43,130
background behind them and if they do

1034
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:45,679
have cannabis background it's good to

1035
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:48,259
ask where it's from and what I mean by

1036
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:51,469
that is that cannabis went legal in

1037
00:39:48,259 --> 00:39:54,438
Colorado before everybody else for the

1038
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:56,509
you know for the most part as far as

1039
00:39:54,438 --> 00:40:01,129
recreational and so what that meant was

1040
00:39:56,509 --> 00:40:03,170
an explosion of greenhouses in Pueblo

1041
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:06,230
and Pueblo happens to be the high desert

1042
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:08,269
of of Colorado it's it's you know it's

1043
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:12,740
it's high elevations there's not a lot

1044
00:40:08,269 --> 00:40:14,719
growing out there and they made it okay

1045
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:16,729
for cannabis and so what happened was is

1046
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:20,329
there's a local greenhouse company in

1047
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:22,099
Colorado of a very reputable one and so

1048
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:23,989
a lot of people naturally wanted to buy

1049
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:26,210
local you know I'm like Colorado

1050
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:28,608
cannabis business i'ma buy greenhouses

1051
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:31,099
from this Colorado cannabis greenhouse

1052
00:40:28,608 --> 00:40:34,159
company and so that greenhouse company

1053
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:36,920
did sell a lot of greenhouses to the

1054
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:40,250
cannabis space in Pueblo Colorado but

1055
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:43,039
that same the data that they created

1056
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:44,630
even out of those greenhouses isn't the

1057
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,570
same that's gonna be produced out of a

1058
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:50,599
greenhouse in Washington or Oregon for

1059
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:52,490
that matter even upstate New York and so

1060
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:57,349
that greenhouse company went around

1061
00:40:52,489 --> 00:41:00,289
applying the same you know designs to

1062
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:02,450
greenhouses in other states than in the

1063
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:05,150
high desert of Pueblo Colorado and then

1064
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:07,730
we started seeing increased hostility

1065
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:10,130
and failure rates associated with that

1066
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:12,858
because it's not just you know do what

1067
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:15,588
we do in Pueblo over here in in upstate

1068
00:41:12,858 --> 00:41:18,500
New York or you know out in the islands

1069
00:41:15,588 --> 00:41:20,630
of Washington like you guys are you just

1070
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,630
can't do the same thing the high deserts

1071
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:25,970
are really hot and dry as a bone so you

1072
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,309
can actually use fogging systems and wet

1073
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:30,799
walls and things to you know do the

1074
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:32,690
things that I normally don't spend a lot

1075
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,890
of time talking about because most of

1076
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,358
the people that I've dealt with in

1077
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:37,848
cannabis have always come from this

1078
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,769
already kind of humid area where it gets

1079
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:42,019
hot like you know in these forests and

1080
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:44,150
in places in the you know and it does

1081
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:47,509
get hot and dry don't get me wrong for

1082
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:49,309
maybe a month or so but like I said

1083
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,990
there's still ways to deal with all that

1084
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:53,329
and not just try to get this push button

1085
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:56,449
okay I'm gonna set my parameters like an

1086
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:59,358
indoor room and and here we go and so

1087
00:41:56,449 --> 00:42:01,279
the bugs really enjoy these hot hostel

1088
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:04,098
in areas so that some of the pathogens

1089
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,619
and they also love it underground when

1090
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:08,750
people are you know throwing all these

1091
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:11,030
things into the soil there's also people

1092
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:13,590
that are fighting rude aphids so they

1093
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:15,870
dump all this other you know

1094
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:17,240
rude a foodstuff into the soil that

1095
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:20,219
actually disrupts the other

1096
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:22,799
microorganisms and so you know it's just

1097
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:24,569
kind of a you know a lot of people

1098
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,210
chasing the tail trying to fix one

1099
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:29,130
problem creating another and a lot of

1100
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:31,110
times like I said we got to back up and

1101
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,630
really you know figure out our

1102
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:35,430
environments and figure out underground

1103
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:37,980
environments what's going on and try to

1104
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:40,949
get these two things in harmony so that

1105
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:43,769
we can actually grow stuff that isn't

1106
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:46,349
susceptible or sending out vectors for

1107
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:48,389
pests and disease I always call it

1108
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:49,980
sending out invitations to the party you

1109
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:52,500
know what I mean like you know cannabis

1110
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:56,550
grows you can have you know plants will

1111
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:58,860
send out messages to let bugs and

1112
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:00,900
pathogens know that you know there is a

1113
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:03,090
party going on and we're open for

1114
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,430
business so so how about when we were

1115
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,870
talking about ventilation earlier yeah

1116
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:08,849
you were talking about the folks who

1117
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:11,309
were concerned about opening the windows

1118
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:13,409
because they open the window for pests

1119
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:14,849
and you know I hear that all the time so

1120
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:17,489
what do you say to those people do you

1121
00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:20,429
say listen even the sterile grows have

1122
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:21,959
got you know spider mites so don't worry

1123
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:23,759
about them coming in the window it's

1124
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,920
more important to get the the the

1125
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,780
ventilation or you know what do you

1126
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,070
actually tell your clients when when

1127
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,010
they're trying to make that decision to

1128
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:34,920
open the window or not well I actually

1129
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:37,620
have pictures and stuff that shows the

1130
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,809
differences of plants being overheated

1131
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:42,449
and going through nutria lockout versus

1132
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:44,340
ones next to it in a in a diffused

1133
00:43:42,449 --> 00:43:46,529
I've got people that have pictures that

1134
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,420
have you know plants that are covered in

1135
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:50,580
spider mites next to plants that are

1136
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,740
completely healthy that you know don't

1137
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:54,750
have any spider mites you know it's

1138
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:57,809
really hard to get across that message

1139
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:59,250
but most people that I talk to are have

1140
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:00,929
heard some of this before you know the

1141
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,579
healthier the plant the more resistant

1142
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:04,710
it is to bugs and disease I mean that's

1143
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:06,690
a common statement in a lot of

1144
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:09,090
horticulture and not just cannabis and

1145
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:11,880
it goes the same with people you know if

1146
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:14,100
we're healthy we typically can fight off

1147
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,320
sicknesses and diseases easier than

1148
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:19,230
people that you know choose did not be

1149
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,820
healthy and so you know it kind of goes

1150
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:22,230
back to the trade shows and the things

1151
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,640
where you and I've met over the course

1152
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,710
of the years if you look at the trade

1153
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:26,849
shows yeah they're turning real techy

1154
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:29,789
right now for just

1155
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:31,349
Spencer ease and track and trace and you

1156
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:33,630
know banking and all that kind of stuff

1157
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:36,269
but historically they've always had a

1158
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:39,119
lot of the band-aids like how to clean

1159
00:44:36,269 --> 00:44:41,789
the air the new spray for this disease

1160
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,480
the new you know route drench to kill

1161
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:48,389
this disease the new purifier to fight

1162
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,670
this disease everything is this battle

1163
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:53,400
you know band-aid thing and nobody's

1164
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:56,250
really looking back and saying okay how

1165
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,750
can we change the band-aid syndrome and

1166
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,360
get to the health of things you know

1167
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:03,030
it's almost like Big Pharma some of us

1168
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,470
choose to try to eat organic food and

1169
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,810
get healthy and other people choose to

1170
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:09,599
go to the doctor and get a pill yeah you

1171
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:12,000
know and so you don't like it go ahead a

1172
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,619
holistic way yeah and you know I got to

1173
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,179
tell you you know I've been interviewed

1174
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:16,469
a few a handful of times and you and I

1175
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,819
are personal friends and I've talked to

1176
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:20,219
you and I've never heard you talk this

1177
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:22,289
much about soil science right you know

1178
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:25,109
it's like like like and and you know

1179
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:27,570
I've really gotten into soil and and KNF

1180
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:30,930
Korean natural farming and you know this

1181
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:34,260
idea that that's that sick plants put

1182
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:36,629
out that invitation for bugs and it's

1183
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:38,850
not whether or not you have the window

1184
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:41,280
open at all because if you got healthy

1185
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:43,889
plants even if the windows open it's not

1186
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,840
going to create a home for bugs because

1187
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:48,179
there's no invitation you know that's

1188
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:51,110
that's some radical stuff right cuz I've

1189
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:54,509
heard you talk about the pest solutions

1190
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:56,220
via you know mechanization of the

1191
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:58,230
greenhouse or different things that you

1192
00:45:56,219 --> 00:45:59,909
could do with the building but I can I

1193
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:01,920
can feel that you've moved beyond that

1194
00:45:59,909 --> 00:46:04,289
you're like listen the solution to the

1195
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,420
pests is not in the greenhouse design

1196
00:46:04,289 --> 00:46:08,250
necessarily it's actually in the

1197
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,320
holistic design of the entire greenhouse

1198
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:13,289
and so you better damn well talk to your

1199
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:15,059
soil expert exactly and what's happening

1200
00:46:13,289 --> 00:46:18,150
though and I found out through working

1201
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:20,549
with you know a person in particular my

1202
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:23,910
buddy Scott is that you know he found

1203
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:25,890
anomalies in greenhouses in in even

1204
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:27,690
indoor rooms that exchange air kind of

1205
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:30,000
like greenhouses and I started seeing

1206
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,920
some of the same things but I didn't

1207
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,070
really know what I was seeing I knew

1208
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,110
that I was kind of I guess visualizing

1209
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,760
this happening but I wasn't I didn't I

1210
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:40,460
didn't have the microscope and the data

1211
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,130
to actually go oh my god

1212
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:45,650
this is you know solid we figured it out

1213
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:48,230
you know this is it type of type of

1214
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:50,059
attitude and so my confidence level in

1215
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:51,530
some ways has gone up to talk about this

1216
00:46:50,059 --> 00:46:53,210
stuff because I found that these

1217
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:55,730
correlations or these things that were

1218
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:59,710
you know at the tip of my fingers are

1219
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:02,329
actually you know in full grasp now and

1220
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:04,099
what that's what's happening is that

1221
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:06,409
yeah you can create conditions in the

1222
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:09,980
greenhouse that changed the biology in

1223
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:11,989
the soil so a new tool that I carry

1224
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:14,000
around besides my infrared thermometer

1225
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:16,338
is I like to carry around a six-inch

1226
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,829
soil probe for checking the soil

1227
00:47:16,338 --> 00:47:20,900
temperature and a lot of times we find

1228
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:24,440
that the soil temperatures increase or

1229
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:26,750
decrease and sometimes a higher soil

1230
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,000
temperature will create more of a

1231
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:30,889
hostile environment for pathogens bugs

1232
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,530
and things to grow or to help create

1233
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:35,569
these vectors like I talked about and so

1234
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:37,760
you know thrips a lot of people have a

1235
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:41,119
problem with drips and drips like to lay

1236
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,680
their eggs where the the babies when

1237
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,108
they hatch have something to eat and

1238
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:47,779
what do they eat the bacteria and so

1239
00:47:45,108 --> 00:47:50,989
when we have an over bacterial frenzy or

1240
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:53,540
a high nitrogen fixed soil we easily get

1241
00:47:50,989 --> 00:47:55,219
the thrips and so you know looking at

1242
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:57,079
all these things you know we can make

1243
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:59,358
slight changes and some of those changes

1244
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:01,219
have to do with the air movement if we

1245
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:03,079
have a sealed greenhouse that's doing

1246
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:04,579
mechanical ventilation and we have air

1247
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:06,739
coming in at one it into the greenhouse

1248
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:08,480
that's cooler than the air going out

1249
00:48:06,739 --> 00:48:10,489
because again you got to remember

1250
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,409
national greenhouse manufacturers

1251
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:14,689
Association standards so you gotta have

1252
00:48:12,409 --> 00:48:17,149
one air exchange per minute in a

1253
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:19,608
greenhouse so that's a ton of air moving

1254
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:22,400
in and moving out of a greenhouse ya

1255
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:25,338
know what that's crazy one exchange a

1256
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,260
minute yes so if you think about that

1257
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:29,838
that's a standard that's recommended

1258
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:32,089
it's not for cannabis that's for the

1259
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:33,949
greenhouse world and so we're moving a

1260
00:48:32,088 --> 00:48:36,349
high volume of air and the reason is is

1261
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:39,169
because as the air travels through the

1262
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:41,630
greenhouse it heats up and so when you

1263
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:44,119
think about a long long greenhouse we

1264
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:47,358
have air coming in at one in heating up

1265
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:49,849
and exiting a different temperature than

1266
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:51,230
when it came in so I've had reports of

1267
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:53,180
people saying that they had air

1268
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,619
temperatures coming in the greenhouse at

1269
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:57,730
70

1270
00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:59,890
five degrees and exiting at 130 Wow all

1271
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:02,528
in say that that air is getting heated

1272
00:48:59,889 --> 00:49:04,358
up in under a minute under a minute and

1273
00:49:02,528 --> 00:49:06,278
in some cases if people don't have their

1274
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:08,380
calculations right maybe that they're

1275
00:49:06,278 --> 00:49:10,298
not exchanging at one time a minute so

1276
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,539
they do have solar gain in that regard

1277
00:49:10,298 --> 00:49:15,159
so they didn't do their calyx right and

1278
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:15,970
they don't have one air exchange per

1279
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:18,578
minute

1280
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:21,578
maybe the greenhouse is super long if we

1281
00:49:18,579 --> 00:49:23,710
go over 144 feet we really see a problem

1282
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:26,349
with air having a chance to heat up

1283
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,630
because of those long lengths and the

1284
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:31,119
main thing that you know my buddy Scott

1285
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:32,588
pointed out was that you know I saw this

1286
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,640
too in a couple of the classes I was

1287
00:49:32,588 --> 00:49:38,558
teaching at Oaksterdam that the the

1288
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,210
plants at one end of the greenhouse or

1289
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,359
the other would be more healthy than the

1290
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:45,338
the the rest of the whole run and so

1291
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:47,679
what I found in a couple classes is with

1292
00:49:45,338 --> 00:49:50,739
the plants closest to the entry point of

1293
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:52,268
that cooler fresher air weren't doing

1294
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:54,338
actually as good as the plants at the

1295
00:49:52,268 --> 00:49:56,709
other end where the 130 air degree

1296
00:49:54,338 --> 00:49:59,588
degree air was exiting and why is

1297
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:02,048
because they were over watering and so

1298
00:49:59,588 --> 00:50:05,078
plants closer to that cool intake air

1299
00:50:02,048 --> 00:50:07,630
don't use as much water as the plants at

1300
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:10,180
the other end where the heat is and so

1301
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:12,338
you might think the opposite and say oh

1302
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:14,078
the plants at the end where the cooler

1303
00:50:12,338 --> 00:50:15,369
air would be the healthier ones versus

1304
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,680
the one at the other end and it's the

1305
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:20,259
opposite because the soil is able to dry

1306
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:22,509
out and those plants even though it's

1307
00:50:20,259 --> 00:50:25,329
warmer air at that in the the soil dries

1308
00:50:22,509 --> 00:50:26,858
out faster because the other end of the

1309
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:30,369
where the air is coming in the soils

1310
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:33,460
waterlogged using any water so the

1311
00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:36,400
biology is is is it's turning into water

1312
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:39,849
molds and generating but only but only

1313
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,009
at the one end well actually 90 percent

1314
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:43,599
of the greenhouse they overwater the

1315
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:45,099
whole green house and the plants that

1316
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,890
did the best where where it was the air

1317
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:49,480
was exiting so like you know a third of

1318
00:50:47,889 --> 00:50:51,608
the greenhouse was doing good at the

1319
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,380
other end where it was mostly I would

1320
00:50:51,608 --> 00:50:54,909
think a little bit hostile but when you

1321
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,410
look at the leaf surface temperature

1322
00:50:54,909 --> 00:50:59,048
they were moving so much air through

1323
00:50:56,409 --> 00:51:00,518
there and plants are made of water it's

1324
00:50:59,048 --> 00:51:02,199
just like me and you if we stand in

1325
00:51:00,518 --> 00:51:04,778
front of a fan when I'm hot and sweaty

1326
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:07,509
or if I stand in a cool breeze provided

1327
00:51:04,778 --> 00:51:10,150
by Mother Nature my body starts to cool

1328
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:12,070
down the sweat starts to dry and you

1329
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:14,380
know I'm evaporative that way and so

1330
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:16,410
plants are the same way and so even

1331
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,700
though the air temp might have been 130

1332
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:21,039
exiting that doesn't mean the leaf

1333
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:22,869
surface temperature was that high and so

1334
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:26,050
therefore that plant was actually doing

1335
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:28,119
pretty dang good considering what it was

1336
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:30,789
going through and and the fact that the

1337
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:33,179
rest of its family in that bed was being

1338
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:35,170
over watered before we go on to our next

1339
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:37,119
greenhouse challenge you've mentioned

1340
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:39,130
Scott like three times let's go ahead

1341
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,230
and plug Scott cuz I don't I don't know

1342
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:43,119
I don't personally know Scott but I'm

1343
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:45,639
assuming we're talking about Scott

1344
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:48,069
logroño 'la on Instagram I don't

1345
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:49,929
actually know what his real last name is

1346
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:52,210
but but I follow him and I think he

1347
00:51:49,929 --> 00:51:53,769
follows me but but go ahead and go ahead

1348
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:55,420
and plug him as sex so that so that

1349
00:51:53,769 --> 00:51:58,509
people who are into soil can be start

1350
00:51:55,420 --> 00:52:01,780
following him yeah so um Scott Tola

1351
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:03,820
granola is is how you say it or how you

1352
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:05,620
look it up on Instagram I mean he has a

1353
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:07,780
business one but he doesn't use it very

1354
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:11,880
often and his companies called pressive

1355
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:14,260
soil services and so Scott Oleg Rinella

1356
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,860
happens to be somebody that called me

1357
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:20,470
years ago when I was working answering

1358
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:23,860
phones at the last job I had and so he

1359
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:25,209
called me gosh I want to say like 2013

1360
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:27,180
or something like that and he was

1361
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:30,429
actually calling me to inquire about

1362
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:31,809
dragonfly Earth medicine and you know he

1363
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:34,359
was actually asking me some questions

1364
00:52:31,809 --> 00:52:36,549
about soil and some things and I had

1365
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:40,090
done some work with one of a laningham

1366
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:41,769
Siddhas during that time on a walnut

1367
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,930
orchard and my family's down near

1368
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:46,809
Stockton and so we were trying to add

1369
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:48,789
biology to an organic my dad turned

1370
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:51,369
organic all of a sudden on one of his

1371
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:54,190
forty acre farms and so we wanted to go

1372
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:58,210
in and add some biology after its many

1373
00:52:54,190 --> 00:53:00,309
years of roundup use so I was involved

1374
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:02,409
in doing that and when I was out there

1375
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:03,759
we were spraying compost tea on

1376
00:53:02,409 --> 00:53:05,619
everything when it really needed to be

1377
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,690
watered in and so when Scott called me

1378
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:09,579
he talked about sprang compost tea on an

1379
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:12,130
alfalfa field or something like that and

1380
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:13,719
I said no you gotta water it in and you

1381
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,039
know use the dragonfly that way or

1382
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:18,189
whatever and then I mentioned a

1383
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:19,719
Laningham name and he followed her and

1384
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:20,980
next thing you know he took all of her

1385
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:22,779
courses

1386
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:25,059
done all the stuff and he became one of

1387
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:27,369
her advisors and she has like eleven

1388
00:53:25,059 --> 00:53:30,670
people that have taken the full course

1389
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:32,829
and get the advisor status or whatever

1390
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:35,590
but he's the only one that did cannabis

1391
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:39,250
out of all those eleven advisors and so

1392
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:42,039
he created data that I believe that you

1393
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:44,590
know blows even Elaine's information

1394
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:46,719
away because she started something that

1395
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:49,119
you know she taught people and he's one

1396
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:52,839
of these prodigy types that took it to

1397
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:54,369
the next level and so I I can't say

1398
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,350
enough good things about the stuff that

1399
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:58,930
he's learned and he's teaching and the

1400
00:53:56,349 --> 00:54:01,179
the information that he has about soil

1401
00:53:58,929 --> 00:54:02,980
pest in cannabis and it's kind of gone

1402
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:04,179
hand in hand with my work because a lot

1403
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:06,789
of the work he's done has been in

1404
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:08,289
greenhouses so then you know here we are

1405
00:54:06,789 --> 00:54:12,039
working together on some of this stuff

1406
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:14,440
and so we are doing a lot of farm rescue

1407
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:18,009
worker greenhouse rescue so to speak

1408
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:20,349
work together coincidentally you know it

1409
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:22,300
wasn't even like it just kind of just

1410
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:24,549
started happening that way right on so

1411
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,470
anyway so so that was actually a little

1412
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:28,450
bunch of really quality name drops in

1413
00:54:26,469 --> 00:54:30,639
one response so so everybody was

1414
00:54:28,449 --> 00:54:33,009
listening you recommended to go follow

1415
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:36,400
Scott on Instagram but also Elaine

1416
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:38,410
Ingham was was named checked and Elaine

1417
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,630
is fantastic and then also you mentioned

1418
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:42,789
Josh and Kelly a dragonfly earth

1419
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:44,500
medicine who are you know kind of heroes

1420
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:46,119
of mine and so if you're not following

1421
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,949
dragonfly Earth mess and it medicine go

1422
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:50,170
check them out as well alright so moving

1423
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:52,750
forward let's talk about inadequate size

1424
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:55,990
man because a lot of people there

1425
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:58,989
they're there they're either moving from

1426
00:54:55,989 --> 00:55:01,269
multiple smaller grows into one finally

1427
00:54:58,989 --> 00:55:03,219
commercial grow or you've got people who

1428
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:05,019
are setting up a commercial grow and

1429
00:55:03,219 --> 00:55:06,939
they've they're you know they're not

1430
00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:08,320
experienced in cannabis and so they

1431
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,990
don't know how to come up with the

1432
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,670
appropriate size to build and so then

1433
00:55:10,989 --> 00:55:15,009
now you've got a company that's trying

1434
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:17,440
to you know make their millions into

1435
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:19,840
small the locations so how do you think

1436
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,880
through that with clients of yours of

1437
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,470
how big they want to go I mean you just

1438
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,980
mentioned a hundred and more than a

1439
00:55:23,469 --> 00:55:28,629
hundred and forty-four feet long and you

1440
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,429
start running into all sorts of airflow

1441
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:32,640
issues there's got to be a short

1442
00:55:30,429 --> 00:55:34,899
checklist of that stuff that you've got

1443
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:36,159
definitely have a checklist I mean the

1444
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,318
main thing is to see what kind of

1445
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:39,788
license people are having because in

1446
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:42,460
California you can get certain

1447
00:55:39,789 --> 00:55:44,589
square-footage licenses and so you know

1448
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:47,199
at first people are going for this size

1449
00:55:44,588 --> 00:55:49,989
license and so based on that size

1450
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:52,838
license they can do X number of square

1451
00:55:49,989 --> 00:55:56,318
feet of flowering and some people are

1452
00:55:52,838 --> 00:55:59,019
also you know now stacking licenses so

1453
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:02,528
it kind of turns into this like you know

1454
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:04,358
let's build it as we go or it you know

1455
00:56:02,528 --> 00:56:06,579
some people just get what they can get

1456
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:08,199
so I mean there are a ton of greenhouses

1457
00:56:06,579 --> 00:56:10,150
that are going up for sale and for lease

1458
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:12,278
and so it's real popular to go find

1459
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:13,930
something it's already built and you

1460
00:56:12,278 --> 00:56:15,429
know fixed it up or do what you want

1461
00:56:13,929 --> 00:56:17,500
with it and then there's also a lot of

1462
00:56:15,429 --> 00:56:19,719
the new construction and so people are

1463
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:22,630
yes having to design their own

1464
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:25,058
greenhouse and so you know designing the

1465
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:26,920
greenhouse in my opinion is definitely

1466
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:29,260
an important part of that and it's not

1467
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,298
just necessarily how many fans and where

1468
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:33,130
we put them and you know the obvious

1469
00:56:31,298 --> 00:56:35,400
calculations and things like that but

1470
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:40,539
it's also the workflow strategies of

1471
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:42,639
being able to have small plants bringing

1472
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:44,920
in you know plants for transplanting

1473
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:47,048
being able to harvest plants processing

1474
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:50,500
all these things have to go on within

1475
00:56:47,048 --> 00:56:52,480
this facility and I feel like a lot of

1476
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,920
that stuff isn't looked at close enough

1477
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,588
and we just look at okay how are we

1478
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,720
gonna grow let's grow this stuff and how

1479
00:56:56,588 --> 00:57:01,659
much can we pump out and we'll try it

1480
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:04,118
over here and trim it over here and it

1481
00:57:01,659 --> 00:57:06,368
causes a lot of cross contamination that

1482
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:09,548
way yeah that makes a lot of sense you

1483
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:11,798
know since um you know because of the

1484
00:57:09,548 --> 00:57:14,079
time of year it is right now you see on

1485
00:57:11,798 --> 00:57:16,480
a lot of people's Instagram feeds folks

1486
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,548
who are outgrowing their hoops right and

1487
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,278
it's it's you know it's sad funny right

1488
00:57:18,548 --> 00:57:23,650
cuz like we would never wish on anybody

1489
00:57:21,278 --> 00:57:25,179
the fact that their plants have grown so

1490
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:27,519
much that they're touching a plastic

1491
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:29,469
which you know touches the condensation

1492
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:31,750
which creates vectors for mold right so

1493
00:57:29,469 --> 00:57:34,058
we all know not to do that but we also

1494
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:36,579
know that if you let your you know if

1495
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:39,579
you set up your depths wrong or or if

1496
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:40,990
your your full term stuff is it moves

1497
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:42,910
too fast

1498
00:57:40,989 --> 00:57:44,288
suddenly you're you've outgrown and so

1499
00:57:42,909 --> 00:57:46,889
you see a lot of people this time of

1500
00:57:44,289 --> 00:57:50,190
year putting like extender

1501
00:57:46,889 --> 00:57:52,049
on the bottom of there they're plastic

1502
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:54,780
right now yeah thank you on the body the

1503
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:57,420
hoops to buy themselves another 18

1504
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:59,400
inches or whatever right and um and you

1505
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,170
know obviously with a professionally

1506
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,990
built greenhouse that's a hell of a lot

1507
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:06,180
more difficult to potentially impossible

1508
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:10,139
are there any tricks of the trade for

1509
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:11,789
for fitting more into a a solid

1510
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:15,989
greenhouse like there is for hoops or

1511
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:17,909
are you just stuck well I mean in some

1512
00:58:15,989 --> 00:58:20,250
cases you know canopy management is

1513
00:58:17,909 --> 00:58:21,569
definitely an art into itself and and

1514
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:23,579
it's something that people are learning

1515
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:26,160
to work on I mean historically when we

1516
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:28,019
had you know legal cannabis in

1517
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:30,119
California anyway it was all plant

1518
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:32,699
counts you know you didn't grow over 99

1519
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:35,579
plants or certain counties let you grow

1520
00:58:32,699 --> 00:58:37,619
25 they kind of you know ran everything

1521
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:39,719
by plant count and so that meant let's

1522
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:42,389
grow the biggest possible plant we can

1523
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:45,929
grow because that's how we're gonna you

1524
00:58:42,389 --> 00:58:48,269
know get all these pounds of herb and so

1525
00:58:45,929 --> 00:58:50,579
with plant counts yeah people were

1526
00:58:48,269 --> 00:58:52,769
pushing limits and growing massive

1527
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:54,779
plants definitely hitting the roof or

1528
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:56,489
taking the cover off you know like

1529
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:58,860
you've probably seen when your travels

1530
00:58:56,489 --> 00:59:01,919
up north some people grow some monster

1531
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:04,470
outdoor plants I mean that you know it's

1532
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,450
pretty pretty impressive to see how big

1533
00:59:04,469 --> 00:59:08,879
some of those outdoor plants can get and

1534
00:59:06,449 --> 00:59:11,129
so you know we've changed the model now

1535
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,380
to square footage licenses in this legal

1536
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:16,110
area and so what happens with that is

1537
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:19,170
that people want to grow more plants but

1538
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:22,500
not quite as big and so we we kind of

1539
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:24,389
have a new learning curve in some cases

1540
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:27,059
you know we're all kind of getting our

1541
00:59:24,389 --> 00:59:29,279
feet wet and growing more plants and you

1542
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:31,349
know being able to scale up like you've

1543
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,810
been talking about to have the veg space

1544
00:59:31,349 --> 00:59:36,389
to be able to put plants into this

1545
00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:37,949
flowering space and so you know I see a

1546
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:39,659
lot of people that yeah take the cover

1547
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:41,549
of their greenhouse off and the plants

1548
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:44,309
go bananas and they end up using the

1549
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:47,370
hoop is as trellis and things like that

1550
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:49,650
and what I look at that as is a lot of

1551
00:59:47,369 --> 00:59:51,719
people didn't want to go greenhouse

1552
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:53,670
because it trapped too much air and they

1553
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:55,500
found that growing outdoor was much

1554
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:57,690
easier they didn't get the bugs they

1555
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:59,130
didn't have the condensation that

1556
00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:00,210
created the mold and all these things

1557
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,160
but nine

1558
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:04,470
out of ten what it was was they were

1559
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:06,598
trapping too much air using too clear of

1560
01:00:04,469 --> 01:00:09,149
a cover and yeah the plants got way too

1561
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:11,880
big for any airflow to happen anyway and

1562
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:14,760
so ripping the cover off alleviated all

1563
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,858
those issues but if we backed up and

1564
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,839
we're able to educate people on the fact

1565
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:20,969
that you know you got to have the

1566
01:00:18,838 --> 01:00:22,440
ventilation sorted out the proper

1567
01:00:20,969 --> 01:00:25,049
greenhouse cover and don't let your

1568
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,700
plants get quite as big you're actually

1569
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:28,470
gonna get better results at the end of

1570
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:30,239
the day and what I mean by better

1571
01:00:28,469 --> 01:00:33,049
results is that we've had a lot of this

1572
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:35,939
stuff tested over the course of time and

1573
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:39,690
what we found is higher cannabinoids and

1574
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:41,490
higher terpene profiles in stuff that's

1575
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:44,639
been supported through these greenhouse

1576
01:00:41,489 --> 01:00:46,500
techniques and compared to outdoor or

1577
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:48,779
indoor and so there's two different labs

1578
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,219
that have been saying this stuff for a

1579
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:53,339
little bit and there's actually a

1580
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:55,319
terpene company that prefers to get

1581
01:00:53,338 --> 01:00:57,389
greenhouse material because they usually

1582
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:59,789
get more Terps out of it than they would

1583
01:00:57,389 --> 01:01:01,980
outdoor or indoor mmm that's really

1584
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:03,659
interesting all right so I've got one

1585
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:05,670
more question for you before we go to

1586
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:08,489
our next commercial and then this is

1587
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:12,119
totally a non sequitur so so I was down

1588
01:01:08,489 --> 01:01:14,279
in Phoenix doing a keynote at an Indo no

1589
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:18,869
it wasn't in no Expo what was it

1590
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:20,970
oh it's imperious Expo easy confusion so

1591
01:01:18,869 --> 01:01:22,769
anyway I was down there for it for to

1592
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:26,368
Phoenix and I'm talking all these folks

1593
01:01:22,769 --> 01:01:27,900
who are doing greenhouses out in the

1594
01:01:26,369 --> 01:01:29,700
desert right and you know like you were

1595
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:31,680
talking about during first set you

1596
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:34,739
wouldn't naturally think of greenhouses

1597
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:36,629
in the desert because it's already hot

1598
01:01:34,739 --> 01:01:38,338
and normally greenhouses were to keep

1599
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:40,829
things warm right to keep the air warm

1600
01:01:38,338 --> 01:01:43,349
and so all these people were talking

1601
01:01:40,829 --> 01:01:44,789
about they're using the greenhouse for

1602
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:46,980
the light but then they're also spending

1603
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:49,380
all this money on air conditioning to

1604
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:50,849
keep it cool and I was on the flight

1605
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:52,829
home and I got to thinking I'm like well

1606
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:55,410
you know if it was me and I was doing

1607
01:01:52,829 --> 01:01:59,250
this I'd be really tempted to dig a big

1608
01:01:55,409 --> 01:02:03,088
hole in the ground and and grow the

1609
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:06,599
plants below grade and then just put a

1610
01:02:03,088 --> 01:02:08,789
glass roof on the top of that hole so

1611
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:12,030
that I could use the geothermal cooling

1612
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:13,318
and yet still used the hot sunshine have

1613
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:16,410
you ever heard of that before is

1614
01:02:13,318 --> 01:02:18,358
that even a things that possible uh I

1615
01:02:16,409 --> 01:02:21,058
mean it's definitely a thing and there

1616
01:02:18,358 --> 01:02:23,400
are possibilities I mean you know name

1617
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:25,440
dropping again our friends at dragonfly

1618
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,269
Earth medicine really promoted a lot of

1619
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,338
wallop Heaney greenhouses is what they

1620
01:02:27,268 --> 01:02:32,338
call that what it's called Waller right

1621
01:02:29,338 --> 01:02:33,869
on yeah yeah while a PT and so we

1622
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:36,630
actually worked with some people in

1623
01:02:33,869 --> 01:02:38,400
Colorado that did one and and and I know

1624
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:41,519
that they have one at their farm and

1625
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:45,239
things like that and so they do work and

1626
01:02:41,518 --> 01:02:47,639
they I'm kind of on the fence because on

1627
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:49,858
one hand they don't work 365 you know

1628
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:50,728
24/7 type of thing for what people are

1629
01:02:49,858 --> 01:02:53,219
trying to achieve

1630
01:02:50,728 --> 01:02:55,288
but they do provide some of the stuff we

1631
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:57,650
you're talking about as far as cooling

1632
01:02:55,289 --> 01:03:00,719
and heating on the thermal level but

1633
01:02:57,650 --> 01:03:03,568
depending on where you are that can be

1634
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:05,338
really tricky to quantify that all the

1635
01:03:03,568 --> 01:03:07,079
time and what I mean by the desert is

1636
01:03:05,338 --> 01:03:10,018
really unforgiving and you'd have to dig

1637
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:13,318
a pretty deep hole to get any of that

1638
01:03:10,018 --> 01:03:15,778
relief or health from those things in

1639
01:03:13,318 --> 01:03:17,788
you know in in Grass Valley for that

1640
01:03:15,778 --> 01:03:19,409
matter where I am up here it gets really

1641
01:03:17,789 --> 01:03:21,269
cold in the wintertime and people have

1642
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:23,788
tried some of these techniques and and

1643
01:03:21,268 --> 01:03:26,129
using warm water barrels and things in

1644
01:03:23,789 --> 01:03:28,739
the daytime to you know try to offset

1645
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:30,809
some or give off some heat and at night

1646
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:33,150
and those a lot of those times they

1647
01:03:30,809 --> 01:03:35,819
didn't work because it's just too hot or

1648
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:37,410
it's just too dang cold and you know

1649
01:03:35,818 --> 01:03:39,509
those things help maybe in the evening

1650
01:03:37,409 --> 01:03:41,389
time or in the morning time but like I

1651
01:03:39,509 --> 01:03:43,880
said it's not a consistent enough

1652
01:03:41,389 --> 01:03:46,588
situation and I believe in the deserts

1653
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:48,028
you can grow in a combination of things

1654
01:03:46,588 --> 01:03:50,788
and I've been to the few desert

1655
01:03:48,028 --> 01:03:52,978
greenhouses already one of them was in

1656
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:56,579
Death Valley of all places it was like

1657
01:03:52,978 --> 01:03:59,728
70,000 square feet and I happened to be

1658
01:03:56,579 --> 01:04:01,548
in Vegas consulting on an indoor project

1659
01:03:59,728 --> 01:04:04,259
that wanted to get a greenhouse and so

1660
01:04:01,548 --> 01:04:06,028
through Instagram a buddy of mine that I

1661
01:04:04,259 --> 01:04:08,670
didn't even realize was out in Death

1662
01:04:06,028 --> 01:04:10,829
Valley running a big greenhouse so we

1663
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:13,079
packed up headed out there and you know

1664
01:04:10,829 --> 01:04:16,079
with the wet wall going on a hot day on

1665
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:18,089
112 it had it down into the 70s or high

1666
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:20,579
70s which felt really nice and was

1667
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:22,619
working well but again like you said it

1668
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:24,930
costs money to run those systems and to

1669
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:26,380
make all that happen the one thing that

1670
01:04:24,929 --> 01:04:28,989
he did mention is that

1671
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:31,570
was getting to be monsoon season and off

1672
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:33,639
the coast we've been having a lot of

1673
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:36,100
high-pressure or whatever systems and

1674
01:04:33,639 --> 01:04:39,400
causing it to be really humid and so

1675
01:04:36,099 --> 01:04:42,039
when it gets really humid out in the

1676
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:44,139
desert or even close to San Diego where

1677
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:46,179
I went to another one those wet walls

1678
01:04:44,139 --> 01:04:49,000
are tricky because the humidity is

1679
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:51,099
really hard to deal with and so you know

1680
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,900
we kind of have like a saying before we

1681
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:55,779
take a few steps forward and a few steps

1682
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:57,340
back and so yeah in the desert model of

1683
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:59,860
a greenhouse we have to have more

1684
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:03,460
flexibility of things to turn off and on

1685
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:05,110
and to do and so I thought they had to

1686
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:07,630
clear of a cover I would have used a

1687
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:09,309
more diffused cover another place that I

1688
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:10,930
went to says well we like to clear and

1689
01:05:09,309 --> 01:05:12,219
we'll just pull out the shade cloth well

1690
01:05:10,929 --> 01:05:14,799
if you don't pull out the shade cloth

1691
01:05:12,219 --> 01:05:16,239
soon enough you end up getting high leaf

1692
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:18,700
surface temperatures and then you're

1693
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:21,729
actually closing the shade cloth in and

1694
01:05:18,699 --> 01:05:23,079
retaining that humidity because the

1695
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:24,730
plants have already overheated and

1696
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:27,429
started to sweat and so if you don't

1697
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:29,559
catch it at the right time you still

1698
01:05:27,429 --> 01:05:31,569
kind of deal with the same problem that

1699
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:34,239
you were hoping to avoid with some of

1700
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:36,250
this fancy stuff so it's a lot of

1701
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:38,169
orchestration that goes along with the -

1702
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,579
it's not just how you do the greenhouse

1703
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:41,920
and what you put on it it's the

1704
01:05:39,579 --> 01:05:44,259
orchestration and how you set it up to

1705
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,480
operate and the parameters so that you

1706
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:49,630
can you know utilize shade cloths

1707
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,940
properly utilize lighting cooling wet

1708
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:54,430
walls and passive ventilation when it's

1709
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:56,889
time so I mean all these things work

1710
01:05:54,429 --> 01:05:58,690
well and can lower your cost of

1711
01:05:56,889 --> 01:06:00,369
production but like you said or like

1712
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:02,829
you're hearing people will just do one

1713
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:04,029
thing and you know they want the cooling

1714
01:06:02,829 --> 01:06:05,559
they run the wet wall all the time

1715
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:08,230
that's it they didn't get a ridge vent

1716
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:10,719
or a passive ventilation option or

1717
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:13,809
anything like that they maybe didn't use

1718
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:15,789
a diffuse cover or whatever the case may

1719
01:06:13,809 --> 01:06:18,670
be you know I find that nobody does

1720
01:06:15,789 --> 01:06:20,980
anything the same either yeah there's

1721
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:23,710
there's definitely not a solid set of

1722
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:25,240
best practices that is universally

1723
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:27,579
shared and I got to tell you it's kind

1724
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:29,589
of surprising too to get to this point

1725
01:06:27,579 --> 01:06:31,960
you know it's not like greenhouses are a

1726
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:34,390
new thing but yet there are is so

1727
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:36,210
there's so much going on as far as new

1728
01:06:34,389 --> 01:06:39,659
thoughts new deployments new

1729
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:41,579
implementations new tech now that

1730
01:06:39,659 --> 01:06:43,920
now that the greenhouse world has got so

1731
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:46,230
much more of us cannabis fools running

1732
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,269
around inventing things and getting

1733
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:50,190
involved hey let's go ahead and take our

1734
01:06:48,269 --> 01:06:51,989
second and last short break we'll be

1735

right back you are listening to shaping

1736
01:06:51,989 --> 01:06:55,649
fire my guest today is cannabis

greenhouse advisory group as a business

1739
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:03,269
owner you are incredibly busy in reality

1740
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:05,130
you are responsible for everything your

1741
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:07,079
company does you've got so many

1742
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:08,608
responsibilities every single day that

1743
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:10,829
often you just don't have the time to

1744
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:12,989
really dig into your marketing as deeply

1745
01:07:10,829 --> 01:07:14,220
as you'd like you know there's more that

1746
01:07:12,989 --> 01:07:16,169
you could do to reach out to new

1747
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:18,088
customers and encourage loyalty and the

1748
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:19,769
customers you do have but you certainly

1749
01:07:18,088 --> 01:07:21,119
don't have the time for it and you're

1750
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:23,880
not really ready to hire someone

1751
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:26,640
full-time for that role either for you I

1752

responsibility for improving your bottom

1759
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:43,409

01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:02,579
an established company moving from

1769
01:08:00,809 --> 01:08:05,880

whole plant medicine terpenes heritage

1774
01:08:12,568 --> 01:08:17,100
farmers and the particular needs of

1775
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:19,529
startups check out what she did recently

1776
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:22,670
for moon tine medicinals in Humboldt

1777
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:24,690
County at moon time medicinals calm

1778
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:26,640
Kirsten and her team put together a

1779
01:08:24,689 --> 01:08:28,678
whole brand package for them built their

1780
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:31,230
website and wrote their sales materials

1781
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:32,759
no doubt this is a paid commercial spot

1782
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:34,738
but that does not mean that they bought

1783
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:36,420
my opinion I've worked with blunt

1784
01:08:34,738 --> 01:08:38,428
branding on four projects now for

1785
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:39,659

1787
01:08:39,659 --> 01:08:44,548
promised and over delivered on results I

1788
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,679
love how they generate new revenue and

1789
01:08:44,548 --> 01:08:49,289

1790
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:51,088

host Shango Louis and our guest this

1843
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:45,100
week is cannabis greenhouse expert Erik

1844
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:47,800
Branstad from greenhouse advisory group

1845
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:49,750
so we have talked about a whole bunch of

1846
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,250
stuff that can go wrong Erik you know

1847
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:53,829
we've talked about the heat and the

1848
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:56,020
pests and the mold and inadequate sizes

1849
01:10:53,829 --> 01:10:58,960
and crazy location based issues which

1850
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:00,550
generally tend to be heat based well a

1851
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,590
lot of people I'm sure are feeling

1852
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:04,350
overwhelmed which is exactly why you

1853
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:07,319
know you've started this this

1854
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:09,660
new approach of greenhouse rescue so so

1855
01:11:07,319 --> 01:11:12,569
let's take it all the way back to the

1856
01:11:09,659 --> 01:11:15,059
beginning if somebody is looking to

1857
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:17,729
build a greenhouse what should they be

1858
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:21,480
looking for when shopping for a company

1859
01:11:17,729 --> 01:11:22,889
you know that's a good question and it

1860
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:25,199
can be kind of a tough question

1861
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:27,180
sometimes because a lot of the people

1862
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:28,470
are trying to sell stuff and they want

1863
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,900
to get your business so they're gonna

1864
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:32,550
say a lot of the right things it's you

1865
01:11:30,899 --> 01:11:35,189
know if you say are you guys involved in

1866
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:36,989
cannabis they'll probably say yes so you

1867
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:39,299
know just dig a little deeper you know

1868
01:11:36,989 --> 01:11:41,569
like can I see the cannabis project can

1869
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:43,619
I see videos pictures can I talk to

1870
01:11:41,569 --> 01:11:45,659
maybe the person that bought the

1871
01:11:43,619 --> 01:11:48,809
greenhouse you know what I mean like dig

1872
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:50,430
deep for references is what I like to do

1873
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:53,010
so that you can really kind of vet it

1874
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:55,050
out and make sure that on one hand they

1875
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:57,530
have been successful greenhouse growers

1876
01:11:55,050 --> 01:12:00,539
I mean if you can talk to builders even

1877
01:11:57,529 --> 01:12:03,869
you know talking to the builders to find

1878
01:12:00,539 --> 01:12:05,670
out information on you know the

1879
01:12:03,869 --> 01:12:07,380
greenhouse itself on how that's gonna go

1880
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:10,350
I mean I've had a lot of builders that

1881
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:13,020
build any greenhouse and they are you

1882
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:14,910
know they have their own ideas of who's

1883
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:16,710
better who's not so I mean a lot of

1884
01:12:14,909 --> 01:12:19,529
times it's just getting the education

1885
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:21,359
background don't just pick one it's good

1886
01:12:19,529 --> 01:12:23,399
to get at least three quotes in my

1887
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:25,859
opinion or three bids to find out the

1888
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:27,359
differences because there's engineering

1889
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:29,039
timelines that are different with

1890
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:30,539
everybody needing get building permits

1891
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:32,640
these days

1892
01:12:30,539 --> 01:12:35,609
and everybody's also in a hurry to get

1893
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:37,410
their project going engineering

1894
01:12:35,609 --> 01:12:39,089
timelines and how soon you can get those

1895
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:41,279
blueprints to the county so that you can

1896
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:44,220
apply for your permit can be a deal

1897
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:45,719
maker or breaker the timeline that it

1898
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:47,340
takes from pulling the trigger on the

1899
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:49,380
actual greenhouse to being able to get

1900
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:52,289
the metal how long is it going to take

1901
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:53,940
to you know get it built there's a lot

1902
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:55,470
of these factors and when you talk to

1903
01:12:53,939 --> 01:12:56,699
three different greenhouse companies

1904
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:59,550
you're gonna get three different answers

1905
01:12:56,699 --> 01:13:01,349
to all those questions basically and

1906
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:04,039
depending on where you are at your

1907
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:07,020
greenhouse project one or two of those

1908
01:13:04,039 --> 01:13:08,939
differences is gonna help you make that

1909
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:11,640
decision it's not all just price these

1910
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:13,919
days and it shouldn't be a lot of people

1911
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:16,530
bottom line shop they just look at that

1912
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,239
bottom line and go that direction and I

1913
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:20,219
feel like that's what gets people

1914
01:13:18,238 --> 01:13:22,319
in the most trouble I'm not saying

1915
01:13:20,219 --> 01:13:25,679
spending more is better but I'm saying

1916
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:27,630
paying attention to all these things is

1917
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:30,510
more important than bottom line shopping

1918
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:32,940
because what's the point of buying a

1919
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:34,860
fairly inexpensive piece of equipment

1920
01:13:32,939 --> 01:13:36,509
and not being there for another year or

1921
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:38,429
something yeah totally and I actually

1922
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:41,039
I'll take the extra step in and and

1923
01:13:38,429 --> 01:13:42,748
suggest people call somebody like you

1924
01:13:41,038 --> 01:13:44,460
right and actually you're the only

1925
01:13:42,748 --> 01:13:46,649
person I know who's doing this right now

1926
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:49,109
for cannabis some somebody who's a green

1927
01:13:46,649 --> 01:13:51,388
house strategist right like they're not

1928
01:13:49,109 --> 01:13:52,738
trying to sell you a product because you

1929
01:13:51,389 --> 01:13:54,690
know you used to be that guy right you

1930
01:13:52,738 --> 01:13:56,248
used to sell green house yeah but but

1931
01:13:54,689 --> 01:13:58,379
but over your 10 plus years of

1932
01:13:56,248 --> 01:14:00,779
experience you've realized what the

1933
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:03,840
score is on on everybody and and

1934
01:14:00,779 --> 01:14:05,969
somebody like you is a pretty smart

1935
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:08,099
first call because the money that I

1936
01:14:05,969 --> 01:14:10,189
would save and calling you to give me

1937
01:14:08,099 --> 01:14:12,989
some direction and just you know

1938
01:14:10,189 --> 01:14:16,558
business reconnaissance is going to be

1939
01:14:12,988 --> 01:14:19,649
saved many times over you know when I

1940
01:14:16,559 --> 01:14:21,329
actually go to build or rescue a green

1941
01:14:19,649 --> 01:14:23,069
house so so people should do that as

1942
01:14:21,328 --> 01:14:24,420
well so so they're gonna look for a

1943
01:14:23,069 --> 01:14:28,229
green house company with that with with

1944
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:29,699
with serious references that can be

1945
01:14:28,229 --> 01:14:31,288
checked up they might consider reaching

1946
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:33,988
out to somebody like you who's got a

1947
01:14:31,288 --> 01:14:36,779
bigger perspective and isn't allied to

1948
01:14:33,988 --> 01:14:39,089
any brand or product but in the end they

1949
01:14:36,779 --> 01:14:41,670
get something built and and then the

1950
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:43,440
company hands you the keys right and I

1951
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:44,940
have heard you talk about this at length

1952
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:46,348
about you know somebody gets a green

1953
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:48,149
house and they don't know what to do

1954
01:14:46,349 --> 01:14:50,190
with it right they don't know how they

1955
01:14:48,149 --> 01:14:53,038
don't know how to make it function to

1956
01:14:50,189 --> 01:14:55,848
make it sing and so you know when when

1957
01:14:53,038 --> 01:14:58,469
you are helping somebody you know

1958
01:14:55,849 --> 01:14:59,788
mentally and emotionally move into their

1959
01:14:58,469 --> 01:15:02,998
green house right because this is a big

1960
01:14:59,788 --> 01:15:05,340
stage and a company's overall arc what

1961
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:07,319
kind of hints do you give them for like

1962
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:09,480
getting a green house up and running I'm

1963
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:11,819
sure that you've got some some initial

1964
01:15:09,479 --> 01:15:13,888
best practices that you give your

1965
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:19,259
clients so that they get off on the

1966
01:15:13,889 --> 01:15:21,599
right foot yeah I do you know one of the

1967
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:23,940
things I try to say is even start out

1968
01:15:21,599 --> 01:15:26,940
small inside the green house I mean just

1969
01:15:23,939 --> 01:15:28,828
because you have a giant green house or

1970
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:30,509
even on whatever size green house I mean

1971
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:31,649
you don't have to necessarily fill the

1972
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:34,320
whole thing up

1973
01:15:31,649 --> 01:15:37,469
or you know start out of the gate at

1974
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:39,840
full capacity it's good to start out

1975
01:15:37,469 --> 01:15:42,510
with a small work flow practice and

1976
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:45,420
start to ramp up you can wrap up fairly

1977
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:47,460
quickly but I see people going in

1978
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:49,829
headfirst sometimes right off the bat

1979
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,810
and that can be actually too big of a

1980
01:15:49,829 --> 01:15:53,630
pill to swallow because some of the

1981
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:56,489
things that we set up or design or

1982
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:58,109
workflow things you know they need some

1983
01:15:56,488 --> 01:16:00,678
tweaking they aren't gonna be set in

1984
01:15:58,109 --> 01:16:03,599
stone and perfect right off the bat and

1985
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:06,300
within those adjustments we find better

1986
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,370
efficiencies and you know weed out some

1987
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:12,510
of the things that won't work in the

1988
01:16:08,369 --> 01:16:14,309
long run and before we go headfirst so I

1989
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:16,440
would think that a lot of these best

1990
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:18,780
best practices you know how to use the

1991
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:20,399
machinery right but but and you know

1992
01:16:18,779 --> 01:16:22,469
especially for us if something is

1993
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:24,269
they're paying for the mechanization but

1994
01:16:22,469 --> 01:16:27,239
I would also think that there are a lot

1995
01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:29,640
of things as far as like more than

1996
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:33,539
workflow like the steps that the

1997
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:35,850
employees take around the space I'm sure

1998
01:16:33,539 --> 01:16:38,429
that those are somehow more unique or

1999
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:40,350
differently unique for greenhouses than

2000
01:16:38,429 --> 01:16:42,929
they are for example an indoor warehouse

2001
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:44,520
grow they are but I take a lot of

2002
01:16:42,929 --> 01:16:46,679
information or what I've seen from

2003
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:48,719
indoor grows now and try to apply them

2004
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:53,579
to the greenhouses and what I mean by

2005
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:54,989
that is the workflow of being clean you

2006
01:16:53,579 --> 01:16:57,179
know a lot of people I see in their

2007
01:16:54,988 --> 01:17:00,119
greenhouses will go from the flowering

2008
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:03,960
plants that might have vectors going on

2009
01:17:00,119 --> 01:17:06,090
and who knows or actually have problems

2010
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:07,859
that you can visually see you know go

2011
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:09,150
around those plants touch them talk

2012
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:10,679
about on this that and the other and

2013
01:17:09,149 --> 01:17:14,460
then we go over and let's look at the

2014
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:16,020
moms and the babe the cuttings and so a

2015
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:18,390
lot of people need to understand that

2016
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:20,190
there is cross contamination going and

2017
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:24,449
even when we're harvesting we're taking

2018
01:17:20,189 --> 01:17:26,460
trays of harvested plants past you know

2019
01:17:24,448 --> 01:17:28,799
the cloning room or something like I see

2020
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:30,420
a lot of people passing passing each

2021
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,760
other in the halls where we actually

2022
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:35,340
have to establish a workflow that means

2023
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:37,050
the clean you know the the veg and the

2024
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:38,219
cutting people stay with those plants

2025
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:39,810
and before you move over to the

2026
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:41,819
flowering or vice versa

2027
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:43,260
we actually change our clothes and go

2028
01:17:41,819 --> 01:17:45,208
through a procedure of cleaning and

2029
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:47,519
decontamination

2030
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:49,889
and maybe we have two different crews

2031
01:17:47,519 --> 01:17:51,929
you know we have a veg and cloning crew

2032
01:17:49,889 --> 01:17:53,399
and the flowering crew is over here and

2033
01:17:51,929 --> 01:17:55,708
they do the nerd thing and we don't

2034
01:17:53,399 --> 01:17:58,530
actually cross each other in the halls

2035
01:17:55,708 --> 01:18:01,109
or pathways when we're hauling trays of

2036
01:17:58,529 --> 01:18:04,228
clones and another person has a rack of

2037
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:07,498
harvested plants I mean I see that we

2038
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:09,119
really all too often and the other thing

2039
01:18:07,498 --> 01:18:11,969
that I see that's happening is a

2040
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:13,558
landscape plan in the sense that it's

2041
01:18:11,969 --> 01:18:16,529
easy to build the greenhouse and make

2042
01:18:13,559 --> 01:18:18,748
that all die out in in a sweet space but

2043
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:21,208
then we have dusty driveways and dust

2044
01:18:18,748 --> 01:18:24,029
surrounding everything and so every time

2045
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:26,729
someone drives a golf cart by every time

2046
01:18:24,029 --> 01:18:29,279
a visitor an inspector pulls up every

2047
01:18:26,729 --> 01:18:31,590
time a worker walks by or the dogs or

2048
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:34,248
you know doing they're playing right

2049
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:36,389
there we're creating all this dust and

2050
01:18:34,248 --> 01:18:38,519
unfortunately that dust is getting

2051
01:18:36,389 --> 01:18:40,979
everywhere on the plants and creating

2052
01:18:38,519 --> 01:18:43,320
its own set of problems too so I mean a

2053
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:46,199
lot of the best practices I see have to

2054
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:48,538
go into with cleanliness you know I

2055
01:18:46,198 --> 01:18:50,098
don't mean like white glove tech but we

2056
01:18:48,538 --> 01:18:51,509
got to put wrap our heads around some of

2057
01:18:50,099 --> 01:18:55,679
this stuff I feel like it's kind of

2058
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:58,199
basic from my perspective like landscape

2059
01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:01,649
dust control and you know not carrying

2060
01:18:58,198 --> 01:19:03,208
clones past flowering plants or how

2061
01:19:01,649 --> 01:19:05,969
harvested plants is just like a

2062
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:08,609
no-brainer but it's just everybody's

2063
01:19:05,969 --> 01:19:11,219
doing it you know I've talked to quite a

2064
01:19:08,609 --> 01:19:13,799
few greenhouse folks this year who were

2065
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:15,748
really concerned about either their new

2066
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:18,208
greenhouse that was you know still had

2067
01:19:15,748 --> 01:19:21,029
the new car smell on it or or their

2068
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:22,679
rehabbed greenhouse around the wildfires

2069
01:19:21,029 --> 01:19:24,238
that we've been having so hardcore the

2070
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:26,309
last two years I mean everywhere right

2071
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:29,759
down near where you are in Grass Valley

2072
01:19:26,309 --> 01:19:31,829
it was terrible it's crazy up in Canada

2073
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:33,739
right now where I am in the northwest

2074
01:19:31,828 --> 01:19:36,779
we've got fires in Oregon and Washington

2075
01:19:33,738 --> 01:19:38,458
um are there any best practices for

2076
01:19:36,779 --> 01:19:42,809
greenhouses when there's a wildfire

2077
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:45,208
nearby you know I mean it's tough I mean

2078
01:19:42,809 --> 01:19:47,099
we're still dealing with air exchanges

2079
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:50,578
and opening vents and things like that

2080
01:19:47,099 --> 01:19:53,219
smoke gets into our homes we try to keep

2081
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:55,139
the smoke out but depending on the level

2082
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:56,969
of smoke a lot of people don't have air

2083
01:19:55,139 --> 01:19:58,500
conditioning in their homes so they rely

2084
01:19:56,969 --> 01:20:00,420
on opening windows to

2085
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:02,520
you know to live in their homes

2086
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:05,819
throughout the summertime and so smoke

2087
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,650
is definitely a hot topic but it's

2088
01:20:05,819 --> 01:20:09,509
something that you know I don't even

2089
01:20:07,649 --> 01:20:12,269
really have a big answer on that right

2090
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:14,250
now it's it's mostly you know trying to

2091
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:15,900
go in and be able to spray your plants

2092
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:17,670
off I mean spraying them with water

2093
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:20,099
alone when they're in veg to try to

2094
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:22,560
rinse any particulate off things like

2095
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:25,350
that be an option but at the end of the

2096
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:27,180
day I'm starting to look to the labs to

2097
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:29,880
see what they say about the level of

2098
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:33,300
contamination on these plans to try to

2099
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:36,359
get an idea of where we're at like you

2100
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:38,100
know if it's smoky how smoky does it

2101
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:39,989
have to be to actually affect your

2102
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,520
plants or how long does it have to sit

2103
01:20:39,989 --> 01:20:44,340
there for for it actually to be a

2104
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:46,590
problem and things like that and so you

2105
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:48,390
know that's a little bit new territory

2106
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:51,659
that I'm looking into and asking the

2107
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:53,670
same questions about and so hopefully

2108
01:20:51,659 --> 01:20:56,039
I'll have some more solid answers as we

2109
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:58,470
go but right now yeah it's a scary scary

2110
01:20:56,039 --> 01:21:01,439
situation right on so my last question

2111
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:03,630
for you today we're gonna go back to the

2112
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:06,449
ultra basics you know I know that you

2113
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:08,579
have been doing light DEP way for a long

2114
01:21:06,449 --> 01:21:10,439
time and you know all the way back to

2115
01:21:08,579 --> 01:21:14,039
where people were using refrigerator

2116
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:15,869
boxes around one plant in Humboldt and

2117
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:17,220
stuff and you know this is the time of

2118
01:21:15,869 --> 01:21:19,769
year where people are putting away their

2119
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:24,539
depth tarps and people will be soon

2120
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:26,370
putting away their you know their their

2121
01:21:24,539 --> 01:21:30,409
their reg seed tarps you know they're

2122
01:21:26,369 --> 01:21:33,239
full they're full season greenhouse

2123
01:21:30,409 --> 01:21:35,340
Poly's anyway you know people are gonna

2124
01:21:33,239 --> 01:21:36,929
plead putting this stuff away and and

2125
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:39,029
you've deal dealt with these materials

2126
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:42,600
for you know your whole life how do you

2127
01:21:39,029 --> 01:21:43,979
recommend that people put these things

2128
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,750
away clean them and put them away for

2129
01:21:43,979 --> 01:21:47,759
the year because I've seen everything

2130
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:49,710
from people wash them down and put them

2131
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,570
away and they mold and then other people

2132
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:53,970
just take them and they roll them up and

2133
01:21:51,569 --> 01:21:55,469
they just go buy a new one next year so

2134
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:58,320
you know as somebody who's been around

2135
01:21:55,470 --> 01:22:01,260
this since it is seasonally correct do

2136
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:03,630
you have any pointers for folks yeah the

2137
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:05,220
main thing is is uh yeah roll it up and

2138
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:07,230
put it away and I wouldn't worry too

2139
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:09,090
much about washing it off before you put

2140
01:22:07,229 --> 01:22:11,699
it away because yeah if you don't dry it

2141
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:12,779
really good and get everything dry you

2142
01:22:11,699 --> 01:22:14,609
end up getting some mole

2143
01:22:12,779 --> 01:22:17,158
because waters trapped for the winter in

2144
01:22:14,609 --> 01:22:19,920
those folds and so having a dry dusty

2145
01:22:17,158 --> 01:22:21,569
tarp folded up isn't a big deal you can

2146
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:23,880
rinse it off in the spring when you get

2147
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:26,009
it out again and and clean it off then

2148
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:27,359
when you get it hanging up maybe even

2149
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:28,920
before you have plants in the greenhouse

2150
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:31,769
type of thing it's easy to hose it

2151
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:33,750
inside and outside and and things stay

2152
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:35,820
dry but rolling it up and putting it

2153
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:38,069
away in a place that isn't gonna get hit

2154
01:22:35,819 --> 01:22:39,719
with mice or rats because one thing that

2155
01:22:38,069 --> 01:22:42,328
happens the poly that's rolled up and

2156
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:44,639
put in the garage is we find mice that

2157
01:22:42,328 --> 01:22:46,679
go bore a hole in these things and so

2158
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:48,989
then when you go unroll it or unfold it

2159
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:50,849
we have a little hole every five feet

2160
01:22:48,988 --> 01:22:52,288
you know the whole you know

2161
01:22:50,849 --> 01:22:55,409
three-quarters of the length of the

2162
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:57,658
greenhouse so putting things away

2163
01:22:55,408 --> 01:23:00,238
knowing that they're gonna be secured

2164
01:22:57,658 --> 01:23:02,250
from animals pinecones

2165
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:05,328
you know damaging elements and things

2166
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:08,219
like that is really important because I

2167
01:23:05,328 --> 01:23:10,408
store mine or I used to store mine every

2168
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:13,408
year and the mice would always be my

2169
01:23:10,408 --> 01:23:15,179
biggest threat for that and then when it

2170
01:23:13,408 --> 01:23:17,429
comes to all the other equipment I mean

2171
01:23:15,179 --> 01:23:19,859
the greenhouses are made for wintertime

2172
01:23:17,429 --> 01:23:21,630
so most everything as far as fans and

2173
01:23:19,859 --> 01:23:24,868
bearings and all that stuff are sealed

2174
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:26,880
and pre-packed if it's a hoop house I

2175
01:23:24,868 --> 01:23:28,920
always recommend and you're only using

2176
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:31,020
it in the summertime for the most part

2177
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:33,118
or the spring in the summer is take the

2178
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:35,760
cover off for the wintertime because if

2179
01:23:33,118 --> 01:23:38,219
if we get a snow that pops up and it's

2180
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:41,639
easily collapses hoop houses even if

2181
01:23:38,219 --> 01:23:44,099
they say that they can handle some snow

2182
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:46,230
they really shouldn't and have a tough

2183
01:23:44,099 --> 01:23:48,900
time because most hoop houses are all

2184
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:50,578
hoop houses have a little bit of a flat

2185
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:52,469
spot at the top it's hard to see with

2186
01:23:50,578 --> 01:23:53,880
the naked eye but it's there and when

2187
01:23:52,469 --> 01:23:56,158
you have that flat spot and you have

2188
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:59,309
snow building up on it it can sneak up

2189
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:01,948
on you really quick and it's no fun

2190
01:23:59,309 --> 01:24:03,869
having a greenhouse collapse on you when

2191
01:24:01,948 --> 01:24:05,638
all you had to do was really take the

2192
01:24:03,868 --> 01:24:07,500
skin off for the wintertime and let it

2193
01:24:05,639 --> 01:24:10,230
snow and and there wouldn't have been a

2194
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:12,658
problem so winterizing your greenhouse

2195
01:24:10,229 --> 01:24:14,848
is definitely very important for those

2196
01:24:12,658 --> 01:24:17,038
that don't use it and so we want to

2197
01:24:14,849 --> 01:24:19,409
protect the cover and protect the frame

2198
01:24:17,038 --> 01:24:23,000
at all costs and makes it less likely

2199
01:24:19,408 --> 01:24:24,599
that you will need a greenhouse rescue

2200
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,300
exactly

2201
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:28,920
right on well Eric thank you so much for

2202
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:31,350
taking the time to be with us

2203
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:33,690
today you know you've got this this you

2204
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:35,970
know decade-plus amount of experience

2205
01:24:33,689 --> 01:24:38,669
and somehow we have to distill it down

2206
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:41,760
for you know a 90 minute show somehow

2207
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:43,800
and and and and I think we were able to

2208
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,630
get you know enough of the problems that

2209
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:47,970
enough of the solutions out there to get

2210
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:50,819
people thinking about it and and to get

2211
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:53,730
them on the road to road to recovery

2212
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:55,380
I hope so it's always fun hanging with

2213
