1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:11,400
so hair is great to run into you today

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,230
at NCI a here in San Jose and you know

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,940
everybody kind of got freaked out in

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,219
surprise to find out that you're no

5
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,199
longer had forever flowering greenhouses

6
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:21,629
because we all know you like you're at

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,460
every convention and you know we all

8
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:25,890
know you as being the person who built

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,230
you know forever flowering into the epic

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,618
thing it is by being everywhere but now

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,170
you're not there anymore and so I'm glad

12
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,238
I ran into you because I wanted to know

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,890
what you're up to now and after talking

14
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,828
with you for a little bit it sounds like

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,570
you've got some opportunities but you're

16
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,000
also looking for some kind of

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,710
opportunities so I just wanted to take a

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,320
second and find out what you're up to

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,759
let everybody know so because you'd like

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,710
everybody who's watching is on your team

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,079
right so so what do you got going on now

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,390
post forever flowering well I appreciate

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,539
you saying all that stuff I appreciate

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:04,170
everybody's support right now I took the

25
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,390
job with a distribution company and so

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,430
I'm actually going out farm to farm

27
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,810
sourcing trim at the moment they do all

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,299
kinds of things but my job primarily

29
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,490
at the moment is defined trend so I'm

30
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,780
connected with a lot of farms and the

31
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:18,969
funny thing is as far as I normally

32
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,478
would wouldn't connect with that I'll

33
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:27,728
believe I'm now connecting with because

34
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:30,640
of my notoriety I guess you could say

35
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:32,379
and so being able to connect with those

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,209
farms has been kind of cool because now

37
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:35,769
I'm actually seeing a side of people and

38
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:38,019
things that I normally would see those

39
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:39,849
with that company and then it also turns

40
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:42,129
into talking about greenhouses allowed

41
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:44,049
you so now a lot of people have searched

42
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:46,780
out for me to still get green house

43
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:49,090
advice right and so not that I like the

44
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,719
word consultant I like more of strategy

45
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,429
or buy three of those kind of words but

46
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,469
people still want my opinion and so I'm

47
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:59,049
willing to give that opinion and of

48
00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:00,700
course I want to monetize it so yeah I'm

49
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,670
not really interested in trying to sell

50
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,409
or resell goods as much as I'm happy to

51
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,000
sell the advice and we'll work with a

52
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:10,429
lot of the connections that I have in

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,229
the industry and even the community too

54
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:14,989
farmers in whatever capacity they

55
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:16,608
request so you got got like two hustles

56
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:19,908
going right now here you got the the

57
00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:22,099
sourcing trim for business partner one

58
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:23,870
and then obviously people are gonna be

59
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:26,238
asking you about greenhouses labor

60
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,400
collie forever now alright cuz you're

61
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,759
you know industry expert so let's talk

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,408
about the troopers right so so what kind

63
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,310
of opportunities like are you looking

64
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:39,828
for people who have got their license

65
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,658
and have got trim that they want to sell

66
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,889
on the open market does that is that the

67
00:02:41,658 --> 00:02:44,719
kind of people you're looking to connect

68
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:47,090
with yeah and it's kind of fun because

69
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,979
you know managing a company for 11 years

70
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,229
like I did came with a lot of pressures

71
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:53,539
of you know a lot of decisions to make

72
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:55,369
and things like that so basically now

73
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:57,078
it's kind of listening to what other

74
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,230
people are doing and just going out and

75
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:01,730
doing something that is really kind of

76
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:03,108
fun in a way because I'm not selling

77
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:06,798
something that I'm trying to buy

78
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:08,599
something it's a nicer yeah and I'm

79
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,609
connecting with the same group of people

80
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:12,259
if not these same people that I've

81
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:14,019
connected with before so it's on a

82
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:16,759
different level for a different purpose

83
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,069
but it's still within my community that

84
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:21,019
I love so much and the people that

85
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:23,539
actually trust and support me as well

86
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:25,099
that are coming out and you know it

87
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:26,959
might not be a career move some of my

88
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:28,149
going went for managing a company to

89
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,400
take another

90
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,110
whatever but like I said without taking

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,938
a break this was a quick way to jump

92
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,280
into something that I feel like I can

93
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:37,840
you know bring value to and also do a

94
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,969
pretty good job at and I'd have to

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,759
really think and make so many critical

96
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:44,979
decisions you know maybe sleep better at

97
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:47,019
night in some cases so a lot of that

98
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:48,608
stress is relieved and now going out and

99
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,519
doing that's been kind of fun but like I

100
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:53,859
said now I'm getting hired to actually

101
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:57,039
going to Vegas next week to consult on a

102
00:03:53,859 --> 00:04:00,340
greenhouse project that merely want my

103
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:03,129
advice they don't really need to buy

104
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,979
pick my brain and they're willing to pay

105
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:07,359
me for it and so I figured out a way to

106
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,280
come up with a rate sheet that kind of

107
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,880
discusses a few different services

108
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,430
whether it's giving a presentation to

109
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,659
helping people that have never

110
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,509
understood or dealt with the green house

111
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,340
before or to people that are already on

112
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,949
their way into it and the biggest one

113
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,899
now is green house rescue there's so

114
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:27,639
many green house people that are either

115
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:29,918
getting into an existing order of built

116
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,360
one and maybe don't have the right head

117
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,240
grow or maybe they are putting the

118
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,280
pieces together properly working harder

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,980
not smarter a lot of those things I can

120
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:40,269
address pretty fairly easily and it's

121
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,220
something I feel like I'm pretty good at

122
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:45,459
and so the green house rescue a lot of

123
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,169
capacity you know kind of coining it

124
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:49,839
taking off you know that actually makes

125
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:53,109
a lot of sense too because when you were

126
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,489
a guest on my shape and fire podcast one

127
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,860
of the things like you've kept on coming

128
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,079
back to is a lot of your job was just

129
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,610
stopping people from doing the stuff

130
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:02,349
they were doing wrong right

131
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,780
it's like it's like the greenhouse

132
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,640
itself you know if you if you build it

133
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:08,859
right you're in good shape and then but

134
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,839
then when how people choose to use it

135
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,030
you know gets them in all sorts of

136
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:15,219
trouble right down to using black fabric

137
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:17,529
bags instead of brown right it was

138
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,590
amazing over the course of the last year

139
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:21,629
so the people that I've met

140
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:24,089
two farms that had our greenhouses I

141
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,889
felt like understood what we were all

142
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:28,979
about or the message that I was laying

143
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:32,039
down and I came to the realization and a

144
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:34,020
lot of people didn't quite I mean they

145
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,460
bought product or greenhouses from me

146
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,159
and things but they still didn't quite

147
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:41,219
get the concept and so I feel like I'm

148
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,460
still saying the same story and trying

149
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,900
to hold the same space that I did before

150
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:47,129
because that information I feel like his

151
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:50,279
by the way it's still the same

152
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:52,439
information it's helping people but like

153
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,269
I said you know even people that I'm the

154
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,939
closest to might not have seen my

155
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:59,399
presentations or heard my message before

156
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,620
so how about anybody you can avoid

157
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,839
hearing you because you were everywhere

158
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,220
that's what I thought and I feel like

159
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,019
sometimes I feel like I've been

160
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,610
everywhere and said it and other times I

161
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:11,789
felt like man nobody's heard anything

162
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,530
because I'm out here just repeating

163
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,420
myself and going over

164
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:17,729
same things you know what the greenhouse

165
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,400
is the ground covers the colors the

166
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,350
clear skins different little things

167
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,179
trapping air and the default is to turn

168
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,790
on a fan rather than open it up and stop

169
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,350
traffic airs I mean it's just methods to

170
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:31,410
the madness and unfortunately in

171
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,300
California we lost a lot of brands or

172
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,420
people that were originally pioneering

173
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,000
people or companies due to regulations

174
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:41,520
so with those people being gone we have

175
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,060
a whole new crop of people that in some

176
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,799
ways need that education our industry

177
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,870
has got such churn dude

178
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,160
it's looks like or and then you don't

179
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,610

180
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,830

198
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:34,500
mix of that here today I saw people that

199
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,689
knew or followed kind of the story or

200
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,189
kind of saw

201
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:42,649
things were going in my transition and

202
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:44,360
gave me a lot of accolades and support

203
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:46,819
today and there was people that didn't

204
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,919
know and learn today and like I was

205
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:51,499
saying people just want to hear the

206
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:54,678
advice or or work with me in the sense

207
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:56,929
that I do have a lot of connections to

208
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:58,938
source a lot of things to make a

209
00:07:56,928 --> 00:08:00,859
business work or to fix a business

210
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:03,289
that's having problems yeah and actually

211
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,729
I heard you say that stuff a couple

212
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:07,098
times to people like bring people up to

213
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:09,228
speed and you know I'm like you know you

214
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:10,968
and I've been pals for a while now but I

215
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:13,068
thought it was very honorable that you

216
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:14,899
were talking any [ __ ] about your old

217
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,989
employer right right like a lot of

218
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:19,218
people like you know when they're not

219
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:20,838
somewhere anymore they talk a lot of

220
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:22,788
crap right he put him on blast yeah

221
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:24,168
totally and that's that's not your way

222
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:26,478
you're just like you know parting the

223
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:28,128
ways doing my own thing now yeah there's

224
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,498
a lot of honor in that well I appreciate

225
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:32,149
that I mean I tried to do my best in the

226
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:34,639
11 years that I was there and treated

227
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:36,589
like it was my own company and I was a

228
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,049
partial owner wasn't a majority owner

229
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:40,729
and you know after

230
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:43,278
years my time is kind of I guess you

231
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,690
could say and so it's actually been a

232
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,629
nice breath of fresh air even though

233
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,760
transitions can be tough but you know

234
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:53,088
the cannabis industry still has a lot to

235
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,919
offer for people and I'm glad that I've

236
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:56,950
been here so long so that I do have

237
00:08:54,919 --> 00:09:00,519
these connections and

238
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:02,110
our support an appreciative of stuff you

239
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,320
know like it's hard to believe how

240
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,259
appreciated people are to my commitment

241
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,749
to

242
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:10,428
industry well also you're a giver right

243
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:12,139
like you know yeah I mean like you and I

244
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:14,028
get it off right away but there's no

245
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:16,548
doubt man you introduced me to people at

246
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:18,558
Emerald cup your shirt or sermon you

247
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:22,009
told people like yeah he's not he's not

248
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:24,139
a local humble guy but he's overhead so

249
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:26,538
I'm sure you do that to all sorts of for

250
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:28,668
all sorts of folks and so you know just

251
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:30,528
like why I hunted you down today you

252
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:32,568
know like you know people want to get

253
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:34,428
back yeah yeah and I don't do it for

254
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:36,858
everybody but I definitely do it for the

255
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:38,720
people that I find the same community

256
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:40,990
spirit the passion for the planet you

257
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,480
know what I mean

258
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,639
I think we can see each other you know

259
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,529
through a crowd sometimes and sort out

260
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:50,559
who's who even from being outside

261
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:52,419
blazing a doobie yeah and I versus

262
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,069
standing in line at the bar yeah right

263
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:56,199
and so you know some of those things

264
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,780
give it that community effort that we're

265
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,490
really a part of it makes us remember

266
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:02,289
and see each other every time we're here

267
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,210
versus being at the bar

268
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:06,240
you know maybe remembering each other or

269
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:09,009
not it's usually not for the same

270
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,730
meaning that we put to it and why we're

271
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:14,379
here yeah so so let's wrap this up by

272
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,820
talking about like the kind of

273
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:17,200
opportunities are looking for right

274
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,480
because it's kind of the goal of life

275
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,580
you know me doing this inside I wanted

276
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,430
to get you plugged in replugged in a new

277
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:28,389
ways rain and so you got the trim thing

278
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:30,159
going on should people reach out to you

279
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:31,689
if they have trim for sale yeah

280
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,209
definitely so what are you looking for

281
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,690
specific I'm looking for state permitted

282
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:40,210
trim and it can be in various quality

283
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:43,570
there's a various price range for that

284
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:45,759
quality it needs to pass testing for

285
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,560
contaminants it's a micro process so

286
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,319
they test it for everything and even the

287
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,879
returns and then we basically quarantine

288
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,760
it for two weeks while the testing is

289
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:55,460
going on

290
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:58,819
we come out and cash out on the spot we

291
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:01,940
can even do wire transfers so it's not a

292
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:04,490
terms of 30 or 45 days or anything other

293
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,990
than that yes the testing give us a

294
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,879
minute we'll be right back and then we

295
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,769
cash out and that works really well and

296
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:12,649
it seems to be compared to what I'm

297
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:14,389
hearing a pretty good opportunity and

298
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:16,159
then with the greenhouse consulting I'm

299
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:18,830
creating a rate card that's going to

300
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,589
have different services different ways

301
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,210
for people to basically utilize my

302
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,970
information and my connections within

303
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,830
the industry and so like as far as the

304
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,830
greenhouses people should contact you if

305
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,870
if they are considering a greenhouse and

306
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:35,180
they want to understand it better and

307
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,759
they want to think about what vendor to

308
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:39,829
go to and if they've got a greenhouse

309
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,319
that's maybe underperforming or they

310
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,150
want it to perform better or they've got

311
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,370
like you know when greenhouses go bad

312
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:47,990
and they never got a situation because

313
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,580
like everybody knows you're like the

314
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,519
greenhouse save King because you're

315
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,590
always out at greenhouses seem like

316
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,720
worst-case scenario it's all true and

317
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,280
it's all been cannabis that's the other

318
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,259
thing like there's plenty of greenhouse

319
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,439
experts of greenhouse people out there

320
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,750
that way

321
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,910
I'm sure and the thing that I know is

322
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,129
the cannabis side of everything related

323
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:10,750
to greenhouses for more than eleven

324
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:14,740
years because when I moved to Humble in

325
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,970
1992 I was really chasing down cannabis

326
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,220
more than anything

327
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,800
black boxing and like Depp is part of

328
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,240
that greenhouses eventually became part

329

people go through and really they're

335
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,700

336
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:42,490
couple things up or layer things a

337
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,190
