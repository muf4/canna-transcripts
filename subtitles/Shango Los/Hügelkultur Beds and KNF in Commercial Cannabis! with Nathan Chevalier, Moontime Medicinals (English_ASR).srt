1
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:16,689
so Nate thank you so much for having me

2
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,600
over to the farm today the tour was like

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:23,270
exhilarating actually I have never seen

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,210
Google culture deployed at such a size

5
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:28,939
you know permaculture classes and stuff

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,710
you'll see one or a couple and of course

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,570
I've seen lots of books where where you

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,299
get a side view of one so you understand

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,420
how they're built but your your Google

10
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:39,979
culture field is like astonishing right

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,989
and it's really cool right now because

12
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:44,569
you know some of them are finished and

13
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:46,158
you're already planted into them whereas

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,289
other of them are still like these holes

15
00:00:46,158 --> 00:00:51,320
and you're building them out I'll never

16
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:53,570
be able to describe it as well as you

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,710
will so so just tell us about that that

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,929
Google culture deployment

19
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,469
yeah well it's a it's been a challenge

20
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:02,390
from the beginning we've we hope to have

21
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:04,658
everything done by the Solstice and here

22
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:13,210
we are a couple weeks past that and

23
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:16,070
we're still working on it so we've we've

24
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:19,389
had a lot of issues sourcing material to

25
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:23,569
put into our hue goals we have a lot of

26
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:26,150
downed wood we've been bringing in PG&amp;E

27
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:27,589
for some for some electricity so we've

28
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,530
done some brush clearing some tree

29
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,630
thinning stuff like that so we've had

30
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:35,329
some sources just getting it down to the

31
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:37,819
farm and and into its proper home has

32
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:39,170
been a big challenge give people an idea

33
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:40,519
of how big it is right because for most

34
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,079
people they'll be like getting stuff

35
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,409
your hookah culture is simply just grab

36
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,989
that

37
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:46,879
but like you need a hell of a lot yeah

38
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:49,549
yeah so we're doing sixty three hundred

39
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:53,119
square feet is the size of our of our

40
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:56,179
plot and you know we're doing somewhere

41
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,850
around 14 or 15 hue goals that average

42
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:02,900
from 25 feet wide all the way up to

43
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:04,908
almost 75 feet wide so it's a lot of

44
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,159
biomass it takes because that's all

45
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,780
going into the ground it is it is and

46
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,689
and we've seen different methods of

47
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,628
doing Hugo culture and mounting it up

48
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:18,709
just on your native soil we decided to

49
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:20,449
actually trench out some some holes and

50
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:22,938
esque of eight three feet down and

51
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:23,919
backfill with rotten firewood that we've

52
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:27,310
had around the property

53
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,589
in some of these down trees to get in

54
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,530
there so getting it all down in to where

55
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,239
it needs to go has been a challenge but

56
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,890
but it's almost all there and it feels

57
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,420
good now that it's there so yeah I

58
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,729
believe in ila I like that you

59
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:41,079
incorporated those big those big bags

60
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:43,000
that I saw last time I was here that I

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,130
posted to my Instagram what were those

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,009
with those 300 gallons 200 gallon 200

63
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:51,549
gallons and so um you know it's one

64
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:53,789
thing to see the the big tree sections

65
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,800
there and then you're filling it in with

66
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:59,229
you know brush and the the natural

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,230
forest what did you call it fluff for

68
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:04,899
stuff that's on the ground yeah but then

69
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:07,539
you know by by you pouring all of that

70
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,750
you know aged and loved active living

71
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:12,818
soil on it you're you're pretty much

72
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,289
inoculating it with all the best parts

73
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,729
of your last several seasons right I

74
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:17,379
mean that's the idea we're hoping so

75
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:21,250
yeah that's kind of what we're shooting

76
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:23,799
for is the mound of decaying firewood

77
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,769
below mixed with some of the native soil

78
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,409
that's been excavated out we've ran into

79
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:31,390
tons of rock so that's been a challenge

80
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,459
as getting some of the big boulders out

81
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:36,429
of there but we're really excited about

82
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:38,500
repurposing the rocks so as it's

83
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,700
challenging it's also allowing us to do

84
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,400
other things around the property with

85
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:44,319
them but yeah we've got the we've got

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,390
the native soil back in there and then

87
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,539
the living soil to add some more

88
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:53,919
microbes to our fungus from the rotting

89
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:56,169
firewood and then we basically with the

90
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,899
four stuff and the potting soil we top

91
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:01,119
it off with one more layer of natural

92
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,950
soil that's been excavated out or

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,129
collected from the perimeters in

94
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:08,738
different areas try not to take too much

95
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:11,530
from one area to kind of do the wild

96
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,909
creature so it mixed up a little bit

97
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,549
from here a little bit from there right

98
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:16,810
right for one reason for diversity of

99
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,160
different areas but also you don't want

100
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,858
to take too much from one area right

101
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,689
yeah and strip it right right exactly um

102
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:27,849
you know the the you know on one end

103
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:29,620
you've got the Google cultures that are

104
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,210
you're literally building out today as

105
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,199
soon as I get out of your way right and

106
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:35,709
you've got the other ones that already

107
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,709
planted and you know any plant when it

108
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,870
gets trans

109
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,789
is gonna have some amount of shock and

110
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,519
so they're all like you know ten days in

111
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,830
and they're all kind of rebounding yeah

112
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,959
that must have a whole lot of complex

113
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:51,589
feels for you right because here we are

114
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:53,779
in the first licensed and taxed season

115
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:56,359
in California and you're trying to do

116
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:59,659
two things you're both trying you're

117
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,129
you're deploying this new growing tech I

118
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,380
mean not that it's new that it's never

119
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:06,399
existed before but being introduced to

120
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:08,659
both your farm and cannabis in general

121
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,339
but but you're also doing this I'm not

122
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,110
like the highest pressure cannabis

123
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:14,839
season in California ever where

124
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,759
everybody's trying to make money and not

125
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:20,269
lose the farm because everything's kind

126
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:22,459
of a mess right now that must mean there

127
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:24,979
must be challenges in that for you to

128
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:26,629
both be wanting to do this creatively

129
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:31,870
and sustainably and good for the

130
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:34,670
environment but also know that you can

131
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,069
give you if you screw up and it's a big

132
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,750
deal oh it's definitely a big deal I

133
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:40,550
think I explained to you earlier that

134
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,829
the place that we're cultivating is

135
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:49,699
typically about half of our our yield in

136
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:54,019
years past and looking down at it right

137
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:57,529
now it's a it's definitely an unsettling

138
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:59,539
feeling to to see how small everything

139
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:01,129
is at this point of the year but we did

140
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:06,590
try to make up for that a little bit by

141
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:08,649
increasing plant counts we're going more

142
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:12,638
in a

143
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:14,769
and in the same area so we're just

144
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,379
hoping that it's gonna fill in and do

145
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:19,629
what it needs to do I'm I'm cautiously

146
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:21,699
optimistic but I think it's I think it's

147
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:24,100
gonna be okay the one thing that we were

148
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:28,209
kind of contemplating too was maybe to

149
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:30,250
just have the have the square footage

150
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:32,709
sit sit dormant for this year and plant

151
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,120
a cover crop on it um but we decided

152
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:38,168
that it was worth the challenge to go

153
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,610
ahead and take it on and it's so far

154
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:41,139
it's turning out okay I think it's not

155
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,229
gonna be a total failure but it's not

156
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,910
gonna be the most epic thing we knew

157
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:47,859
that coming in - we knew that we'd heard

158
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:52,479
you know some trials and tribulations

159
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:55,900
other places that inspired us and we

160
00:06:52,478 --> 00:07:00,639
also feel that with hopefully the market

161
00:06:55,899 --> 00:07:04,929
being as low as it can get right now you

162
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:08,500
know that it's not going to affect us

163
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:12,038
too much and that the price per unit is

164
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,538
lower so at least you're using soil

165
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:15,459
that's already alive you know because

166
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:17,319
you use the soil from the 200 pound bag

167
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:19,509
or the 200 gallon bags and put them in

168
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,339
there you know a lot of people who will

169
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:24,279
build a Google culture from scratch

170
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:26,739
they'll use you know fresh you know

171
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,538
potting soil or something and then

172
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,050
they'll inoculate this and that and then

173
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:35,110
it really takes a year for it to kind of

174
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,449
all kind of gel together but by using

175
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,340
the soil that's already activated in it

176
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,709
I would think that as soon as your roots

177
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:43,779
of your newly transplanted plants hit

178
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:45,849
down its be like hitting the mother lode

179
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:48,069
and they're gonna like oh you know you

180
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,570
know here here's a raizou sphere here's

181
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:51,430
a here's you know the mycelium here's

182
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,459
everybody and then they'll and then I

183
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,949
guess that's the I hope right yeah

184
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:58,629
fingers crossed for sure right on so so

185
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:01,810
you said that you increased your plant

186
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:05,319
counts this year to give you more more

187
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,550
room for error essentially and and I

188
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,829
think you said that you're you're about

189
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,949
three times the size of what your

190
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:13,478
medical 215 grow was yeah yeah I think

191
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,519
somewhere around there we're not all

192
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:17,589
completely planted yet so it's it's

193
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,719
still up in the air but somewhere in

194
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:20,528
that neighborhood so one of the reasons

195
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,539
that

196
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:24,488
visited you before and why I just I'm

197
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:27,368
generally attracted to moon time

198
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:29,468
medicinals product is is because you use

199
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:32,639
KNF inputs right you're not a big fan of

200
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:37,509
bottled stuff and a lot of what you're

201
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:39,908
putting in starts on the farm and then

202
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:41,800
you know you fpj it and then you're

203
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:43,328
putting it on your own plants so so

204
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,448
everything's happening here

205
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:49,239
so two-part question number one can you

206
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:51,278
tell me a little bit about what you're

207
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,558
growing on the property that you're then

208
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:57,039
then then you're then fermenting and

209
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:59,558
then also what it's been like to scale

210
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,929
up from you know where you've been the

211
00:08:59,558 --> 00:09:03,698
last several years growing for what was

212
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:06,370
essentially a third of what you've got

213
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:08,438
going you know that kind of scaling you

214
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,299
know you're not using small mason jars

215
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:12,099
anymore right things get much bigger at

216
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:14,318
that point so so kind of color that in

217
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,680
for us would you yeah so so previously

218
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:19,419
using K and F on our veggie garden is

219
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,688
essentially the only experience that

220
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:24,519
we've had in it in previous years and we

221
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:28,299
do 2,000 square feet in the veggie

222
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:30,698
garden so when training is a good

223
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:33,128
training but when you scale it up to 13

224
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:35,349
5 you know it's a it's a challenge and

225
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:38,110
like you said starting out with mason

226
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:41,319
jars we've actually started to employ

227
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,110
our pickling crocks

228
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:45,578
that we've used in previous years for

229
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,519
kim cheese and Krauts and things like

230
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:54,099
that so i've got three large crocks that

231
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:56,558
we ferment various things we do horse

232
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,639
tail that's just harvested locally on

233
00:09:56,558 --> 00:10:00,360
the property

234
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,860
will do pea shoots from our cover crops

235
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,980
that's one thing that we grow purposely

236
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:08,318
for that we'll do lemon balm to add for

237
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,199
terpenes to to our plants we're hoping

238
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:13,899
that the the correlation there

239
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:18,248
translates straight to our plants will

240
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:19,629
do trying to think what else would do

241
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:23,769
some of our cannabis plants will do our

242
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:25,778
males will do get some comfrey comfrey

243
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:29,980
comes along for sure that'll go in there

244
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:33,139
at times thistle just anything that

245
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:38,350
grows around the property and is

246
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:40,580
it's very vigorous and doesn't show much

247
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:43,100
susceptibility to anything is what we

248
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:46,009
like to use thistles is a really good

249
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:51,019
one in the horse tail probably two

250
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:53,990
really good examples of that but but

251
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:57,620
yeah beyond that we've we've got into

252
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,940
the L a B and we've got into some of the

253
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,610
other stuff we're just scratching the

254
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:06,130
surface on some of the on some of the

255
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:08,180
more complicated I guess ok enough

256
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:10,279
ferments we're really excited about

257
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:11,959
getting the fish going we're gonna

258
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,029
source some fish from for mountain

259
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,000
shelter Co from a commercial fisherman

260
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:19,549
so that'll be good you know if you're

261
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,429
gonna do that you should listen to the

262
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:24,620
the interview I did with Chris Trump he

263
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:26,629
talks about how while you're doing that

264
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,990
for your plans also do something for

265
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:31,399
your own fish sauce for your house you

266
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,870
know and he's all like he's all like you

267
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,840
wouldn't think you want to eat it but oh

268
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,100
my god it's so good so I might I might

269
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,330
need to get some of that from you too

270
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,250
yeah um so so let's talk a little bit

271
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,900
about the trade-off of you know right so

272
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,690
you're you're you know you've never been

273
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:50,779
a big bottle guy and now you're really

274
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:54,470
going whole into producing your own

275
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:56,360
inputs it takes time right it takes the

276
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,250
time to eat yourself educated to collect

277
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,600
the stuff on the property to go through

278
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,230
and ferment it you have to wait for it

279
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,639
to ferment then you're straining and and

280
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,830
you know bottling part doesn't take much

281
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,509
time and then and then implementing it

282
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,009
whereas other people are all like and

283
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:13,129
they open the bottle and they go to town

284
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:16,700
right yeah what do you see the trade-off

285
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:21,500
being behind the the time that it takes

286
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:25,100
to produce the the ferments and the the

287
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:28,730
your yield increases versus saving the

288
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,259
time and using a bottle and you know

289
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,330
because that's a that's a trade-off and

290
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:34,639
I and I know you weigh those in very

291
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:38,090
particular ways yeah I certainly do I

292
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:41,000
feel a lot of the nutrients in the

293
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,530
bottle and ingredients that I use tend

294
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,960
to be really expensive they're high

295
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:47,759
quality

296
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:51,629
the nutrients or microbes and I've just

297
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,429
found that with the way the markets

298
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:56,460
going the way the margins are shrinking

299
00:12:53,429 --> 00:13:00,870
that that is the best way that I know of

300
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:02,100
to to increase my bottom line is to take

301
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:08,220
out the things that I can certainly

302
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:10,139
control and we we love microbes we'd

303
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,149
love to put as many different microbes

304
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:15,240
as we can into the soil that's been our

305
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:17,069
strategy in years past but now we're

306
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,210
just trying to make them on our own by

307
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:22,890
doing the IMO boxes and and you know

308
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:26,910
doing different doing different things

309
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:30,529
to harness what we have locally and try

310
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:35,299
and use that as our goal and I feel like

311
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:37,980
the time that that takes is directly

312
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:40,740
equivalent if not a money savings to

313
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:45,480
going and buying a bottle of nutrients

314
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:47,519
somewhere and you know it goes without

315
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,050
saying the environmental impact of the

316
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,460
of the waste and stuff like that the

317
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:54,719
micro plastics or or something yeah it

318
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,060
totally gets you and you know like this

319
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,590
you know you're a probiotic grower right

320
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:59,609
and so the idea that you're producing

321
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,590
your own inputs

322
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,960
I would think offers a lot of

323
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,730
self-satisfaction - right like I'm doing

324
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,670
it my way dammit you know that kind of

325
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,649
doing yeah so um so the last question I

326
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:12,449
have for you is that you know this is a

327
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:15,990
really you know this is a

328
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:18,570
once-in-a-lifetime summer this summer

329
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,639
because you know people have shifted to

330
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,980
the licensed and taxed environment and

331
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,250
you know you've been a farmer for years

332
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:29,250
and years and you got into your cycle of

333
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:32,009
how you spread your time when you do

334
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:35,580
things and you get into a you know a

335
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:37,110
farmer routine but then this year you're

336
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,150
you're having to deal with like all this

337
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:42,240
other random stuff like like find a

338
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:46,009
distributor develop packaging develop

339
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,560
your new website and and logos you know

340
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:52,470
you know find extraction partners go to

341
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,919
County meetings go to your track and

342
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:59,540
trace class

343
00:14:54,919 --> 00:15:02,360
and and and in okay work with PG need a

344
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:04,009
fight to try to get your power here what

345
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,749
you know what's your experience been

346
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:11,028
this year that's unique in trying to do

347
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:12,319
all of that bureaucratic stuff while

348
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:14,958
you're also actually just trying to be a

349
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:19,389
farmer yeah it's it's been a big

350
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:22,748
challenge we we staffed up a little bit

351
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:27,379
from years past I guess just recently

352
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:29,689
initially I tried to try to do it with

353
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:31,220
just me and my lead cultivator and I

354
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:33,349
found that I was being pulled in way too

355
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:37,129
many different directions and we needed

356
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:38,869
to bring a couple more guys in so we

357
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:41,509
brought in a couple new hires they've

358
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:42,980
been great additions and they've they've

359
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:44,568
picked up on a lot of things they've

360
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,329
brought a lot of their own knowledge in

361
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:51,188
which is good from the from the Humboldt

362
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:54,739
State botany and Forestry Department so

363
00:15:51,188 --> 00:16:02,719
we've had we've had a lot of really good

364
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:05,299
help and I'm lucky to have yeah I feel

365
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,259
like that's that's been the the big

366
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:10,998
thing is while I love to be out and

367
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,919
getting my hands dirty I need to free

368
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:14,870
myself up and be able to do some things

369
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:20,149
in heaven some people that I can really

370
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:35,178
rely on even with the really high

371
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:37,129
quality everyone's distracted by legal

372
00:16:35,178 --> 00:16:39,470
and licensed related stuff that they've

373
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,970
got it - are you finding that that you

374
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,928
and your people are kind of behind -

375
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:54,079
just because it's such an

376
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:56,299
extraordinarily yeah you know it's

377
00:16:54,078 --> 00:17:00,199
already showing some benefits and

378
00:16:56,299 --> 00:17:02,719
you know it's it's good to see it's good

379
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:09,710
to get it done it all the way something

380
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:12,740
that we strongly water conservation is

381
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:16,720

382
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,720
