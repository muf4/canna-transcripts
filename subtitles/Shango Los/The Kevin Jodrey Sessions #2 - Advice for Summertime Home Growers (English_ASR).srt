1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,529
so Kevin you know you are an expert

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,259
consultant to big commercial grows all

3
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:13,959
over the world and so you know you know

4
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:15,640
how to grow cannabis at scale but now

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,560
all over the country the reverse is

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,539
happening right folks can home grow they

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,070
can grow four six plants or something so

8
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:23,140
they can you know get their hands in the

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,268
soil and be more self-sufficient with

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,509
their cannabis well as somebody who

11
00:00:25,268 --> 00:00:30,459
helps foster these huge grows at

12
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:32,618
commercial level what kind of advice do

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,558
you have for a home grower who's gonna

14
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:37,689
grow their 4 or 6 plants so that they

15
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:39,729
can have an optimum experience based on

16
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:42,459
your depth of experience with commercial

17
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:44,529
size grows don't look at the commercial

18
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,378
model whatsoever because that's based

19
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,808
off of efficiency for sale and

20
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:52,058
production you for the individual what

21
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:53,530
you're looking for is experience part of

22
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:56,858
the experiences you actually work on it

23
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:59,230
yourself and the experience of having a

24
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:00,910
holistic healthy organic model if you

25
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:02,588
can see I don't fault anybody for

26
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:04,838
growing cannabis in their closet with a

27
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:06,700
single light using a one part chemical

28
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:08,439
because if that's the tool you have to

29
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,570
work with and that's what you're limited

30
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:12,219
to afford and that's the barrier that

31
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:14,379
you have to get around to be able to do

32
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:15,849
it then that's where you begin and you

33
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:17,530
look for the best genetics you can get

34
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:19,349
your hands on and you put the best

35
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,180
effort you can

36
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,158
you put the the effort in that's

37
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,770
required to get the result that you need

38
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,830
as you is you go forward on this

39
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:31,048
gradient from the least resources to the

40
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,579
most it's not about spending more and

41
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,259
more money it's the opposite it's about

42
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,000
trying to spend less and less money and

43
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,829
if you're someone who can do four to six

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,359
in California six plans you're trying to

45
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,310
build a situation that allows you to

46
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,500
develop some kind of soil situation

47
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,728
that's self-sustaining so that what you

48
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,489
have is you have a permaculture

49
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:49,049
situation where your garden is

50
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:50,609
absolutely able to give you quality

51
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,069
cannabis every year with almost no cost

52
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:55,859
and you want to make it as simple as

53
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,780
possible for you so that you have an

54
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,099
ability to enjoy the flowers and simple

55
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,469
in this case would be put a watering

56
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:03,780
system in and you build organic models

57
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,969
that allow you to do very little effort

58
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,469
on that end of it the effort is applied

59
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,699
to basically keeping the plant and

60
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,430
healthy through cleaning and inspection

61
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,379
and work on that nature and then what

62
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:18,060
you have is you have a very low effort

63
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:19,439
low input high quality product because

64
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,568
for most people that are growing for

65
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,000
plants they're not using it for economic

66
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:26,039
gain for six plants they're using it for

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,439
personal use consumption family use

68
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,789
consumption neighbor use consumption

69
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,599
because you can give away an ounce in

70
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:36,358
California you can share and so that

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,879
situation is a very different direction

72
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:40,739
and it allows you to be able to have a

73
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,299
life have a normal life you don't have

74
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,280
to spend twenty hours a week on your

75
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,500
garden you're only spending a little bit

76
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,659
of time on your garden to actually make

77
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,789
it happen and the rest of the time you

78
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,680
spend on your garden is not necessary

79
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:54,870
for the plant it's necessary for you

80
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,180
that's that's where you are spiritually

81
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,920
connected to a plant growth because I

82
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,560
think so many of us are disconnected so

83
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,048
I think so much of home growing is so

84
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,989
much more than just the end product it's

85
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:08,909
the process but once you do the process

86
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,140
my advice to people is once you know the

87
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:11,879
process put your hands in your pockets

88
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:13,919
that way you don't touch anything and

89
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,530
then then you can go and sit down in the

90
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,568
garden and just be around

91
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,219
and enjoy the terpenes that are coming

92
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:21,379
off of them that are volatize in through

93
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:23,719
the the natural sunlight hitting em and

94
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:26,629
then warming up watch the wind move them

95
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:28,759
about if it's indoor in your room smell

96
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:32,359
this beautiful smell that's lighting up

97
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:34,759
a stale indoor environment if it's if

98
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,160
it's even electric light experience the

99
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,169
way the the plant responds to the heat

100
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,389
of it and and how the plant moves in

101
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:43,939
tropism and you become enthralled with

102
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:46,309
this process of plants that do all these

103
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:49,159
incredible processes and never speak to

104
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,840
you never ask you for anything and so

105
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:53,329
you have to use all these other senses

106
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,890
that we don't develop typically and it

107
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,630
grounds you in a way that's different

108
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:58,309
and when you start to become a really

109
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:00,318
good cultivator where you're really

110
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,969
about what you're doing you start to

111
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:02,509
have this other awareness on what you

112
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:05,000
eat

113
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:06,949
on how the earth is treated in general

114
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,379
and you start to have this much more

115
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:11,268
human connection and a much more

116
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:14,000
spiritual connection to the actual

117
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:15,890
planet you're on and it allows you this

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,048
beautiful window into a world that you

119
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,149
haven't seen prior because our lives are

120
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:22,339
so rushed we go and we just buy product

121
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:24,439
we use cannabis to change our tone but

122
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:25,789
when you produce the cannabis you're

123
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,918
gonna find you changing your tone

124
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,450
without ever consuming it and for a lot

125
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:33,439
of people that consumption becomes

126
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,879
second to the production process and I

127
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,370
think for me it's always most important

128
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,649
to get lost in that process but but make

129
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,209
sure it fits your schedule so they don't

130
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:43,399
know are they doing it you know a lot of

131
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:45,168
people say you know that cannabis is a

132
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,849
gateway but cannabis is a gateway to

133
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:48,949
horticulture right because you just do

134
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,500
that I think it opened up organic AG I

135
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:53,360
think that use the organic aggravation

136
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,519
in America was funded primarily by

137
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,229
people who are in urban areas that had

138
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,120
exceptional monies or they could they

139
00:04:57,228 --> 00:05:00,439
could afford to make choice and then all

140
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,699
of us that were in cannabis production

141
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:03,529
all over the United States because we're

142
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:05,360
like why are we feeding our plants and

143
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:08,149
building soils so well and buying

144
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,230
supermarket food it became this

145
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:13,939
we strange paradigm of wait a minute I

146
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,950
don't put anything toxic on the plants I

147
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:18,019
don't do anything bad to my stuff I'm

148
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:20,990
against all these processes with my

149
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:23,209
cannabis but I'll consume fast food and

150
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,379
you started to see this awareness occur

151
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:26,509
with the growers where they started to

152
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:28,159
realize wait a second I'm growing

153
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:30,860
cannabis that's far healthier than my

154
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,580
food supply and you start to begin to

155
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,080
grow your own food and then you also

156
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:37,939
start to frequent farmers market so that

157
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,259
you can you can support local farmers

158
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:41,269
growing the food that you know you

159
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:42,740
should eat because you're so aware the

160
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:45,889
inputs on the cannabis and how it

161
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,840
reflects in the the end result and so I

162
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:49,969
think that cannabis cultivation in the

163
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,709
United States was so big and lucrative

164
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,480
enough that it gave people the

165
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:55,669
disposable income to choose to go

166
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,230
organically when prior they couldn't

167
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,030
because they've made organic AG so

168
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,040
unbelievably expensive in its production

169
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:03,019
methodology to get to the store and sell

170
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,939
that it precludes regular people from

171
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:07,159
buying it and then all of a sudden is

172
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:08,810
this massive paradigm shift and what we

173
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,550
should consume Annie and I think the

174
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,560
cannabis really drove it but from a

175
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,120
secret level no one really knew what was

176
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,089
pushing this incredible consumption

177
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,500
because where'd the money come from

178
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:20,599
you point out that really there's only

179
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,660
two steps to the home growers process

180
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,100
one build soil so that you don't have to

181
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,750
buying all these bottled nutrients and

182
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,270
spending all these extra money and then

183
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,889
number two you'll be present with the

184
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:31,969
plan so that you can see their changes

185
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:34,129
and they can talk to you and tell you

186
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,650
anything that they'll that you need you

187
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:38,300
know they say the best fertilizer for a

188
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:40,729
plant is the growers shadow

189
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,800
yeah a Chinese proverb yeah so I dry

190
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,000
that me too no I totally do and a lot of

191
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,319
it is you know people say I'm working

192
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,399
ten hours a day in my garden and I'm

193
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,170
like what do you do if then I was a day

194
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,849
and garden lead only took an hour and a

195
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,290
half the other the other eight and a

196
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,780
half hours shouldn't be considered work

197
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,760
it should be considered leisure but

198
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:57,049
leisure in a positive way people believe

199
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,870
that if you're not constantly being

200
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,759
industrious you're lazy and that's not

201
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,620
the human condition we didn't work

202
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,149
non-stop until basically electric lights

203
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,180
came out and people who did work

204
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:09,069
non-stop called slaves and you don't

205
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,110
want to be a slave to yourself

206
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:12,879
constantly grinding and so when you get

207
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,949
into a cannabis situation with plants

208
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,839
there's something calming from the

209
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,610
release of the terpene profiles that are

210
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:22,000
just naturally zooming off of them in

211
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,680
vegetative state and in flower and I see

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,689
it when I have people in Gardens where I

213
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,220
see them relaxed and it changes their

214
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,139
complete demeanor I've watched this for

215
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,700
years and so I realize that's one of the

216
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:34,599
things that's so powerful for us is that

217
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:36,969
you can allow this process which we

218
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,890
normally consider work to be something

219
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,510
that's therapeutic and healing and most

220
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:43,959
people don't get that from their jobs

221
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:45,430
and cannabis has that ability and so you

222
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,589
can have people that love to grow

223
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,030
cannabis for the other people in their

224
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:52,060
home so you may be able to grow six

225
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:54,879
plants per parcel in California and say

226
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,040
I grow it but it's my it's my girl or my

227
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,379
other people live in my house that are

228
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,760
the ones who consume it I may be a small

229
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:03,670
consumer and that's not the case with me

230
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,740
but it is it's the reality that you have

231
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:08,410
people who love to grow and cultivate

232
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,480
cannabis like they do flowers like they

233
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,210
do all forms of horticultural flora

234
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,280
culture agriculture and they're not

235
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:16,959
really about the consumption on the end

236
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,119
of it because it's the process that

237
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,819
allows it to happen and it doesn't have

238
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,439
to be complicated the complicated part

239
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:24,759
is really to understand that living soil

240
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,000
is about as complicated as it could

241
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,689
possibly be because of this incredible

242
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,490
interrelationship between all these

243
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:32,830
different organisms that make a delivery

244
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,860
possible but you learning how to do that

245
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,330
over time is this incredible experience

246
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,680
of the human life existence so it's

247
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,660
something that we don't get which is

248
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:44,339
really everyday living science project

249
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,339
yeah right on cool thank you welcome
