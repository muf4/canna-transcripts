1
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,638
hey there friends shango here from

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,040
shaping fire and i'm with my good buddy

3
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,919
tyler marquart who's here as well

4
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:18,559
um we are here to talk about uh tyler's

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,480
bookner funnel technique and some of you

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,320
may have already seen the video that we

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,278
did i don't know almost two years ago

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,240
now

9
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:28,800
when he was here when he had just

10
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,879
figured out this technique and um you

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,320
know he tyler helps me with hash all the

12
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,839
time and so um he came up uh

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,719
to do that with me and then he brought

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,520
this get up with him and i'm all like oh

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,120
my god i am i'm always gonna use this

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,440
when i make hash from here on out and so

17
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,959
um so we posted that video on youtube

18
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,920
and i told some people about it on

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,000
instagram and the response was like

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,920
pretty significant um people were pretty

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,119
stoked to have an option um that dries

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,000
out their hash very quickly um without

23
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,280
the high budget tool of a freeze dryer

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,640
and like i mean i think we all want a

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,280
freeze dryer right freeze dryers are

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,719
great and and totally are useful um but

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,879
like you know a lot of us are balling on

28
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,719
a budget and this definitely falls in

29
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,560
that category so

30
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,000
um so i was talking with tyler and since

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,359
he was going to be up here on vashon

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
island this weekend helping me out i

33
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,239
said hey man let's go ahead and do an

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,920
update video because the first one we

35
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,079
did we didn't actually realize was gonna

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,680
be such like a big hit and um we did

37
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,359
kind of a pretty quick abbreviated

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,920
version and i'm all like well you might

39
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,400
we might as well do a longer version

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,439
with all of the best practices that he

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,000
has developed um you know in the last 18

42
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,839
months or whatever and so so here we are

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,159
with this so tyler thanks for joining me

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,159
thank you for having me all right so so

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,960
let's start with the the purpose what is

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,880
the purpose of the device so this device

47
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,559
will help uh

48
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:01,438
hashmakers at home dry their hash faster

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,079
so there's a reduction in any sort of

50
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,798
contamination through mold issues from

51
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,199
having too much water in your material

52
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,520
it's gonna allow

53
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,318
water to come out really quickly

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,080
and uh by doing that um you're giving

55
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,479
yourself a much better chance to have a

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,400
higher end quality product around so

57
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,318
let's let's go through the equipment

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,239
first because i'm sure there's a lot of

59
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,679
folks out there like me who who were not

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,759
familiar with the buckner funnel at

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360
first so so why don't you start at the

62
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,359
top and work our way through to the

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,200
vacuum pump absolutely so at the top

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,319
here we're going to have

65
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,839
the this hairband just uh i belong here

66
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,119
so this works out well for me you could

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,360
use a variety of different things a

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,959
rubber band but this is just what i have

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,280
on hand

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,959
and that is going to secure the piece of

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,159
aluminium foil

72
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,759
which has a very small hole in it here

73
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,959
you can use the tip of a pen to poke

74
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,598
that through

75
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,280
this is going to create a suction device

76
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,878
other people on the internet who have

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,719
been using this have shown me that

78
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,878
they've used tupperware

79
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,359
tops or some sort of plastic top and

80
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,560
they've been burping it a little bit

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,560
there's a variety of different things

82
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,560
that you can use i just had this readily

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,560
available so that's what i ended up

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,360
using and it works really well

85
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,479
if you don't make the hole big enough it

86
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,879
will

87
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,238
pop this off into the air um and you'll

88
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:24,239
be very surprised at that when that

89
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:27,120
happens um then we have the actual uh

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,640
top piece here which is connected to um

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,400
the vacuum pump

92
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,559
this has a glass frit disc in it and it

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,039
has a tube on the inside

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,759
which allows a vacuum to be pulled

95
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,598
through the flask and so

96
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,719
you could use a variety of different

97
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,119
sizes

98
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,400
this is a 500 mil top and a 2000

99
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,878
milliliter

100
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,080
flask um you can

101
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,679
this is more

102
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,439
stable right very giving you the

103
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,159
stability i at my place i use a 1 000

104
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,639
milliliter flask and a 1 000 milliliter

105
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:04,158
or i'm sorry a 500 milliliter flask in a

106
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,399
1000 milliliter um funnel and that

107
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,560
allows me to put larger amounts in and

108
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,039
still pull a tight vacuum

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,199
then going from the tube here

110
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,719
into the vacuum pump

111
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,358
is pretty much all the parts so you have

112
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,759
one two three four five six parts in

113
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,439
total to the to the equipment right on

114
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,560
so a couple things i want to point out

115
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,319
um this uh this frit disc which is

116
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,040
essentially um

117
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,279
a filter uh it's built in so you don't

118
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,879
buy these separately this is one piece

119
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,159
which i didn't realize at first when i

120
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,800
was first starting to shop for it um

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,120
there you go um and

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,759
so so ty just to give people a general

123
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,000
idea um you know the the pumps kind of

124
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,439
like it's separate things so this piece

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,800
and this piece which is where um

126
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,000
i actually don't know if it's mostly

127
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,520
expense

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,040
what is what's what should people

129
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,879
somebody pay expect to pay for that on

130
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,400
like amazon or something for sure so you

131
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,639
can get in a variety of different sizes

132
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,399
but this is going to be less than 75

133
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,240
dollars for the two of them depending on

134
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,319
the type of glass the quality of glass

135
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,319
like everything has quality ranges right

136
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,079
and so depending on where you get it

137
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,399
from and all that it's gonna be less

138
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,439
than a hundred dollars wow yeah much

139
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,599
less than a

140
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,319
freeze dryer yeah absolutely all right

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,800
so so now we know we're we're using it

142
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,000
to take water out of the hash material

143
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,879
very quickly

144
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,478
and um and it's it's an affordable

145
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:31,038
option so so will you walk us through

146
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,360
the using of it yep absolutely so what

147
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,478
we'll do is we'll take the hash out of

148
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,080
the bag

149
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:40,079
when we're pulling um the the 45 bag or

150
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,038
the 73 or the 90 whatever you decide to

151
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:46,079
use take that material out put it onto a

152
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,399
screen um we we've been using these five

153
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,079
inch by five inch screens um that were

154
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:54,560
provided by the press club for us to use

155
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:56,800
here and that then goes on into the

156
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,918
funnel area and you place it down lay it

157
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,680
flat

158
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,599
i find that often

159
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,439
slicing the patty a little bit will help

160
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,800
with air getting through

161
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,439
and allowing it to dry a little bit

162
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,720
faster you don't have to do that

163
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,918
once that's on there you're going to

164
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,000
want to take the aluminum foil here

165
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,839
put it on the top

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,839
secure it with whatever device that you

167
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,638
have again you don't have to use

168
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,478
aluminum foil you can use a plastic lid

169
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,918
they probably actually make if you're

170
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,680
into chemistry and you work in a

171
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,359
chemistry lab there probably is a device

172
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,959
that they actually legitimately make for

173
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,759
this i just haven't looked for it yet

174
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,120
because

175
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,560
this works really well this is just in

176
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,800
my kitchen and just

177
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,680
one less thing to purchase on and over

178
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,319
um

179
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,160
and yeah so then you hook up the the

180
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,400
tubing here make sure the tubing is

181
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,520
attached um this has um

182
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,959
uh

183
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,639
i can't remember the name of it now but

184
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,638
it it it'll

185
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,560
attach itself without coming off it

186
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,960
won't the vacuum won't pull the tube off

187
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,399
so you don't have to secure that

188
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,399
to that at all

189
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,198
and then on this side i did secure it

190
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,758
with a um

191
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,598
a amount and so that's mounted to that

192
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,080
um when you purchase these pumps

193
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,159
something to note is that they usually

194
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,240
need to be filled with oil um so you

195
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,639
will have to buy some vacuum pump oil

196
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,800
you can purchase that at your local like

197
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,400
auto store um i think i went to like

198
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,639
o'reilly's or something like that and

199
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,038
like just they had a bottle there

200
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,680
but vacuum pump oil uh it needs to be

201
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,360
specific vacuum pump oil and uh and then

202
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,038
they have a max minimum line usually on

203
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,800
the outside and there also is like a um

204
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,800
a glass chamber you can see how much oil

205
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,759
you have in there so that helps you set

206
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,160
that up

207
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,520
once it's all hooked up uh

208
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,280
and everything's attached like we have

209
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,879
here and the hash is in there just turn

210
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,239
the pump on

211
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,159
i let it run in between the runs so uh

212
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,400
when i make hash i usually do a three

213
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,560
minute run uh depending on the quality

214
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,719
of the hash and and all the

215
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,839
standards that go around it

216
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,000
three minutes

217
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,159
allows it to pull most of the water out

218
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,519
it's still going to be wet it's not 100

219
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,759
dry um it's not like a miracle like but

220
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,240
you can see individual granule you know

221
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,080
yeah it turns it from like what is

222
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,199
essentially wet mud

223
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,240
to being

224
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,800
just barely damp sand correct and like

225
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,439
that's such i mean that saves two days

226
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,120
at least of oxidation

227
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,279
doing it with like dehumidifiers and

228
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
fans absolutely absolutely and so yeah

229
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,399
so once you're at that stage it just

230
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,560
starts pulling through

231
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,478
you can see in this that we've pulled

232
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,958
from today we've pulled out a fair

233
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:36,080
amount of water um just from what we've

234
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,199
we've run here um

235
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,360
yeah

236
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,278
right on so let's talk about the vacuum

237
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,200
pump um i know when we did our last

238
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:48,000
video um we were using um aquarium pumps

239
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,839
right yeah so would you compare like the

240
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,639
experience of using an aquarium pump

241
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,440
versus using this badass [ __ ] yeah yeah

242
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,480
absolutely this uh really moves air

243
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,040
faster

244
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,440
also having a smaller

245
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,639
base and a smaller top will help pull

246
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,399
the vacuum harder faster too um but

247
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:11,039
mostly this is a fork cfm cubic feet per

248
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,559
minute pump and uh the other ones we

249
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,799
were using were like .2 or 0.5 so um

250
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,799
this really just made a huge difference

251
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,359
and these are like less than 100 i think

252
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,879
this one was like 79 or it came out to

253
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,480
be like nine so really this is like 200

254
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,639
bucks all in 200

255
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,240
you know maybe this is a couple uh you

256
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,278
go to home depot and or your local

257
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,440
hardware store and you can find the

258
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,519
tubing there for you know a couple bucks

259
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,080
a foot or a couple uh with inflation who

260
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,240
knows what it is

261
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,920
it's not expensive for less than 200 or

262
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,360
250 bucks you're pretty much set and

263
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,559
ready to go right on and um you know if

264
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,159
if you want to take a look at these

265
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,479
parts um i'm gonna post links below uh

266
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,679
to these and then you know you know if

267
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,278
you want to get something else by all

268
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,559
means but you can actually see what what

269
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:59,679
we're rocking here um in the links below

270
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,439
so um so now tyler like like

271
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,479
i've been watching you all day as we've

272
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,279
been doing

273
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,720
you know these these rounds

274
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,799
you're you've got the hash and it's on

275
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,879
the mesh screen

276
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,639
and then you turn on it and it like

277
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,278
pulls down the water which is like

278
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,679
obvious and amazing and then you take it

279
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,078
off what do you do when you take it off

280
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,120
of um the bookner funnel yep so when we

281
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:24,799
take it out we're gonna put it on the

282
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,799
table we take a knife and just kind of

283
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,838
chop it up a little bit more break it up

284
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,838
so that it gets more surface area and

285
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,079
then you have a lot of different options

286
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,440
you can go from there um i've been using

287
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,000
a wine fridge

288
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,920
wine fridges are about can be set uh the

289
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,679
digital ones you can set to about 45

290
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,639
degrees so it's a good temperature to

291
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:47,439
keep the that down they also sometimes

292
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,360
keep the humidity low in the 50 to 60

293
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,760
percent range which is good

294
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,680
so that'll help it dry a little faster

295
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,240
we've also found that putting dry ice

296
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:59,359
into that or putting dry ice into a

297
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,399
cooler with a cookie

298
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,879
drying sheet or sorry the the cookie

299
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,240
aluminum um

300
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,799
like a wire rack

301
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,278
the wire racks uh the the cookie drying

302
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:15,120
wire racks those uh you put those down

303
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:18,399
and you uh then put the uh um

304
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,240
the 25 micron or 15 micron whatever size

305
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,720
you decide to use sheet on that with a

306
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,560
hash on it and then the dry ice will act

307
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,839
as a desiccant and pull the rest of the

308
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,679
water out

309
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,440
you can use a cooler like if you have a

310
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,559
cooler to go to the beach with or take a

311
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,920
picnic

312
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,599
and then put that in there with the dry

313
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,719
ice and that will help pull the rest of

314
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,159
it out

315
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,519
but essentially in less than 36 hours or

316
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,679
24 hours depending on how much material

317
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,679
you have obviously the more

318
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,239
hash you're making the

319
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,719
more space you need to dry and and so

320
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,039
forth um but once you have that figured

321
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,360
out within 24 to 36 hours you're pretty

322
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:58,719
much ready to go

323
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,039
so so you say 24 to 36 hours break that

324
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,160
out into how much time it's at each

325
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:07,199
place so of that time is it like

326
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:09,679
you know 24 to 36 hours but only the

327
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,480
first like 10 minutes is in this like

328
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,120
like

329
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,278
like um give me the location of the hash

330
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,519
for those 24 hours yeah it's a it's also

331
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,000
a nuanced thing i think to start with is

332
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,480
what is your relative to humidity um i

333
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,480
live in california near the beach so uh

334
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,800
we are in an area where in the mornings

335
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,839
it's 90 humidity easy pretty much almost

336
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,278
every day

337
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,440
it drops in the afternoon and then back

338
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,200
up in the evening and so you have to be

339
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,240
conscious of what your relative humidity

340
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,680
is um unless you're using a dehumidifier

341
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,278
in the room or the tent that you're

342
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,519
you're washing and stuff or you're

343
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,000
processing all this in um so that is

344
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,440
kind of your biggest mitigating factor

345
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,519
but um

346
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,200
when you pull the hash out of the bag

347
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,120
you put it in here i'm running it for

348
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,360
about three to six minutes depending on

349
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,360
how long i make my runs so if i'm making

350
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,480
a three minute run on the uh on the

351
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,039
machine

352
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,440
this will the run before that will will

353
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,958
be drying in here uh once uh the machine

354
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,600
stops and i'm draining while it's

355
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,119
draining i go i'll pull this out move it

356
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,800
set this up so that i can move the next

357
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,879
one in and then kind of cycle through

358
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,479
like that if i find that the material

359
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,480
isn't like the best material and i can

360
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,680
wash it at six minutes it dries a little

361
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,360
bit faster

362
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,919
it does seem like there's a bell curve

363
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,680
where like if you do have high humidity

364
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,958
it'll dry it out but then all of a

365
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,439
sudden it starts getting a little bit

366
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,278
more moisture back into it um but again

367
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,360
it's it always i think associated with

368
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,679
the relative humidity the in in the

369
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,240
immediate area that you're working in uh

370
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,000
once it's it's in there um three to six

371
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,360
minutes usually it's pretty good 10

372
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,360
minutes we'll get it really really

373
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,519
really pretty dry like we saw you're

374
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,839
like cutting it almost in the sand yeah

375
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,919
and um and then after that it's just

376
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,399
move it into the the dry chambers and

377
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:51,439
break it up put it in the dry chamber

378
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,720
and then i was taking a sieve and

379
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,959
putting it in there

380
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,278
sieving it up and then that opens up the

381
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,838
airflow even more i love more surface

382
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,519
area and and it dries it even faster

383
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,360
within a couple hours after that it's

384
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,919
pretty good to go right on

385
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,839
so um as we all know this has been an

386
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,958
evolving technique right like you're

387
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,639
doing it more sophisticated than we did

388
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,319
whatever there was 18 months ago when we

389
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,480
recorded the first video

390
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,800
um are there any uh problem points that

391
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,039
you are experiencing now that you are

392
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,799
trying to sort out at this point like

393
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,958
because like you know um all of us in

394
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,039
cannabis we trade best practices right

395
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,679
so so are there any solutions that

396
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,120
you're looking for that um that other

397
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,198
people could be thinking about yeah so

398
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,039
there's a couple things uh one uh

399
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,439
somebody online mentioned putting in a

400
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,599
vapor trap here um so that either oil

401
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,399
doesn't go back in or you can collect

402
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,399
terpenes and stuff that comes out um

403
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,240
that's pretty good idea you know and we

404
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,120
obviously don't want oil pumping back

405
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,799
into the the situation i haven't seen

406
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,560
any uh

407
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,000
traces of that or anything because it

408
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,679
would also have to go all the way back

409
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,360
up past the front disc past the other

410
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,838
micron filter so there's some other

411
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,320
stuff that i have to go through um let's

412
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,399
hit on that a second time because

413
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,680
as you know youtube jerk boys you know

414
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,159
they like leave all these stupid

415
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,519
comments and um

416
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,000
there have been like a couple people who

417
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,039
have left like like eye-rolling comments

418
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,360
about how

419
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,599
using this technique is gonna make your

420
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,199
hash taste like oil right

421
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,399
and like ugh

422
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:26,559
but um would you explain just like for

423
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,399
the back of the room why

424
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,799
the oil from the pump is not going to

425
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,198
end up in your hash yeah the the amount

426
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,159
of pressure coming through is so much

427
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,919
it's just

428
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,838
i mean this is what i've been using for

429
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,679
the last two months and there's no oil

430
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,959
in here at all and you can see it hasn't

431
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,719
been collecting any oil so um you know

432
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,879
having it as a preventative measure sure

433
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,480
would be great um it's an added cost

434
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:52,559
that maybe you know somebody can't

435
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,879
afford if it's a 50 unit or 100 unit

436
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,479
i don't think it's needed personally um

437
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,399
i haven't had any

438
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,039
uh any of the hash tastes like it's

439
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,320
flavored off or anything like that um

440
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,078
and i looked under a microscope i

441
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,399
haven't seen anything awkward or any

442
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,239
sheens or anything like that so for that

443
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,919
nature i i don't think that it's

444
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,320
particularly needed but you know for

445
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,639
somebody who maybe wants to

446
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,000
be extra careful sure or if you want to

447
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,278
experiment have the money and you find

448
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,519
out that it does make a difference and

449
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,439
you can do an a b run and have it tested

450
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,799
for petrochemicals then

451
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,480
that that's awesome you know we

452
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,639
definitely encourage people to take this

453
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,320
and and expand it even more and if you

454
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,198
have those capabilities to do sort of

455
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,199
that r d um let us know what what turns

456
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,519
out so that we can let other people know

457
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,359
last time we posted the video there were

458
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,360
like a whole bunch of comments from

459
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,278
people saying like you know dude you

460
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,759
need to monetize this why are you giving

461
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,600
this [ __ ] away from free some some some

462
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,079
chad's gonna like like bring this into

463
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,920
the market and make all your money and

464
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,198
just to kind of like pre-answer the

465
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,039
people who are going to comment below

466
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,958
the video what is your answer to this

467
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,120
yeah i mean i didn't really invent

468
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,278
anything i literally just took things

469
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,720
that existed and was like whoa and i'm

470
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:01,838
sure other people have already done this

471
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,040
i mean other people have mentioned that

472
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,558
they're like oh yeah i did that a few

473
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,159
years ago or something so it's not like

474
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,078
something that uh like i'm like i'm the

475
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,798
inventor of this put my name on it like

476
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:13,038
that's impo it's i literally just was

477
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,439
working i've been working in a lab and i

478
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,439
saw this equipment and it just

479
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,959
hit and i was like i was thinking about

480
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,038
buying a freeze dryer one day and i was

481
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,400
like i really don't want to spend 3 500

482
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,160
bucks to 5 000

483
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,839
on a freeze dryer like there's got to be

484
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,360
something other other way around it and

485
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,399
it just kind of clicked

486
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,399
and you know being a patient and having

487
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,559
access to high quality medicine is

488
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,600
always like uh important to me uh i

489
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,839
thought why not just get this

490
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,439
information out i'm not manufacturing

491
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,959
something that's unique like somebody

492
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,200
else manufactures this somebody else

493
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,519
might i would basically be a middleman

494
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,880
for like you know selling lab equipment

495
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,400
to somebody where you could just go buy

496
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,799
it off of amazon i'm not going to mark

497
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,240
it up 20 because i'm the guy who

498
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,000
invented it right right right brought it

499
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,919
up or something like that

500
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and also you know one of the reasons why

501
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,240
tyler and i became friends early on is

502
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,558
we both really believe in the

503
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,839
self-sufficiency of patients

504
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:08,079
and um not everybody has got uh you know

505
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,240
the budget for a freeze dryer or a sexy

506
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,159
lab or all these things we're just

507
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,919
trying to like you know do some home

508
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,600
grow and process it into hash

509
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,200
that so that we have easy access to

510
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:24,959
medicine and we can um you know make

511
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,679
using licensed stores an option for us

512
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,079
instead of making us have to use them

513
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,240
right and that kind of independence i

514
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,720
think is really important for people who

515
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,798
rely on their cannabis medicine so yeah

516
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,400
all right so to wrap this up

517
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:42,480
um um you know this is a continually

518
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,120
continuing to evolve technology

519
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,720
so if you have ideas uh that might

520
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,359
improve on this by all means leave them

521
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,759
in the comments and then um tyler you

522
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:55,199
often talk about this technique on your

523
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,919
instagram and um as you come up with

524
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,558
like um new best practices you share

525
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,880
them so where can people follow you on

526
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,079
instagram if they want to find out more

527
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,480
and kind of just follow along with your

528
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,519
trip yep my instagram handle is just my

529
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,079
name tyler marquardt and uh i pushed it

530
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,599
on there also i'm linked in too um so if

531
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,038
you're on there you can find uh some

532
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,038
information on there as well which

533
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,599
basically shoots you back to my ig yeah

534
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,960
shoots you over to shaping fire um but

535
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,119
yeah those are pretty much the two spots

536
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,558
that i'm not on facebook so right on all

537
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,038
right cool well thank you for interest

538
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,160
in the bookner funnel technique and

539
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,000
thank you tyler for sharing it with

540
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,679
everybody appreciate it all right thanks

541
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,519
all right so now we're going to take the

542
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,080
hash which is on the screen that we've

543
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,200
cut out uh and we're going to place it

544
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,359
inside of the buckner funnel

545
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,200
[Music]

546
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,479
and make sure it sits in there then

547
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
we're going to take

548
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,798
our aluminium foil with a tiny little

549
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,639
hole in the top

550
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:52,160
we're going to place it on top

551
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,679
we're going to take a hair tie you can

552
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,120
use something else this is what i use

553
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,679
because i have it readily available for

554
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,959
my long hair

555
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,360
put it on

556
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,558
make sure it's secure

557
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,959
and then we're going to turn on the

558
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:05,960
vacuum pump

559
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,599
now you can see the water is coming out

560
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,720
of the buckner funnel into the bucket

561
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,918
flask

562
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,679
and it is pulling out water really

563
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,679
quickly

564
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,559
so in roughly three to six minutes it'll

565
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,480
be

566
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:29,480
substantially more dry than it was

567
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,480
before

568
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,038
you
