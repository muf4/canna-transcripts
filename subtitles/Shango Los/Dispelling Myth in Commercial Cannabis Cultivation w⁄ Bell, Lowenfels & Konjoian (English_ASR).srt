00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:15,558
hello thank you for being here and

2
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:18,500
welcome to the 2:30 panel on cultivation

3
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:19,879
myths please silence your cell phones

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,399
we've been having a heck of a lot a

5
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,320
problem with that today I am Shango

6
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,239
Lowe's host of the shaping fire podcast

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,129
if you like listening to smart

8
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,778
interviews with the top minds in

9
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:32,839
cannabis I invite you to check out the

10
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:35,058
show at shaping fire calm we also have

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,890
an extraordinary YouTube channel with

12
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:39,799
over 150 speaker videos I recorded

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,870
events just like this one in fact all

14
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,048
three of our panelists today appear on

15
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:48,500
the shaping fire YouTube channel so our

16
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:52,088
speakers on our panel today are collin

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:55,399
bell - immediately to my right into him

18
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:57,588
his co-founder of his co-founder and

00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,838
chief growth officer of gross Sencha

20
00:00:57,588 --> 00:01:01,908
mammoth microbes he received his PhD in

21
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:04,459
biological sciences specializing in soil

22
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:07,670
microbial ecology and plant microbe

23
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:10,250
interactions next a Collin is Peterkin

24
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,600
giant Peter created his research and

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,370
consulting business conjoin

26
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,039
horticultural education services

27
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,780
incorporated in 1992 and has been

28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,640
immersed in both the commercial and

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,010
research areas of the u.s. greenhouse

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,599
industry for several decades his current

31
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,940
research is focused on controlled

32
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:31,419
environment agriculture and hydroponic

33
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:33,859
crop production to his farthest side is

34
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,930
our good friend Jeff Jeff lowenfeld

35
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:37,879
author of the seminal teaming with

36
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,980
microbes teeming with nutrients and

37
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:42,560
teaming with fungi book series on the

38
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,750
soil food web Jeff when I asked him for

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,310
his bio for today even though I've said

40
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,810
it many times I said do you have any

41
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:54,019
upgrades he goes - no just skip my bio

42
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:55,700
and say that Jeff might be Lord of the

43
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:57,890
roots and write books but he is most

44
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,870
proud of starting plant a row for the

45
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,219
hungry a program designed to get every

46
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,710
gardener in the United States to grow

47
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:05,359
one row of food to donate to someone who

48
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:07,459
needs it you don't need to buy his books

49
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,118
but you do need to plant a row so we

50
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:10,118
appreciate that

51
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:16,030
so our panel today is a little different

52
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:18,549
it's actually pretty exciting it is

53
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,829
entitled dispelling myth in commercial

54
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:22,329
cannabis cultivation and when I was

55
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:24,159
talking with the guys in advance of the

56
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:26,140
panel I was like so like do we want to

57
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:28,000
talk about that hasn't been done again

58
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:29,559
and again and again at cultivation and

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
they all started talking about the

60
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,219
things that people do that bug them and

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,019
I'm like alright I got a list of all

62
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,848
these things that the guys hate and I'm

63
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:38,408
like alright that'll be the theme let's

64
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:41,709
call it dispelling myths and here we are

65
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:44,530
so all the content from the fellas so um

66
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:46,060
question one let's get warmed up with

67
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,789
something really open-ended so we're

68
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,209
gonna start with Colin and then Jeff and

69
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:55,539
then Peter on this question so everyone

70
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:58,780
can jump in so Colin one thing we have

71
00:02:55,539 --> 00:03:01,810
all seen is how much in cannabis we all

72
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,400
need to unlearn myths are everywhere

73
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,250
from people who think you can identify

74
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,629
the sex of a see by looking at it to

75
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,250
others thinking that you can get higher

76
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:11,578
if you hold your head long enough to

77
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,378
cough and both are opposite untrue

78
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:17,620
cultivation has its own wide range of

79
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:20,378
myths so Colin and then Jeff and Peter

80
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,209
what is a cultivation myth that you

81
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:24,280
still see people talking about that

82
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:28,840
needs to be identified and fixed within

83
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,719
cannabis horticultural practices so I

84
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,439
think I'll start with a simple

85
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,659
microbiology and this is gonna be a

86
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,900
little academic and a little geeky but

87
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:40,448
the idea that you don't need microbes or

88
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,150
microbes aren't important in agriculture

89
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:46,959
systems and then you can actually

90
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:50,079
sterilize systems any kind of organic or

91
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,878
root systems it's actually not true

92
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:53,859
there's no such thing as a sterile

93
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:57,578
system anywhere you can't really fully

94
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:59,129
sterilize anything not food not water

95
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:01,890
nothing

96
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:05,269
and so the idea of thinking that you can

97
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:07,979
work with a sterile system is completely

98
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:11,610
biologically impossible and so I would

99
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,959
like to start with that so what do you

100
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,199
what do you think the ramifications are

101
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,480
of that I think the ramifications of

102
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,329
thinking you're dealing with the sterile

103
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,550
system are one you're attempting to

104
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,289
sterilize a system that's not possible

105
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,600
so you're putting a lot of effort in

106
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,250
buying a lot of disinfecting chemicals

107
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,430
that you're flushing through your root

108
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,889
environment and so you're spending time

109
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,259
and money doing something that's not

110
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,539
going to be fruitful and the second part

111
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,329
of that I think more importantly you

112
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,520
will knock off a lot of microbes when

113
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:46,169
you flush disinfectants through a roots

114
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,810
of a plant and mostly they're going to

115
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,480
be beneficials and so what I think is a

116
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,250
real challenge with that paradigm is

117
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,200
you're going to kill off a lot of

118
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,970
beneficial microbes that you really want

119
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,329
to have within your Rice's here within

120
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:03,060
your grow zone and you're gonna promote

121
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:05,729
potentially the the competitive

122
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,519
advantage of pathogens that can exist in

123
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,860
that environment and and what I would

124
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,509
say is if we can bridge the gap of

125
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,580
understanding how to bring natural

126
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:16,889
processes into these precision

127
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:21,269
hydroponic agriculture environments and

128
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:23,279
like biology against biology you can

129
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:26,459
actually learn to nurture beneficial

130
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:29,639
microbes to balance out the the

131
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:31,409
potential pests that will inhabit your

132
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,509
root zone without them being there

133
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,340
that's great can I do a Bernie Sanders

134
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:38,219
well actually you're up next

135
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:39,479
anyway same question well I have a

136
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,940
different answer but I just want to add

137
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,600
on to that from my perspective and it's

138
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:47,879
not a perfect analogy as if you read my

139
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,920
second book things don't go into a cell

140
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:53,790
unless they have an electrical charge on

141
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,970
them with the exception of boron if it's

142
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,960
the microbes that put the charge on

143
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,010
and if you don't have the microbes you

144
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,359
don't have the charge and if you don't

145
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,889
have to charge it or do anything in your

146
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,110
cells that you want to get in there so

147
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:05,550
that's why we do it that way all right

148
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,500
so what bugs me more than anything

149
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,000
yeah cultivation man you know when we

150
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,759
first had this discussion I was going to

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,430
say flushing but but since then I've

152
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,810
been I've been working and thinking and

153
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:22,949
I'm gonna say worse than that we moving

154
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:25,740
leaves live leaves from a plant you know

155
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:28,349
ostensibly in order to get more light on

156
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:33,090
the bud so that it'll fatten up and grow

157
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:35,430
bigger I hate that I cannot for the love

158
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:37,349
of me see why anybody would in the life

159
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,050
of me want to do that why would they

160
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,580
want to take a photosynthesizing Factory

161
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,850
and shut it down

162
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,349
you know and you know it just doesn't

163
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,410
make any sense at all

164
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:52,200
if you happen to believe that the Sun is

165
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,450
what causes that bud to swell by falling

166
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,009
directly on the butt itself even though

167
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:59,339
it has a limited amount of

168
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:01,740
photosynthetic leaves in it you know you

169
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:03,959
can you can take the leaf and just sort

170
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,389
of bend it out of the way or clip it out

171
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:10,549
of the way or tape by the way don't cut

172
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:13,889
live leave from a plant period right on

173
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,689
Peter same question to you what's a

174
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,959
cultivation myth that you want to expose

175
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:21,750
some light on well I want to first build

176
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,329
on what Colin referenced about the

177
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,610
natural biome around the plant for the

178
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:29,129
past 15 years as a traditional

179
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:32,220
commercial greenhouse researcher I've

180
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:34,649
been working with water treatment the

181
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,260
chemicals that Colin mentioned we have

182
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:40,289
to be careful with my work has been

183
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:42,689
treating systems and irrigation lines so

184
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,450
that we can reduce algae biofilm and

185
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:47,850
plant pathogen populations if I could

186
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:48,550
draw an analogy between East and Western

187
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,310
medicine

188
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,949
and how over our lifetime we seem to be

189
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,800
meeting somewhere in the middle we now

190
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:59,110
need to find that sweet spot where we

191
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,860
can control the algae and the biofilm

192
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:05,379
throughout the system but not be

193
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:09,129
injecting enough to harm the natural

194
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:11,530
balance of microbes so so for me it's

195
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:14,680
all about research research learning

196
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:16,448
gaining knowledge and Colin and I are

197
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,788
talking about how we might collaborate

198
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:23,110
and bring the two worlds together

199
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:25,598
my pet peeve or the myth that I'd like

200
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,960
to dispel is whenever I'm in a

201
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:32,889
hydroponic supply store and I walked

202
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:36,009
down the fertilizer aisle in my opinion

203
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:38,528
as a traditional horticulturist there

204
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:40,870
are way too many fertilizer products and

205
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:44,139
while I acknowledge and I'm trying to

206
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:46,539
learn quickly the nuances with the

207
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:48,458
cannabis plant because I've spent my

208
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:51,099
research career on poinsettias and

209
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:53,708
geraniums and petunias I want to learn

210
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:57,509
how its unique but I still don't think

211
00:08:53,708 --> 00:09:00,069
we need all those products so what

212
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:04,720
appear to follow up with that if you

213
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:08,740
were to go down that aisle and only keep

214
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,870
the the type of products that you think

215
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,009
are necessary what would you keep I'm

216
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:17,289
gonna sidestep that slightly Shango and

217
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:21,069
bring in how Colin and I with our

218
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:23,259
research training and background I'm an

219
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:26,200
Ohio State Buckeye for graduate school

220
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:29,528
you were Texas Tech graduate school all

221
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,170
right I don't mean to exclude you you

222
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:36,989
were northeastern and Harvard

223
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:40,618
correct all right so I I think what I

224
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:41,970
see is not necessarily I'm going to pick

225
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:44,819
out which products should be there

226
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:48,470
Shango but I think in this industry we

227
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:50,789
need more science and research

228
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,079
validating the products that are on the

229
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:55,139
shelves amen

230
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:58,229
so I'm used to my side of horticulture

231
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:00,899
going through that so when I'm in the

232
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,970
trade show downstairs and tomorrow in my

233
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,578
presentation on reference some of this

234
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:09,359
when I see a booth that feels the need

235
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:14,219
to say science based or science backed

236
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:16,230
in its message I'm wondering why why

237
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,389
does this industry need to do that it

238
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:22,230
must mean that so many others are not

239
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:26,278
science-based like that and that's a

240
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:28,739
good side step to so question - so the

241
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:31,289
next question is about developing best

242
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:33,869
practices so I'll start with Peter who

243
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:35,969
was just speaking this time so Peters

244
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:38,489
giving a presentation tomorrow all about

245
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,860
how to design your own internal company

246
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:43,499
experiments so that you can develop next

247
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,509
level SOPs and maybe happen to discover

248
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:46,918
some intellectual property along the way

249
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:49,048
so it's gonna be very interesting and

250
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:51,688
that's tomorrow but we're going to start

251
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:54,178
with the hue Peter so since we are all

252
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:56,849
growing cannabis as a commodity small

253
00:10:54,178 --> 00:10:58,379
differentiators between companies make

254
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,058
all the difference whether they be in

255
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,308
marketing product quality or

256
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:04,318
distribution expertise cannabis

257
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:05,789
companies with an awareness of analytics

258
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:07,828
and spreadsheets are setting up in a

259
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:09,509
house cultivation experiments to create

260
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:11,758
some citizen science right there in the

261
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:14,369
front lines of cannabis growing instead

262
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,019
of in a lab so Peter what is the mindset

263
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:18,059
that you recommend to commercial

264
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,068
cannabis cultivators who want to embark

265
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:22,188
on setting up experiments under their

266
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:25,318
own roof and where should they start

267
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:28,409
okay that's that's a great question I

268
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:31,979
want to start out by trying to dispel

269
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:34,259
another myth perhaps you hear the word

270
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,440
research and it can sound intimidating

271
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:40,610
or dry

272
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:44,120
were difficult and I think the opposite

273
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:47,419
is there's a 65 year old I'm still as

274
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,840
excited today as I was at 18 to see a

275
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:54,110
seed germinate or a cutting room so for

276
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:57,170
you folks as cultivators my word is

277
00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:00,110
grower on my side of the industry I

278
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:02,959
think we hear the phrase citizen

279
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:06,200
scientist these days in our daily

280
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:11,900
lexicon I'd like to say cultivator

281
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:15,379
scientist grower scientist and the the

282
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:18,679
excitement about running a trial or an

283
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:22,580
experiment in your own operation that if

284
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:25,219
designed correctly will result or yield

285
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:28,639
some really good information that you

286
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:31,340
used to make decisions that that's what

287
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,009
I get charged up about and I'd like to

288
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,800
convey to you folks through the course

289
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:37,939
of the conference right out so : your

290
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,649
approach is slightly different because

291
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:45,140
you're coming out of the lab what are

292
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:47,929
your thoughts I think there's a real

293
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:50,710
challenge with understanding how to

294
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:54,739
conduct research I think it's kind of

295
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:57,769
more complicated thought of it's more

296
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,350
complicated than it is and the truth is

297
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:02,029
the more simple research or an

298
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,879
experiment is the more resolution there

299
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:06,980
it is and what we find as a team and you

300
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,590
know Peter kind of changed my life we've

301
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,200
met a lot earlier this year and we've

302
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,879
engaged ever since and he's coming from

303
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,320
a horticulturist point of view and I'm

304
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,879
coming from a research scientist point

305
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,160
of view from Colorado State University

306
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,009
we did a lot of pretty sophisticated

307
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:23,809
research for years and years ecosystem

308
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,269
level lots of interactions those types

309
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:28,338
of things so I understand

310
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:29,579
setting up experimentation and I kind of

311
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:31,740
take it for granted

312
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,170
and as a microbiologist creating

313
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,089
technologies biology that I want to use

314
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:38,009
in agriculture and I want it to be

315
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:40,529
successful we have to collect the data

316
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:43,259
and ask Peter on the phone point-blank

317
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:45,110
and this is like early February why do

318
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:49,319
so many experiments fail

319
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,789
why isn't biology more actively adopted

320
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,290
in agriculture and I'll never forget

321
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:55,019
what he said and I wanted a real and

322
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:58,110
biased answer my horticulturalist a said

323
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,759
Colin you might not like this answer I

324
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:04,320
know I don't like this answer but the

325
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:06,539
truth is cultivators don't necessarily

326
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,720
I'm talking generally understand how to

327
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:11,939
conduct experiments and over 50% of the

328
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,120
trials that you engage in and that was

329
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:18,350
from his experience coming to me are

330
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,539
going to be skewed because of

331
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,159
experimental error on the grower side in

332
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:25,078
the growth facility and I've been

333
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:29,458
testing that hypothesis ever since

334
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:32,909
engaging with facilities avidly across

335
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:37,409
the country and it takes one misfeed or

336
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:39,419
one AC outage or one infestation to

337
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:42,000
completely disseminate an experimental

338
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:44,849
drive experiment design an experimental

339
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,919
trial and again and again and again it

340
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,839
happens and if someone comes to me and

341
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,328
says you know I think I see a result I'm

342
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,829
not so sure they need dissect would

343
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:56,609
happen across that experiment that

344
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:59,149
growth trial either something did happen

345
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:02,389
or

346
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:03,139
there is an infestation or the power

347
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:06,019
went out

348
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:07,338
there's always something that seems like

349
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:10,069
interfere with the controlled

350
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,480
side-by-side so I would say that the

351
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:16,400
challenge is a little bit of knowledge

352
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:18,409
and having a dedicated area facility

353
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,199
that's very controlled that you can

354
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:23,240
dedicate again to a controlled

355
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,070
side-by-side we don't change anything

356
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,440
else if you want the resolution on what

357
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:31,220
to add into your grill don't change

358
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,740
anything has to be in the same room the

359
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:37,490
same climate the same strain and you

360
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,470
just manipulate one factor and then you

361
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:43,460
measure differences and if you see a

362
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:45,950
difference by changing one factor and

363
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,410
you can repeat that because science is

364
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,960
repeatable then you might have something

365
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:52,610
that will bring value to you but having

366
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,639
the commitment and the time and the

367
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,320
dedication to conduct that trial is very

368
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,480
challenging for a lot of commercially

369
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,180
producing facilities right on good point

370
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,190
so there's a lot of home and patient

371
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:05,838
growers in the room - so Jeff you know

372
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,330
you've been helping gardeners better

373
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,760
their skills for decades through your 40

374
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,639
plus year gardening column how might

375
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,950
this these ideas apply to a home grower

376
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,019
well right again of course home growers

377
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,270
particularly home cannabis growers are

378
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,399
the worst excited test experimenters in

379
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:24,799
the world because you know we get this

380
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,409
idea that you know there's this project

381
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,629
this is supposed to work well if I I'm

382
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:30,689
only allowed to grow eight plants if I

383
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:32,809
put it on

384
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:35,940
plant and it works I've wasted seven

385
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:38,278
plan on all the plant you know and so so

386
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,930
we don't experiment properly we don't

387
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,629
have enough discipline to do it the

388
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:45,929
right way and and so what I tried to do

389
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:48,120
in terms of my books is write books that

390
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:49,948
that give you enough science so that you

391
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,139
can figure out what's going on and

392
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:55,409
whether it makes sense just as we have

393
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:57,659
to learn which social media platforms we

394
00:16:55,409 --> 00:17:00,088
can rely on and you know which which

395
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:02,039
news organizations are really which

396
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:04,259
aren't real all this Russian crap you

397
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,730
know just as we got to learn that stuff

398
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:08,250
we have to we have to do the same thing

399
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,500
with regard to where we get our science

400
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,619
from we get a lot of science because

401
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,859
it's so easy now for people to do you

402
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:18,538
know geometric stuff and do DNA testing

403
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,038
and all these things we never thought

404
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:22,500
possible you can do right in your own

405
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:25,199
home you know for maybe a thousand bucks

406
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,818
you didn't do DNA stuff and people are

407
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,439
doing it you know but that doesn't mean

408
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:30,690
they're doing it the right way so we

409
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,360
have to just be on our toes all the time

410
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,970
I think we have to put pressure on

411
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,589
companies when they are selling us a

412
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,240
product to be able to tell us enough

413
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:41,339
about the product on the websites which

414
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,960
they all have that gives us confidence

415
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:44,519
in the product so we can go to Colin

416
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,079
site and go to mammoth and we can look

417
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,908
up what they have what they're doing and

418
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,609
who they are and all that kind of stuff

419
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:52,980
as opposed to you know the product you

420
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:54,959
buy that's you know got something on the

421
00:17:52,980 --> 00:18:00,839
label that you don't really know about

422
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:04,279
okay so the Miracle Grow you know versus

423
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:06,959
being sensible and doing your homework

424
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,460
so I'm gonna ask a bonus question on

425
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,690
before we move on to the third question

426
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:15,150
so why would each of you think would be

427
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:18,570
an area than a commercial cultivator

428
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:21,840
or even a home grower might want to look

429
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:22,889
into doing a little their own research

430
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:27,269
what do you think is an area that's

431
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:29,850
right for fresh research turkeys and

432
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:33,058
flavonoids I mean I you know we still

433
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:34,829
are stuck in the sativa indica base when

434
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:37,440
you go in and purchase him sell and

435
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:37,769
that's stupid because we know indicates

436
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,029
it

437
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:41,099
first of all I may not even exist

438
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:43,920
properly anymore and second of all we

439
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,990
know that that's not the parameters that

440
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,660
we should be using to determine what

441
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,009
we're buying and so I would I would say

442
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:54,090
anything you can do to learn about

443
00:18:50,009 --> 00:19:00,089
flavonoids and cannabinoids is gonna be

444
00:18:54,089 --> 00:19:03,750
a big class I think my response is as a

445
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:05,839
grower having grown up on a farm run a

446
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:20,700
commercial greenhouse for me it's

447
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:24,599
learning how to read

448
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,430
it's experimenting learning how to allow

449
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,059
that plant to grow better

450
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:33,180
whether it's yield whether it's size

451
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:36,569
whatever it is how do we manipulate how

452
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:38,820
the plant grows and respect that the

453
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:42,379
plant is going to grow with or without

454
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:45,450
us but we're merely there to serve and

455
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,770
help it reach its potential I'm gonna

456
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,080
redirect you a little bit Collin because

457
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:51,329
I know because we're buddy is that you

458
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:53,970
you probably toward more professional

459
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:57,439
cannabis cultivation operations than

460
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:59,910
anybody around even globally and so

461
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,230
you've seen the insides a lot of things

462
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,390
so I even think that you would have a

463
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,880
different kind of insight about what

464
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,770
kind of research could be taken up in

465
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:13,800
those facilities that would immediately

466
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:15,809
benefit them you don't know kind of

467
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,250
pivot from that there's research and

468
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:18,809
there's a lot of things we can do and

469
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,670
we're very interested in quality and

470
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:22,259
terpenes and cannabinoids and the

471
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,730
different strains that can do these so

472
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:25,500
there's a lot of room for genetics and

473
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm excited about a lot of this stuff

474
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,950
I'm excited about input

475
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,548
and maximizing it really dialing

476
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,840
restrain how to optimize growth and

477
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:36,720
yield to me I talk about it all the time

478
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:41,759
but honestly you know I've becoming

479
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:45,120
increasingly aware of and kind of focus

480
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:48,900
on getting a better understanding of

481
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:51,839
what we don't know and I've been aware

482
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,850
of like in the grow now it's just like

483
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,529
ecology and like ecosystem ecology

484
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:57,569
there's what I'm looking at at our room

485
00:20:55,529 --> 00:21:00,418
there's so many different interactive

486
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:02,460
properties that influence plant growth

487
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:04,110
you know there's not only in genetics

488
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,909
there's lighting and there's temperature

489
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:08,038
and there's humidity and there's air

490
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:10,169
flow and there's all these below-ground

491
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:11,700
factors like even that not only the

492
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:13,320
quality of the water but the temperature

493
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,750
of the water and then nutrients you have

494
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,970
going in there and the oxygen flux in

495
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,558
the soil and then there's a microbial

496
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:23,429
component and then there's contamination

497
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:25,259
all this stuff and I don't think that

498
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:27,570
it's thought of as a holistic approach

499
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:29,640
more than not and I think when people

500
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:30,389
walk into a grasso this fascinating

501
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,580
technology

502
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,980
just this week Lau is here where we can

503
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:36,899
actually analyze hotspots of

504
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,470
contamination in a room and you can look

505
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:43,679
in a room and see where there might be

506
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:46,259
potential sources of danger as far as

507
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,730
infection as far as a pests coming in

508
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:51,829
and you could have the cleanest room in

509
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:55,169
the world except for on the mop handle

510
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:59,519
except for on the fire hydrant or the

511
00:21:55,169 --> 00:22:02,009
the fire extinguisher except on the cat

512
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,200
and you can being completely buttoned up

513
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:06,210
suits and so there's things that you

514
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,950
don't know you don't know you never

515
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,450
think that they not that you're using a

516
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,669
cleaner facility is a source of

517
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:15,029
contamination and when I saw that's like

518
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:17,480
wow you know how do we get the level

519
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:21,079
where we understand

520
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,730
trol fur for those unknown to those

521
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:27,409
things that just aren't in our purview

522
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:30,529
and measuring at that level is where I

523
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,669
think the most important progress of any

524
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:33,319
girl you know you have to have the right

525
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:34,730
genetics and it starts and stuff to

526
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,409
plant genetics but you can ruin any

527
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,700
plant genetics as soon as there's an

528
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,110
infestation or as soon as there's a

529
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,029
temperature drop or as soon as or as

530
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,719
temperature increase so I'm fascinated

531
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:43,399
by it

532
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,730
I just think it's it's a really

533
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,880
interesting environment that's very hard

534
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:52,130
to control and so that's what I would

535
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,040
say just this overall awareness of every

536
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:58,250
room as an ecosystem and it's dynamic

537
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:02,569
and figuring out how to how to dial in

538
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:05,390
or mitigate risk over time would

539
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:10,668
probably bring growers more value than

540
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:11,630
any other research project I wasn't sure

541
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:12,980
if you leaned toward because you're

542
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,990
gonna jump in on that Peter or yours

543
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,019
right so so Jeff we're gonna start with

544
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:19,789
you on on this question so so during the

545
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:21,918
panel today we've encouraged people in

546
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:23,389
different ways to educate and change

547
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,090
habits right look into what your

548
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,890
processes are and make sure that that

549
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:30,379
those are the processes you want so as

550
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,150
we look into the future say five years

551
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,790
from now which is a long time in

552
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:37,190
cannabis years what is one thing that

553
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:39,230
you see significantly changing in

554
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,090
cannabis horticulture and how might

555
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:45,370
commercial cannabis cultivators planned

556
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:45,369
for it now as it comes down the line I

557
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:52,069
think a lot of flowers are the next

558
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,509
tomato both for the home gardener

559
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:55,428
because I think they're easy to grow

560
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:57,679
they're small they don't have a photo

561
00:23:55,429 --> 00:24:00,048
period problem you can go from seed to

562
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,798
harvest and seven to nine weeks you have

563
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:06,259
a tomato plant that my mother would grow

564
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:08,168
particularly once it's legal she might

565
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:12,019
even she might have even thought about

566
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:13,460
but commercial growers on the other hand

567
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:16,339
really put their nose up in the air

568
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:19,009
about these things but lately they're

569
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:22,279
they're equally as good at my book

570
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:24,019
as a commercial plant when you take into

571
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:26,059
consideration the speed they grow Auto

572
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:27,980
flowers of the next tomato we're gonna

573
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:30,859
be seeing them everywhere we're gonna be

574
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,759
seeing them at Lowe's and Home Depot you

575
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:33,379
know we're gonna be seeing them at

576
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,960
Christmastime decorated like little

577
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,330
Christmas trees this is it this is it

578
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,299
the dynamics have changed so drastically

579
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:44,089
in the past year or two that they are

580
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:46,579
every bit as good as commercial large

581
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:47,959
big gigantic plants that take a long

582
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:50,480
long time to grow and that have the

583
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,730
photoperiod necessity so that's where

584
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,079
and if you and if you're if you're new

585
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,990
to Auto flowers and you're not really

586
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,849
familiar with it oddly enough Jeff and I

587
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,339
are both giving talks tomorrow on autos

588
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:03,199
and what it is going to is they're very

589
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:06,169
different Jeff's got a new book coming

590
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,569
out in October which is Auto flowers

591
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,860
like for beginners and for maybe your

592
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:12,500
neighbor who you want to kind of get

593
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:14,029
into cannabis so he's at the beginning

594
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,369
of the day is going to be an

595
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:17,450
introduction to growing Auto flowers

596
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:20,389
kind of general introduction to

597
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,920
cultivation period and then my talk in

598
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:25,310
the afternoon at 2:30 is going to be

599
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,470
more about patient oriented medical grow

600
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:30,470
a plication Xand commercial applications

601
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:33,110
in a in a bigger scale it's a perfect

602
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:35,000
fit yeah so that'd be great so so so

603
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:37,969
Jeff okay so that was Auto flowers and

604
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,829
so how about you Peter so reminding me

605
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,059
since I kind of took it back off course

606
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,949
what's one thing that you see

607
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,690
significantly changing in cannabis

608
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,950
horticulture in the next five years and

609
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:49,670
how might commercial cannabis

610
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:51,950
cultivators plan for it can I first

611
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:55,970
respond this AB sand to something that

612
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:59,299
Jeff said again from the commercial

613
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:01,279
ornamental world we've been trying to do

614
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:04,149
this with poinsettia which is a

615
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,359
short-day plant and chrysanthemum for

616
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:09,980
generations

617
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:12,439
so with breakthroughs here that might

618
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,289
then spread and be applied to other

619
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,009
crops the point seniya is this country's

620
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:22,480
number one flowering potted plant

621
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:25,450
and are so far yeah well said that we

622
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:30,160
know report how about a point steady at

623
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:32,798
ruderalis cross Peter is a home beer

624
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,980
brewer in the lover of growing hops in

625
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,509
my backyard and the relationship between

626
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,160
the crops there's just so much

627
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:40,960
excitement going around and bouncing

628
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,529
around my head Shango to answer your

629
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,500
question an interesting dynamic that

630
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:51,099
that I see is that the commercial

631
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:53,829
greenhouse grower is now looking to grow

632
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:57,129
indoors with vertical farming without

633
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:59,439
the Sun your industry traditionally has

634
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,330
grown indoors without the Sun and you

635
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,620
folks are looking to grow in the

636
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:07,960
greenhouse I see an opportunity one of

637
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:11,139
my messages tomorrow is a plant as a

638
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:13,090
plant as a plant and I see a wonderful

639
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,480
opportunity two industries that are

640
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:18,509
passionate about the plants they grow

641
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,339
coming together working together as

642
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:23,650
horticulturists and my message to my

643
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:25,750
growers around the country that are that

644
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,419
are growing poinsettias and geraniums

645
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:31,240
and having trouble battling the mass

646
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:34,809
market and low pricing my message to

647
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,089
them is cannabis why not us we we know

648
00:27:34,808 --> 00:27:38,740
how to grow crops in a greenhouse we

649
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:42,009
just need to retool and learn how to

650
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:44,859
grow this new species and my message to

651
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:46,990
you folks is welcome aboard there's

652
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:49,689
plenty of room and greenhouse space for

653
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:51,519
everybody so so dig in that little bit

654
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:54,160
Peter so are you saying that the big

655
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,950
change coming to cannabis cultivation in

656
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,200
five years is that we're already moving

657
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:02,470
even more so into greenhouses is that

658
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,840
the point you're making to a degree

659
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:06,880
Shango I am NOT one that believes that

660
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:10,500
it's going to end up one size fits all

661
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:14,090
so we're going to have a a blend

662
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:17,750
regionally between outdoor greenhouse

663
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:20,299
and or so so I'm not going to say that

664
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:23,210
LED lighting is going to take over the

665
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:25,250
entire industry because I'm on an

666
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:28,670
advisory board for a medical group up in

667
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:31,460
Maine and they have been growing indoors

668
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:35,390
and are now looking to expand and put up

669
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:37,460
a greenhouse to complement there's

670
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:40,730
nothing quite like those sunshine fed

671
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:42,440
terpene profiles that's for sure so so

672
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,720
calm same thing with you brother

673
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,279
so in the in about in the next five

674
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,230
years what do you see as being a

675
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:49,849
significantly changing thing in cannabis

676
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,599
halter horticultural and how can

677
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:55,609
commercial growers pay prepare for it I

678
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:56,990
think I agree I was just having a

679
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,399
conversation with someone else yesterday

680
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,349
Todd McCormick these are really

681
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,730
interesting dude he's been in the

682
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:03,559
industry for a long time he's working

683
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:06,319
with a lot of people and here this

684
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:11,000
repeatedly at least in North America in

685
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:13,399
the US it's scaling you know commercial

686
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,470
facilities are scaling and it's so

687
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,950
incredibly expensive to maintain an

688
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:21,319
indoor warehouse style facility there

689
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:23,059
the energy use alone and the mitigation

690
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:25,339
of pests and everything that's going on

691
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:27,409
that you have to manage and the labor

692
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:32,139
and everything that uh

693
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:34,730
I have seen several tomato facilities

694
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:36,290
large-scale commercial tomato high-value

695
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:39,059
tomato facilities that are growing

696
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:42,389
tomatoes for nothing

697
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:44,519
swapping over to cannabis and at some

698
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:49,220
point there's a threshold where these

699
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:52,079
large-scale very sophisticated producing

700
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,600
companies are gonna flip to cannabis and

701
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,970
change the game and I don't think that

702
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:58,230
cannabis is going to drop it up enough I

703
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,779
don't think cannabis is gonna be the

704
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,299
cost of a tomato but I think it's gonna

705
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:05,670
drop significantly as you know I don't

706
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:07,889
have a crystal ball that works but I

707
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,720
have a sense from enough data points

708
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:12,540
coming in and people in the industry

709
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,029
that you have to be ready to produce

710
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:17,279
that's significantly less than you can

711
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:18,809
produce now and I kind of take that the

712
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,519
people that haven't been able to produce

713
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:25,049
and some of the markets that have had

714
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:27,839
shift or significant shifting costs

715
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:29,789
they're not in business anymore and so

716
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,720
that scale is key and I think greenhouse

717
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:35,909
growing is one way that you can scale

718
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,650
and stay competitive and can in the

719
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,360
cannabis industry if you're a producer I

720
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,220
think I would add to that too that no

721
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:44,279
there's no question that the scaling is

722
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,980
coming especially as the big AG

723
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:49,289
companies are coming to the table and I

724
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,690
also think that you know most of us who

725
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:54,180
love the plant we think like artisan

726
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:56,850
producers and while we definitely need

727
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:59,190
to get a lot of the the tricks of the

728
00:30:56,849 --> 00:31:01,799
trade from folks that we can from

729
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:04,740
scaling to use and our artisan grows I

730
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:06,450
also think that we as as both business

731
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,819
owners and but also as a cannabis scene

732
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:10,620
need to like search our hearts and to

733
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:12,629
figure out how much we want to support

734
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:16,409
scaling because a lot of these companies

735
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:18,270
are going to be producing you know huge

736
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,390
fields of flavor of a-list flowers that

737
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:22,470
are going to be the Budweiser of

738
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:24,480
cannabis and then there's going to be

739
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,240
people who are doing crafts at smaller

740
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,180
levels but their skills have got to turn

741
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,519
to specialty marketing and and so that

742
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,799
their products say upset or set apart so

743
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:36,660
I so I agree with you on the scaling but

744
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,399
I also think that we each need to decide

745
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,920
for ourselves how far we want to go down

746
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,390
that path and we all need to grow some

747
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:46,820
tomatoes just so the

748
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:46,820
do it when they're growing cannabis will

749
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:52,140
this really and you say we're Fort

750
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,670
Collins Colorado when there's a lot of

751
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,050
breweries in Fort Collins Colorado at

752
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,400
New Belgium brewery is one of those and

753
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:57,960
we kind of modeled our company mammoth

754
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,090
microbes or for some of the culture and

755
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,430
values that New Belgium did and they're

756
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:03,869
really known to be company owned and and

757
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,519
these really wonderful properties

758
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:07,739
internally and that's how we modeled our

759
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,379
company so you know we're we're our

760
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,819
company are our employees on the company

761
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,740
everyone has shares and I think that's a

762
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:16,349
really cool thing to do from a research

763
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,849
scientist going to a business guy we

764
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:19,980
really care about the business structure

765
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:22,049
I just wanted to do things cool and and

766
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:25,589
and that's some of the things that we

767
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:27,000
did and New Belgium brewery is right

768
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:29,339
around the corner from our facility I

769
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,680
was having a conversation with one of

770
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:35,369
the folks kind of higher up in that in

771
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,529
that organization and they're really

772
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:39,569
struggling right now and it was a really

773
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:41,250
well known craft brew fact era they have

774
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:43,740
a lot of different brands and they do a

775
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:46,380
wonderful job branding and they have

776
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,910
great products and what happened is they

777
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,610
were dominant they were the largest

778
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:53,730
micro brew operation in the world and

779
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:56,069
they still are and they're suffering the

780
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,450
reason they're suffering is because at

781
00:32:56,069 --> 00:32:59,759
one point they're competing it's

782
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,340
Budweiser and coolers and in all those

783
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,579
major breweries and they distinguished

784
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:08,990
themselves because they weren't that

785
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:11,549
just like the Kraft versus just the

786
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,930
producers that are growing flavorless

787
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:14,549
flour and I agree with that and I think

788
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:16,038
there's always going to be a demand for

789
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:18,190
craft but

790
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:22,759
happened it's a New Belgium brewery is

791
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:25,600
Budweiser acknowledged that and they

792
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:28,249
start buying up craft breweries and now

793
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:30,888
although New Belgium thought they would

794
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:32,989
have a brand loyalty after a couple of

795
00:33:30,888 --> 00:33:34,998
years people got amnesia and they're

796
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:36,950
buying these craft breweries that are

797
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:39,739
actually funded by Budweiser and so

798
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:42,499
there's this strategic shift from the

799
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:45,019
large breweries to also be a craft

800
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:47,239
brewery and I think it's interesting and

801
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:48,679
once I heard that I was like huh you

802
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:51,619
know there's a potential for that to

803
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:54,739
happen and I'm pretty keen on having

804
00:33:51,618 --> 00:33:57,048
small craft breweries in and small

805
00:33:54,739 --> 00:34:00,288
family or mid mid family-owned

806
00:33:57,048 --> 00:34:01,940
businesses be a huge part of the

807
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,979
cannabis industry and we have a small

808
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,379
company ourselves and so I'm keen on

809
00:34:03,979 --> 00:34:08,599
that but I think it's important to look

810
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:11,148
at the dynamics of other industries to

811
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:13,068
see where that trend might be so if you

812
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:16,279
know where the puck is going you can

813
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:18,349
kind of position yourself to protect

814
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,179
yourself from that yeah right on and I

815
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:22,818
think we make a mistake looking just at

816
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:24,470
the alcohol industry as you know it's so

817
00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:26,418
comparable because they both get you

818
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:28,878
high my father was in the butter

819
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:30,679
business and then margarine came along

820
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,929
because some guy wrote wrote an article

821
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,750
it said you know butter fast bad it

822
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:37,369
turned out to be false false news watch

823
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,960
and stuff he's rolling over in his grave

824
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:41,298
today now that we know that it was all

825
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,349
Punk but but he was in the butter

826
00:34:41,298 --> 00:34:44,000
business they came out a little

827
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:45,470
margarine you know and he had his

828
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,378
margarine going along but his was a

829
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:50,358
craft butter and he stuck with it and

830
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:51,618
then he started private labeling you

831
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:53,898
know things like so there are ways you

832
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:55,519
can you can keep alive and do it and I

833
00:34:53,898 --> 00:34:58,098
think that's a much better analogy I

834
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:00,280
mean as as local people you're going to

835
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:02,119
need to start clapping together

836
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,190
somebody's gonna have to be the Packer

837
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:05,298
so it's gonna be this growers it was

838
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:09,159
gonna be this you know you know we need

839
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:11,150
to start being crafty about being craft

840
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,489
businesses and I don't I don't think

841
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:15,559
we're thinking together quite

842
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:17,899
but it all happened as soon as you know

843
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:19,989
what Weiser gets into the business and

844
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,220
it's not not going to be very long so

845
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:28,819
did you want to weigh in on that Peter I

846
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:32,358
did we may or may not have time for

847
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:34,910
questions so so but Peter if you if you

848
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:36,500
do we're not gonna continue on I was

849
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:38,690
actually gonna shift to questions now so

850
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,889
did you want to weigh in on that yeah so

851
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,260
go ahead and then we'll move to

852
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:44,239
questions okay so this this thread that

853
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:47,000
you're pulling yeah about size of

854
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:50,329
operation and Collins reality check on

855
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,789
scaling is very dear to me

856
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:55,309
I've tried to spend my career as a

857
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:58,338
researcher conducting research to help

858
00:35:55,309 --> 00:36:02,659
my fellow growers who are small and

859
00:35:58,338 --> 00:36:05,210
medium in size I think part of the story

860
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:08,118
that Collins sharing with New Belgium is

861
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:10,940
and I've experienced it on a commercial

862
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,250
greenhouse side when you end up too big

863
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,530
to be small and too small to be big and

864
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:19,608
get caught in that middle area there's

865
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:22,339
there's an issue now I'm very passionate

866
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:26,480
over my lifetime is a commercial

867
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:30,199
greenhouse operator I've often asked the

868
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:33,440
question why is it in this country that

869
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:33,919
the only measure of success is how big

870
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,450
you are

871
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,849
and if I could change that and and

872
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:44,539
create an environment where you can be

873
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:46,910
small and successful that's that's my

874
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:50,509
passion that's the torch I try to carry

875
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:52,879
and we walk the path in commercial

876
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:55,670
greenhouses with ornamental crops and

877
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,800
bedding plants and whatnot where the

878
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:00,920
greenhouse operations fueled the mass

879
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:04,250
market and my family's operation as a

880
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:08,780
small family garden center we survived

881
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:13,099
from this 1960 to 2010 and as the

882
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:15,080
recession took hold we were always able

883
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:16,590
to charge more than a mass market but

884
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:20,549
during the recession we couldn't

885
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:23,970
enough to stay in business and we closed

886
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:28,860
our doors I'm very passionate about your

887
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:31,169
industry being able to hold on to some

888
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,910
success in being small now just to

889
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:36,260
finish up the comment two weeks ago I

890
00:37:32,909 --> 00:37:39,239
heard that two of our top 100 greenhouse

891
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:41,850
operations up 100 in the country and

892
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:44,429
sized acreage are closing their doors

893
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:47,489
and selling out for hemp hemp production

894
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:49,230
I turn to my wife and I said great those

895
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:52,979
big green houses put me out of business

896
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:55,170
as a small family-run garden center good

897
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,400
they get what they did full circle now

898
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,920
they're going out of business and

899
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,539
selling out to a new crop which is gonna

900
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,360
be a problem for the little guy because

901
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:06,179
they have stuff you know the pollen gets

902
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:13,320
into your crops and that's not good so I

903
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:15,059
saw they saw a big terrible circuit so a

904
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,860
couple of months ago there was a study

905
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:20,579
published by a group out of Berkeley

906
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:25,730
that genetically modified a host of

907
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:28,139
cells to produce such as THC and CBD so

908
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,909
piggybacking off of Collins statement

909
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:32,369
about scale do you really think these

910
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:33,659
Budweiser's and you know Marlboros of

911
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:35,969
the cannabis future are gonna be growing

912
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:39,569
plants or just they just need ruing

913
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:41,519
giant fats and this stuff I've been

914
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,830
obtaining on that I saw that that study

915
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,750
now wasn't sure just to be fair I'm not

916
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:48,059
sure exactly the state of that

917
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:49,619
technology but it's coming and I think

918
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,969
that they still have a little ways but I

919
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:53,819
think there's gonna be a place for that

920
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:55,289
if you think about the farm industry the

921
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,539
farm industry is not gonna want to

922
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:59,400
manage greenhouses and grow plants

923
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:00,210
they're gonna want to make stuff and

924
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,200
fermenter

925
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:07,710
and so that's what I think do I think as

926
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:12,239
a consumer of cannabis is gonna want to

927
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:14,940
take it consume from a cannabinoid

928
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:18,479
that's extracted from a yeast I don't

929
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,700
know I just say I don't know I'm Hindi

930
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,079
well the way no one ever assumed no but

931
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:25,828
I'll tell you what if it's made into a

932
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,650
pill that's right and I don't know what

933
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:31,050
that statistic is on until consumption

934
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:33,300
in the United States but it's extremely

935
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:35,309
high and so there's gonna be a market

936
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,530
for that I don't think it's gonna be the

937
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:40,019
market that we acknowledge as a cannabis

938
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:41,599
industry today I think it's a medical

939
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:44,338
market there I mean if you have Crohn's

940
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,920
some terrible intestinal disease and you

941
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:49,558
can take a yeast based pill that'll

942
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,980
release THC in your intestines in an

943
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:54,180
anaerobic environment Wow pretty cool

944
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:56,429
you know that might make a tremendous

945
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:58,289
amount of sense do you want to smoke the

946
00:39:56,429 --> 00:40:03,719
stuff I don't know I mean you know as

947
00:39:58,289 --> 00:40:09,298
some people put yeast on popcorn stump

948
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:12,449
on her own so I have this idea having

949
00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:15,389
been in horticulture not related to

950
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:17,338
cannabis I see a lot of industry groups

951
00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:19,618
that market together the work together

952
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:21,869
that produce in this research together

953
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:23,760
and I don't see a whole lot of that

954
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:25,500
happening in the cannabis is that what

955
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,410
do you think about that as being sort of

956
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,588
a model for how the cannabis industry

957
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:33,210
could move forward with research

958
00:40:30,588 --> 00:40:35,130
protecting its brands as artisan

959
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:37,588
qualities what kind of stuff - beginning

960
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:40,829
to see it I think you know in places

961
00:40:37,588 --> 00:40:43,099
like the Emerald triangle here in court

962
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:46,019
you know we have clean green certified

963
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:47,789
there are marketing coops in lots of

964
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:50,009
different places the problem is it's

965
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:52,440
been legal and still you know and

966
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:53,890
there's no banking and and everybody's

967
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,110
worried that if they make the wrong

968
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:58,210
marketing-wise you know the government

969
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:59,920
comes down and says ooh you know god

970
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,170
it's cooking jeff Sessions not around

971
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,030
you know that kind of stuff so it'll

972
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:06,369
happen and there are some that are there

973
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:08,140
already I think I can speak for Colin

974
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:10,539
and myself both being tied to the

975
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:13,509
academic community we've got colleagues

976
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:16,420
around the country salivating for the

977
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,460
federal law to change so that all of

978
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:22,000
these university program land-grant

979
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:23,110
universities can get involved we have

980
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,119
friends all around the country you're

981
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:27,400
salivating as well and when they're not

982
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,869
an academic it's hard enough because at

983
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,880
the moment you're not even supposed to

984
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:33,880
be sending samples back and forth right

985
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,829
so it's hard to even develop labs and

986
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,930
