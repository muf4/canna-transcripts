1
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:08,089
so when I'm talking to clients you know

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:09,500
they often are asking me okay help me

3
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:11,628
envision what this is gonna be going on

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,189
five or ten or twenty years down because

5
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:15,468
they're putting in millions and millions

6
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:17,570
of dollars and they want to have a

7
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:18,618
long-term arc of their business and you

8
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,780
know first of all I tell them that

9
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:22,850
nobody's got a crystal ball and and

10
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,100
thinking that that anybody knows what

11
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,260
what this chaos is gonna look like in

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,760
ten or twenty years they're they're

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,860
they're overcharging you for their

14
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,270
consulting right whoever it is but at

15
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:34,460
the same time we all do need to think

16
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,460
about this and two things that will

17
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,820
radically change the oil market when it

18
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,469
happens will be a the allowing of

19
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,730
Interstate Commerce in the u.s. it's

20
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:45,948
just a matter of time before that

21
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:48,768
happens and so a lot of these states

22
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:52,608
that are becoming legal now they've got

23
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:55,009
these really nice you know oil grows and

24
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:58,338
any manufacturing setups and they're

25
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:59,838
great but their margins are there their

26
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:01,039
cost of doing business is really high

27
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:03,829
right because of where they live or

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,659
their weather or whatever but then as

29
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:08,689
soon as as soon as people are allowed to

30
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:11,570
ship over state lines suddenly you know

31
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:13,578
California and the southern part of the

32
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:15,589
country are going to be doing this

33
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:18,349
producing these same products with a

34
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,030
very low cost of business and then wait

35
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:22,578
until international gets involved and

36
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,310
and Mexico can grow you know this

37
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:27,889
beautiful flower organic certified if

38
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,019
they choose to process all the oil down

39
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,030
there with like world-class and then and

40
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:34,009
then just ship up drums of oil and

41
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,590
that's just gonna crush like for example

42
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:39,049
the edibles market right where where the

43
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,509
you know it's not artisan dab oil it's

44
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:44,060
it's more of a commoditized oil so I

45
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:45,500
know that you give good advice to

46
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,109
people both here in the US and around

47
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,269
the world so so what are you telling the

48
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,339
people who seek your advice about how to

49
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:54,769
think about those two barriers

50
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,170
interstate and then national barriers

51
00:01:54,769 --> 00:02:00,048
coming down as far as setting up local

52
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,759
businesses to provide oil that's that's

53
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,680
a good question because it's economy

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,689
scale

55
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,400
and if they start to be able to pull

56
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:08,258
like CBD drive trips out of hemp and

57
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,149
then with plant infused terpene

58
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:12,429
infusions all of a sudden you're really

59
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:16,330
able to make it a very simple method to

60
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:19,870
create some of these lower quality oil

61
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,610
packages and the question is over the

62
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,800
next 20 years will you be able to

63
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,500
develop a new group of people new

64
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,110
consumers who want to consume the

65
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,270
products that have grown in their region

66
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,280
where they're more aware of locally

67
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,350
produced products that's basically the

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,240
hope to me the fundamental about organic

69
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,889
a gizze that if you're really looking at

70
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,629
it part of the organic nature of it is

71
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:43,569
it isn't being trucked across seven

72
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:45,549
states to get to your house so it's hard

73
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,229
to say you're an environmental advocate

74
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,330
when you're having stuff shipped in

75
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:51,579
globally into your neighborhood and so

76
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,590
it's trying to create the awareness that

77
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,620
you want to have local products local

78
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,270
goods because they should be cheaper

79
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,090
unless we're we're so inefficient in our

80
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,980
production and you allow the places that

81
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,479
do bulk oil production to do bulk oil

82
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:06,129
production and you focus on what you're

83
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,530
supposed to focus on and that's really

84
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:10,900
the reality of Ag so Humboldt has

85
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,969
problems because we don't a lot of flat

86
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,400
ground and so there's really not a lot

87
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:17,169
of prime soil there's not a lot of flat

88
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,689
ground so it doesn't allow us to do

89
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:21,458
massive Central Valley type farming

90
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:24,579
operations but what we have is a

91
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,949
tremendous amount of clean air and untuk

92
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,350
sic regions because we don't have all

93
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:30,669
these other industries contaminating and

94
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,409
so that's the problem that you're seeing

95
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,419
in all these massive agricultural areas

96
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:35,590
is cross contamination so they have to

97
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,629
create these positive pressure

98
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,069
greenhouses to expel any air that's

99
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:40,979
coming out anything's coming in is

100
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:44,469
coming into massive filtration systems

101
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:46,689
well that has to be cost and so it

102
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:48,979
starts to become so expensive to create

103
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:51,408
products in areas that were

104
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,908
because cannabis being regulated a

105
00:03:51,408 --> 00:03:55,128
degree that no add product that we've

106
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:57,259
been regulated and so you can't really

107
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:58,609
grow cannabis in the wineries that well

108
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:01,250
because you have so much much of uterine

109
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,379
all applied for all the grapes you can't

110
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,150
use cannabis in the Central Valley to

111
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:06,679
the same degree if you take a look how

112
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,330
many of these failures are coming from

113
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,280
the Central Valley even the larger

114
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,170
organizations they're having to remodel

115
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,780
the entire greenhouse ranges once they

116
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:17,358
get all that in it's still unbelievably

117
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,589
expensive infrastructure to provide and

118
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,329
as we go forward does the consumer

119
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:26,089
become educated enough to realize that

120
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:27,859
that's industrial cannabis when they

121
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:29,478
want to buy cannabis are they gonna look

122
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,580
at it like wine at some point where

123
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,379
there's many gradients of quality right

124
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:35,240
now it's confusing it's just a price in

125
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:37,430
a store but as people start to become

126
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,280
more aware and I believe that the youth

127
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,329
that are coming in are very cognizant

128
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,679
about these facts because they've been

129
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:44,300
barred than Barda with a sense of

130
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,038
childhood they didn't get the same

131
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,389
advertising we did that it's a don't

132
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:49,370
worry about it

133
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,720
these products are good for you fluoride

134
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,978
is great for your teeth you shouldn't

135
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,020
even get as much as you can in your body

136
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:56,418
now that you know it's a neurotoxin and

137
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:58,189
it changes how you perceive these

138
00:04:56,418 --> 00:05:00,649
products and I think that for a lot of

139
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:04,759
the smaller places that have such a risk

140
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:07,038
it's trying to create zones of enjoyment

141
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:10,159
where people who really are about the

142
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:12,110
culture and the quality can know to

143
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,050
source their products and buy them and

144
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,629
that's really over time of educating the

145
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,249
customer so that the customer education

146
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:19,689
has to

147
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:23,139
and all we've done is educate them that

148
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:25,119
cheaper more hot numbers more frosty

149
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:27,189
better pictures on Instagram or what you

150
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,379
want and that has absolutely nothing to

151
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:30,879
do with reality and I think it's that

152
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:33,129
it's the ability to get people to

153
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,109
understand the reality of that these

154
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:36,819
ugly tomatoes that they won't sell at

155
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:38,079
the store the exact ones you want to cut

156
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,809
up and eat on your sandwich and that's

157
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,189
why farmers markets sell burn and

158
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:43,899
hopefully that the new generation is

159
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:45,429
able to make these decisions and say

160
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:47,559
look if I want to consume cannabis I'd

161
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,808
like to consume it from craft regions

162
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:53,829
where the environmental impact is low

163
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:55,899
where the farmers are known and I'm at a

164
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:57,338
fair price so the problem is you're

165
00:05:55,899 --> 00:06:00,189
trying to get people to pay higher

166
00:05:57,338 --> 00:06:02,139
prices for this extra effort and you

167
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:04,479
have a population of people globally

168
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:07,418
that buy cannabis oh really aren't cash

169
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,788
rich so their disposable income is less

170
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:12,128
and that's gone if you look at the

171
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:13,149
global situation so the 1% can afford to

172
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:15,249
buy what they want but they're not the

173
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:16,988
cannabis consumers is everyone below

174
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,639
them and so it's trying to be able to

175
00:06:16,988 --> 00:06:21,899
figure out how do the farmers get

176
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,069
themselves into very specific niches of

177
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:26,649
acknowledgment where people recognize

178
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:28,899
their products they recognize the region

179
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:30,908
they recognize the farmer and they

180
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:32,949
recognize that they're fairly priced and

181
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:35,079
that starts to allow you to be

182
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,329
competitive and as these products start

183
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,999
to move across the borders then all

184
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:42,369
other high level products small niche

185
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,989
products move across borders too and so

186
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:46,209
why wouldn't we be able to move our

187
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:48,668
products across these borders and allow

188
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:51,668
the cheaper products to come in to allow

189
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:54,038
people who have a less price point get

190
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:55,838
cannabis enjoyment yeah because it's not

191
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,428
about taxing people the death is to

192
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:59,110
create a gradient where the poorest

193
00:06:57,428 --> 00:07:00,728
person can afford the product the

194
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,379
richest person could afford a product

195
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:04,508
and they may get different products in

196
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:06,009
terms of the fine qualities but

197
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,588
fundamentally the poorest person still

198
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:10,158
has an edible quality product where

199
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:11,899
there's no toxins no content

200
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:14,360
and it gives them the effect they desire

201
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:16,009
and the upper echelon of subtleties that

202
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,098
you have to basically develop a palate

203
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:20,899
for right to even appreciate it once we

204
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:22,699
can do that and educate it so really to

205
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,889
me this is a twenty year cycle and

206
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:28,718
that's the part that's so scary is that

207
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,718
can we survive twenty years
