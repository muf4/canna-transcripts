my dad was 18 years old he was the first

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,070
person in his family to go to college

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:27,689

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:30,300
order to to the court about college

7
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,058

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,920
that quarter you got droplets Vietnam he

9
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,339
came back from Vietnam to totally change

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,340
me

11
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,350
if you fast-forward 30 years I was 22

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,030
when I figured out that that room in the

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,800
basement with the lights and the plants

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:57,448

15
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:59,429
in tomatoes 12 years later David for

16

Veterans Day in 2014 we've just taken

17
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:19,439
down our first to go harvest of

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:21,329
marijuana so when you under it and when

19
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,189
you ask why I do what I do and where I

20
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:24,689
get the energy to graze multiple round

21
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,060
in and run a business and be the

22
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,700
president of cannabis clients I do this

23
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,618
every day for my death they do this

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,228
every day for the veterans we can't get

25
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,118
access to medicine that we know works

26
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,728
for them and help make their bites

27
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:41,579
better I do this for the mothers and

28
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:43,469
fathers those children are suffering the

29
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,329
terminally ill diseases or miss grant

30
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:48,390
hands are suffering and they can you get

31
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,929
access that we know it works and they do

32
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,640
this for us wives and the mothers and

33
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:56,519
daughters whose husbands and brothers

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,200
and fathers are sitting in jail Prasanna

35
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:02,340
plant two people who wanted to buy it

36
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,170
it's time to raise their consciousness

37
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,170
to stop this insanity

38
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,459
[Applause]

39
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:27,329
so my name is Daniele results and I am

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,310
serving my second term as a

41
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,800
democratically elected president for the

42
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,590
cannabis wine you guys including in this

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,450
position not really sure why I'd like to

44
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,950
think it's because mercurial optimism

45
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:49,429
and charming good looks and I think it's

46
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:51,780
much much deeper I think that I had s

47
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,909
and it's because of my comprehension as

48
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,650
an industry as a business owner and it

49
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:58,319
being part of this industry since long

50
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,890
before was legal I think it's my vision

51
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:05,039
of how we collectively want community to

52
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:06,779
a poem and I think it's my empathy for

53
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,849
all parties involved willing and

54
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,919
unwilling the no identities and their

55
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:15,930
feelings just as important as ours good

56
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,539
listener or good leaders we listen to

57
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,250
all sides of the point we empower people

58
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,079
to work with issues that are important

59
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,689
to them and to bring multiple

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,980
perspectives to the table so that we

61
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:28,859
compound and find a solution that works

62
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:30,840
for everybody and they see many policy

63
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,000
makers or regulatory regulators in this

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,879
room knows that there are a whole lot of

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,080
opinions beside the cannabis industry

66
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,120
and it would make your hands jobs a

67
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,130
whole lot easier if we could all come to

68
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,159
agreement and find common ground before

69
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:44,620
we showed up

70
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,159
phone calls emails and that's exactly

71
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,810
what the cannabis alliance does the

72
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,509
campus life is made of producers

73
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,199

75
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,929
we're also made up of other associations

76
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,849
patience empathy is ancillary businesses

77
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:07,689

85
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:28,420
I feel really silly to business person

86
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:32,620
to my marketing expert would kill me if

87
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:35,800
I didn't mention that I've also we are

88
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,370
lazy to use your processor in Bellingham

89

using 100% LED technology and water

93
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:50,319
reclamation systems to give you an idea

94
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:53,320
that we do give you an idea what that

95
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,469
means we use 50% less power consumption

96
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:58,930
and normal indoor grills that use a GPS

97
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:01,570
and which is approximately enough to

98
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:04,750
power 150 homes per year in our current

99
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:08,168
situation we went using 550 gallons of

100
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:10,629
water at age 14 which the you mentioned

101
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:13,060
my husband team up today the water

102
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:16,519
equation system we didn't make these

103
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,199
choices to save money it's not

104
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:20,568
we made these choices because it's the

105
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,060
right thing to do it is the greatest

106
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:24,680
good and those morals of values that

107
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,329
drive our decisions and our business

108
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,158
practices of trailblaze and are exactly

109
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:30,560
the same morals and values that ivory

110
00:05:28,158 --> 00:05:33,978
Canada's Alliance and our board members

111
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,430
share it's been an honor and a privilege

112
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:40,098
to volunteer with us lands I know you

113
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:45,668
obviously you guys have no interest in

114
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:47,990
starting an industry in every

115
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:52,209
Association this new every regulatory

116
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:55,960
procedure is new its total chaos I mean

117
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:58,068
and the Jinni floor is really daunting

118
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,739
but the people who make up the members

119
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:02,300
of Canada's alliance by title ways their

120
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,598
startup companies and their family

121
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,759
obligations to invest in the greater

122
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:09,649
good they have a vision of where they

123
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,509
thought the cannabis industry to go and

124
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:13,218
they have tactics about how to get there

125
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:14,658
they might not know it all right there

126
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:16,579
in their heads but they're surrounded by

127
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:18,168
the people that are also offering ideas

128
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:20,149
bouncing off each other

129
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:22,250
so that we can actually get to what we

130
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:24,859
know cannabis industry is capable of

131
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,589
doing the members of the Canada

132
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,718
industries will fight or not just what

133
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:32,198
is good for their bottom line but it was

134
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:34,968
what is fair and good for all of us

135
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:39,699
which is a really stellar lead-up to our
