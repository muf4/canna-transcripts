goal is we're going to present the

50
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:09,349
panelists with a question I'm going to

51
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,510
start with a different 11 each time and

52
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:15,019
and get all three of an opportunity to

53
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:16,579
comment on the topic and then we'll just

54
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,530
go through and see how many we get

55
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,360
through in the next 50 minute we will

56
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,300
also have and mincer questions at the

57
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,880
end so with that just are beginning for

58
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,650
the first one so any facility can

59
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:31,159
accompany simply come up with a name

60
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,930
that sounds good to them and then go for

61
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,599
it only to find out later that it has

62
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,240
some problem what advice would you give

63
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,400
us a new canvas company so that they can

64
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:47,150
increase the likelihood that they choose

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:49,340
an effective brand name wagon start as

66
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,610
we can't brand ourselves being on our

67
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:55,400
personal passions are these that are too

68
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,920
close hoping differently our logos to

69
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,200
somebody then they're missing

70
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,000
your audience so always hire

71
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,969
professionals especially in an industry

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,699
we know what the trends are like if you

73
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:10,389
do it super self again nobody's gonna

74
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:15,318
get another a beautiful promise

75
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:19,759
great you know I would add them there to

76
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:22,129
remember even statues lesser are kind of

77
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,500
terminating this joke and you make it

78
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:27,049
memorable when you make and catchy so

79
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,019
kind of attacking me a lot of times it's

80
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:32,870
two words the first word text words are

81
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:35,060
never a letter I worked real well for

82
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:39,469
have been right back also in addition to

83
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:41,239
that remember to make it trademark if

84
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,639
you know you remember to make it

85
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:48,019
something that you cannot trademark

86
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:51,859
gypsy two cohorts and my plural for the

87
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:56,719
devil seven even bleach keeping book so

88
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:59,209
keep that in mind a leader I think this

89
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:02,509
goes back to trip recipes that they have

90
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:04,250
to start with geosearch only little

91
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:06,828
marketer first and foremost so I always

92
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:10,250
look and I find is doubly so because you

93
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:12,290
can't find any probably first over event

94
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,509
I look for the social media angle

95
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:16,608
complete or not in addition trademarking

96
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:18,500
you going to the property to be able to

97
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:21,709
build your brand actually if you can

98
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,079
secure the platforms that meet you of

99
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,629
that sex became unconscious where you to

100
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,569
agree v8 to do surgery and I would say

101
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:31,728
even experts compatibility crisis I was

102
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:35,089
opening my company merging marketing I

103
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:37,279
gave you 15 Mary Jane all the time and

104
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:39,918
has applied for digital voice we share

105
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,288
ways on say how you compute severity

106
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:48,620
marketing I'm still I'm actually looking

107
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:50,418
to change my own that's the point is

108
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,788
it's a learning thing and the Pieta

109
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:56,240
finishing people you can before Kansas

110
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:59,839
has to remember like houses social trade

111
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,319
and you can be very messy them still hit

112
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,478
back of the messenger by the way if I

113
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:09,439
can't drive or social I did not react I

114
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:12,918
hired an proprietors be lasting living

115
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:15,348
thank you this is a great segue so so I

116
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:17,598
also agree and the best way to go to

117
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:19,699
hire a professional because if you are

118
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:21,379
trying to name your cannons company it

119
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:24,978
may be the first company that you've

120
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:27,110
ever made and and you have your owns and

121
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:29,120
experience however if you're using a

122
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,870
brand strategist they have hopefully

123
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,658
have beautiful doesn't making prophecies

124
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,149
on River belt and so let me connects to

125
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:40,519
where you know let's say that for

126
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:43,189
whatever reason the opportunity is not

127
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,810
going to hire someone and they decided

128
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:47,180
that their executive team is going to do

129
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,889
themselves now all four of us as brand

130
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,990
strategist we've got our favorite

131
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:55,939
exercises that we like to run our

132
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,990
clients through to help them come to to

133
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:00,079
generate Heike

134
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,300
so so we share one of your preferred

135
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:11,529
exercises

136
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:14,220
to the client insulting generating you

137
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:20,500
know I would say first and foremost to

138
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:24,880
try to combine what you do with a word

139
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:28,060
begin and his trademark a you know and

140
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:31,569
if you can find those two things I

141
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,060
secretly visited you know hip again if

142
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:37,389
you can find an identifier along with

143
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,100
something that is unique I think that's

144
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:41,500
right in the alley that you want to be

145
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,150
and you know I didn't mean to create

146
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,660
this brainstorm and you know I think

147
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:48,849
it's just talking a client will be the

148
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,050
topic client through and pretty soon

149
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,480
you'll figure they answer their own

150
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,990
questions and it's just hitting them

151
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,400
leading them to do and so you know talk

152
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,310
about you making a few conversations

153
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:03,819
with friends and family remain you know

154
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:06,490
can talk through who you are who is your

155
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:07,269
consumers what are you doing and the

156
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,699
morganelli

157
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:15,699
through your own discussion you'll have

158
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:19,750
up with your ranked communal event I say

159
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:21,879
what she said but we basically take that

160
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,730
thing and if you have charging being a

161
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,430
force that allows us to kind of continue

162
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,750
our customer or client would at least

163
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,920
that be

164
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:35,889
Asian and Indian students returning a

165
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,350
selvage a lot of the exercise we were

166
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:41,139
not in develop literally digitally

167
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:43,360
stalking my clients and the potential

168
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,189
customer base that they're tied to to

169
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,560
reach in that way I would say I think

170
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:49,990
it's culturally hacking we're trying to

171
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,980
figure out LaHood we want is about the

172
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:56,680
particular target market ax will lead us

173
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:00,460
this rightward several types of hurt

174
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,889
resultant one of the things that I

175
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:05,739
always recommend it to clients when I

176
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:07,418
was in the Brandon game with don't go

177
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,060
which necessarily your first choice

178
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:12,459
they'll come on the quarter five-day

179
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,829
lightweight I like number one to number

180
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:17,079
two or number three or number get by

181
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:19,029
that you could totally desire and then

182
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:21,490
choose from those going from the first

183
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:23,439
one that you get you that you might it

184
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,540
might be great that day but for it to

185
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,370
create a a company name that's not

186
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,379
staying power you're going to do much

187
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,959
better to choose one from and rule five

188
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:33,969
that your Orion moment online them so

189
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:36,519
let's start out the other the schita so

190
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:39,700
a comfortable Sarang silver he's kind of

191
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,019
established out of potentially go code

192
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,320
them the names let's talk a little bit

193
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:47,199
on logos so the company grand mark says

194
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,720
a lot about coming right and it is a

195
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,759
thing of being open how to respond to

196
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:57,310
them would you name a common mistake

197
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:59,950
that you see in logos and other software

198
00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:03,909
problems on the keeper real high in

199
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:06,250
somebody else's style if you will is up

200
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:08,500
the state are taking that isn't

201
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:11,110
especially in Canada that shape because

202
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,289
the underground for nearly 11 years of

203
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:17,529
birth yet um listen usually might not

204
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:19,839
with a granite or even I can even pay me

205
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,449
what I want the to apply but I would say

206
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,240
that ultimately patches are your way to

207
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,100
get a seasoned business we know we

208
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,070
already saw Girl Scouts kind of doing

209
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,990
that is the name of strength so I looked

210
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,050
at the region I think I see I need to

211
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,960
get someone company with a brand logo

212
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:40,179
that looks exactly like something out as

213
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,180
a play of it and it's so cute it is so

214
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:46,239
clever for not real-life business you

215
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:53,229
know it's one of those things is been

216
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:55,299
sailing for last look of sharp

217
00:09:53,230 --> 00:10:00,159
interesting because my firm did ran

218
00:09:55,299 --> 00:10:02,620
study a couple of years ago that ran for

219
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:07,449
the big topic of conversation about to

220
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:10,060
leave or not to be a logo and you know

221
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:13,210
there was so much discussion on do not

222
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:16,389
leave to give me dreams values this by

223
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:19,810
mainstream this map and so we didn't

224
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:22,659
study that we did it for a company we

225
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:26,289
did a tribal to about having me

226
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:28,419
we did a child oh that did not we put

227
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:31,509
the prize into the dispenser

228
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:34,689
that all see the packaging design on it

229
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:38,529
right now can't believe you're not the

230
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:42,490
package with the elite although it

231
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:46,600
wasn't mapped directly so almost three

232
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:49,570
times more the subs when it comes to a

233
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,430
local you know I understand these a few

234
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,180
months ago main James and I'm all for

235
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:54,609
that

236
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:58,209
but also keep in mind that your logo

237
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:02,169
cannot be totally off from who you are

238
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:07,360
or what you do and I'm just as much as

239
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:10,839
you can to say who you are the amatis

240
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,169
when you create your local you know

241
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:17,410
another problem is even that in common

242
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:18,849
color a lot of people will use colors of

243
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:22,149
the color you know that are right next

244
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:25,659
to each other which is technically very

245
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:27,759
definitely the lowest empty consumer

246
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:30,459
vision will be grabbing the top of

247
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:33,519
shelving remember to try to use the

248
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:36,639
color colors that are opposite on the

249
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:42,970
color wheel in color spectrum and we do

250
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:45,460
that work much better as well wine first

251
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,470
don't use fiber when you pay five

252
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,720
dollars for nothing your brands like for

253
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,820
five dollars and I understand that not

254
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,210
everybody has a budget right a lot to

255
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:58,480
random self but I really can guess when

256
00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:00,430
you pay more in this industry I should

257
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,110
go a little bit more towards the

258
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:05,199
mainstream when I work with brands I

259
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:08,470
like stuff that's more coming cheap

260
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,660
an example is impossible we argued well

261
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,820
but Howard sterling he was on that bet

262
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:14,829
he had to edit in public was more fun to

263
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,640
me that your engines go all out I'm

264
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,980
serious

265
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,439
so we can hold stuff back and be more

266
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,659
clever than the hey we're a cannabis

267
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,480
company I kinda like that better I kind

268
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:27,189
of like the creativity of that and no

269
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,450
offense to anybody like it kind of think

270
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:33,400
the leaf is easy and I would reiterate

271
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,379
that you know during the last question

272
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:39,549
we mentioned going with a professional

273
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:41,080
and it's almost always a good idea to go

274
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:42,549
with a professional even if you just

275
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,530
want them to rubber stamp anemia or

276
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:46,689
anything that you're a mullet then I'm

277
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:48,970
going to come to a graphic designer

278
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,400
for goodness sakes go with something too

279
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,769
professional because once your brand

280
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,159
large in the market you can't take that

281
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:56,649
back

282
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:59,919
and yet you're if you're starting a

283
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:02,259
company that means you got short on

284
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,929
funds that leaveth a conservative on how

285
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:07,559
you're spending your capital so that is

286
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:09,579
a good place to spend your money because

287
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,500
you know if you want to come out as a

288
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,300
quality product if you want to deal out

289
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,059
in health even if you want to go very

290
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:18,939
like edgy and talk a lot about it you

291
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:21,819
still want to be a clean design that

292
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,620
really stands itself alone by itself in

293
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:27,040
the market you're going to get that

294
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:30,220
accomplished graphic designer and and

295
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,230
also since we've mentioned having an

296
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,120
expert to help you both with name your

297
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,399
company and with choosing and then

298
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,139
building your logo I would say there's a

299
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,840
good case to have it lead to different

300
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:43,299
people very often the person who's how

301
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,759
can you name may also have some

302
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:47,500
the design shops but the reverse really

303
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,039
isn't as strong to have a graphic

304
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,429
designer

305
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:54,309
help you with the aiming aspect because

306
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:56,829
people play vocabulary and design at

307
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:59,619
this well they're different books to do

308
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:02,200
great can also add that when you are

309
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:06,009
first starting off and you have nothing

310
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:08,800
keep it simple right because ultimately

311
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:10,958
grand and local school few iteration

312
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:15,338
through the years just look at embassies

313
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:18,729
of adult absences that you showing you

314
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:20,529
the unit have transformed the department

315
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,480
without reviewing that therefore target

316
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:25,450
in his transformative actually doesn't

317
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,759
matter in general but is transformed as

318
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,410
well this is you won't be able to have

319
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,509
iterations and then you have

320
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:33,309
professional errors up couple on top of

321
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:35,470
things that you may be started up with

322
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:38,229
and we can reduce it into something has

323
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,209
been validated plus rebranding gives you

324
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,680
more attention you have a party or some

325
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,289
kind of rebranding launch which is

326
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,149
getting into orbit

327
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:48,009
when you can pick you up the attention

328
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:50,289
to you mean you remember when SP

329
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:52,149
regretted their logo I actually whatever

330
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,889
Bernal run trade journals for a lot of

331
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:56,289
just they're simply changing their logo

332
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:58,328
so so now we're going to start with us

333
00:14:56,289 --> 00:15:00,278
left in the middle there so it's less

334
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:02,229
you'll there are so many players in each

335
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:04,958
candidate needs you know whether it's

336
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:08,019
extraction or retail that competition is

337
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:10,899
really severe what's the strategy that

338
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:14,078
you like three staying a company apart

339
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:17,220
from the rest of the pack as far as the

340
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:21,279
brand experience goes

341
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:24,279
you know I think that that also has to

342
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,620
do with demographics you know and where

343
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:29,949
you're located a lot of these products

344
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:32,049
can't cross the economy so keep that in

345
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,629
mind you know if you've got a product in

346
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:38,349
California and we're launching first in

347
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:40,570
the product is you know in New York you

348
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,279
know those to me that's benefiting our

349
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:45,100
brand now if you're thinking about

350
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,019
licensing mass sales growth you also

351
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,649
have to definitely because you can

352
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:53,470
cocktail in them but you know in the

353
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:56,079
initial branding you know I would

354
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,370
definitely say that look at your

355
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:03,639
demographics and ask to do your consumer

356
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:05,379
because they'll also have to do with

357
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,439
your branding and your branding method

358
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:11,889
no leave my current over 40 clients and

359
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:17,590
four different countries and that alone

360
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:20,259
is branding huge nightmare because you

361
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:22,810
your branding so many different ways not

362
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:26,470
only for a safe territory inhabited

363
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:30,369
country and you know everyone can just

364
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:32,230
very very very different so look at what

365
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,169
you're you asked as well when you're

366
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:37,060
branding and you know please that

367
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:39,909
consume you know if you have your

368
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:43,209
consumer in New York is very very

369
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:44,259
serious tactics not sourcing or isn't a

370
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,480
casual laid-back

371
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:48,669
keep that in mind especially because

372
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,730
remember when most of these products

373
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:53,370
your combined with in your safe so keep

374
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,629
that in mind

375
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,970
[Music]

376
00:16:54,629 --> 00:17:01,000
we are crazy endlessly online so what I

377
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:04,209
do is it to show the personality of the

378
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,980
company in your online presence so your

379
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:09,549
Facebook page or your Instagram account

380
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:11,799
if you're at one company like mine a lot

381
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:14,109
of that voice comes through so it is

382
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:17,198
about like celesta and knowing your

383
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:20,318
target audience are you telling someone

384
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:24,568
like me who the jack woman or are you

385
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,568
going to a gentleman through morning

386
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:30,369
that would be if you're really really

387
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:33,700
new to initiating like audible the hell

388
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:36,159
is my target audience what I thought of

389
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,500
my client is really identified the white

390
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,929
space opportunities I did that in

391
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,220
corporate America that's worth a lot of

392
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:46,540
companies that will say okay I set up

393
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,670
the company for success is to actually

394
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:51,250
look where there is the best opportunity

395
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,929
where there is a competition and is

396
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,460
actually easy and I think once you

397
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:56,620
fulfill the single detail about

398
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,870
everything and you show me a one-way

399
00:17:56,619 --> 00:18:02,829
that's relatable to the particular

400
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:04,000
demographic differences have Wilson you

401
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:06,549
know like this one interesting thing

402
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,160
about Canada so what we've seen so far

403
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:12,879
the Kansas sale cycle it's not so much

404
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,769
about gaining new customers to come to

405
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,410
Canada because people come to Canada on

406
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:20,319
their own the chance of sale cycle is do

407
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,690
have wheezy [ __ ] so really when I was

408
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,298
competing against the other

409
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,610
on the shelf next to you and they'll be

410
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:28,908
really aware about who's already in the

411
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:31,589
market and what they look like and

412
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:33,840
differentiate yourself from them and

413
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:36,298
think about who you are who you want to

414
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,009
be in comparison to them because in the

415
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:40,109
end you know there might only be four or

416
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:42,659
five different company mouths shelf next

417
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:44,729
to you and they are going to be in the

418
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:46,860
computer and even one more thing on that

419
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,558
to is done I find that a lot of my

420
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,729
clients become me or even call me about

421
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,428
people are thinking about launching

422
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:57,750
brands being haven't even taken the time

423
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:59,730
to go into a dispensary hang out to see

424
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,490
what people are pulling off the shelves

425
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,919
see what they're saying you know when

426
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,859
they pull it off the shelf just hang out

427
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,549
purpose in some mystery and see for

428
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:10,678
yourself

429
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:12,388
you know why are they going out for

430
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:14,850
product talk to the people that are a

431
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:17,008
little bit faster you know people tell

432
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:19,740
you more than you think if you just ask

433
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:21,389
and ask what is the roughest product

434
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,548
that your body you know what me to

435
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:26,158
purchase it and you'll see that they

436
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:29,819
tell you yeah definitely then take that

437
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:32,190
in mind you need um proposition and just

438
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:36,418
twist years a little corner choosing

439
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:38,038
reasons what you do you know I wanna

440
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:41,490
double down on that you know blood

441
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:42,599
enters are our own unique lot you know

442
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,278
there's something that you want to take

443
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,709
their advice on living that you don't

444
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:49,500
well one thing I they are experts on are

445
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,600
what people buy and I think think of no

446
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,878
other thing for all of us as Canada's

447
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,278
entrepreneurs the after byte header then

448
00:19:53,878 --> 00:19:58,378
you know which were these product rise

449
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:00,628
to people pick up which one guilty

450
00:19:58,378 --> 00:20:02,009
synced and visually acquaintance and

451
00:20:00,628 --> 00:20:04,469
then one

452
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:07,019
- visually excitement event in read you

453
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,970
know ingredients or strength or house

454
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:09,509
use or letters their lesson your

455
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,490
students

456
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:14,490
this is incredibly valuable information

457
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,440
the bartenders can be a focus group for

458
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,710
you they can't get anywhere else and

459
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,660
honestly a lot of people don't give

460
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:25,049
blood vendors the respect that they can

461
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,880
deserve on this topic and so if you ask

462
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:28,919
them for their opinion you'll get a lot

463
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,100
of opinion and it's all three and to

464
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,680
your vendor

465
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:36,119
let's see chatter so so Celeste hit on

466
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,570
this a little bit and let's let's start

467
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:42,539
with the in here so on so do a lot of

468
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:44,250
damage viewers at the state level you

469
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:46,019
know are looking to eventually go

470
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,210
national either they want to take their

471
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:51,299
company national or they're looking to

472
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:52,410
get bought out and put together the

473
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:55,259
larger brand

474
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:57,509
what kind of advice to each of you give

475
00:20:55,259 --> 00:21:00,089
to your client who need to be

476
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:01,740
competitive now at the state level in

477
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:04,619
order to get their revenues up so they

478
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,720
are on a capital but they also want to

479
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:08,789
the bigger national market doesn't

480
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,160
normally playing it yet but they want to

481
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:14,069
make sure that their disposition with

482
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,769
their brand that they can get bought out

483
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:20,369
and then in putting local with much

484
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:23,609
other cons right first hire a trademark

485
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:24,989
attorney right into decision even if

486
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:27,209
you're going to be local turn on or two

487
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:30,990
or five years you need to be trademarks

488
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:33,509
and a time but second would be if you're

489
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:36,099
creating a great intial blood once you

490
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:37,629
go and ask them before are we clear

491
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:40,240
I can tell you how many people like that

492
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,820
I saw you wagon because it is a small

493
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,299
industry still but if you are active

494
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:48,909
online in a great website things like

495
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:50,980
these create that lets you handle it

496
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,900
every networking group where in Canada

497
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:57,849
your name out there willfully it gives

498
00:21:52,900 --> 00:22:01,210
me those what new mention I know I say

499
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:03,609
to again try to keep yourself as unique

500
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:07,809
as possible you know one grandma did

501
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:11,319
that really well was role and they made

502
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:13,779
their branding their look unique their

503
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,539
colors recognizable things like that and

504
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:19,119
was not be purchased to do as how many

505
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:22,000
or or merchants or whatever was what you

506
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:25,059
built their purchasing and grandpa and

507
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,099
you create the recognition which is

508
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:29,740
worth looking hard on creating that

509
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:31,899
uniqueness that recognition and then

510
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,509
also don't forget the element of quality

511
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:37,000
and customer service because we know

512
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:39,279
what is going to purchase or work with

513
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,559
you if you have a bad customer service

514
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:47,649
or your quality in our so keep one nine

515
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:50,409
to twelve about the marketing of effect

516
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:53,200
and branding branding brand don't get

517
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:57,070
out the bass coaches and I would ask

518
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,620
that reduce paper the first is that an

519
00:22:57,069 --> 00:23:01,538
educated consumer is going to be of

520
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:03,538
that's the person s bring more people

521
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:06,609
back to the table so in addition to

522
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:08,648
really crafting what your product launch

523
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:11,319
strategy is verbally you want to

524
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:12,969
leverage the visual space getting blown

525
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:15,009
away and you're really looking to

526
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,829
provide education which is global and

527
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:20,169
means for advocacy which is also verbal

528
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:21,970
the second thing is I feel like when you

529
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:24,190
think about a national strategy versus

530
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,288
the local one you're looking at are you

531
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,200
packing into Main Street so yes please

532
00:23:26,288 --> 00:23:32,788
more cannabis consumers absolutely is

533
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,288
again two episodes up but if you are not

534
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:37,089
competing you have not use it in 20

535
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:40,119
years and you're the person than just

536
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:42,519
your element still using it or pictures

537
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,619
of abuses in the Darian brush and in

538
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:47,138
realizing that it works for my own where

539
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:49,689
I work for my son and I want to be how

540
00:23:47,138 --> 00:23:52,089
are Celine you're not necessarily just

541
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,649
going to be sold on cannabis and so you

542
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:55,269
want to make sure at the very least

543
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:57,459
you're reaching that population of

544
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:59,829
housing people type accident educating

545
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,139
them they want to be educated to hunter

546
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:03,939
and evangelist for you if you do have an

547
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:06,009
income saying if you do what you did

548
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,679
earlier and tell my friends to and

549
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:10,538
ultimately that's why would we want us

550
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:13,298
elaborating that powering in that reach

551
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:16,990
on a national level now what you think

552
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:19,418
that that's right hand or a vacuum so so

553
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,669
what we're talking about expanding from

554
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:23,919
state levels in the national level you'd

555
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:26,019
only locally legging didn't be

556
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,538
participating in all of your your

557
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:30,909
locally then your media events like this

558
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:32,679
for the you know that Arizona market and

559
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:35,470
you'll go with these things talk to

560
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:37,809
people and establish yourself in your

561
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,909
reputation for both you and your product

562
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:41,740
at state level but we're all looking for

563
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:43,149
hopefully you know getting your bought

564
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,950
out or when nationally

565
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,718
that's where the real serious dollars

566
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,249
are and so that brings us back to

567
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:51,820
digital which all three of you are

568
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:53,288
experts in and so I want to top us out

569
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:56,950
there that what was the thing that I

570
00:24:53,288 --> 00:24:59,798
find that the top level jazz companies

571
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:03,028
are doing that others are not they're

572
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:06,429
creating their own original content and

573
00:25:03,028 --> 00:25:07,838
you know so many options off the doors

574
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:09,399
they don't have time just looking at you

575
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:11,739
they're busy and so they just take

576
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:14,018
whatever new story is going around that

577
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:15,999
day and they just repost that and that's

578
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:17,618
all that happens people end up hiding

579
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:21,489
you because they're seeing those same

580
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:23,558
articles everywhere else and so you know

581
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:25,269
what I don't tell people is you know

582
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:28,088
take pictures of things that are

583
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:30,338
happening in your company's world that

584
00:25:28,088 --> 00:25:34,298
that gives you a sense of authenticity

585
00:25:30,338 --> 00:25:36,848
and create the feeling that their review

586
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:38,588
actual humans behind your coming so for

587
00:25:36,848 --> 00:25:40,898
this question along the same line is

588
00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:43,210
what are some suggestions or even just a

589
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:45,668
suggestion that you give your clients on

590
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:49,899
the Digital side o how they can seem

591
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:52,450
Nilla tangible real human company but to

592
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:54,699
their Facebook I think it starts with

593
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,650
including yourself with a story so I

594
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,319
started off as a

595
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:02,710
knocked over a Campari to see these are

596
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:05,769
not typical have children girl but I was

597
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,660
a former stoner and Hobbit I started on

598
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:10,569
watching videos of Celeste actually

599
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,490
talked about marketing and then I wanted

600
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,379
to lead a question like that when I

601
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,750
talked about Ohio at the end of this

602
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:19,570
executive I don't know where as four

603
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,789
months ago I had $13,000 and their

604
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:23,679
language would be I think it starts to

605
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:26,319
telling the story itself there are not

606
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,660
enough boys and you know I was thinking

607
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:31,569
stage one of my different people but

608
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,580
back tell that story that ultimately so

609
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:35,980
I think that the more dreams with your

610
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:38,049
own story out there the better and the

611
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,259
more effective and filled but maybe

612
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:43,539
wanna bid column select businesses as

613
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:46,629
well and then that was followed with

614
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:48,308
education about I restarted so some of

615
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:51,610
the advocacy pieces were all in the

616
00:26:48,308 --> 00:26:53,829
community together and and our hope and

617
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:56,349
purpose emerge eventually that means I

618
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:58,449
think that that power you need to be a

619
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:00,969
digital phase really works and you can

620
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,480
start being no cotton just attorney on

621
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,420
yourself

622
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,150
other classes I didn't work is like I

623
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:10,058
have data event I forced people in our

624
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:12,820
profession to make a multi happen figure

625
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:16,440
out your hashtag hashtag is very sexual

626
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:16,439
do please leave normally

627
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:26,039
so that becomes worse you know I would

628
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:29,100
say that we are along the same lines

629
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:31,649
between the humanize yourself and a lot

630
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:34,079
of my clients with my social media team

631
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:38,070
it'll give seven coordinators and it's

632
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:40,379
so funny it can get boring it can get

633
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:42,539
glance there's only so much community

634
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,640
propose so much education you can give

635
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:46,470
so much about this so yes

636
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,930
give those things that's important but

637
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,150
at the same time humanize yourself for

638
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,100
constantly Ellen your height send us

639

your product there's a photos of all

643
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,960
these types of things that humanize

644
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:07,079
yourself you know and I think it's very

645
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,819
important to to passion pain to write

646
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:12,289
your own carcasses you know that

647
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:16,829
authorship is invaluable that SEO

648
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:20,220
centigrade is the analogy those links in

649
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:23,789
announce when people rerun your original

650
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:26,789
articles are invaluable so it takes time

651
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:29,789
no more delay I don't like to write but

652
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:33,750
I do because there's too much value do

653
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:36,269
not and so was to a going in you lose

654
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:39,420
too much vitamin value in new media and

655
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:43,019
so take the time right

656
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:45,140
optimize those articles from SEO athlete

00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,859
cultivation picture from a dispensary

662
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:03,079
clients I get more engagement than

663
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:05,539
anything since you and I have any

664
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:08,298
complications but everybody out there is

665
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:11,389
not an amazing people - seems like that

666
00:29:08,298 --> 00:29:13,970
it's the innovative Roman and and it's

667
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,590
bit syriza trying being behind it things

668
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,120
like that it's also branding yourself

669
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:19,209
and make sure you have a professional

670
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:23,149
photographer because I'll do a driver

671
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,440
and on the other one what am I going to

672
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:27,380
can't remember there was just a

673
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,570
cultivation so anything was evil but

674
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,150
tender picture show pictures of your

675
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:34,519
waking you can begin what if someone's

676
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,630
on the fence about it there are diesels

677
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:38,359
are afraid of what it's going to look

678
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:40,240
like inside it's transparent as you can

679
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:44,298
be it's going to help you right now

680
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,009
that's well said and you know should so

681
00:29:44,298 --> 00:29:47,990
many of us are any industry a lot of the

682
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:50,329
things that we all get used to the end

683
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:52,548
consumer is definitely not you - I mean

684
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:54,199
it will happen out in kind of readings I

685
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:56,210
remember the first time I saw a male

686
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,160
plant getting off Holland and on the

687
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,558
early days windii never see that because

688
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,080
the

689
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,990
Morini be called early on consumer never

690
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,668
got speed one and a prism I saw it you

691
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:09,720
know fingers addendum polymer will

692
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:11,370
commence nature in India you do that

693
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,589
because you can't think about what's

694
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:15,778
happening in your shop you know but

695
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:17,579
better not get the retail job or an

696
00:30:15,778 --> 00:30:18,538
extraction shop whatever we're going

697
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:20,609
your place of business

698
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:22,679
think about what you're seeing that

699
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:24,778
other folks are you don't know how

700
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,820
popular and how much share those big

701
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:29,278
bags of nodes are you know that

702
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:31,439
extractors both you to see where these

703
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:33,898
other eyes get big and they get all the

704
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,669
dreaming about a right and so think

705
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:38,069
about what your company is doing that's

706
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:40,769
cool in college the same thing that you

707
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:43,259
keep out on with your own employees at

708
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:44,940
work take pictures of that stuff even

709
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:47,569
corn pictures and you'll have somebody

710
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:52,080
there like you know like this major Cody

711
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:58,408
continue to seem fun buying zine let's

712
00:30:52,079 --> 00:31:01,168
see here so so what so you know many

713
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:03,720
companies find great success in

714
00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:06,659
co-branding with another company to

715
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:10,700
benefit both what should a company look

716
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:14,820
for in a co-branding partner I

717
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:19,139
definitely think that you need to be

718
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:23,668
able to cross-promote with partners you

719
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:26,379
are in a relevant situation hedging

720
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:29,080
reversible and that's one of the things

721
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,730
that we love doing that are because the

722
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:33,699
amount of clients we have we have

723
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:37,360
promote them all and it's great because

724
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:40,059
we will drive traffic to both of them

725
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,979
even more traffic and get more haulers

726
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:46,480
and more engagement because we're

727
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:50,500
prospero me so we can go to prosper look

728
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:55,019
to get happening to are relevant to what

729
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:58,329
you do look to engage with influencers

730
00:31:55,019 --> 00:32:03,039
who have more followers than you or

731
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:06,429
people or a captive sometimes use their

732
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:09,309
hashtags and cross promote that way

733
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:12,430
another thing if you have a product to

734
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:15,190
shout out dispensary you'll see this out

735
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:17,910
pays off in the long run that sort of

736
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:21,850
thing look for for that relevance in

737
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:23,860
children I don't even think I haven't

738
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:27,549
even asked that that was a really good

739
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:30,179
explanation as always make sure you

740
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:33,250
information as well not all the time

741
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:35,200
silences are really cool with it because

742
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,240
if they have a good for instance I'm it

743
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:42,279
means keeping track that and the limited

744
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:43,680
but I I will pad and across from uh

745
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:47,970
between grant design

746
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:51,269
I think there's also an interim opponent

747
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:54,000
don't forget to ETL fundamentals that

748
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:57,000
you see every day in consumable Target

749
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,119
or Walmart Walmart store well you can

750
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,559
trust to look into that way and well if

751
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:04,289
you have a heart that goes in the

752
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:07,200
dispensary you can you know make a lot

753
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:08,789
more headway with a number of uses you

754
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,019
got going out the door get in order to

755
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:14,730
dispensary itself awesome potion

756
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:16,589
satisfactory and you use those win by

757
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,599
following up with the support individual

758
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:22,049
space like hey we've got something going

759
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:24,059
on to this particular place 20% off 25%

760
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:26,609
off so there now to the time

761
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:28,980
I also recommend eating a little bit so

762
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:31,979
that people are able to track how much

763
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:36,360
having additional incremental x87 to the

764
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:38,039
floor a little type of hospital so

765
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,889
they're so kind of order yourself eating

766
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:42,450
program you're not sure what that is you

767
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,759
know right learn did I actually learned

768
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:47,610
it from uh from Puff Daddy right I mean

769
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,799
this hop is is it is the original go

770
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:52,139
grinders you put on an album and then

771
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:55,200
you have all your friends yes on your

772
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:57,270
song so now I can find one album but now

773
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,309
you're getting paste of you know five or

774
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:02,250
seven other artists on that same

775
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:04,470
mountain and so now you go by you know

776
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,910
JB's album and now up now you can turn

777
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,190
on in like six or seven people and it

778
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:11,429
goes on and on from that we do the same

779
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:13,619
thing again if you are a Grover jeweler

780
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:15,630

787
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:30,220
podcast there's an Phil Gramm so there's

788
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:33,158
all these different ways as soon as you

789
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:35,588
think about people in the scene who you

790
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,869
can consider allies and who you would

791
00:34:35,588 --> 00:34:39,849
like to have your grand mean little bit

792
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:41,710
just go ahead and reach out Wednesday

793
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:43,960
Able's lets you soak them together and

794
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,519
cross pollinate our markets and I think

795
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,179
we'd all agree that it really works

796
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:53,828
wonders to Train audiences let's see so

797
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:58,450
um so this is this is an interesting one

798
00:34:53,829 --> 00:35:01,809
so so it worked out use yes so don't

799
00:34:58,449 --> 00:35:04,598
enter state level um when are your

800
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:11,019
favorite places to spend advertising

801
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:13,838
dollars to get brand awareness one

802
00:35:11,018 --> 00:35:16,478
digital world but I do think that the

803
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,038
matrix for marketing at the balance of

804
00:35:16,478 --> 00:35:21,278
hosta is very important

805
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:23,710
I will say that the biggest bet are

806
00:35:21,278 --> 00:35:25,650
going for me is going to be first proper

807
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,829
action especially if your saga after

808
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,829
action is
