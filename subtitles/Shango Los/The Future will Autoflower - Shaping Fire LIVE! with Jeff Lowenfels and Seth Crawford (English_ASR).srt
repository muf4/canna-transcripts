1
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:30,528
so for those of you who don't know I'll

2
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:34,789
start with Jeff on the far side Jeff

3
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:37,609
Lowen fells is a you know 45 plus year a

4
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:39,589
gardening author out of Alaska but most

5
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:42,378
of us in this room know him from his

6
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,900
teaming with microbes teaming with fungi

7
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:47,088
and teeming with nutrients series of

8
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:49,518
books which is like essentially the Holy

9
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:52,460
Grail trilogy for people who love this

10
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:56,929
kind of stuff right and so he has also

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:59,989
got a new book coming out in October all

12
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:02,479
about Auto flowers and it's fantastic

13
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:04,280
I've been able to check out parts of it

14
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,829
as it went to the publisher and it's

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,250
very much an introduction to Auto

16
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:13,819
flowers and and because of that I see

17
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,859
Jeff as an evangelist for Auto flowers

18
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:17,809
and then to his right is my other good

19
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:19,909
friend Seth Crawford and some of you may

20
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,750
know him as a co-founder with his

21
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:28,539
brother Eric of Oregon CBD seeds near

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:33,109
Albany and and so they're focused on

23
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:35,780
heavy-duty non-gmo heavy analytical

24
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:38,750
breeding they're at their laboratory and

25
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,868
with the goal of developing particular

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:45,200
chemo VARs that can target particular

27
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:48,259
symptom issues for patients and so they

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,179
started with CVD they have figured out

29
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:54,349
the CBG they're on their way to the

30
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:57,739
Varens and and it's fantastic much to

31
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:59,780
the joy and chagrin of cannabis farmers

32
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:01,789
throughout the country they're their

33
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,149
seeds continually get outstripped

34
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,228
because as no as many as they produce

35
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:08,538
everyone just then goes and buys those

36
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:10,120
and then they're out again and so you

37
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:13,250
know if people vote with their wallets

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,189
people are voting for oregon CBD so

39
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,900
thank you gentlemen for joining us today

40
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:24,378
so i'm gonna have a sip of water here

41
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:26,840
and then off we go all right so so most

42
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:29,840
people may understand that Otto's finish

43
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,848
faster but that doesn't seem to be that

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,680
it doesn't mean the best application for

45
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:35,568
autos are readily apparent to everyone

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,750
so well we'd like to hear you both

47
00:02:35,568 --> 00:02:40,909
starting with you Jeff how will autos

48
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,580
influence cannabis growing in

49
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:46,430
horticulture going forward well let me

50
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,560
give two different answers the book as

51
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,810
you indicated is really an introductory

52
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,400
book I like to say it's a book for your

53
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,439
sister and your brother it's a book for

54
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,150
your your Uncle Bob and Aunt Sally it's

55
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:59,060
not a book for our professional grower

56
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,650
I'm convinced that auto flower cannabis

57
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,800
is going to change the general

58
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:07,400
populations attitude about cannabis

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,340
because it's the next tomato plant once

60
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,469
in a lifetime I'm 70 years old it's only

61
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,500
happened to me once once in a lifetime a

62
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:17,240
new plant is introduced to the general

63
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,280
horticultural gardening public the last

64
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,420
time it happened it was the snap pea

65
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,310
they took over the pea world and every

66
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:26,719
gardener grows snap peas a couple of

67
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,969
times during their career and probably

68
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,289
every year that's what's gonna happen I

69
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:32,930
think to these Auto flowers because

70
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:35,090
they're so easy to grow their quality

71
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,730
has risen so high as a result of the

72
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,009
genetics and so that's the first answer

73
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:42,049
the second answer is this is a plant

74
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,969
which you can grow on a deck which you

75
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,890
can grow outside in a garden you can

76
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:48,469
grow it in a perennial bed you can grow

77
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:50,589
it in a pot in the ground and so it's

78
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:53,090
something that is accessible to all

79
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,189
growers not just people who have big

80
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,469
farms or a big greenhouse and because

81
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:58,879
they don't have a photo period it means

82
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:01,849
that people who live in northern

83
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,979
climates like Alaska where on September

84
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,560
21st your plant finally gets the

85
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:09,619
darkness that it needs to set flower you

86
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,659
also get a frost that night and then

87
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,120
finally for those who do professionally

88
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:17,149
grow here is a plant which you can use

89
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,790
to inter space between your plants as

90
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,709
they veg the same thing your plant says

91
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,360
they flower you just put them in they

92
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,069
don't care what the light is you can

93
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,020
give them 20 24 hours of light they're

94
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:29,659
gonna flower based on their genetics and

95
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:33,139
so you can use your spare space this is

96
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:36,320
a dream for the entire horticultural

97
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:37,990
world fantastic so so Seth I know you're

98
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,519
coming from a little different direction

99
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,470
Jeff and I share that we were but very

100
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:45,709
interested in home growers and patient

101
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,880
growers but your customers and the

102
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,168
people you are talking I mean I know

103
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,579
you're a heavy patient guy so I'm not

104
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:51,740
saying you're not into patients but but

105
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:54,918
your customers are very demanding right

106
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,710
and so so what are you seeing as far as

107
00:04:54,918 --> 00:05:00,529
the advantages for auto flowers for

108
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:04,189
folks that are growing at a scaled level

109
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:05,568
at acreage size yeah and I would I would

110
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:09,620
say since this is gonna be on the

111
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:11,060
internet for ever this is for posterity

112
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,910
go back and take a look if you're very

113
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,250
interested about geeking out on some of

114
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,770
the historical background on ruderalis

115
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,699
it's that the technical term for auto

116
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:24,948
flowering plants ruderalis is Latin for

117
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:27,139
derived from ruderal which is rubble

118
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:30,169
from the rubble these are plants that

119
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:32,538
can grow anywhere like they can grow

120
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:35,029
where it freezes they can grow through

121
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:38,870
frost they can grow in very very crazy

122
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:41,839
situations and actually finish the the

123
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:45,800
trick at industrial scale is really

124
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,388
being able to get them in the ground at

125
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,970
the right time so whether that's a

126
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,560
direct seeding or transplanting before

127
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,270
the plant goes through stress there's

128
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,939
some underlying genetic mechanisms that

129
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:58,728
lead the plant to go directly into

130
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:01,158
flower when it senses a stressful

131
00:05:58,728 --> 00:06:03,408
situation just to step back for a second

132
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:06,019
because of that posterity sake take a

133
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:06,889
look for that geek out moment at Ernie

134
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:08,718
smalls

135
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,579
Ernie smalls is a Canadian researcher

136
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:12,709
who's been working on cannabis related

137
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:16,519
issues for the last 45 years

138
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:17,899
brilliant gentleman and he is the person

139
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,060
that was responsible for coming up for

140
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:21,649
the industrial hemp zero-point-three THC

141
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,848
rule and if you go back and look at his

142
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,228
earlier writings that was based on

143
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:25,788
taking a leaf off at the top at the

144
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:28,879
plant rather than testing the top eight

145
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:30,050
inches of flower at 0.3% hopefully

146
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,060
that's going to be incorporated into the

147
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,639
USDA rules to say move forward at the

148
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,459
farm bill but in 2018 he wrote a seminal

149
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,650
paper and I'm sure that this is going to

150
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:41,329
go down as one of those Testaments to

151
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:46,008
auto flowering plants and in the long

152
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:47,568
term the the paper is about highlighting

153
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:50,870
the fact that these day-neutral auto

154
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:53,750
flowering plants represent really the

155
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,788
peak in human agriculture so in a lot of

156
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,889
other crops the reasons and rationales

157
00:06:55,788 --> 00:07:00,379
that we have for expanding the total

158
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:03,220
productivity of each individual crop on

159
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:06,430
a per acre basis has come down to

160
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,950
plant breeders geneticists etc over long

161
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,170
periods of time being able to make the

162
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:14,469
plants more compact make them more

163
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:16,120
uniform and take wild types of plants

164
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,730
that tend to have seeds in varying

165
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,329
places on the plant and consolidate them

166
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:26,790
into a usable machine harvestable really

167
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:29,800
energy dense organism and that's been a

168
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,720
true for many of the other crops that

169
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,430
have been domesticated Ernie smalls goes

170
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,050
so far as to say that that is the most

171
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,670
profound thing that we have seen in over

172
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,250
thirteen thousand years of human

173
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:42,069
agriculture is this move towards he

174
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,949
called some semi dwarf or dwarf germ

175
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:47,349
plasm so the title of the paper is dwarf

176
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:49,990
germ plasm and essentially it's about

177
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,879
how to get tremendously large yields

178
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,920
both for food crops if you're growing

179
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,259
for seed hopefully in places where

180
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,449
they're not growing for sensimilla or a

181
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:02,709
cannabinoid products we can get into

182
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:04,329
that later but also for cannabinoid

183
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:05,829
production in general so it's it's all

184
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:09,819
about being able to maximize the space

185
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:11,800
minimize the inputs and really allow

186
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:14,740
both farmers and people who benefit from

187
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,900
these compounds to have more access to

188
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,168
them and and to benefit from this plan

189
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:21,969
and auto flowering plants are tremendous

190
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:24,399
at this yeah maybe we don't know explain

191
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,169
so these plants if you if you're not

192
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,009
familiar with Auto flowers two things

193
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:32,860
first of all they'll start to flower in

194
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:35,529
eighteen days up to three weeks they'll

195
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,810
just flower period which is pretty

196
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:39,848
incredible which is pretty incredible

197
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:45,939
and then the the other thing about them

198
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:49,960
is that they that you can you can you

199
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:52,870
can overdo it with them this is a plant

200
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:56,980
that grew quickly they were discovered

201
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,840
and and and about 1900 1903 scientists

202
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,050
found him in the Volga River area in

203
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,360
Russia he described it it had low low

204
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:06,579
THC or no THC and so they basically

205
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,919
forgot about him and then in the 70s

206
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,870
people started to say hmm maybe we could

207
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:14,709
breed these and so you know the breeding

208
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,690
happened and then in 2003 a guy was able

209
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,950
to successfully commercialize one call

210
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:24,460
lowrider and and you know these are the

211
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,810
ultimate heirloom kind of thing they're

212
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,670
not a land race really I don't think

213
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:29,409
anymore but they're their heirloom and

214
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:32,500
you can you can breed these things they

215
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:34,929
go flower and the you know 18-day third

216
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,269
third week by nine weeks they're

217
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:39,099
finished you harvest it Wow the breeding

218
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:41,319
potential and opportunities on these

219
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,779
things are just spectacular so so the

220
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,030
opportunity to be able to improve on

221
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:47,740
this plant like we have in theory

222
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:50,589
improved on some of the some of our

223
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,279
agricultural plants is absolutely

224
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,290
incredible

225
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,839
another thing that I love about them is

226
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:58,000
that if you have got a greenhouse

227
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,060
environment but you don't you really

228
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,730
want to supplement with light for for

229
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:06,759
whatever reason you can actually do two

230
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,649
cycles of Otto flowers without light

231
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,720
depth and that's crazy right

232
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,000
you know I'm experimenting with that

233
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,649
this year and the biggest thing I ran

234
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,450
into was trying to keep them warm

235
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:18,879
because Otto flowers don't particularly

236
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,879
like to start off their life with cold

237
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,399
feet but the idea is you know you can

238
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,799
you can have your you can you can start

239
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,759
something early spring and have it

240
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:33,459
finish 4th of July and then put put

241
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:35,319
seeds in that same no-till environment

242
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,490
let those pop and they're done by

243
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,090
October 1st

244
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,220
so you've run two cycles and and and you

245
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,950
don't have to pull any tarfu which we

246
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,149
all love to avoid right and so um so

247
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,310
that's fantastic the other thing I

248
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,169
wanted to hit on was it was how

249
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:52,239
appropriate these are for patients and

250
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:54,299
for people with lower mobility because

251
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,590
like Jeff mentioned these are very

252
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:58,329
compact plants right these pretty much

253
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,180
top out at around three three and a half

254
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,680
feet and and because of that you don't

255
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:05,559
have to do the reaching and they're not

256
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:07,989
hard to break down and and you know the

257
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,879
patient can stand up and look all around

258
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,200
them from mold instead of you know

259
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,450
trying to work with some of these nine

260
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,160
footers where they're just impossible to

261
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,960
work with they're beautiful and I love

262
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:18,309
them and I want to talk them right but

263
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,019
but they're really they're you know

264
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:22,149
they're all caged and difficult to work

265
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:24,309
with so this is something that that

266
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,649
folks who are living in an apartment who

267
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:28,449
are growing in a tent can grow for these

268
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:29,939
together with no sweat you don't even

269
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,770
need to scrub them

270
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,310
and and then if you're a patient they're

271
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:37,379
so easily it's easy to use and always

272
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:39,359
going to flower in a particular

273
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:41,370
timeframe you be ready to go that it

274
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,600
really opens up the door but let's not

275
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,490
leave the impression that these are

276
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,960
little teeny baby flowers because their

277
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,730
little teeny plants you know I mean

278
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:52,040
there there's there's a there are some

279
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:54,750
I've seen colors that are 80 grams Wow

280
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:57,719
unbelievable and they'll have you know

281
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:00,750
10 of these colas on a plant so so these

282
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,050
are not the the lowrider that you

283
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:07,740
remember these are a totally new plant

284
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:11,159
ready for primetime just to add on to

285
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,810
that so yes you can make them flower in

286
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:14,639
general for field production we're

287
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:17,059
looking at about 77 days from the time

288
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,409
that the seed emerges in a starter plug

289
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:22,500
transplanted into the field within the

290
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:24,539
week 77 days from that time of emergence

291
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,129
until we harvest it and what Jeff is

292
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:30,120
saying is absolutely true what we see

293
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:31,740
with regular photo period plants is the

294
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,240
stem in stock weight accounts for about

295
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,250
27 and a half percent of the total

296
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,259
biomass of the plants with these

297
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,269
day-neutral plants you're looking at

298
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,580
roughly nineteen percent so this is a

299
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:44,639
order of you talking about a significant

300
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,500
percentage of increased biomass now the

301
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,319
one thing that I will say it it's it's a

302
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:53,399
little bit of a little bit of a brain

303
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:56,400
bubble is try growing one of these in a

304
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,679
hundred gallon smart pot okay so it's

305
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,149
really nice for patients or someone

306
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:01,229
who's just trying to experiment with one

307
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:03,059
of these plants in a three gallon

308
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,190
container to have it on their deck it's

309
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:07,409
amazing it's really cool the very useful

310
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,690
plants they stay small they're not gonna

311
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:10,709
flip out if you'd hit them with a porch

312
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,960
light in the middle of the night when

313
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,670
you go outside but if you put one in a

314
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,519
much bigger container you're gonna

315
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:19,860
notice that the flowering system is

316
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,750
genetically determined based on stress

317
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,629
and stress particularly to the root zone

318
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:27,000
so you can actually grow five six seven

319
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:30,029
eight nine foot tall auto flowering

320
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,769
plants if they have enough root space

321
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:33,569
and they're not restricted they're

322
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,949
actually when we think about cannabis

323
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,690
one of the things that researchers

324
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,759
always go back to is the amazing

325
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,740
plasticity of that plant and its ability

326
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,809
to respond to the environment that it's

327
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,159
placed in Auto flowering plants the

328
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:45,049
state

329
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:48,198
neutrals are to me it's the epitome of

330
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:49,490
that alright so so I want to pull

331
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:50,838
together something Jeff just said and

332
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,240
something you just said and take it

333
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,509
further so Jeff loves to talk about how

334
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,250
these scrappy little plants from Russia

335
00:13:55,509 --> 00:14:00,259
you know you can put them in in in Rocky

336
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,750
crappy soil and they still very much

337
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:04,850
thrive and and you have spoken to me

338
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:08,299
before just like you just did to all of

339
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:10,339
us that that this it's the stress of the

340
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:12,708
of the roots hitting the bottom of the

341
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:14,000
pot that's gonna trigger flowering and

342
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:16,549
but I've never heard you give this

343
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,220
example before of these large hundred

344
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:20,899
gallon pots which makes me very

345
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,269
interested in growing an 8 foot Otto

346
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:28,250
flower just to do it right so here's my

347
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:29,629
question is that if if if how do how do

348
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,909
they grow in soil then cuz like I know

349
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:34,819
you go right into the ground but there's

350
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:36,350
no eventual bottom of the pot so there

351
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:39,588
has got to be something going on

352
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:42,019
scientifically genetic so what's the

353
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:44,180
trigger yeah in part and one of the

354
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:45,889
things when you're there are many many

355
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:47,750
different soil conditions and the

356
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:49,159
Willamette Valley were blessed with a

357
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,019
number of things including we'll get

358
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:53,448
into this as we talk about farming at

359
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:55,339
scale but we have in certain locations

360
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:58,250
38 feet of topsoil and if it's properly

361
00:14:55,339 --> 00:15:00,079
prepared you can end up with very large

362
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,269
plants I mean we had plants that were

363
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:05,659
averaging a pound and a half per per

364
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:07,610
plant planted very densely in in the

365
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:10,100
field just north of Corvallis last

366
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,750
summer for one of our indie trials it

367
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,639
really comes down to proper soil

368
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,679
preparation and the ability for those

369
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,860
roots to just go out and do their thing

370
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,870
you know now in the book I stress that

371
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,600
it's that from the perspective of an

372
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,179
amateur growing these things they they

373
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,250
don't really like to be repotted all the

374
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:30,588
time I mean you so I always tell people

375
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,958
to grow them in the original container I

376
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:34,370
started out with 3 3 gallon containers

377
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,479
because you know I thought the plants

378
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,429
were cute and everything else and

379
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,808
there's something they call it now super

380
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:41,149
Auto flowers they're really the same

381
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:43,250
thing but different soil structure and

382
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,198
different soil amounts and so now I'm

383
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,759
telling people I 5 gallons is good that

384
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:50,028
you know you'll pick what is Hardware

385
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,829
bucket but 7 gallons is even better and

386
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:53,750
you put the seed right in it I mean I

387
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:55,589
don't even start them in a because I

388
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:59,279
think if if they if they

389
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:00,840
are stressed they will flower hi and the

390
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,789
worst thing you can have is something

391
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:08,190
that flowers when they're not cheap

392
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:09,839
seeds although you can grow your own

393
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,400
season they become cheap

394
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,860
yeah it's disappointing when they're

395
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,419
five inches tall yeah and I actually I

396
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,159
actually did that for my first time and

397
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:20,399
I have I can admit to making that

398
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:22,110
mistake my first tray last year I still

399
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,720
like my idea I put them in root riot

400
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,700
plugs which I like because um when i

401
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,950
find when i propagate right into soil

402
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,259
it's a lot more difficult to keep the

403
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:33,780
soil or keep the seed in a moist

404
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:36,210
environment right the the top of the

405
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:38,970
soil dries out really fast whereas those

406
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,710
root riots while they are soil and so

407
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,290
i'll put the seed in there let it pop

408
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,629
and as soon as i've got like you know

409
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:47,669
you know firmly established coddled and

410
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:49,590
leaves then i go ahead and i put it in

411
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:52,169
before the the roots are coming out the

412
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,090
bottom and they do make some cute little

413
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:56,839
plants i mean you I saw a little plant

414
00:16:54,090 --> 00:17:04,380
growing in a thimble with with it with a

415
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:06,110
you know yeah kind of thing you put on

416
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,510
Instagram

417
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:12,119
Wow and so I had a tray of these right I

418
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:14,509
had a tray of these in and I let them

419
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,559
sit too long in the tray before I

420
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:19,019
because you're right you said you know

421
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,119
that same week you know but so so I let

422
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:25,049
him sit to there and so I had a tray of

423
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,549
very expensive beautiful eight-inch

424
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:30,299
Otto flowers and each one had this

425
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:33,389
gorgeous big noggin top and and you know

426
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:37,319
the the yield per weight was incredible

427
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:40,230
the yield per $15 seed was not right so

428
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:42,899
so I'm growing my own still paying $15 a

429
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,849
gram which is like not not a win but

430
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,040
they made awesome gifts to people

431
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:48,359
because you give somebody a small plant

432
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,639
with this fully mature bud and you're

433
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,959
like here you go snip it off like let it

434
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,640
dry for a couple days and smoke it and

435
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,350
they're like really well and actually

436
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,750
you know I know we're getting getting

437
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:59,699
out of order here but but but in keeping

438
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,160
in my idea that this is the next tomato

439
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,650
I'm convinced that that in in the next

440
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,160
future few years you're gonna be able to

441
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,798
walk into you know you

442
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,509
Whole Foods or wherever at Christmastime

443
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,980
and they're gonna have a little shelf

444
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:14,720
and it's gonna have you know thirty

445
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,279
little Auto flower plants sitting they

446
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,169
look like little Christmas trees that

447
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:20,178
are decorated you know and then at

448
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:21,620
Easter Easter time you know you're gonna

449
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,870
have a play you know plants with a

450
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:28,329
little that little green plastic crap

451
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:30,859
you know this is these plants are

452
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:33,740
unbelievable they're so much fun to grow

453
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:39,619
I just cannot you can I'm peeing in my

454
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:40,669
pants I love this so so I wanna I want

455
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,379
to bring the conversation back to

456
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:43,640
medical which obviously I keep bringing

457
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,320
this conversation back to you because

458
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,360
those are the people I work with a lot

459
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:48,649
and so and we're gonna keep going with

460
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,009
you Jeff and then we'll jump back to

461
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:55,150
Seth so so in terms of medical Jeff I'd

462
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:57,589
like you to speak a bit to the ease of

463
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,720
growing and and I've heard you talk

464
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:01,220
about how you can actually do too much

465
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,140
right so I want to I would like to hear

466
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,179
that and then and then and then Seth

467
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,880
would you pick up since you are

468
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:09,919
analytically breeding these to help with

469
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,039
particular ailments I'd like to hear

470
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,500
from you how the the breeding of Auto

471
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,599
flowers are can be so targeted because

472
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,490
they're so they're so quick to cycle so

473
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,619
but Jeff let's start with you well you

474
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:28,569
know these are these are unbelievable

475
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:31,759
plants and they just just you know

476
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:33,200
compared to as a marigold you know I

477
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,119
read a garden column in the in the

478
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,650
newspaper up in Anchorage and and you

479
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,699
know marigolds are the one plant I say

480
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,750
you know you got to have you got to

481
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,548
plant something or you're not a real

482
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,750
gardener so you plant a marigold you can

483
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:43,819
have you a kid do it with you because

484
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,048
it's the only seat you stick the seat in

485
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:46,579
the ground it's like a sunflower seed

486
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:47,869
there's certain see you just put them in

487
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:49,339
the ground you walk away you don't do

488
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:50,658
anything and they grow well they grow

489
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:52,279
the way they're supposed to grow and

490
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:53,929
that's what happens with these plants if

491
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,808
you put too much fertilizer in the soil

492
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:58,190
if you put any for I don't put any

493
00:19:56,808 --> 00:20:00,589
fertilizer the first time you grow it

494
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:02,330
because you may not need it ever you

495
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:05,178
know you got to watch these plants very

496
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:07,428
carefully they grow so quickly that you

497
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:09,409
know that when the whitefly or whatever

498
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:11,240
decides to hit it all of a sudden it's

499
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12,860
gone through the stage where the where

500
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,169
the you know the right kind of juice

501
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:16,639
it's wait a minute what happened to my

502
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:19,440
plant it's not the same plant anymore

503
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,380
and the insect moves on I mean these

504
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,299
don't need a lot of care now you gotta

505
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,100
keep an eye out for mildew and the kinds

506
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:30,299
of things that you normally do but they

507
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:32,279
quo so quickly that that that if you if

508
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:33,899
you push them too much they're not gonna

509
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,420
grow well the only thing I do to mine to

510
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,280
start when I buy a seed from somebody I

511
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,060
don't know what you know whether it's

512
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,129
gonna be any good

513
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:42,750
I put the mycorrhizal fungi on it and

514
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,360
that is all I do

515
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,430
and generally I've never had to

516
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,799
fertilize any of my plants and they grow

517
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,630
so fast for those of you who grow indoor

518
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:53,700
especially in tents you don't really

519
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,770
have enough time to screw them up and

520
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,170
that's fantastic right you know I had

521
00:20:55,769 --> 00:21:00,420
never heard your example Jeff about the

522
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,920
the plant growing through the stage of

523
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,930
life that appealed to any particular

524
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,539
pest but that makes sense the first

525
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:09,120
round I did I've got no mold issues no

526
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:11,549
pest issues and and we're you know where

527
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,139
I live on Vashon Island we don't have

528
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:15,240
that much pest but we always get mold

529
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,950
right and and it's just that their life

530
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,259
cycle is so short a lot of that stuff

531
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,779
doesn't have a time to take over and

532
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:23,730
they've been bred to get rid of the mold

533
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:26,339
so I know the good the people that grow

534
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,839
at new breed seeds that's what they were

535
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:33,809
looking for more let's get rid of that

536
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:35,220
mold and they did in terms of being able

537
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:36,809
to use these plants for different

538
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,380
medical conditions I always defer to dr.

539
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:41,909
Ethan Rousseau who is somewhere out here

540
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,410
so I'm not going to speak to exactly

541
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,420
what type of compounds are going to help

542
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,710
for particular ailment all we know is

543
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,720
that all of these different compounds

544
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,029
are very useful and trying to figure out

545
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,950
exactly how to triangulate and make use

546
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:54,509
of those compounds and get them into

547
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,870
plants in a way that's useful for for

548
00:21:54,509 --> 00:22:00,539
patients and for people across the world

549
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:02,519
is is really our goal so when we look at

550
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:04,589
different plants from a breeding

551
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:06,569
perspective what we're really trying to

552
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:08,220
do is we need photo period plants for

553
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:09,539
very particular locations we need plants

554
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,610
are gonna flower early but they're still

555
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,109
photo period sensitive and we need auto

556
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:16,439
flowering plants so that you can deploy

557
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:17,819
these these plants in basically once

558
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,440
you've developed a particular chemo bar

559
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:21,659
you can deploy them anywhere in the

560
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,730
world and that's really what makes these

561
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,370
different compounds available to people

562
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:28,980
so having CBD varieties having CPG

563
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:31,199
varieties CVC rich plants more

564
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,000
importantly now working on CBD v cv g'v

565
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,759
and

566
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,980
cbcb along with other other minor

567
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:39,319
compounds that we don't even know how to

568
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,420
quantify and don't have reference

569
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:43,369
standards for all of those are

570
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,289
incredibly important and not just from a

571
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:47,719
from a from a patient perspective being

572
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:49,309
able to grow it at home and take care of

573
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,589
your own family or take care of yourself

574
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:52,879
through the joy of actually gardening a

575
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:54,740
plant there's something emancipatory

576
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,260
about being able to do that I think

577
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,549
everybody feels that but being able to

578
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:01,190
make sure that those compounds are

579
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:03,829
available at scale at a price that

580
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,600
individuals can actually afford to treat

581
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:07,939
themselves so it's it's pretty important

582
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,859
and these plants make that possible one

583
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,440
one good example of that is being able

584
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:14,899
to use the plasticity of auto flowering

585
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,539
plants for a particular ecological niche

586
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,670
so most most people here are probably

587
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:21,529
familiar with how much grass seed the

588
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:23,150
Willamette Valley produces so well well

589
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:24,950
I'm a ballet so them to 95 percent of

590
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,330
the world's grass seed production we're

591
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,870
able to grow grass seed in the

592
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:31,970
Willamette Valley for better for worse

593
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:33,739
due to the climate the climate that we

594
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,600
have so we don't normally get rain in

595
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,849
the Willamette Valley through the middle

596
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,009
of July up until the middle of August we

597
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:41,659
have a month of generally speaking very

598
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:43,160
very dry conditions and it allows a

599
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,200
competitive advantage of grass seed

600
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,210
farmers who have good irrigation and

601
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,819
great soil to be able to grow this

602
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,650
particular crop cut it down field dry it

603
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:54,049
it sits in the field for five to seven

604
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:56,450
days and then it gets combine and picked

605
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:59,029
up no other place in the world has that

606
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,430
steady climate that allows for that

607
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:04,460
particularly even though you know most

608
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:06,890
people like food rather than lawns but

609
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,200
no one else is able to really do this we

610
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,120
can actually do the same thing and use

611
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,759
this technique illogical advantage

612
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:15,379
paired with a technological and

613
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:17,779
horticultural advantage by using these

614
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:20,000
auto flowering plants to plant thousands

615
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:22,190
of acres of very rare and useful

616
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,069
compounds that are present in these

617
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,779
plants after specific breeding grow them

618
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:29,029
out and dry them in a way that doesn't

619
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:30,139
require a huge drying infrastructure

620
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:31,809
that you would you would have to have

621
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:35,210
for other crops or in other locations

622
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:36,440
it's a it's a huge I think it's a huge

623
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,539
step forward in terms of being able to

624
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,980
make these compounds available make them

625
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:42,649
an everyday thing so that you can

626
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,240
literally walk into any supermarket and

627
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,679
find something that

628
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,450
is useful and targeting a particular

629
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,250
malady we just need to figure out

630
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,179
exactly what those come which is which

631
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,440
yeah right on

632
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:53,660
I've got to follow up questions for

633
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,000
yourself the first one is is you know I

634
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,440
hear from a lot of folks when I went you

635
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,420
know I've become kind of an evangelist

636
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,370
for Auto flowers because I'm so into

637
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,380
them but people people come up to me and

638
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:05,719
they're like like you know we don't want

639
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:08,210
Auto flowers because we can't breed with

640
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,069
them and and they're they're not for

641
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,390
everybody and I want my nine-foot plants

642
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:12,919
and you already dispelled tonight the

643
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,170
short plants thing I didn't I did not

644
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,660
know they were a taller but um but I

645
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:20,090
like that you just said that there are

646
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:22,580
particular nature environments where you

647
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:25,970
want the photo period some that are

648
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:28,039
photo period but finish early and then

649
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,779
there's Auto flowers I've not heard that

650
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:32,839
analysis before so will you go a little

651
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:35,269
more in depth in there why do we still

652
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:36,678
need the other two categories oh we

653
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:39,950
don't it's just it's nice to have

654
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:42,080
diversity well we do we do need them I

655
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:45,319
mean we need them to breed with because

656
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:48,859
the land race trains our photo period

657
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:51,589
and so we need those so I mean we need

658
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:54,500
them a good example is I when we're this

659
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:56,240
is something that a lot of us living in

660
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,440
in a black market it was difficult to be

661
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,690
able to get information about the way

662
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,100
that people produce in other areas of

663
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,470
the country or other areas of the world

664
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:05,209
a great example is Kentucky and

665
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,640
Tennessee so Kentucky and Tennessee have

666
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:10,279
incredibly wet July August and September

667
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,960
and then they have the very into

668
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,700
September and then through October they

669
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,100
have perfect weather and it's it's

670
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,840
almost like what Oregon is like in late

671
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:21,139
August early September before the rains

672
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,519
hit so it's most of us know here we need

673
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,000
to make sure that our plants are out of

674
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:29,000
the field taking care of harvested dried

675
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,619
properly handled it if it's not done by

676
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,140
the middle of September you're really

677
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:35,119
you're really pushing yourself you

678
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,130
really chancing it in those areas it's

679
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,659
it's the opposite you want to actually

680
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,120
get your plants out at the end of

681
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,950
October so in that case a long season a

682
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:52,399
full season photo period sensitive plant

683
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:53,808
is really the way to go if you if you

684
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,059
have it if you have an auto flowering

685
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:56,509
plant in certain areas you can plant

686
00:26:56,058 --> 00:26:59,449
your

687
00:26:56,509 --> 00:27:02,118
flowers in early may go back and replant

688
00:26:59,449 --> 00:27:03,649
in mid-july and end up getting to crops

689
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:05,628
and and basically double the

690
00:27:03,648 --> 00:27:08,268
productivity of what you have available

691
00:27:05,628 --> 00:27:10,398
to you see unless you live in Alaska

692
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:11,868
where you let have six plants three of

693
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:14,778
which are allowed to be in flower you

694
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:16,939
know so I always tell people don't treat

695
00:27:14,778 --> 00:27:19,519
this like broccoli you know where you

696
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,440
plant it all at once you stagger it and

697
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,899
I don't mean you wait for the crop them

698
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,459
to harvest you know every two weeks or

699
00:27:23,898 --> 00:27:27,738
every week you put it in a couple of

700
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:29,389
more seeds and then when the regulator

701
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:30,229
comes to your house you go now I got

702
00:27:29,388 --> 00:27:32,269
three in flower

703
00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:36,769
you know forget the fact that I got 50

704
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:39,229
pounds of drying weed over here but but

705
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:41,769
but they really are everything you say

706
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:44,659
again sort of emphasizes the idea that

707
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:47,388
home gardener would you know people grow

708
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:49,669
heirloom tomatoes you know you married

709
00:27:47,388 --> 00:27:51,558
Mary and next-door neighbor she's famous

710
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:53,839
because she's got the Oregon summer

711
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:55,668
spring and and George next door is

712
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,168
famous because his are plum tomatoes

713
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:58,729
gonna make the best sauce you know and

714
00:27:57,169 --> 00:27:59,809
they give them away and and that's the

715
00:27:58,729 --> 00:28:01,699
same thing that's gonna happen with

716
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:03,469
these auto flours mine look at the

717
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:05,269
colors on this one look at the landscape

718
00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:06,769
capabilities on this one you know

719
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:09,108
they're not they're gonna be landscape

720
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:10,489
plants they're gonna be a plant that

721
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:12,769
everybody except we've got to get rid of

722
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:14,149
that stigma but it's happening and this

723
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:15,709
is the plant that's gonna carry us over

724
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:17,689
the line I'm convinced and help the big

725
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:19,639
plants as well so I really like what you

726
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,949
said too about neighbors sharing right

727
00:28:19,638 --> 00:28:24,918
because if if we all have got plant

728
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:26,599
limits we're limited by our variety and

729
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,729
you know it's just like tomatoes right

730
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:29,928
you know if you grow tomatoes at home

731
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:31,818
you're still gonna end up buying

732
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:34,399
Tomatoes at the store it's not like

733
00:28:31,818 --> 00:28:36,199
commercial tomato growers are all hosed

734
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:37,578
because we're all growing at home

735
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:39,169
tomatoes you buy the ones at the store

736
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:41,928
so you get the seeds so you can grow

737
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:43,999
them yourself okay but but this is

738
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:45,829
another great idea because neighbors can

739
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:48,259
you know grow different varieties and

740
00:28:45,828 --> 00:28:49,698
trade and it creates increased community

741
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,139
and everybody gets to try more wheat

742
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:53,599
right yeah and so that's the win as well

743
00:28:51,138 --> 00:28:55,668
so last year in the a at the Alaska

744
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:58,308
State Fair they actually in Kenai they

745
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:59,959
had a cannabis entry thing and I'm

746
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:01,368
convinced every every State Fair in the

747
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:03,259
country is gonna have a Auto flower

748
00:29:01,368 --> 00:29:05,538
cannabis contest you know I mean it's

749
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:08,088
just this is the best thing that ever

750
00:29:05,538 --> 00:29:09,329
happened to our industry because it's

751
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:11,220
gonna get mom and

752
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:13,919
pop and uncle Bonnie and Sally who

753
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,900
normally would be against it into it and

754
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,250
that's what we really need so we can get

755
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:21,030
the taxes out of it

756
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:24,089
amen amen I will say that they are a

757
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:27,210
pain in the ass why from a breeding

758
00:29:24,089 --> 00:29:29,669
perspective so we make feminized seed we

759
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:32,160
don't use males and if you can come to

760
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:34,050
me with a good argument as to what is

761
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,050
actually contained in the male genome

762
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:38,599
that's useful and how you can access and

763
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:41,279
figure out what those traits are I'm

764
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:43,589
open to having my mind change that's

765
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,420
what science is about but the way that

766
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:47,789
we operate is we make feminized seed and

767
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,470
we use females because it allows us to

768
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:51,029
know what the chemo type is to know what

769
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:53,279
the terpene profiles are to know what

770
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:54,660
the potency is the flower structure and

771
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,420
then be able to figure out how that's

772
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,500
inherited from generation to generation

773
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,850
auto flowering plants are a different

774
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,849
animal in the sense that when you plant

775
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:04,769
that seed that clock is ticking you

776
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:07,049
can't just go oh hey that's a great

777
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,309
plant well I'll just revenge it and get

778
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:10,859
some cuttings off of it and use it for

779
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:12,569
breeding it's done a great example of

780
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:15,329
this last year we were I was working

781
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:17,220
through and about 20 different CBG rich

782
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:19,949
plants trying to figure out what the the

783
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,660
average ratio of CBG to THC was to

784
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,610
identify which plants we could use or at

785
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,680
least what the frequency was for

786
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:28,319
developing really really high ratio

787
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,450
plants and one of the individuals from

788
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,220
that population we sent the the results

789
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,769
into a third party lab after we tried to

790
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:38,549
screen them in house and they came back

791
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:40,619
and said whoa 50% of your total

792
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:42,659
cannabinoid profile was a compound that

793
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:44,699
we've never seen before it's not a

794
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,529
terpene it looks like a cannabinoid from

795
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,789
its molecular weight but we don't have

796
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:50,129
any reference standards to be able to

797
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:51,930
identify what it is and this is this is

798
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,080
Pyxis in portland they're a very good

799
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:56,670
lab they have more cannabinoids

800
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,470
available to them than most labs in the

801
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:01,529
country and very good equipment very

802
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,940
well trained personnel and the person I

803
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:06,000
was interacting with said can you send

804
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:08,220
me another sample and I'm tearing my

805
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,150
hair out saying that was the only plant

806
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,740
that was it it's gone it's gone you you

807
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,600
can't get that back and so you go back

808
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:18,240
and grow hundreds of those plants out

809
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,309
and you never find that same plant again

810
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,450
so for a structured breeding program

811
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:22,720
when you're trying to isolate these

812
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,809
individual compounds

813
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,829
and turn them into useful field ready or

814
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:32,289
homegrown we're ready seeds it poses a

815
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:34,619
significant challenge because you only

816
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:37,119
have a certain amount of time we have

817
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:39,279
literal professionals now working at our

818
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,799
company who are trying to find other

819
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,180
ways of making this happen and it's this

820
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:46,659
is a it's a significant technological

821
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,490
challenge so there's ways around it but

822
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,400
it takes a ton of space a ton of time

823
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:54,670
and a lot of motivation to to really be

824
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,170
able to isolate them so just a they're a

825
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,340
different animal when it comes to the

826
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:59,590
breeding stampin that's from a

827
00:31:57,339 --> 00:32:02,289
professional perspective from you know

828
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:05,079
real amateur perspective if you take two

829
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:07,750
auto flowering plants and and breed them

830
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:10,149
together you can breed them and they're

831
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:15,759
fun nine weeks holy crowing all of a

832
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:19,269
sudden you know my wife just like big

833
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:21,279
guys do you know what I mean but it's

834
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:23,759
really kind of fun and the idea that you

835
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:28,379
can get somebody's you know genetics and

836
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,379
now I could be careful they talk about

837
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:33,160
sorry folks I joke here you know too

838
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,289
soon too soon

839
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:38,140
you know you get somebody's great

840
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:39,990
genetics as an amateur can I fool around

841
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:42,730
with the stuff a little bit you know

842
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:44,259
these guys obviously but you can you can

843
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,900
fool around with it and and you can do

844
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:48,309
it all winter long and you know under 20

845
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,400
hours of light you can do it all night

846
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:55,059
long if I mean it's just this is a fun

847
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,470
fun plant to grow yeah it can be

848
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:58,179
difficult and it can cause some problems

849
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:00,009
and if you're a professional grower

850
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,930
you got to adjust yourself a little bit

851
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:04,629
but boy if you are a professional grower

852
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:06,850
you're growing medical cannabis get into

853
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:09,550
these auto flowers see what you think

854
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:12,009
see if we can't improve the ability to

855
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:13,299
get more medicine out there and it it's

856
00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:15,400
it I think it's a really important point

857
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:16,539
to you you brought up the historical

858
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,640
reference back to the low rider

859
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:20,470
varieties from 2003 that was a shitty

860
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,420
plan oh but the waters are worse I grew

861
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:24,100
some of that and it just made me sick to

862
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,500
smoke I mean it's horrible the terpene

863
00:33:24,099 --> 00:33:28,599
profile was terrible the structure was

864
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,430
not great but you can see the promise

865
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:33,459
you could you could see the promise and

866
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:35,080
what it took was small-time breeders who

867
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,950
were working under either medical

868
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,678
programs or in

869
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:42,580
garage surreptitiously to improve those

870
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:45,070
plants and it wasn't until 2010 that I

871
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:46,658
finally consumed something that changed

872
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:49,388
my mind about auto flowering plants

873
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:52,690
someone had taken one of DJ shorts

874
00:33:49,388 --> 00:33:55,168
blueberry varieties merci and dominant

875
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:57,759
with a number of different minor terpene

876
00:33:55,169 --> 00:34:01,299
different Terp minor terpenes that end

877
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:03,099
up making it a very calm anti-anxiety

878
00:34:01,298 --> 00:34:05,528
experience and it's a it's a beautiful

879
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:07,569
piece of work but they finally instilled

880
00:34:05,528 --> 00:34:11,050
that into an auto flowering plant that

881
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:12,460
made the effect and the flavor just as

882
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,960
good or better than a lot of the other

883
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,269
commercially available varieties at the

884
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,820
time and that was that was the no you're

885
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:19,780
right the early ones

886
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,399
interesting but they weren't any good

887
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,990
and that's why you know I remember I

888
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:25,929
remember there's a listserv called

889
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:28,868
auto-flowering net which we kid about

890
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:30,070
they they threw me off because I I got

891
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:32,379
on it and I say gee I'm writing this

892
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:34,389
book I need some pictures and they threw

893
00:34:32,378 --> 00:34:37,348
me off so I finally thanks this angle

894
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:40,149
got back on again and Ted has but but

895
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:41,889
you know when they first started you

896
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:43,418
would be on grass city or one of those

897
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:45,128
other forms and you say oh I'm growing

898
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:46,179
OTO flowers people laughed at you they

899
00:34:45,128 --> 00:34:48,460
made fun of the other you were

900
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:51,460
stigmatizing basically you were drummed

901
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:53,409
out of the community so somebody started

902
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,179
the auto for auto net you know and if

903
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:56,530
you go back in the way you know people

904
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:00,369
were just sort of struggling services

905
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:02,769
and around 2008/9 somewhere right in

906
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:04,300
that area they hit the sweet spot you

907
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:06,670
know and then they started laughing at

908
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,980
other people in the pictures oh my god

909
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:12,010
and on Instagram just yesterday I saw

910
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:15,099
one somebody had a one of these movies

911
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:19,420
where it went from seed to harvest you

912
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:22,450
know in two seconds Oh fabulous I'm

913
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:25,838
telling you folks get some seeds you are

914
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:29,108
going to love these and and you know I

915
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:31,568
love to buy feminized seeds for for my

916
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:34,059
own home growing and to help patients

917
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:36,009
right because being able to take males

918
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:38,588
out of the mix if you're not breeding

919
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:40,930
them this is this is a win but right now

920
00:35:38,588 --> 00:35:43,539
there are still lots of auto flower

921
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:45,759
seeds that are being sold regs right so

922
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:47,710
you're gonna get boys and girls and so

923
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,480
you know if you if you really if you

924
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:52,059
just want the flowers and you

925
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,889
want to play with the plant as Jeff is

926
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:56,619
suggesting get yourself some like

927
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:58,358
fantastic modern you know feminized

928
00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:00,220
seeds from like Mephisto genetics or

929
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:01,929
somebody who's got a good reputation and

930
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:04,689
it's all very plug and play just like

931
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:07,719
Jeff is describing but if you want to

932
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:10,210
enjoy that that extra horticultural

933
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:12,730
experience of making something that did

934
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:15,550
not exist in the world until you did it

935
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:18,760
you know find yourself a pack of auto

936
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:20,260
flour reg seeds and pop a couple of them

937
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,470
that you think sound interesting and

938
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:25,420
it's really easy to collect male pollen

939
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:27,099
you know you take you take a branch and

940
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,630
put it in a bag and you shake it a

941
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:30,400
little bit now you got a bag up on and

942
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,930
you walk through the other side or maybe

943
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,430
your friend's house and you've got a

944
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:35,559
paintbrush and you put some of that

945
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:37,480
pollen on there and yeah you paint it on

946
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:39,070
to one branch of the plant and then when

947
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,440
you're done next year you're gonna have

948
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,880
like you know 40 or 50 seeds and and

949
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,769
like you said you get to name it which

950
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,090
can be the most fun part but you don't

951
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,289
have to wait till next year that's the

952
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:50,230
other thing I mean you know these things

953
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:52,329
grow indoors really well you know in

954
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,309
Anchorage we're really excited about

955
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:56,590
about the opportunity to grow these

956
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:59,019
things because we got a photo period at

957
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:01,530
the same time we get the frost man this

958
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:07,269
is gonna just change our whole world

959
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:10,300
right on so you talk about the low rider

960
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:12,639
old kima bar you know a lot of people

961
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,010
nowadays still consider them cute right

962
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,379
but professionals are like men you know

963
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:19,930
this is this is just something on the

964
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,269
side that isn't gonna you know matter to

965
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:24,909
the rest of us but then you know you

966
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:27,210
meet Seth and you you walk acre upon

967
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:29,500
acre of these beautiful plants in

968
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,900
September and the air is filled with

969
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,809
terpenes and you know you're just like

970
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,250
oh my gosh I want to lay up and let my

971
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:39,009
content and just like live here right

972
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:41,650
and so what I'd like to hear from you

973
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:43,600
both are you know commercial

974
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:45,690
applications right or and specifically

975
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,858
let's let's talk about yield and quality

976
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,510
because it's one thing that it's all

977
00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:51,880
incredibly easy and we can grow them

978
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:53,850
intense but but a lot of people are

979
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,730
thinking about you know

980
00:37:53,849 --> 00:38:00,460
scale for commercial and also am I gonna

981
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:02,530
get enough flour for my effort for home

982
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,949
grow so so I'd like you both to kind of

983
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,050
speak to

984
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:07,739
that option well here in Oregon I mean I

985
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:10,240
would start with new breed seeds frankly

986
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:11,828
they're in there you know they're from

987
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,629
Oregon they were the first ones to get

988
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:18,880
their license to be able to sell seeds

989
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:21,220
and and they are growing for commercial

990
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,920
growers I think the last time I spoke to

991
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:25,569
them they said yeah you know selling the

992
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,920
seeds at the dispensaries just a pin

993
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,690
yeah so they want to go home and there

994
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,130
are lots of commercial growers that are

995
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,639
using these things for a couple of

996
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,440
reasons

997
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:35,618
all the ones we've already discussed if

998
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,470
you're growing indoors on racks if you

999
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:40,030
get the right size plant double racks

1000
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:42,129
triple racks you know you can use the

1001
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,560
whole stealing all the way up to the

1002
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:46,180
ceiling the space on these things make

1003
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,759
it so that you can interspace them in

1004
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:50,889
between existing plants which is really

1005
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,510
a useful thing to do you you know you've

1006
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:54,460
already got the heat you've already got

1007
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,320
the light if you're indoors and to be

1008
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,699
able to interspace a little small plant

1009
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,019
that's not going to detract from the

1010
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:01,449
bigger plants that you're trying to grow

1011
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:03,400
there's you know it doubles your ability

1012
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:05,139
to get more income as a result of doing

1013
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,430
this stuff so I so in that regard it's

1014
00:39:05,139 --> 00:39:08,139
important and then of course the idea

1015
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:10,269
that you can get something in seven nine

1016
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:11,889
you know if you want to go longer 12

1017
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:13,929
weeks Wow

1018
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:17,078
I mean from a commercial perspective if

1019
00:39:13,929 --> 00:39:18,699
the yield is good and the and and and

1020
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:20,950
the power is good if that's the probably

1021
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:22,088
the terpene spectrum you know you're

1022
00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:25,809
there why would you want to grow

1023
00:39:22,088 --> 00:39:27,369
anything but so so I really highly

1024
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:29,199
encourage you to try these they're

1025
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:31,329
really quite something and to contact

1026
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,789
you know people like new breeze season

1027
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:36,430
and get names of other commercial

1028
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:38,019
breeders that are doing it go see what

1029
00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:39,639
they're doing we all share information

1030
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:41,530
that's what we do so oh I'm glad you

1031
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:44,049
reminded me of that too before you

1032
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:47,859
answer I want to plug with the correct

1033
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:50,349
URL Auto flower dotnet yeah and cuz this

1034
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:52,029
is a Jeff story with spot on right the

1035
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:54,190
these were the people who were laughed

1036
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:56,349
off of other forums for using Auto

1037
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:58,630
flowers and so they decided to create

1038
00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:01,690
their own where they could be misfit

1039
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:03,460
toys together and so you know one of the

1040
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,409
things that we've lost in our scene I

1041
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,539
think as people God have gotten more

1042
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:09,399
money focused is everybody's got I pee

1043
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:11,588
now and everybody wants to hide and

1044
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,869
protect things and you know back in the

1045
00:40:11,588 --> 00:40:15,980
day outside of just like not wanting to

1046
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:18,050
go to jail people were real

1047
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:21,019
open to sharing within the community

1048
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:22,519
sharing best practices swapping seeds

1049
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:24,079
all this kind of stuff which which

1050
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:26,869
you're seeing less on the commercial

1051
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,719
side but you're still seeing on this

1052
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:34,699
group at Auto flower net because they

1053
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:36,469
are they are all trying to learn from

1054
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:39,139
each other they are sharing best

1055
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:39,980
practices because they haven't mattered

1056
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:42,859
for a while

1057
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:45,139
and it really excites me to see some of

1058
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,910
the leaders in that particular community

1059
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:48,949
knowing what's good things are gonna be

1060
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:52,039
like in three or four years when Auto

1061
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:54,589
flowers just falls off people's lips so

1062
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:56,570
easily and and these people will be the

1063
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,820
new generation of superstars and and

1064
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:01,130
that you know that's cool when when

1065
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:03,380
people who I love an underdog story

1066
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:06,380
right so so so say have some of the best

1067
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,539
bud porn I've ever seen yeah the photos

1068
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,910
are just incredible so so Seth going

1069
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:13,099
back to you um specifically you know the

1070
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:16,029
the people that you are sowing seed to

1071
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:19,759
are growing at acreage size right and

1072
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:21,230
and and when people are I mean you don't

1073
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,090
have to give people pitches about your

1074
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,860
seeds anymore but but just for the sake

1075
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:27,260
of this conversation what does that

1076
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:29,300
pitch sound like when they're all like

1077
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,880
you know like really you want me to you

1078
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,080
know plant a whole field of these what

1079
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,849
are essentially still probably gonna be

1080
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:36,769
smaller plants what's the name of the

1081
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:42,829
company again which one yours

1082
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:45,500
uh we don't advertise right I owe you

1083
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:47,349
like five emails so we can't we can't

1084
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,000
handle the advertising right now

1085
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:51,980
honestly we we don't pitch it to people

1086
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,809
people come to us and say hey I really

1087
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:57,889
want to try this I really want to try

1088
00:41:53,809 --> 00:42:00,650
this and we say no you don't it's really

1089
00:41:57,889 --> 00:42:02,599
hard you're gonna [ __ ] up you're not

1090
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,130
gonna do it right it's taken us it took

1091
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:06,309
us three years to figure out how to get

1092
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:08,660
the plants in the field without having

1093
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:10,670
flowering in trays and actually getting

1094
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:13,099
a good yield this year we're moving on

1095
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:15,740
to large-scale field trials for

1096
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:16,909
different density of planting and we've

1097
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:18,559
stepped back and we're actually putting

1098
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,029
it into the hands of much more competent

1099
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,099
farmers who've been farming other crops

1100
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:25,940
for their entire life and how many

1101
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:27,309
cultivars that's such a technically how

1102
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:30,849
many different kinds of plants roughly

1103
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:30,849
one okay

1104
00:42:32,778 --> 00:42:36,929
not really

1105
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:38,609
yeah there's a number a number of

1106
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,829
different varieties out there it all

1107
00:42:38,608 --> 00:42:42,748
comes down for us it's not about

1108
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:45,599
cultivars ours are chemo types we look

1109
00:42:42,748 --> 00:42:48,018
at plants as having very particular

1110
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,769
chemical compounds that are replicable

1111
00:42:48,018 --> 00:42:52,228
generation after generation should

1112
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:53,639
correct it it's okay don't worry but

1113
00:42:52,228 --> 00:42:55,168
it's it really it comes down to trying

1114
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:56,879
to figure out how you in the same way

1115
00:42:55,168 --> 00:42:59,158
that you're describing maximizing space

1116
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,838
in a small area inside this is how do

1117
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:04,380
you maximize the productivity on a per

1118
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:06,838
acre basis over thousands of acres and

1119
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,028
it really comes down to what we've seen

1120
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:11,548
with successful farmers is either direct

1121
00:43:09,028 --> 00:43:12,449
seeding which is wrought with all kinds

1122
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:14,338
of problems that most of you probably

1123
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:16,318
don't care about but it all comes down

1124
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:18,449
to the depth of the the planting of the

1125
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:21,469
seed and you're talking about literally

1126
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:23,789
millimeters will make or break success

1127
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:25,648
down and then the other side of it is

1128
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:28,649
the density of planting for both weed

1129
00:43:25,648 --> 00:43:31,018
suppression and to maximize lateral

1130
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:32,880
minimize lateral branching and force the

1131
00:43:31,018 --> 00:43:35,638
plants to basically just turn into one

1132
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,189
solid flower that's that's really what

1133
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:40,318
we're looking at this year I and then I

1134
00:43:38,188 --> 00:43:42,118
would say for 2020 dad definitely will

1135
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:46,380
be ready for you to buy autoflowering

1136
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:50,639
seeds both type 3 CBD rich plants and

1137
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:52,469
type 4 Pierce EBG lines so what are the

1138
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,449
other advantages amines clearly the

1139
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:57,298
short cycle is great for scaled

1140
00:43:54,449 --> 00:43:58,829
agriculture but when I visited your farm

1141
00:43:57,298 --> 00:44:00,119
you were mentioning some other things

1142
00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:02,969
like the fact that the plants are

1143
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:05,880
uniform so they're really easy to repeat

1144
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:06,989
cut on a sled cut on a slit so so what

1145
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,809
are the what are the you know

1146
00:44:06,989 --> 00:44:13,079
traditional farming advantages of this

1147
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:14,699
plant versus the photoperiod ones the

1148
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:16,380
the main one in it again it's gonna

1149
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:17,729
depend your location in certain areas

1150
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,829
you can't cut the plant down and let it

1151
00:44:17,728 --> 00:44:21,268
dry in the field and a lot of people

1152
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:23,369
have had questions about that we did our

1153
00:44:21,268 --> 00:44:26,158
our team did some amazing experiments

1154
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:28,919
this last summer long hours in the field

1155
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:31,079
very hot conditions harvesting about 15

1156
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:34,348
acres that believe it was about 38,000

1157
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:36,539
plants in the early August cutting him

1158
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:38,699
down laying him down in the field to

1159
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:39,720
basically cook at 100 degrees during the

1160
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:42,659
day

1161
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:45,299
and then grind him up and put him into

1162
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:47,519
totes just to see how much CBD would be

1163
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,650
lost and what the terpene loss was going

1164
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,699
to be and what we found was about you're

1165
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,220
gonna lose about two thirds of your

1166
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:55,379
terpenes they're very volatile they just

1167
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:58,949
they vaporize they're gone but there's

1168
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:01,230
still enough to be able to get some some

1169
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:03,149
efficacy from the entourage effect

1170
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:04,260
depending on the type of terpenes that

1171
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,420
you're working with and their their

1172
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:08,160
volatility the heavier sesqui terpenes

1173
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,409
tend to stick around the the really

1174
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:12,389
volatile monoterpenes are always going

1175
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:15,779
to be gone but the moral of the story on

1176
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:17,279
that was that CBD content did not change

1177
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,350
there was no statistical difference

1178
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,730
between plants that were cut down and

1179
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,980
dried in the field versus plants that

1180
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:25,320
were cut down and hung up in a warehouse

1181
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,940
so again that's a that's a great thing

1182
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:30,150
if you happen to have a very dry late

1183
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,769
very dry late July early August but if

1184
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:33,329
you have a rainy period that may not

1185
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:37,320
necessarily be the plant that you want

1186
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:39,299
to use so it's it's really about like

1187
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,769
any farming or any any cannabis

1188
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,140
production it's about being able to use

1189
00:45:40,769 --> 00:45:45,030
the plasticity of the plant to adapt to

1190
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:47,400
your own local ecosystem and climate

1191
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:49,590
right on so Seth I'm gonna give you a

1192
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,130
particular question here it's just a

1193
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:54,900
sniglet off topic but but it's very it's

1194
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:57,240
very important for where we are today

1195
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,400
and and what I want to ask you is you

1196
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:01,949
know you're you know you have particular

1197
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,950
experience in the dangers of pollen

1198
00:46:01,949 --> 00:46:06,839
contamination right and you know since

1199
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:09,059
both feminized and regular Auto seeds

1200
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,280
exist I think this would be a good

1201
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:13,739
moment for you to make your pitch for

1202
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,410
for you know running you know not

1203
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:18,750
running males outdoors I'd love you to

1204
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:20,399
share the story about your valley just

1205
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,039
to make everybody more aware of the

1206
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,389
dangers of pollen if you if you have a

1207
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,130
pollinated crop and you're growing

1208
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:27,989
outside you're gonna lose 30 percent of

1209
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:31,280
your total cannabinoids and 50% of your

1210
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:35,429
biomass that the seed is a tremendous

1211
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,810
energy-sapping creation that that ends

1212
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:39,119
up taking the power away from your

1213
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:41,549
plants in reducing the not only the

1214
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,750
profit the profitability but the actual

1215
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,620
amount of cannabinoids that you can

1216
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,739
harvest outdoors

1217
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:48,068
I know Oregon at this point we're trying

1218
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:50,409
to launch

1219
00:46:48,068 --> 00:46:52,478
a nonprofit organization that will help

1220
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:55,509
in the future in terms of creating

1221
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:57,399
buffer zones between farms so that we

1222
00:46:55,509 --> 00:46:59,949
don't have issues of pond contamination

1223
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,809
see Oregon cannabis pinning Association

1224
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:04,719
OC PA org it's the only thing they'll

1225
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:06,459
advertise today hopefully and we're

1226
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:08,108
really just kind of in a we're trying to

1227
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:09,848
raise awareness this year and then

1228
00:47:08,108 --> 00:47:13,598
actually move into a more formal pinning

1229
00:47:09,849 --> 00:47:15,640
system for 2020 but pollen outdoors is a

1230
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,969
huge issue and there are a number of

1231
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:20,650
people who are either growing regular

1232
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:23,259
male/female seeds or trying to create

1233
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:25,318
seed outdoors just because you can

1234
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:29,019
produce so much it's it's a tremendously

1235
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:30,818
productive way to make seed but we've

1236
00:47:29,018 --> 00:47:32,919
had to basically go to a lot of

1237
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:35,349
small-time breeders who are saying oh

1238
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,579
man this is the big rush I want to make

1239
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:38,380
sure that I can make a bunch of seed

1240
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:41,680
this year and then sell it for next year

1241
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:43,088
not knowing that in doing so not only

1242
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:44,379
are they not going to get a successful

1243
00:47:43,088 --> 00:47:45,639
crop because there's other people who

1244
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,160
are doing that and now you have a

1245
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:50,588
contaminated crop yourself with no

1246
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:53,288
purity that you won't be able to sell if

1247
00:47:50,588 --> 00:47:55,208
you're a moral or ethical person but

1248
00:47:53,289 --> 00:47:56,650
you're also going to destroy all of your

1249
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:58,478
surrounding neighbors ability to

1250
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:59,680
actually grow a crop and have something

1251
00:47:58,478 --> 00:48:01,598
that's valuable at the end of the year

1252
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,068
so it really comes down it's a it's a

1253
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,239
touchy subject for a lot of people but

1254
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:09,278
it is definitely in terms of being able

1255
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:12,519
to create an environment thing that we

1256
00:48:09,278 --> 00:48:14,588
all can continue to produce cannabis in

1257
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:16,268
in an environment that our kids can

1258
00:48:14,588 --> 00:48:18,489
potentially continue to produce cannabis

1259
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:20,679
in Oregon is one of those really really

1260
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:21,699
lucky spots we're in a sweet spot we can

1261
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:23,828
grow good stuff

1262
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:26,469
we have great breeders we have good

1263
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:27,489
water we have good land but we really

1264
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:30,608
need to make sure that we can protect

1265
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:34,208
that and its pollen travels a long ways

1266
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:36,219
long ways it's it's dangerous and I

1267
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:37,989
think that you know these these pollen

1268
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:39,099
exclusion zones which I even call Youm

1269
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:40,208
do you have an actual official name for

1270
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:42,039
him sounds good

1271
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:43,149
yeah pollen exclusion zone yeah so

1272
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:45,579
that's what I've been calling it to

1273
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:48,999
people and and the first time that Seth

1274
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:51,818
posted about this on their Instagram it

1275
00:48:48,998 --> 00:48:54,639
was ugly you know that the thread was

1276
00:48:51,818 --> 00:48:58,389
mostly people saying you know you know

1277
00:48:54,639 --> 00:49:00,548
you will not tell me what to do with my

1278
00:48:58,389 --> 00:49:01,730
property , dammit

1279
00:49:00,548 --> 00:49:04,820
you know and

1280
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:07,250
Santo you want to control the seeds yeah

1281
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:08,539
exactly and you know and I get where

1282
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,429
people are coming from because I don't

1283
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:12,500
like to be told what to do either but

1284
00:49:10,429 --> 00:49:15,109
what it is it's a it's an it's an

1285
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:18,349
economic and horticultural opportunity

1286
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:21,710
for right we're almost all of us live

1287
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:24,110
here and so what we're seeing is that

1288
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:27,530
you know just like Napa Valley right

1289
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:28,789
they are growing world-class wine but

1290
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:31,460
there are certain things that the

1291
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:36,110
community has all agreed to do and not

1292
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:38,090
do so that they don't screw up the the

1293
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:40,250
you know the wineries and and their

1294
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:44,510
ability to grow grapes because it brings

1295
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:47,929
so much economic power to the region and

1296
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:49,820
for me that's what I see for for these

1297
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:51,409
beautiful valleys throughout Oregon

1298
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,900
where they can where they can you know

1299
00:49:51,409 --> 00:49:55,699
they've already got hemp farmers it is a

1300
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:59,119
burgeoning industry that is is

1301
00:49:55,699 --> 00:50:00,500
lightyears ahead of many of the rest of

1302
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,400
the parts of the world that are going to

1303
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:07,070
try to follow up and when you have a

1304
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,450
lead even though I don't want anybody to

1305
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:11,480
tell me what to do with my property

1306
00:50:08,449 --> 00:50:14,210
either I really hope that those people

1307
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,730
would keep open minds because the the

1308
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:19,039
the reasons for not growing pollinating

1309
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:22,340
cannabis plants outdoors make a lot of

1310
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:24,019
sense for the oregon community and and i

1311
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:25,280
think that it is lost on a lot of people

1312
00:50:24,019 --> 00:50:27,139
because they aren't they haven't let

1313
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,910
their ears be open to the argument yet i

1314
00:50:27,139 --> 00:50:31,429
think people think it's about control

1315
00:50:28,909 --> 00:50:32,809
and the the problem with this is that

1316
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:34,849
it's not about trying to prevent people

1317
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:37,610
from making seed i encourage people to

1318
00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:39,049
go go go do it like i've said before

1319
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:40,400
it's emancipatory not only to grow it

1320
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:41,990
but to breed it and then see the outcome

1321
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,559
it's it's a it's a beautiful thing and

1322
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:46,909
it's part of what makes us human we all

1323
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,730
could probably agree that people have a

1324
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:52,519
right to fire right you can have a fire

1325
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:54,440
on your property that's cool until it

1326
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:56,480
jumps your fence and burns down your

1327
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,400
neighbor's house at that point that's

1328
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,929
your liability it's not your fire and

1329
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,490
that's really what we're looking at

1330
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:03,349
everyone in oregon has a right to farm

1331
00:51:01,489 --> 00:51:05,479
but you don't have a right to exclude

1332
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:07,940
other people from being able to engage

1333
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,889
in meaningful economic activity that not

1334
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:12,260
only is helping that themselves but

1335
00:51:09,889 --> 00:51:14,469
helping other people isn't the general

1336
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,470
motto

1337
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:20,759
your fun ends when the other guy's

1338
00:51:18,568 --> 00:51:22,710
displeasure begins and so you do not

1339
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:24,869
have a right to plant seeds outside I

1340
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:27,389
would say you don't have a right to do

1341
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:29,608
it period if it's gonna impact your

1342
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:31,318
neighbor you don't have that right and

1343
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:33,449
also for for folks who are thinking

1344
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:34,768
about doing you know three four plants

1345
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:36,929
in your backyard and you're gonna bring

1346
00:51:34,768 --> 00:51:39,508
in a mail that's way different than

1347
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:41,788
we're talking about you know growing a

1348
00:51:39,509 --> 00:51:45,119
KERS of regular seeds Russian next-door

1349
00:51:41,789 --> 00:51:47,069
to look no it's fine or we've had to

1350
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,210
take because of that and and we don't

1351
00:51:47,068 --> 00:51:49,588
want to stop anybody from having that

1352
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:51,210
right but to be able to protect our

1353
00:51:49,588 --> 00:51:53,190
interests we had to make sure that our

1354
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:56,099
greenhouses are sealed we only make seed

1355
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:57,630
in places that we're comfortable making

1356
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:58,979
it and then once it comes out we still

1357
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:01,920
have to test it just to make sure that

1358
00:51:58,978 --> 00:52:03,598
it is what we what we think it is and to

1359
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,690
let you know that Seth practices what he

1360
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:09,599
preaches it is really crazy to go into

1361
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:13,710
their breeding warehouses or greenhouses

1362
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:16,349
because they are they suck you in right

1363
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:17,670
so that none of the pollen escapes would

1364
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:19,710
you open it they've got they've got all

1365
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:24,059
the air being pulled in this into a into

1366
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:25,650
a filter so that you open the door and

1367
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:28,079
then you're sucked in so that all the

1368
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:30,450
pollen is kept inside and that's cool

1369
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:36,359
right yeah straight hair before he went

1370
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:37,919
in yeah so alright so the last thing I

1371
00:52:36,358 --> 00:52:43,679
want to hit because we're wrapping up

1372
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:47,219
here is I want to go back you know leave

1373
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:49,318
a little bit of the the the breeding

1374
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:52,079
analytic stuff and talk specifically

1375
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:54,838
about the smoke right because because

1376
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:57,269
you know most everybody in here probably

1377
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:59,728
enjoys the taste and the experience of

1378
00:52:57,268 --> 00:53:01,348
cannabis and and you know I've I've

1379
00:52:59,728 --> 00:53:03,718
smoked the stuff that you grow for

1380
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:06,150
extraction right and some of the stuff

1381
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:08,099
that you grow for extraction these like

1382
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:11,369
like like let's tear up these flowers

1383
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:14,670
right and look right and I take him home

1384
00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:18,509
and smoking like yeah this is this is

1385
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:20,670
really good flower right and so let's

1386
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:23,130
hit on just real quickly the fact that

1387
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:25,090
you know it may be convenient it may be

1388
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:27,039
great for the valley

1389
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:31,269
it may be good for patients it may be

1390
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:32,949
extractable but it's good smoke - let's

1391
00:53:31,269 --> 00:53:35,259
start with you Jeff because I know that

1392
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:37,329
you love you know Auto flower net and

1393
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,980
and and seeing those so so we'll give

1394
00:53:37,329 --> 00:53:41,889
your plug for auto flower taste

1395
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,340
yeah so I'm a vaporizer III vaporize

1396
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:46,179
flower

1397
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:48,340
I haven't combusted in maybe three years

1398
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:51,009
there's a wonderful web website

1399
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:53,850
incidentally called FC combustion and

1400
00:53:51,010 --> 00:54:00,330
you can guess what the FC stands for but

1401
00:53:53,849 --> 00:54:00,329
these Auto flowers they taste just like

1402
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,619
stuff and the numbers on it if you're if

1403
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,170
you're into numbers I think it's a

1404
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:09,759
fool's game you know if you can't get if

1405
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:12,700
you can't get stoned cuz your number is

1406
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:16,210
only six percent THC take another hit

1407
00:54:12,699 --> 00:54:18,419
for God's sakes you know the idea that

1408
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:19,990
you gotta buy a thirty to get store

1409
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:22,840
anyway

1410
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:25,509
they taste delicious they have this the

1411
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:27,640
aisles are phenomenal and you know I

1412
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:29,020
when I do it with other people a lot of

1413
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:31,000
times my for my friends up in Anchorage

1414
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:34,360
they go man these things grow so fast

1415
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,320
they don't have time to to write you

1416
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,500
know I said what are you talking about

1417
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:42,340
there's nothing bad taste you know

1418
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:44,889
obviously the guy was very stoned they

1419
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:48,309
are just like regular cannabis they

1420
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:50,379
didn't used to be but they are now and I

1421
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:54,190
would defy you to tell the difference

1422
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:57,490
between vaporizing and Laurel flower and

1423
00:54:54,190 --> 00:55:00,179
vaporizing a regular photo period there

1424
00:54:57,489 --> 00:55:04,869
there is no difference whatsoever I

1425
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:07,690
would agree with that and it's 65 to 70%

1426
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:09,309
of them are mere scene dominant so what

1427
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:10,990
we're seeing out I was fun to walk

1428
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:12,009
through and take a look at the the

1429
00:55:10,989 --> 00:55:14,049
flowers that were entered for the

1430
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:15,610
competition this year and see the

1431
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:17,440
different terpene profiles and watch the

1432
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:20,230
evolution of what growers and breeders

1433
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,340
are targeting at this play go through

1434
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,960
and count how many are mere scene

1435
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,420
dominant this year compared to years

1436
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,210
past versus turpin alene dominant plants

1437
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:30,329
that's that's a big thing it's your your

1438
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:32,949
your fuel flavor your diesel flavor

1439
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:34,900
Turpin a lean beta carry awfully and

1440
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:37,230
alpha pining we're seeing that now

1441
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:39,300
emerge in in auto flowering plants

1442
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:41,460
and it's a little bit more difficult

1443
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,050
with auto flowering plants just because

1444
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,300
of the the breeding that we were talking

1445
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:47,400
about earlier but they definitely pack

1446
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,680
all of the flavor and to be perfectly

1447
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,530
honest the the potency as well out of

1448
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:55,019
our type four high CBG varieties that

1449
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:59,430
we've developed the individual plant

1450
00:55:55,019 --> 00:56:01,980
that has far in a way had the highest

1451
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:03,899
overall CBG percentage was an auto

1452
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:08,849
flowering plant and it came in at almost

1453
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:11,010
16% CBG was over 17% CB GA before addi

1454
00:56:08,849 --> 00:56:13,969
carbing so it's it's definitely possible

1455
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:17,730
to create absolutely terpene rich

1456
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:20,069
cannabinoid heavy and diverse chemo

1457
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:21,900
types with with these day neutral plants

1458
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:23,250
and and i know that you're having the

1459
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,139
analytics and you test everything

1460
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:26,849
in-house do their numbers come out

1461
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:29,219
comparable to photosensitive plants as

1462
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:31,319
well on average they tend to be a little

1463
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,759
bit lower but it also depends on the way

1464
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,260
that you treat them in the light

1465
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:37,320
spectrum don't they also have a little

1466
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:41,340
bit more CBD yeah you can change any of

1467
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:43,230
those from an amateur Rohr seems to me

1468
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:46,590
that there there's always CBD in my auto

1469
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:49,199
flowers but but I'm not sure there isn't

1470
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:53,190
my bigger plants I don't know but yeah

1471
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:55,500
we haven't seen that cbc there is a

1472
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:57,480
little bit more CBC there at least there

1473
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,679
tends to be and that that actually it

1474
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,599
depends on the varieties that you're

1475
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:02,190
looking at but it is it is definitely

1476
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:04,559
present amount of flowering plants let's

1477
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:06,030
just spell another rumor about taste I

1478
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,500
know that you spend a lot of time

1479
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:11,280
breeding them and a lot of people say

1480
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,659
okay so this is a cookies Otto flower so

1481
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:16,170
essentially that means that's cookies

1482
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:17,699
crossed with a ruderalis plant and a lot

1483
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:20,970
of people say that Rudy Rudy plants

1484
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:22,169
tastes like crap right so so what do you

1485
00:57:20,969 --> 00:57:24,149
have to say about people saying that

1486
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:26,039
there's all this like this this

1487
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:29,250
ruderalis terpenes coming along for the

1488
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:32,059
ride there used to be I think that used

1489
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:34,260
to be a valid a valid valid distinction

1490
00:57:32,059 --> 00:57:36,239
one of the main things to consider as

1491
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,250
well is normally what you're trying to

1492
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:40,109
do in a breeding program is look at the

1493
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:42,869
f2 so you take two parents that are very

1494
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:44,550
divergent across them and then do it

1495
00:57:42,869 --> 00:57:47,069
either an open pollination or a targeted

1496
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:49,560
selfing in the the f1 generation and

1497
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:51,010
then you have f2 plants that exhibit

1498
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:52,690
every possible

1499
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:54,520
combination or permutation that you can

1500
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:56,409
possibly imagine it's where the most

1501
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:57,489
diversity is expressed if you're a plant

1502
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:59,769
breeder that's where you should be

1503
00:57:57,489 --> 00:58:01,329
looking for amazing things if you have a

1504
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:03,909
specific terpene profile that you're

1505
00:58:01,329 --> 00:58:07,150
trying to target you can't overlook that

1506
00:58:03,909 --> 00:58:09,009
f1 cross because that's that's actually

1507
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:12,160
where you would identify the plants that

1508
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:13,270
have the most similar profiles to

1509
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:15,399
whatever it is that you're trying to

1510
00:58:13,269 --> 00:58:17,019
target so yeah you can you can very I

1511
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,660
won't say very easily but you could take

1512
00:58:17,019 --> 00:58:21,519
a you know a gg4 across it to an auto

1513
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:24,129
flowering plant and then do your initial

1514
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:25,900
selection in that f1 in breed it one

1515
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:28,150
more time and you can you can lock those

1516
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,950
terpene profiles in it obviously it

1517
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:31,200
takes more time for stabilization of

1518
00:58:29,949 --> 00:58:33,939
traits and that sort of thing but

1519
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:34,689
terpenes and making them taste good we

1520
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,210
can do that

1521
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:40,030
absolutely so we're running out of time

1522
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:42,400
here so I'm sure that you want to hear

1523
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:47,470
more from both of these folks so for

1524
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:49,210
Jeff Lowen fells you can find he at

1525
00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:50,739
least one episode with him on the

1526
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:54,159
shaping fire podcast if you go to

1532
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:11,709
new-age CBD auto flowers that are out

1533
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:16,090
there and then again with a really

1534
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:21,519
insightful interview on the the Nexus of

00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:27,099
Economics of CBD from em and and then of

1537
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:29,619
course don't forget about Jeff's book
