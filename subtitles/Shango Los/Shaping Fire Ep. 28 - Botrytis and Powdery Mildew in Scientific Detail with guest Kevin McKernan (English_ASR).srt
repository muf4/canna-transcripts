2
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:11,099
there are a few things in cannabis as

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,080
frustrating as mold it's true all of

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,179
your hard work can come crashing down by

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,910
the sudden visual signs of powdery

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,010
mildew or botrytis molds it's enough to

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,809
make you cry chastise the source of your

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,060
clones and try to strike a bargain with

9
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:25,858
God there's so much misinformation out

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,629
there about both powdery mildew and

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,400
botrytis that's been handed down from

12
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:31,829
generation to generation of cannabis

13
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,539
growers now though cannabis is

14
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:35,070
attracting scientists and laboratories

15
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:37,769
that can help sort out the biology of

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,808
these molding menaces to society if you

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,820
enjoy hearing frank discussions that

18
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:43,199
dive deep in a cannabis health business

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,359

Kevin Jodrey of Wonderland nursery

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,359
talking about breeding cannabis for the

28
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,160
best terpene profiles and my keynote

29
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,140
address at the Imperius Expo in Phoenix

30
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,629
about why we choose cannabis business

31
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,368
even though the risks are so high don't

32
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:10,949
rely on social media to let you know

shaping fire and I'm your host

37
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,118
Shango lows my guest today is Kevin

38
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,679
McKiernan chem mckernon is founder and

39
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,409
chief science officer of medicinal

40
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,930
genomics medicinal genomics made

41
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,329
worldwide news in 2011 when it publicly

42
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,000
released the first genome sequence for

43
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:35,099
cannabis sativa as a result of this work

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,900
medicinal genomics launched a suite of

45
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:39,478
tools for the detection of microbial

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,490
contamination of cannabis prior to

47
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,048
medicinal genomics Kevin was the team

48
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,569
leader of R&amp;D for the human genome

49
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:49,020
project at the Whitehead Institute for

50
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:50,489
biomedical research at MIT one piece of

51
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:53,099
vocabulary I want to point out for this

52
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,140
week's episode we use the term labs a

53
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:57,750
lot this week sometimes we're referring

54
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,159
to cannabis analytical laboratories but

55
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,680
most of the time we're using the word

56
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,439
labs as shorthand for a collection of

57
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,229
living probiotic bacteria originally

58
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,449
referring only to lactic acid bacteria

59
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,280
in organic growing it's often used

60
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,149
nowadays to refer to a wide range of

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,658
probiotic cultured micro

62
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,069
organisms welcome to the show Kevin

63
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:20,229
thank you for having me Django this is a

64
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:22,179
quite an exceptional podcast I'm honored

65
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:24,369
to be here right huh thank you very much

66
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,860
so Kevin you know this time of year

67
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,110
molds and mildews are being talked about

68
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,730
by growers everywhere because as though

69
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,069
as the nights are getting colder and

70
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:35,919
damp fog and rain starts to become more

71
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:38,500
common in the in the weather report mold

72
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,479
becomes more of a threat and you know

73
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,789
we'll talk about botrytis a bit later in

74
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,348
the show but easily the most common

75
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:47,679
scourge that everyone has to deal with

76
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:51,459
is powdery mildew biologically what is

77
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,859
powdery mildew okay so this is a this

78
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:56,500
evaded us for quite a bit I think the

79
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:59,079
best resources to go to are a book from

80
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,969
John McPartlin and Dave Watson and and

81
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:03,879
Robert Clark it has a great list of all

82
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:05,799
these hemp diseases we we we marched

83
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:08,048
through they're trying to build DNA

84
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,569
assays that could detect powdery mildew

85
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:12,129
and and you know why would anyone want

86
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:14,138
to try and pick up this organism well

87
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:16,328
they're from what we've learned about

88
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:18,579
what powdery mildew does and hops which

89
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:21,370
is the closest relative to cannabis is

90
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:23,530
it has an infection cycle where when it

91
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,329
first lands on the plant it actually

92
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,639
builds what's known as a historia or

93
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:29,169
like a tap root into the plant where the

94
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,169
spore lands and then it builds a

95
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:34,329
mycelium Network and this my city of

96
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:35,949
network is sometimes it's it's debatable

97
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:37,810
whether it's in the plan or outside of

98
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,449
the plant but it spreads it spreads that

99
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,789
network across the plant and it takes in

100
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:45,489
hops sometimes 18 to maybe 40 days

101
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:46,989
before it gets a stress event that makes

102
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,840
it make spores which is the powder that

103
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:51,459
you see and those spores are very Hardy

104
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,489
and they spread the they spread the

105
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,889
disease so we got brought into trying to

106
00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:00,519
figure out what this thing was by trying

107
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:02,109
to build assays for it and we build we

108
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,879
built some of these DNA s is going after

109
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:06,849
the organisms that john was pointing us

110
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:08,739
to which was L torque and they have an

111
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:10,899
organism in there called s MACUL eres

112
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:13,030
but it's recently been renamed to a P

113
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,810
MACUL Eris stands for I think POTUS fara

114
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,339
MACUL Eris so what are these things is

115
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,259
your question these are obligate bio

116
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,728
tropes which means they you can't

117
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,228
culture them unless you have leaves

118
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,490
we tried that we tried putting them in

119
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:25,629
cultures and not didn't behave you have

120
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,430
to find a

121
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:29,469
grind up leaves or somehow and make it

122
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,360
so that there's actually some leaf cells

123
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,130
in there for these things to culture but

124
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,319
an obligate bio trove also means that

125
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:37,750
they're generally very much adapted to

126
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:39,790
their hosts so you do tend not to see

127
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,379
powdery mildews hopping species species

128
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,140
very much like you might see with

129
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:45,909
botrytis and so you'll find powdery

130
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,469
mildews that are very specialized like

131
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,240
the ones that are in grapes are known as

132
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,030
goal of venom Isis there's a vino in

133
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,670
there the ones that are on hops is P

134
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:55,719
MACUL eros and we had some debate as to

135
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,490
whether that was crossing over into

136
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,980
cannabis and it may be we've not yet

137
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,920
found evidence for that yet when we dug

138
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,090
into this we built all of these assays

139
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,870
hoping we'd find something that was on

140
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:08,560
grapes like golden mi C's or these um

141
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,149
al-tohra cos another one that's

142
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,829
mentioned that literature none of them

143
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:13,479
worked and so we went down a bit of a

144
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:16,209
rabbit hole trying to sequence the

145
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,650
genome of this thing alright and what we

146
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:19,659
have found to date is we actually

147
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:23,289
believe it's a novel species that's on

148
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:26,200
cannabis and it is something that has

149
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:29,170
about 98% identical to P Mac eulerís

150
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,719
which is on hops and about 98% identical

151
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,030
as well to go low venom Isis and bro Xia

152
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,930
which is another powdery mildew that's

153
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:39,639
out there so they're very interesting

154
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,079
organisms but they can as everyone knows

155
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,060
they can totally destroy your crop

156
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:45,519
however you can detect them in advance

157
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,129
of the sporulation stage where they make

158
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,839
these things known as Canadia and that's

159
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:52,300
what we're aiming to do with this

160
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,789
genetic test is to enable people to

161
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,280
screen clones or to screen their plants

162
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:00,100
at a certain period of time and remove

163
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,409
anything that has a positive hit and

164
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,900
maybe this will help people breathe

165
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,630
faster for resistance if you're

166
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:08,679
screening for plants that have a lot of

167
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:11,290
this on them well they're probably

168
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,569
susceptible to it unless you're picking

169
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,069
up a single spore and so we've been

170
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:17,290
trying to do some work where this test

171
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:19,480
is fairly sensitive enough to pick up

172
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,850
these mycelial networks but doesn't get

173
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,350
triggered by the spores and that's not

174
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,629
as hard to do as you might imagine the

175
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:28,360
spores can last a winner they're really

176
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:30,730
Hardy and they're very hard to break so

177
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,230
a long story is uh there are different

178
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,120
species pretty much in every organism

179
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,919
you run into and we don't see much

180
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,480
evidence of this hopping species to

181
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,419
species or host a host I should say

182
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:43,390
this is the first time I've heard the

183
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:45,189
anchor on the spore described that's

184
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:47,949
probably one of the ways that people get

185
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:49,810
confused about whether or not PN is

186
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,879
systemic to the plant or merely

187
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:55,209
opportunist because I can imagine that

188
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:58,149
the the spore lands and and it creates

189
00:06:55,209 --> 00:07:02,019
that anchor which which is is is

190
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:05,019
probably breaking the I guess the derma

191
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:08,199
of the plant right right and so suddenly

192
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:10,569
now it's also inside so so with that

193
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,329
anchor idea this is what do you what is

194
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:15,819
it biologically is it systemic or is it

195
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,409
opportunist and topical so that's a good

196
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:18,699
point the definition of systemic is

197
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,410
usually reserved for something that

198
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,909
might be circulating through the xylem

199
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,610
and phloem or like in the bloodstream

200
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:27,070
but like HIV and in humans and I'd say

201
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,770
it might be hard to claim that it's

202
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:31,389
systemic although we should say the

203
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:34,060
experiments we have done have not

204
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:37,029
necessarily nailed that what we have

205
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,410
seen is that it can be present in the

206
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:41,799
plant and am I saying of network where

207
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:43,270
you can't visibly see it and the debate

208
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,069
right now is whether that my city of

209
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:47,529
network is internal to the leaf or

210
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:49,209
external to leaf but for practical

211
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:51,519
purposes that may not matter may be a

212
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:54,969
bit of an academic question for

213
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:57,099
screening purposes there's not much use

214
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,780
in a genetic test that picks up powdery

215
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,790
mildew after you can see it it's too

216
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:02,199
late then you really want to get

217
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,240
something that picks it up early and

218
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,889
that's the key to thwart a most

219
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,629
infectious disease cycles is to actually

220
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:09,699
have early detection so that you can

221
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:11,050
remove the plants that carry the

222
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,149
infection from the from spreading and

223
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:16,480
any further kind of a quarantine and

224
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:17,799
contain approach ultimately breeding for

225
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,960
resistance I think is the right thing to

226
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,550
do but this may be a tool that helps

227
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,560
accelerate that if you can find the

228
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,139
plants that can chronically have high

229
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,850
levels of powdery mildew DNA on them

230
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,289
well then you those are most likely to

231
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,000
be susceptible strands and you should

232
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,580
pull them pull them out of other works

233
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,168
there's a really good paper I'll point

234
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,370
people to that maybe we can put into the

235
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:38,559
show notes from a gentleman by the name

236
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,168
of Liebling who did a lot of work to try

237
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,609
and address this systemic issue and in

238
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:45,220
that paper they do mention a systemic

239
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,590
but I think it might be a misuse of the

240
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,350
term but what they demonstrate is that

241
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,310
this they stain this the DNA of this

242
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,320
working

243
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:54,669
with and you can see the network of this

244
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,100
mycelium it's really kind of beautiful

245
00:08:54,669 --> 00:09:00,069
to look at and you can see that from a

246
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,840
single spore that hits the leaf it

247
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,820
really goes it goes millimeters away

248
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,440
really outside of the entire focal view

249
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,440
of the images that they're taking so

250
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,840
these networks spread very very quickly

251
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,240
around the plant and and I think the

252
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,860
unknown questions we have today are well

253
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,690
how early can you actually pick this up

254
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,909
and how quickly does that my see of

255
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,280
network spread and are you gonna get at

256
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:23,289
eighteen days before it outbreaks you're

257
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,269
gonna get it you know forty days these

258
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:26,980
are unknowns in cannabis right now we've

259
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:29,169
seen the work in hops and we're kind of

260
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,940
drawing parallels from hops but a lot of

261
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:33,490
the work in hops shows that PMAC your

262
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,740
iris will have maybe twenty to forty dpi

263
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,289
which is days post infection when twenty

264
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,500
stents tend to see the actual spores

265
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:43,299
kickoff for when they found the initial

266
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,450
infection of us four so that's it that's

267
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:48,039
a big gap and and stress tends to

268
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,990
accelerate this so if you happen to get

269
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:53,349
infected just before flowering or before

270
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:55,779
flush it that's gonna bring out some of

271
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,519
the the sporulation events it's a I

272
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:59,949
can't help but chuckle when you tell me

273
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,809
that the science is not fully decided on

274
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,970
whether or not it's systemic or merely

275
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:07,029
topically opportunistic because there's

276
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:09,879
so much arguing and gnashing of teeth on

277
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:11,829
line between growers who know for sure

278
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:13,179
one side or the other and everybody's

279
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,160
getting upset about it and you're saying

280
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,389
well actually the science is still out

281
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:18,879
and we're still trying to figure that

282
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:20,949
out you know what what's it doing to the

283
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:26,620
plant itself I mean we know that when

284
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:30,340
the the plant is more stressed it's more

285
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:34,450
susceptible and then when the the spore

286
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:36,220
feels has a stress event it spreads but

287
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,900
but what is it actually doing to the

288
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:43,389
plant itself that is damaging the plant

289
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,709
well there's um I think the stress

290
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,409
signals that go throughout the plant

291
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,700
probably trigger a tremendous amount of

292
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:50,379
secondary messengers signaling I think

293
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,509
there have there has been evidenced that

294
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:54,639
when you get these types of priming

295
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:56,919
responses with let's say another fungal

296
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,500
infection if right about botrytis you

297
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:02,349
can see that there's sometimes terpene

298
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,610
expression that changes there is a host

299
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,870
of other secondary message

300
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,669
that come out of the plants immune

301
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,429
system that begin to respond to

302
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:11,049
infection like this and unfortunately to

303
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:12,669
further complicate the matter you'll

304
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:14,919
find a lot of literature out there that

305
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:18,370
show co-infections of botrytis and p.m.

306
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:20,949
or through cerium and botrytis or so it

307
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,589
seems as if once the immune systems down

308
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:26,200
you know everybody piles on everyone

309
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:27,940
piles on and that actually was a really

310
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,519
complicating factor for us and trying to

311
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,899
sequence this genome because so many

312
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,549
times we were trying to scrape these

313
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,320
spores off you can do must do it with a

314
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:37,449
glass slide and get all types of powder

315
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,100
on type of slide and we try to lyse

316
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,540
those spores in the sequence the genome

317
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,670
when we always get something else we'd

318
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:44,349
always can't like Penicillium or all

319
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:46,360
these other co-infections and it's just

320
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,860
because they happen to lyse more readily

321
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,709
than the spores and they're coming along

322
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,120
for the ride it took us a long time of

323
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:54,219
figuring out how to wash those spores

324
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,389
out and then and then really you have to

325
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,910
really treat them with phenol to

326
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:00,458
actually crack them open to get the DNA

327
00:11:56,909 --> 00:12:02,169
and the sequence it and then when you

328
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:04,719
finally do have that genome it's never a

329
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:06,099
perfectly pure genome of just powdery

330
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,410
mildew spores there's still some other

331
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,600
contaminants there and to make matters

332
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:13,389
worse these genomes tend to be about a

333
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,930
hundred to 180 million bases in size but

334
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:19,600
there are 90% transpose ax Bellaire it's

335
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:20,859
repetitive as all hell and it's really

336
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,699
hard to put the genome back together

337
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:26,199
once you do finally get the DNA so yeah

338
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:27,519
it's been a bit of a frustrating rabbit

339
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:29,588
hole be honest with you but we only

340
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,149
really needed one really unique stretch

341
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:35,170
of DNA in the genome that we could

342
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:38,078
anchor a PCR target for to pick this up

343
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:40,539
unfortunately we don't have to ask

344
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,159
people to go and do this magical spore

345
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:43,539
prep that we're talking about to pick up

346
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,088
the mycelium Network the mycelium

347
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:47,409
Network is really easy to crack and easy

348
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:50,440
to lyse and we just do that with a

349
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:53,049
single core like a hole punch of a leaf

350
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,089
and a four millimeter hole punch with

351
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:57,338
leaf we usually put two of those into

352
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:59,230
each boil and we just boil that that DNA

353
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:00,699
and it pops open the mycelium Network

354
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,009
when we get enough DNA to then pick it

355
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:05,979
up with one of our color metric assays

356
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:07,899
this is a PCR assay that changes color

357
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,789
on you so that you don't need a detector

358
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,970
for and you can run it in the field it's

359
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,309
kind of a really

360
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,019
idiot proof yeah yeah that's the attempt

361
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:17,419
but you know at the same time it's it's

362
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:19,250
kind of a like a pregnancy test it's

363
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:20,958
plus-minus it's not very quantitative at

364
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,480
the moment so you know when it changes

365
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,969
color on you we still don't have a good

366
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,670
correlation with that color change to

367
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:31,160
how intensely in fact that the plant is

368
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:32,719
what people want really one is like well

369
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:34,039
give me an estimate of the colony

370
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,528
forming units you might get as a

371
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:37,610
comparison with this amount of DNA and

372
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:39,198
we just don't have those because we

373
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,560
can't culture this thing Yeah right on

374
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,909
so we're just we're thinking about

375
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,649
making even making a quantitative

376
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:47,328
version of it just for more research

377
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:49,789
purposes but right now it's just dialed

378
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:51,378
in to be as sensitive as we can get it

379
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:53,389
with its color metric assays so it will

380
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:56,569
it will get triggered by a single cell

381
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:58,159
that much we we know because we've

382
00:13:56,568 --> 00:14:00,078
targeted this at a part of the genome as

383
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,850
a really high copy number there's about

384
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,878
50 copies of this region of the genome

385
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:07,540
so a single spore or a single cell will

386
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,188
give us 50 targets to amplify from and

387
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:11,870
that seems to commit you know quite

388
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:14,028
about great quite amount of sensitivity

389
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,250
right on let's jump back to when you

390
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:20,720
were talking about how it spreads so you

391
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:22,308
describe this this stress event and I'm

392
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,500
sure that if there are growers I mean

393
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:26,838
they know what causes their plants to

394
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,039
stress but are those always going to be

395
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:33,920
the same things that causes the the

396
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:36,620
Spore to stress what specifically we can

397
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:39,349
make up the stress event that will cause

398
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,970
the powdery mildew spores to pop and

399
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,129
spread throughout the garden because

400
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,079
whatever those stresses are as a grower

401
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:47,509
we'd want to reduce those to as low as

402
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:48,769
possible I mean things that I've heard

403
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:50,899
about I don't have as much experience

404
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:52,850
growing as many people in your audience

405
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,558
but what I've would have been reading

406
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,209
about through my book warming efforts

407
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:57,620
here on this on this genome is that it's

408
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,929
usually a humidity effect or a

409
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,970
temperature effect that stresses it but

410
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:04,698
I've also been very fascinated in in the

411
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,050
microbiome in the plant so there's

412
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:08,628
there's a lot of evidence that

413
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:10,789
Trichoderma and others in other bacillus

414
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:13,188
species can knock this thing out and I

415
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:15,948
wouldn't be surprised if if your root

416
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:18,620
microbiome isn't healthy that you're

417
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,969
going to have a nutrient deficiency of

418
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,799
some sort that may not be completely

419
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,950
evident by a leaf color change but it

420
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,799
may may be deficient on the less

421
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:28,780
that can also trigger stress so some of

422
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,429
the best bio controls that are mentioned

423
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:32,919
in the literature are in fact using

424
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:35,139
Trichoderma which is another fungus but

425
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:36,819
it happens to make like Titan aces and

426
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:39,399
other enzymes that go and destroy this

427
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,510
thing and those those are probably what

428
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,740
are being emulated in a lot of these

429
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:43,960
products that are on the shelves that

430
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,940
are that are not pesticidal based but a

431
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,940
more enzyme and and biocontrol agents

432
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,580
that you see sure sure and as a matter

433
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:54,340
of fact you know people who are into

434
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:57,250
living soils and probiotics and and

435
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,230
producing their own labs and and using

436
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,700
milk instead of chemicals I mean this

437
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,860
really does seem the direction that

438
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,230
everybody's going because a lot of the

439
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,389
traditional you know anti molds

440
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,970
antifungals that people have used on

441
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:11,949
plants in in the past no one wants to

442
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:15,550
touch that stuff anymore because it's

443
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:17,680
it's gonna ding them at a pesticide test

444
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:19,089
at the state level and suddenly they're

445
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,839
gonna lose their crops so people seem to

446
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:27,070
be more and more moving to work in tune

447
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:29,530
with nature to to rebalance their their

448
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:33,640
leaf or to just straight-out knock out

449
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:35,439
the mold spores that way yeah and I

450
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,699
think it's that's it's very key right

451
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,230
now with all the extraction we have

452
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,670
going on we've seen all these wonderful

453
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,950
papers from many of the people have been

454
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:44,139
on your cast before whether it be Jeff

455
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,690
Raber or Ethan Rousseau that these

456
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:48,580
pesticides tend to hyper enrich an

457
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,920
extraction I mean we may get a couple

458
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,509
three or four fold increase in the

459
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,279
cannabinoids but they're seeing a

460
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:56,889
hundred to a thousand fold enrichments

461
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,569
for some of these pesticides so you know

462
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:59,949
if people using Michael a butyl fight

463
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,810
this we really really should change

464
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,088
practices though the one challenge and

465
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:06,338
changing those practices is that if you

466
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:08,500
do move to some probiotics you have to

467
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:10,299
be very careful of what microbial test

468
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,500
people are running because a lot of

469
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:13,180
those probiotics are going to trigger

470
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,650
your total aerobic counts or your total

471
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,839
yeast and mold counts are gonna are

472
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,459
going to go up and and we really need to

473
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:20,139
work with the regulators to not penalize

474
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,690
people for these organic practices

475
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,130
because you know Trichoderma and the

476
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,509
soleus shouldn't be a human threat they

477
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,870
shouldn't be something that elevates

478
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:30,009
your petri film counts so we do a lot of

479
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:32,589
work on that side of the fence as well

480
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:35,230
we may we make quantitative pcr assays

481
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:36,639
for microbial testing that a lot of the

482
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,319
labs use in many of the states and they

483
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,140
tend to be

484
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:42,139
dialed-in dan fairly specific in fact

485
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,180
our totally stand mole test we have

486
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,430
specifically does not hit p.m. in

487
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,440
botrytis and and if it did it would

488
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:52,200
probably fail you know 30% of the

489
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,789
samples out there that test we've we've

490
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,519
made sure the primers don't hit those

491
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:57,899
because they're not human pathogens

492
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,339
they're they're just plant pathogens and

493
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,230
we can have separate tests to pick them

494
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:02,849
up you probably want to pick those up at

495
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,230
a different time you're not interested

496
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:05,879
in whether you have botrytis or powdery

497
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,799
mildew after you've harvested it's too

498
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,570
late then you want to know about that

499
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:12,149
you know maybe six weeks to eight weeks

500
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:14,069
earlier and so we've consciously broken

501
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,360
apart those tests so that they they have

502
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:17,339
different sensitivities and they can be

503
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,719
used at different times right on we've

504
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:20,129
got a lot more to talk about powdery

505
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,380
mildew but it's time to take our first

506
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,060
short break and read right back you are

507
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,280
listening to shaping fire and my guest

508
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:29,190
today is Kevin a Kernan chief science

509
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:30,930
officer at medicinal genomics as a

510
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,789
listener of shaping fire you already

511
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,830
understand the importance of living soil

512
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:36,509
when growing cannabis when you have

513
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:38,639
active microbe communities in your

514
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:40,710
substrate you go way beyond simply

515
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,410
fertilizing with nitrogen phosphorus and

516
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,420
potassium having active microorganisms

517
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,250
in your substrate supports vigorous

518
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,990
plant growth throughout the plant's root

519
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,869
zone making for higher yields and

520
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:54,029
thriving flowers mammoth pea is the

521
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:54,629
first organically derived microbial

522
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:56,670
inoculant

523
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,860
that focuses on your plants nutrient

524
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,930
cycling processes to release soil

525
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:02,729
phosphorus and other micronutrients from

526
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,610
they're bound forms making them more

527
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,319
available to the plant increased levels

528
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:09,449
of phosphorus will also keep internode

529
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,879
shorter and focus your plants energy on

530
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,890
bud production not only that but the

531
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,140
microbes act as a defense shield for the

532
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,180
plants rhizosphere by out competing

533
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,790
potentially harmful pathogenic microbes

534
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,860
pretty cool right mammoth pee not only

535
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:24,659
unlocks the nutrients in your soil but

536
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:27,359
it also helps protect your plant from

537
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:30,090
disease mammoth Peas beneficial bacteria

538
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,519
act like microbial reactors

539
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:34,919
continually producing enzymes that

540
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:36,629
release nutrients mammoth pee was

541
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,060
developed at a u.s. University has been

542
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,430
extensively tested by Colorado growers

543
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:43,829
and independent laboratories mammoth pee

544
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:46,019
is proven to increase growth and enhance

545
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:47,879
blooming one of the great things about

546
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,349
supplementing with microorganisms is

547
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,850
that they won't compete with whatever

grow cannabis naturally and without

559
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,540
synthetic inputs has become more and

560
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,519
more available in fact probiotic growers

561
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:25,589
are experiencing large yields and

exceptional terpene profiles without

563
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:30,539
using chemicals banned in their state

564
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,480
move away from the risks inherent to

565
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:36,480
chemical nutrients and instead invest in

566
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,029

welcome back you are listening to

588
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,269
shaping fire I'm your host Shango Louis

589
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,250
and our guest this week is Kevin

590
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:41,190
mckernon chief science officer and

591
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:43,380
medicinal genomics so during the first

592
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,539
set we were talking a lot about powdery

593
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,730
mildew and we were talking about you

594
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:50,009
know some of the rumors about how it is

595
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:52,049
spread and versus the truth and the

596
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:54,420
science of it and I got to ask you know

597
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:57,180
a lot of us have leaf hoppers those

598
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:59,190
little those little bugs in our gardens

599
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,680
and you know technically if we we got

600
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,059
inundated with leaf hoppers they do suck

601
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,779
out of the plant and they would be bad

602
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,269
but normally

603
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:08,789
not enough to cause a problem however a

604
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:10,889
lot of growers are suspicious of leap

605
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:14,519
hoppers because they think that they are

606
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:16,650
moving the spores from leaf to leaf and

607
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:19,740
then plant to plant and therefore acting

608
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:23,220
as an agent for powdery mildew to spread

609
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,990
do you buy that so I have read that

610
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,990
Russert mites may do something similar

611
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:30,720
so I if I had a place to an educated

612
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:32,970
guess I'd say yes that they could be

613
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,220
spreading these things around and that

614
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,509
could be one mechanism for removing more

615
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,069
than just powdery mildew okay there

616
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:39,690
could be a host of other diseases I

617
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:42,269
wouldn't be surprised but right over on

618
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:46,170
that way as well yeah I hear that all

619
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:49,559
right so then how about the other gosh I

620
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:50,970
don't I went to say old wives tales but

621
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:52,500
but I don't that doesn't make any sense

622
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,360
because I know a lot of old wives and

623
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,779
all they say is brilliant stuff so let's

624
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,549
say I've got another myth and a a lot of

625
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:01,920
people remove it with their fingers

626
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:03,329
right and they're like oh I went through

627
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,460
the whole plan and I rubbed it with my

628
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:06,809
fingers and now I don't see any and I've

629
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,029
always thought that yeah you're removing

630
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:11,009
the white but you've just you've just

631
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:13,289
spread it around so you can't see it

632
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:14,750
anymore so so to what advantage does

633
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:17,430
rubbing it off with your fingers help

634
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,049
yeah I'll give you an anecdote about

635
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,820
this I don't think that would completely

636
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:23,339
purify from the plant just because these

637
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:25,079
mycelium networks get built in and and

638
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:27,419
spread pretty quickly and you can't see

639
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:30,059
them so I imagine that would stay around

640
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,590
and that's actually effed almost imagine

641
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:33,179
that network is like being an aspen

642
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:34,589
stand where all the roots are connected

643
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,789
and they you can sprout genetically

644
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:37,230
similar things out of the root zone

645
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,549
that's that's kind of these my city of

646
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,769
network stars they're creating this

647
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:43,710
fabric from which it can grow spores at

648
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:45,329
a later stress event so I be that why

649
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,799
that might remove a lot of the spores

650
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:48,779
it's probably a good practice just to

651
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,639
lower the spore count inside the garden

652
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:52,109
I definitely clean your hands and don't

653
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,420
touch any other plants after you do that

654
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:56,309
right I wouldn't be surprised if they

655
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,140
could if they could pop back out at a

656
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:00,149
later stressor event when you do that I

657
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,830
would probably be more inclined that

658
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,570
maybe these sulfur treatments or these

659
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:04,799
other milk-based treatments which I'm

660
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:07,439
assuming what the milk is doing is

661
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,200
putting lactobacillus in play correct

662
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,470
that probably does a better job eating

663
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,620
away that Network and in destroying it

664
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:19,919
so those are probably I bet more

665
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:21,629
party mechanisms so one story think

666
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,940
you've some folks a sense of sensitivity

667
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,840
here there was one group here that was

668
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,150
done there's a there's a company called

669
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,528
curated leaf that runs our our chemistry

670
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,778
here in Massachusetts and they went to

671
00:24:28,528 --> 00:24:32,579
one group grow they tested 30 mothers

672
00:24:30,778 --> 00:24:34,740
one of the mothers was positive for

673
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:37,139
powdery mildew they then and then went

674
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,730
and tested was a twenty five of the

675
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,549
descendants the clones off that mother

676
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,870
and two of those pop positive so now

677
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:44,519
they've pulled the mother and then the

678
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:47,369
two clones and then quarantined those

679
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,929
but that gives you a sense of the

680
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:50,759
sampling challenges we might find with

681
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:53,548
this that if it's if it's at a very low

682
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,349
spore count or very low frequency on the

683
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:57,269
plan it may not be all over the entire

684
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:59,219
plant it might just be in one side of

685
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:00,869
the plant that happened to get a little

686
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,509
bit damp or based on the corner it was

687
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:05,069
facing or something it managed to start

688
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:06,720
colonizing a plant there and when they

689
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:10,048
cut clones from that a couple of the

690
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,819
clones ended up with the disease so it

691
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:13,349
does travel just in the cloning process

692
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:15,480
alone and that's one thing that I think

693
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:17,969
people have to just keep an eye on right

694
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,589
on and similarly and in Reverse when you

695
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,538
mentioned that there you know there's a

696
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:24,750
mother room and one of the of the twenty

697
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:26,579
five plants tested possible positive for

698
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,528
powdery mildew I would think that

699
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:30,329
chances are there's powdery mildew on

700
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:32,759
all of the rest of the mothers as well

701
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:33,990
but the spore counts are so low that

702
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:36,240
they just didn't come up on the test

703
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,788
yeah could it could have been that or it

704
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,960
could they could there could be more

705
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:42,329
resistance as well I mean some of the

706
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,950
resistance literature and a rapid topsis

707
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:45,928
which is the model organism and that

708
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,940
we're looking at in hops there's six

709
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:49,340
different genetic low-side that have

710
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,630
been identified in hops that are

711
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:53,428
pointing towards their resistance

712
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,159
mechanisms and and some of the

713
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:59,399
resistance is that we think that the the

714
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,659
stoma or stomata are smaller and some of

715
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:02,099
the ones that a resistance was harder

716
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:04,080
for them to get that história or that

717
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:05,969
taproot into the plant another ones are

718
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,648
just about enzymes that the plant

719
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,720
happens to make that that might fight

720
00:26:07,648 --> 00:26:11,459
off this infection so there's a there's

721
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,558
a host of different ways in which the

722
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,788
plant this is a hops plan of course but

723
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:16,379
if you draw some of those parallels to

724
00:26:14,788 --> 00:26:18,720
cannabis you have to imagine there may

725
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,179
be more than one genetic resistance low

726
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,640
sigh in the plant and so some might

727
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:26,490
actually get infected but never actually

728
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,070
express the spores we don't know this

729
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,420
yet yeah they may just

730
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:31,009
the leaves but it's not actually

731
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,610
affecting them because they either have

732
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:37,220
you know some some magic chemical on the

733
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:39,259
leaves or so yes come on earth yeah yeah

734
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,150
right so we what we're trying to do with

735
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:43,039
the test is make sure that we we don't

736
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,509
crack open to many spores we want the

737
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,039
spores to remain Hardy and probably be

738
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:47,420
missed by the test we really want the

739
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:49,730
test to be picking up the mycelium

740
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:53,210
Network which we know is a sign of

741
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:54,230
successful infection yeah right and so

742
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,420
that's that's kind of what we've been

743
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,599
aiming for so changing gears a little

744
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:02,060
bit you know we all want to avoid

745
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:04,309
powdery mildew because it stresses out

746
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:06,200
the plan which eventually decreases

747
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:10,279
yield and might take down the plant

748
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,470
itself and no one likes to harvest a

749
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:14,480
plant and and have it go poof with

750
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,519
powdery mildew on the flowers afterwards

751
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,799
cuz that just that the expect experience

752
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:23,180
is gross but what actually happens to a

753
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:26,930
human if we smoke flower that has been

754
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:30,440
dried and then it's got powdery mildew

755
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:33,049
it and we and we combust it so the only

756
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,730
things that we've seen tied to powdery

757
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:37,669
mildew in human health is maybe an

758
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:39,650
allergenic response they're not listed

759
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,820
as human pathogens I mean this is the

760
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,650
reason why we don't have them on our

761
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:44,480
other tests or ones that are looking for

762
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,380
human pathogens like E coli Salmonella

763
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,509
and Aspergillus

764
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,310
you know Aspergillus there have been

765
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:52,220
cases of people inhaling those spores

766
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:54,409
and they can get a special OSIS and this

767
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,000
is a one patient in Toronto had this

768
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:58,700
happen to them maybe last year it was

769
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,930
published the patient survived but they

770
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,180
kind of knew more thorax and it was

771
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:04,070
really hairy scenario usually ask for

772
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,990
gel osis and immunocompromised patients

773
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:07,399
has like a 50% mortality rate so it can

774
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:09,109
be very serious if you get those types

775
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,430
of spores your lungs but it's important

776
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:11,929
about those aren't powdery mildew spores

777
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:15,140
and powdery mildew spores are probably

778
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:16,190
our bodies are probably quite used to

779
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,500
them because they're on a lot of other

780
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:20,390
vegetables you know not that we're

781
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,640
smoking those things but we're certainly

782
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:24,470
ingesting lots of other fruits and

783
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,210
vegetables and the powdery mildews seem

784
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,950
to be quite common - amongst many of

785
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,509
them so I've not found any literature

786
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,220
and I encourage anyone to forward stuff

787
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:32,629
if they can find it that's suggested

788
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,160
that this is actually a human health

789
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,080
concern it's more just I think the

790
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,180
cosmetics and perhaps the it might

791
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,339
change the the flavor and the terpene

792
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,430
profiles and and of course affect the

793
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:43,649
yields but

794
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:46,350
there isn't I think any evidence to be

795
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:48,990
alarmed of powdery mildew wow that's

796
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:50,339
really surprising you know the the lore

797
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,430
is that you know you always want to

798
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:55,409
avoid PM when producing for patients and

799
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:58,049
the idea that it is just simply because

800
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:00,960
of having a you know some sort of

801
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:03,389
allergic reaction just sounds a lot less

802
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,680
serious than mold spores getting into

803
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,810
the lungs which is how most people

804
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,610
normally talk about it and that it like

805
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:10,679
you know taking up residence there

806
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:12,089
yeah and that can be very serious for

807
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,860
Aspergillus and I agree and then in

808
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:15,089
those cases and maybe some people don't

809
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:16,259
have the eye to tell the difference

810
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:18,299
between the two of them I certainly

811
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:21,720
don't but we can tell the difference

812
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:24,059
very very evidently with DNA they're

813
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,400
they're very different so does most post

814
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:29,039
harvest processing remove it like

815
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,710
ethanol or you know using hydrocarbon

816
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,849
extraction well this will this just kill

817
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:38,069
the mold spores but leave the the

818
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:41,369
remaining spore material there but but

819
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:44,279
inactive I would imagine most extraction

820
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:45,839
systems would obliterate it and I've not

821
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,579
there's a few folks in on the field

822
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,709
trying to look at that question whether

823
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:51,029
the extraction systems actually destroy

824
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:53,670
the spores or whether they make it

825
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:55,829
through but if I had to place money on

826
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:59,789
it I bet ethanol extractions would would

827
00:29:55,829 --> 00:30:01,169
melt most of these things away so you

828
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:03,539
know a lot of people have been talking

829
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:06,590
about that great Jorge Cervantes video

830
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:10,589
that's been going around is showing him

831
00:30:06,589 --> 00:30:14,609
giving his flowers with PM a hydrogen

832
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:17,819
peroxide bath that's eight ounces of h2o

833
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:20,939
to to a five gallon bucket of water and

834
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:22,619
then he takes the flowers that and and

835
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,809
then and then washes them kind of

836
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:26,579
submerges them and jostles them around a

837
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:29,569
little bit and then hangs them to dry

838
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:32,339
and of course since we all try to avoid

839
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:36,569
mold generally and water on our plants

840
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:38,039
it totally looks crazy to that and you

841
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:40,710
really have to make sure that you dry

842
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:42,119
them well so that doesn't happen but so

843
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:45,269
what are your thoughts of that is that a

844
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:47,129
pretty effective way to remove PM from

845
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:49,859
your flowers if you've got an especially

846
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:52,350
higher ratio yeah and i think we saw a

847
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:54,089
lot of the grouse here resorting to that

848
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:54,379
when they when they just opened up and

849
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:55,669
had

850
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,990
problem with this they were starting to

851
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,850
resort to some of this hydrogen peroxide

852
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,829
treatment I think they did notice a hit

853
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:03,559
in the terpenes however which is

854
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:05,389
probably not that surprising with

855
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:07,309
hydrogen peroxide so some of the terpene

856
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:10,370
profile may change with that treatment

857
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:12,529
but it I don't know what happens with

858
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:14,149
yield either do you do you end up I

859
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:16,910
would imagine with the PM infection

860
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:18,440
you're not getting perhaps the you're

861
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,180
not getting the best growth the plants

862
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,450
busy trying to find infection as opposed

863
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:26,570
to making incredible colas and so there

864
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:28,130
may be just a yield issue as well

865
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:29,659
so since you mentioned it and I know

866
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,160
this is purely speculative because I

867
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:37,070
don't think there's many studies on this

868
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:39,680
but you suggested that h2o2 would likely

869
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:42,829
decrease the terpenes now regardless of

870
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:45,080
the terpene test being higher or lower

871
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:49,879
what scientifically do you think about

872
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:52,939
hydrogen peroxide would threaten terpene

873
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,590
I think she's oxidative I imagine some

874
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,289
of the the terpenes will get oxidized

875
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:59,599
with hydrogen peroxide treatment which

876
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:02,690
may change limiting and pennilyn or a

877
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,639
few the ones that that are that may be

878
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,870
more susceptible to that good I'm glad I

879
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,759
asked that's really interesting I would

880
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:09,409
have to look into that more myself all

881
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,599
right so then so then the last question

882
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:13,550
before we move on to botrytis is

883
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,039
prevention right like you know the best

884
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:18,559
the best cure is to not get it in the

885
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:21,559
first place and and we know that there's

886
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,500
probably some amount of PM on just about

887
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:27,109
every plant and the question is does do

888
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:30,769
you create an opportunity for the

889
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:32,240
powdery mildew to take over and increase

890
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:34,369
the spore accounts on any particular

891
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,430
plant so what can we do as a

892
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:41,839
preventative so that we keep those spore

893
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:43,519
counts negligible well this is a bit of

894
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:45,409
a self-fulfilling plug here but what

895
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,569
we've been pitching is just a screen for

896
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,740
these this stuff genetically and and use

897
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:50,299
it as a mechanism that perhaps

898
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,460
accelerate your breeding toward

899
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:55,069
resistant lines if you if you can screen

900
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,569
all your plants that the ones that are

901
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:58,730
that are starting to build up in p.m.

902
00:32:56,569 --> 00:33:00,259
and now they're you're not gonna this is

903
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:02,390
before you can actually see the spores

904
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:03,740
once you can see the powder on it's too

905
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,190
late that their spores are there and

906
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,170
they're gonna spread in so by

907
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,140
time you're in emergency mode trying to

908
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:11,970
chop stuff down and treat things but

909
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,440
prior to that while these things are

910
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,610
potentially incubating and building the

911
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,990
especi of networks you could be

912
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:17,729
screening for the plants that are that

913
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:19,950
are susceptible to it and remove those

914
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:21,539
and then by default the ones that are

915
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,850
left over are more likely to have

916
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:26,639
resistance genetics and keep reading

917
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:29,909
those so we view it as an opportunity to

918
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,070
do some some selective reading based on

919
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:34,380
you know plant pathogens that are

920
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:37,289
president that you can find the being

921
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,630
the DNA right on and as far as so that's

922
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:41,909
how you can get rid of it long term

923
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:44,220
through selective breeding and it sounds

924
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:46,259
like our best solution in the short term

925
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,529
if you're if you're dealing with an

926
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:53,609
acute situation is going to labs you

927
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:56,279
know keeping a hostile environment to

928
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:58,979
those spores use your labs in advance

929
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:00,509
both you know in the soil and foliar but

930
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:04,110
I don't actually have a good answer for

931
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:05,730
how it may blow your spore tests though

932
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:07,829
that's that's something that we're gonna

933
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:10,409
have to change in the regulations so

934
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:13,349
that we can continue to use labs for

935
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:15,960
probiotic growing yeah exactly that is

936
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:18,719
the challenges if you go to a lab that's

937
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,269
using Petri films powdery mildew doesn't

938
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,529
grow on Petri films and so they're gonna

939
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:24,449
be blind to it

940
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,700
however Trichoderma which you might want

941
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:28,589
to consider using to get rid of it

942
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:30,449
will grow on those films and so it's a

943
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,860
bit of a double-edged sword there that

944
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:33,689
you might the right thing to do it's

945
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,400
probably probiotics but you're probably

946
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:39,119
gonna get penalized for it if the lab is

947
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,829
using a culture based system to to track

948
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,980
this right on definitely something we're

949
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:47,009
gonna have to all be active around with

950
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:49,050
both lab technique and also how the

951
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:51,150
regulations are put in place so we're

952
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,800
not dinging the wrong people for first

953
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:54,809
for sports they're actually healthy I

954
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,310
mean yeah I think California got this

955
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:58,529
right I think their most recent regs

956
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:59,940
I've seen is a very species specific on

957
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:02,040
the human pathogen front so they've got

958
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,929
a coli and Salmonella and we have a test

959
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:06,059
for that that's multiplexed and two

960
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:08,129
different wavelengths and then there's

961
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:10,259
four different Aspergillus species and

962
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,750
we have tests for all four of those as

963
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,670
well but there isn't anything in there

964
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:16,380
like a total aerobic count or total

965
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:18,869
yeast and mold and thank God because

966
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,970
those very broad

967
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:22,349
tests their their reading tea leaves

968
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:25,049
they're really not telling you what's

969
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:27,360
beneficial versus what versus what's

970
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:30,860
harmful that that's what we used to have

971
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:33,210
in Washington until just last month we

972
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,430
changed to moral on the line so what

973
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:37,349
California is doing so so let's move it

974
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:40,109
let's move on to botrytis you know

975
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:43,199
usually this time of year people will

976
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,760
first swear about powdery mildew and

977
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,099
then we'll follow the next person in

978
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,560
line will swear about botrytis and it's

979
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:52,289
such a drag to watch a gorgeous kolja

980
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:54,360
growing at the top of a plant only to

981
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:58,110
have it crumble in your hands because

982
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:01,550
it's rotted from the inside no no just

983
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:04,620
makes you cry so so so what is botrytis

984
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,970
so it's it's another mold in fact this

985
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:07,650
one was sequenced by the Whitehead

986
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:09,599
Institute many years ago so there's

987
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:12,539
already a genome sequence for this and

988
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,279
it seems to cross two different plants

989
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:17,190
so it's botrytis scenario which is

990
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,570
mostly found in on cannabis and that's

991
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,760
at least the test that we've been

992
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:23,039
building forward is toward that toward

993
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,870
that genome and we do find it a lot of

994
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:27,659
people have handed us botrytis samples

995
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:31,829
the tests are positive for it it is it's

996
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:33,509
it is also something that can get to the

997
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:35,099
seeds which is something where we don't

998
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:38,670
believe can happen with powdery mildew

999
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:40,799
so the the literature at least in hops

1000
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:43,680
is that peat macular is unlikely to get

1001
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,420
into the seeds botrytis however seems

1002
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,899
like it can get into the seeds and it

1003
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:51,599
can also survive the winner and so it's

1004
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,099
um it's perhaps a little bit of a

1005
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,549
tougher one to get rid of in that regard

1006
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:58,409
so from a testing standpoint we are

1007
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,360
still doing leaf punches to try and pick

1008
00:36:58,409 --> 00:37:01,799
this up and that may not we may have to

1009
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,450
change that because it doesn't always

1010
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,880
seem to show itself up in the leaves

1011
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:08,159
like powdery mildew does but it is

1012
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,289
believed to be systemic this is one

1013
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,149
where there's really good literature

1014
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:14,730
around botrytis scenario at getting into

1015
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,050
the vasculature of the plant and this is

1016
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,059
why you can see it in the center of the

1017
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:21,030
buds too so when it's infected it's it's

1018
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:25,079
you know it's inside out and in terms of

1019
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:26,790
its its display so yeah it's a little

1020
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,559
bit of a different beast and sometimes

1021
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:31,829
you know probably harder to deal with it

1022
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,960
anyways so for somebody who is new to

1023
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:36,420
I mean just about anybody who's grown a

1024
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,179
crop or two has has seen botrytis and

1025
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,920
can identify it because it you know it's

1026
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:42,809
a big old bear and the grow it's kind of

1027
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,059
hard to miss once you know what it is

1028
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:46,949
but for somebody who's relatively new to

1029
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:50,279
working with the plants how do you

1030
00:37:46,949 --> 00:37:53,969
identify botrytis visually without going

1031
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:56,730
into a lab well there's you know

1032
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:58,829
horray has great pictures of this in his

1033
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:01,710
cannabis encyclopedia of what botrytis

1034
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:03,779
can look like and there's even so you

1035
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,429
can even sometimes seen on stems as like

1036
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,830
little gray spots and the stems I've

1037
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:09,750
even gotten the DNA tests to pick it up

1038
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:12,929
positive on some leaves that didn't look

1039
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:15,570
like they were infected with any fungus

1040
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:17,909
so we're still learning about I think

1041
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:19,590
about how early this infects things I

1042
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:22,230
think that what I've read is it also has

1043
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:24,420
a dpi of like eighteen to thirty days is

1044
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:26,880
a days post infection meaning that it

1045
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,409
can stay unnoticed human eye for that

1046
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,599
period of time before it begins to show

1047
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:34,129
phenotypes that we can detect with maybe

1048
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:37,289
a magnifying loupe or something so it's

1049
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:38,940
that I've had some plants test positive

1050
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:40,529
where I would have never thought it had

1051
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,420
it had discovered leaves that were

1052
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,800
little necrotic here and there and lo

1053
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,869
and behold there's botrytis in there

1054
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,390
starting to get foot and I bet when some

1055
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:50,190
of those plants mature they're gonna

1056
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:53,339
it's going to come out in full force so

1057
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:54,840
I think this one might be a little bit

1058
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,850
harder for people to eyeball because I

1059
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,010
do think it has a variety of different

1060
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:02,009
ways in which it can they can show

1061
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,810
itself right on let's go ahead and take

1062
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:05,460
our second short break and when we come

1063
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:07,500
back we will continue talking about

1064
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,480
botrytis you're listening to shaping

1065
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,219
fire and my guest today is kevin

1066
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,309
mckernon chief science officer and

1067
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:15,719
medicinal genomics we humans are

1068
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:17,670
attracted to plants because they offer

1069
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:19,739
us relief and are a whole lot of fun

1070
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:21,570
sometimes though the best parts are

1071
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:24,209
buried inside the plant and we need to

1072
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:25,440
use specialty extraction technology when

1073
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:27,539
it comes to cannabis it is

1074
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,639
extraordinarily important to extract its

1075
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:31,769
precious oils without changing them in

1076
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:33,900
the process we want to preserve the

1077
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,789
properties of the cannabinoids terpenes

1078
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,630
and other constituents that all work

1079
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:41,340
together since 1994 Eden labs has been

1080
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:43,230
developing extraction technology and

1081
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,608
processes to do just that

1082
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:47,440
Eden labs was founded by a

1083
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:49,509
loving engineered during the early days

1084
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,088
of medical marijuana in California and

1085
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:53,798
the expanded Eden team has been

1086
00:39:52,088 --> 00:39:55,869
designing and building industry-leading

1087
00:39:53,798 --> 00:39:56,559
solutions for cannabis extraction ever

1088
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:59,559
since

1089
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:02,410
Eden labs flagship product is the newly

compare themselves with not only that

1095
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:15,130
but the improved automation software

1096
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:18,309

cannabis with sunshine you can often

1135
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:50,079
feel limited by the seasonal cycle you

1136
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,849
want to grow sustainably and save money

1137
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,829
so you use as little electricity as

1138
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:55,690
possible but if you haven't studied or

1139
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:57,220
implemented light deprivation techniques

1140

or parading light deprivation solutions

1143
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,360
into your greenhouse you can often add

1144
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,400
two or three additional growing cycles

1145
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,050

scale light deprivation technology is

1149
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,539
remaking the cannabis industry what used

1150
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:18,279
to be done by pulling tarps over hoop

1151
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:19,779
houses has been scaled up over the last

1152
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,360
few years in such a way that has become

1153
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:23,650
mechanized easy and affordable to even

1167
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:51,699
with guest eric Branstad of forever

1168
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:53,350
flowering I talked with Eric about the

1169
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:55,389
importance of intelligent greenhouse

1170
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:57,130
management as well as the huge financial

1171
00:42:55,389 --> 00:42:59,859
benefit of incorporating light depth

1172
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:01,570
techniques there are so many aspects of

1173
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,940
utilizing a greenhouse that can go wrong

1174
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:06,010
from temperature and airflow to light

1175
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,809

1178
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:14,230
retrofit your existing greenhouse with

1179
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,119
light depth and other modern systems at

listening to shaping fire

1193
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:44,619
I'm your host Shango Lowe's and our

1194
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:47,529
guest this week is Kevin mckernon chief

1195
00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:50,019
science officer at medicinal genomics so

1196
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:53,440
let's talk more about botrytis so you

1197
00:43:50,019 --> 00:43:56,139
know when people first see botrytis when

1198
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:59,019
people are in their personal gardens a

1199
00:43:56,139 --> 00:44:01,420
lot of folks will just pinch off that

1200
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:04,150
small amount of botrytis that they see

1201
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:07,180
with the idea of oh you know I really

1202
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:09,130
don't want to destroy the whole Cola or

1203
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:10,929
this whole plant so I'm just gonna I'm

1204
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,789
gonna pinch this little bit off and I'm

1205
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:15,730
gonna take it away from the garden

1206
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:17,409
just like hope for the best and and you

1207
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:19,210
know in in personal gardens sometimes

1208
00:44:17,409 --> 00:44:22,569
you can get away with this but but my

1209
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:24,550
question for you is are we just fooling

1210
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,170
ourselves I mean is it all if it's

1211
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,970
already a little bit on the plant is

1212
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:31,990
there already everywhere and this plant

1213
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:33,250
is doomed how bad is it so that's a

1214
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:35,919
perfect question there was someone that

1215
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,269
this happened to the summer on and there

1216
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,710
was parts of their plant that looked

1217
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:40,509
like they could salvage and other ones

1218
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:43,570
that they broke off and you know threw

1219
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:45,400
it into the trash and so we went in DNA

1220
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:47,890
tested the stuff that was clearly just

1221
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,930
covered in mold and also the stuff that

1222
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:52,900
they thought was clean and we found we

1223
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:54,429
found protaras DNA and all of it so they

1224
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,950
opted to take the clean stuff and then

1225
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:59,019
go extract it and see if they could turn

1226
00:44:56,949 --> 00:45:02,529
into something other than a smokeable

1227
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:04,630
product but I really don't know if if

1228
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:07,210
they had continued to grow that plant

1229
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:08,349
for another week or two whether they

1230
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:10,000
would have just shown up in the other

1231
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:11,799
flowers or not and really sprouted there

1232
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,599
we didn't really that didn't happen once

1233
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,580
they saw it break out like this they

1234
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,900
kind of killed the thing and started

1235
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:19,420
tearing apart the parts if they thought

1236
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:22,480
they could salvage but we did see DNA in

1237
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,789
all of it so yeah I really don't have

1238
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,740
any advice on the biocontrol of this

1239
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:28,570
other than what you can probably find in

1240
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:30,219
a lot of the other recommended books

1241
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:32,470
about using you know Trichoderma and

1242
00:45:30,219 --> 00:45:34,539
other types of yeast to try and take it

1243
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:37,539
down one of the things that makes me way

1244
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:40,269
more suspicious of botrytis then then

1245
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:40,900
powdery mildew is because it is systemic

1246
00:45:40,269 --> 00:45:43,030
right

1247
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,470
I mean you are if you see a little bit

1248
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:46,540
about trying to sign a flower and you

1249
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:49,480
pinch it off you are mechanically

1250
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:52,539
removing the spores from the flower but

1251
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,119
at that point it's already in everywhere

1252
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:57,279
yeah it's already inside of the plant so

1253
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,679
so really you're just doing an aesthetic

1254
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,360
thing at that point yeah well you know

1255
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,669
there is an interesting paper a point

1256
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,400
people - in tomatoes where they they

1257
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:08,289
deploy hexanoic acid under the root ball

1258
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,380
tomatoes and it Prime's the plant to

1259
00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:13,239
defend itself against botrytis and

1260
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,680
hexanoic acid is a very interesting

1261
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:17,409
compound it's actually the first

1262
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:19,089
compound and cannabinoid synthesis the

1263
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:20,679
hexanoic acid pathway is what is the

1264
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:21,970
spread it's arguably a peak or precursor

1265
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:23,799
to these things are obviously Tomatoes

1266
00:46:21,969 --> 00:46:25,689
don't make that but hexanoic acid I

1267
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,240
think in other plants is a signaling

1268
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:29,349
molecule the immune system

1269
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:30,819
but it's an interesting paper because

1270
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:32,469
they actually carbon label the hexanoic

1271
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,150
acid they show it's not actually getting

1272
00:46:32,469 --> 00:46:35,769
past the root zone so it's doing some

1273
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,539
type of cellular communication with the

1274
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:39,820
plant to prime the immune system to

1275
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:42,880
fight off at Rytas oh man that sounds so

1276
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:45,519
interesting I will I will not only get

1277
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,550
that paper from you folks will be able

1278
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:51,099
to look on the the podcast page for this

1279
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:52,630
episode and and get most of the papers

1280
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:55,329
that you're referring to including a

1281
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:59,079
link to that that great Rob Clark book

1282
00:46:55,329 --> 00:47:00,909
about oh yeah and Jesus yeah so all

1283
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:02,829
right so so let's go the opposite side

1284
00:47:00,909 --> 00:47:04,059
right we're talking about a we were just

1285
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:06,219
talking about pinching it off and you're

1286
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:09,820
in your own home grow let's talk about

1287
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:11,549
an indoor commercial grow now if if

1288
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:14,470
you're if you find a plant that is

1289
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:17,620
expressing botrytis and we know it's

1290
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:20,829
systemic it would sound like you would

1291
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:24,190
want to bag that plant cut it and get it

1292
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:27,219
the hell out of your indoor environment

1293
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:29,829
right yeah that would be my tendency

1294
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:32,049
because that once these spores start to

1295
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:35,739
go there they they move and they're very

1296
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:38,500
they're very resistant so so you know we

1297
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:41,439
talked about how powdery mildew other

1298
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,750
than some potential allergies that it's

1299
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,280
not really all that bad for humans even

1300
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:47,079
though we all try to avoid it because

1301
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,080
it's just kind of generally gross and

1302
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:52,569
and and poor aesthetics how does it go

1303
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:55,500
for botrytis I mean I mean certainly it

1304
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:58,210
tastes bad and it causes you to cough

1305
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:01,210
but but how does botrytis affect the

1306
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:02,860
human eye the same thing I've read is

1307
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:05,740
just out allergenic I've not seen

1308
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:08,289
botrytis as being a health hazard and if

1309
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:09,729
anyone has any papers to show us

1310
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:12,130
otherwise we were all years but we have

1311
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:15,309
been searching for any evidence of that

1312
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:17,440
and have opted to not have it be in the

1313
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:19,179
human pathogen analyst results of that

1314
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,070
the allergy part of it is certainly

1315
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:24,099
plenty for me I mean I know that when

1316
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:27,070
when I come across some botrytis in a

1317
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:28,449
flower when I'm trimming let's say you

1318
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,430
know and I and I didn't know was coming

1319
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:32,379
right I didn't see it and I pick it up

1320
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:33,759
and it hits something and I and it's

1321
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:36,460
under the lighting all sudden goes poof

1322
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,560
right and the spores are everywhere and

1323
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,690
of course I'm inhaling it and it's like

1324
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,849
oh man time

1325
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:44,820
take a step outside and get some fresh

1326
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:47,610
air because that stuff's really gross I

1327
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:51,860
think that even though you know it may

1328
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:55,650
not be bad for humans it's certainly

1329
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:57,720
unpleasant to my human yeah these things

1330
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:59,250
are fairly ubiquitous as well in the

1331
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:00,839
atmosphere and so I think it's R it's

1332
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:03,420
really comes down to are they

1333
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,800
immunocompromised or not and in those

1334
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,630
cases maybe the out the allergenic

1335
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,150
reaction is probably more severe of a

1336
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:10,110
concern than what a healthy individual

1337
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:13,800
might have from just environmental

1338
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:15,660
exposure to spores so now for a light

1339
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,789
infection of at Rytas you know in

1340
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:19,710
advance botrytis infection on a flower I

1341
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:22,230
mean the poor flower just melts and

1342
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:23,760
there's nothing left in it but but but

1343
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:28,110
some plants they'll get just a little

1344
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:30,210
bit of botrytis and folks will we'll set

1345
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:33,539
those aside to be processed either into

1346
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:35,220
a topical or you know it is you know

1347
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:36,929
maybe they'll maybe a micro filter it

1348
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:39,629
and turn it into a tincture or something

1349
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:41,579
though that would be arguably sketchy as

1350
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:44,750
well but my point is is that you know

1351
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:48,719
when you process it with ethanol or with

1352
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:51,659
you know hydrocarbons does it kill the

1353
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:54,539
spore but leave the spore plant material

1354
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:56,519
just like it does with powdery mildew so

1355
00:49:54,539 --> 00:49:58,259
I don't know the answer to that it's a

1356
00:49:56,519 --> 00:50:01,230
good question as to whether or not you

1357
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:03,600
know which extraction techniques do what

1358
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:05,340
to the spores you know I would assume

1359
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,960
the spores are the things that are

1360
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,250
probably the hardiest and that they may

1361
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,199
survive some of the extraction

1362
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,610
techniques that are out there but I

1363
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:13,439
don't know I have not seen any studies

1364
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:15,180
done on that right on you know one of

1365
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:20,579
the things that really is a drag about

1366
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:23,549
about botrytis especially up here in the

1367
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:25,710
in the northwest is that down in Oregon

1368
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:29,070
where they have a very popular and

1369
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:32,730
financially successful Riesling harvest

1370
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:35,309
they actually spray it outdoors on

1371
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:38,400
desert wine grapes they actually call no

1372
00:50:35,309 --> 00:50:40,500
noble rot because it makes it makes

1373
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,970
dessert wines taste better and you know

1374
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,619
then the wind blows it up here in the

1375
00:50:41,969 --> 00:50:45,419
northwest it's like you know as if we

1376
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:47,429
don't have enough trouble with mold just

1377
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,869
because it's so wet up here and then

1378
00:50:47,429 --> 00:50:50,730
we're you know it's it's they're

1379
00:50:48,869 --> 00:50:52,079
spraying and but try this down in Oregon

1380
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,039
and it blows up here and suddenly we've

1381
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,690
got there Noble

1382
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:58,559
rot which we've got a lot of swear words

1383
00:50:54,690 --> 00:51:00,150
for yes it's true they I guess in the

1384
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,219
wine industry this actually helps the

1385
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,780
flavor so this is used quite often leaf

1386
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:05,250
or that you know I should say I have

1387
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:07,950
heard of some folks who have been

1388
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:10,139
working in indoor grows where they've

1389
00:51:07,949 --> 00:51:12,349
been chronically exposed to high spore

1390
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:15,480
counts and feel as if they've gotten

1391
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:18,449
some type of allergy or or lung

1392
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,280
infection so you know III don't want to

1393
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:22,649
proclaim that this stuff is all it's all

1394
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,269
rosy for people but there can be cases I

1395
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,889
imagine where a year if you're stuffed

1396
00:51:24,269 --> 00:51:27,509
in in a room that doesn't have right the

1397
00:51:25,889 --> 00:51:28,980
right ventilation you're constantly

1398
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:32,570
working around a high spore count that's

1399
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:37,110
probably gonna aggravate the scenario so

1400
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:38,610
um so similarly 2 p.m. and I and I know

1401
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:39,750
that you're not big on the prevention

1402
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:41,190
side I mean you believe in the

1403
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:43,769
prevention side but it's not really the

1404
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:47,220
focus of your research um would you say

1405
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:50,940
that an approach of spraying labs Foley

1406
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:54,029
early would help against botrytis in the

1407
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:55,440
same ways that powdery mildew I'm

1408
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:57,269
starting kiss your question and foliar

1409
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,340
sprays whether they would help yeah yeah

1410
00:51:57,269 --> 00:52:01,500
so I think that's where a lot of this is

1411
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,059
going to go is that once we have the

1412
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,619
genome sequence of all of the pests that

1413
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:05,820
that have in fact cannabis well then

1414
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:08,009
it's just a question of finding the

1415
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:09,660
genomic Achilles heel and hitting these

1416
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:11,100
things with RNA AI or hitting these

1417
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:14,069
things with other enzymes that might

1418
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:16,769
actually target the weakness that you

1419
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:19,140
can see in the genome and these foliar

1420
00:52:16,769 --> 00:52:20,820
sprays ideally would be for molecules

1421
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:22,889
that are ephemeral that are like enzymes

1422
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,780
biodegrade over time and and RNA

1423
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:26,309
molecules degrade over time and so these

1424
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,690
types of approaches I think you're

1425
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,880
showing a lot of promise in other in

1426
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:31,829
other plants and if they can work in a

1427
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,840
rapid OPS's if you can find an economic

1428
00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:36,059
model club to work in $2 a pound

1429
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,700
tomatoes you can find an economic and a

1430
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:40,259
model for to work in cannabis right on I

1431
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:42,119
think that is a great approach and and

1432
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:45,720
while I'm at it I want to I want to plug

1433
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:48,239
the the Facebook group the probiotic

1434
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:50,879
farmers alliance it's a huge

1435
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:53,789
yeah me too they got like 20,000 members

1436
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:57,320
and if you want to learn how to make

1437
00:52:53,789 --> 00:52:59,940
labs and and you know lactobacillus

1438
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:02,280
lactobacilli and others that will help

1439
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:04,079
protect protect your plants you know you

1440
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,990
can google it anywhere but but that

1441
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,358
group

1442
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:09,909
it's moderated really well and there's a

1443
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:13,389
lot of pros on on that list so probiotic

1444
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:15,098
farmers Alliance shout out there so so

1445
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:17,230
Kevin I know I'm catching you off guard

1446
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:19,838
with this this this last question but

1447
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:23,139
you know you have got a lot of depth in

1448
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:24,818
both powdery mildew and botrytis and you

1449
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:27,670
know I as an interviewer I can only

1450
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:30,460
really ask you questions on things that

1451
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:33,309
that I've come across and and know you

1452
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:35,588
know what have I what's in your head

1453
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:38,109
about either or both of those that I

1454
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:39,518
haven't asked you and and in your head

1455
00:53:38,108 --> 00:53:41,170
you're like you're like oh man this

1456
00:53:39,518 --> 00:53:43,558
would be this would be a good thing to

1457
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:46,450
throw into the mix as well but but maybe

1458
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:48,009
Shenko doesn't you know know to ask you

1459
00:53:46,449 --> 00:53:50,730
about it what am I not asking you and I

1460
00:53:48,009 --> 00:53:53,108
should about this well I would say that

1461
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:54,880
so we have we've sequenced the genome of

1462
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:57,130
one powdery mildew that infects cannabis

1463
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,769
and I'm somewhat suspicious there may be

1464
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:01,210
a second genome out there only because

1465
00:53:59,768 --> 00:54:03,429
that's what we've seen with wheat and

1466
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:05,619
rye there is a two different or three

1467
00:54:03,429 --> 00:54:07,719
different strains of bloom area that are

1468
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:11,108
powdery mildews that infect those

1469
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:12,699
grasses and and the plants have evolved

1470
00:54:11,108 --> 00:54:15,068
different resistance to each one of them

1471
00:54:12,699 --> 00:54:16,748
so we're somewhat eager to see if

1472
00:54:15,068 --> 00:54:18,159
there's another another powdery mildew

1473
00:54:16,748 --> 00:54:20,048
out there that affects cannabis kind of

1474
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:21,778
us having such a global spread it would

1475
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:25,150
be surprise me if there were just one

1476
00:54:21,778 --> 00:54:26,858
right now we've tested a lot of material

1477
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:28,329
from California and from the East Coast

1478
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:29,558
but in a little bit in Canada but we

1479
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:31,329
haven't really gotten to any

1480
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:32,680
international markets with the test yet

1481
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:35,650
to know whether the powdery mildew in

1482
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:37,899
Europe for instance or in an Afghanistan

1483
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:39,730
is is the same species what we're

1484
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:42,278
dealing here dealing with here and then

1485
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:43,900
the other thing is there is a tremendous

1486
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:46,389
amount of confusion in literature over

1487
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:48,489
the taxonomic class of these things in

1488
00:54:46,389 --> 00:54:50,108
fact there's a great book from Roger ta

1489
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:53,588
Cooke I would point people to and the

1490
00:54:50,108 --> 00:54:55,598
taxonomic manual of powdery mildews and

1491
00:54:53,588 --> 00:54:57,068
it's a huge book and what you'll will

1492
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,660
frustrate you about this book is if you

1493
00:54:57,068 --> 00:55:00,639
look at all of these species that

1494
00:54:58,659 --> 00:55:04,778
they're there categorizing in here they

1495
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:06,489
all look the same by eye which can be a

1496
00:55:04,778 --> 00:55:07,900
little bit overwhelming when you realize

1497
00:55:06,489 --> 00:55:09,730
there's this many powdery mildews out

1498
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:13,150
there and they all look the same

1499
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:15,099
what am I actually dealing with so going

1500
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:17,630
forward we're looking to expand the

1501
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:19,340
testing menu from just botrytis

1502
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:21,740
powdery mildew onto anything that

1503
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:23,480
affects cannabis so if folks have ideas

1504
00:55:21,739 --> 00:55:25,099
and tests that we should target we have

1505
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:27,590
a long list of things we're going down

1506
00:55:25,099 --> 00:55:29,449
and making assays for from you know

1507
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,980
Fusarium to Pythium to downy mildew you

1508
00:55:29,449 --> 00:55:32,329
name it everything in these books that

1509
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:34,010
were reading about we're trying to make

1510
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,750
assays for but we always want to hear

1511
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:37,580
from growers as to what they're actually

1512
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:39,079
running into what what are the problems

1513
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:41,659
that are really causing them economic

1514
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:44,139
harm so that we can make assays that

1515
00:55:41,659 --> 00:55:46,699
detect them very early because we think

1516
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:48,949
is the key to finding both resistance

1517
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:51,439
genetics and also to just preventing

1518
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:55,069
grows from getting knocked out the idea

1519
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:57,500
that there may be a novel p.m. that's

1520
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:59,690
specific for cannabis is really an

1521
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:03,050
interesting idea it's probably really

1522
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:06,440
like the other ones but has just got a

1523
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:10,880
small difference that is that is unique

1524
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:13,130
how would at what point would nature of

1525
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,690
developed this this novel version of

1526
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:17,150
p.m. would it would it go all the way

1527
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:18,980
back to you know the land races or is

1528
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:21,170
this something that probably it happened

1529
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:23,719
once we all started hybridizing them so

1530
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:25,369
I'll link you guys another paper to the

1531
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:26,750
plumeria paper and they're they

1532
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:29,900
hypothesize that this is happening

1533
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:32,360
during domestication of of the plants

1534
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,130
that when you domesticate them you tend

1535
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,750
to take the plants out of a surrounding

1536
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:38,030
where they have a lot of other species

1537
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:39,800
where there might be more hopping going

1538
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:41,720
on into more of a monoculture

1539
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,550
environment and when that happens the

1540
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:45,919
youth these obligate bio troves tend to

1541
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:49,160
speciate at least that's their thinking

1542
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,260
so yeah it could be just that this dates

1543
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:53,690
back to when mankind decided to take

1544
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:55,400
cannabis under its wing and along with

1545
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:57,490
its pathogens decided to evolve

1546
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,930
according to new cultural or new

1547
00:56:57,489 --> 00:57:02,059
agricultural practices yeah that makes a

1548
00:56:59,929 --> 00:57:05,659
lot of sense and and yet more evidence

1549
00:57:02,059 --> 00:57:07,820
against mono cropping mono culturing and

1550
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:11,029
in favor of permaculture and companion

1551
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:12,559
plants right Yeah right right on well

1552
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:14,450
