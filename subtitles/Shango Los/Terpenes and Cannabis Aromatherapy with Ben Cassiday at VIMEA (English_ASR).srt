1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:12,859
our guest this evening is my good friend

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,260
Ben Cassidy Ben his co-founder of true

3
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:17,118
terpenes in Portland Oregon and he was

4
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:19,429
kind enough to drive all the way up just

5
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,859
for tonight's event to terpenes provides

6
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:24,710
exceptional quality organic steam

7
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:27,710
distilled terpenes both soul as well as

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,939
in handcrafted and his profiles tonight

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,650
Ben is going to talk to us about

10
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:33,170
terpenes and improving our health

11
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:35,799
through aromatherapy both width and

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:41,920
without cameras give it up event

13
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:41,919
[Applause]

14
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:47,369
so will this dope right into the actual

15
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:50,759
kind of beat of Everton and that is a

16
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:52,349
look at the definition of terpenes from

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,899
a few different perspectives

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,939
I hope feminists would say that terpenes

19
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,280
are aromatic hydrocarbon made of ice

20
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,070
cream and what does that mean I'm gonna

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,070
break it down turbines are the largest

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,399
most diverse class for ecologies odds

23
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,889
are you smell something and it is a

24
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:13,259
natural airhead

25
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,700
opponent it is a turkey or it started as

26
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:15,569
a turkey and integrated into something

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,549
else

28
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,829
the difference between a turkey and

29
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,478
turkey noise is subtle but I think

30
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,329
everybody in this room should know what

31
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:28,469
it is instead ytterbium is produced by a

32
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:30,118
plant while it's living not to say that

33
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:31,798
once it's been removed from the plant

34
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,920
all of the chemicals become terpenoids

35
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,020
the terpenoids are oxidized to turkeys

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,549
so rather than just being a hydrocarbon

37
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,868
which just doesn't sound means that it's

38
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,868
made just hydrogen and carbon

39
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,510
therapeutic application at that point

40
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,620
different sense continues to be able to

41
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,219
create over time

42
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,359
turkeys are also lipids reflect Mets

43
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:01,549
which we're all familiar with when it

44
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,170
comes to canvass lipids generally are

45
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:05,060
hydrophobic and they're unable to

46
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,330
solvent water so the same thing with

47
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,649
marriage proof derbies in all essential

48
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,990
oils you can't just put them in the

49
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,340
water having dissolved you have to make

50
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:18,830
sure that you have some sort of other

51
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:20,150
fat based substance that they can so for

52
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,560
something to be called aromatic this is

53
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,689
pretty interesting to me

54
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,330
we'll see what you think it has to

55
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:27,650
contain at least one benzene ring

56
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,590
benzene is the central structure of

57
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,680
thousands of organic molecules and

58
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:36,259
composed of six carbon atoms most of the

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,150
common psychotropic substances that were

60
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:44,419
familiar with the containment team

61
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:46,969
that's betadine FDA lsd-25 mescaline and

62
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:49,129
all of the cannabinoids as well there's

63
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:51,680
a CVD is going to even all of their

64
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:55,430
various formations are also considered

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,500
aromatic benzene ring this term was

66
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:00,200
actually coined because when they

67
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,439
aromatic brother was coined because when

68
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,699
they started looking into terpenes the

69
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,169
chemistry wasn't there for

70
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:07,488
identification at the time so they

71
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:11,869
started to notice that a lot of these

72
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:14,360
scented solvent like compounds also had

73
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,659
sweet and aromatic pleasing smell this

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,670
is about 1955 since then the term

75
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:21,180
aromatic chemistry has been repurposed

76
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:23,369
and it doesn't actually mean

77
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,799
something that's sin but it means that

78
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:30,539
it is has a certain structure so just an

79
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,129
important note when it comes to

80
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:33,688
essential oils just because you hear

81
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:37,649
that something is aromatic doesn't mean

82
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:39,810
that necessarily bad smell Terk so their

83
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,459
aromatic hydrocarbons either carbons

84
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,750
means that it's made out of an

85
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,079
arrangement of hydrogen and carbon

86
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,789
molecules be a majority of micro carbons

87
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:50,250
that are found in earth naturally

88
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:52,229
occurring crude oil and this is because

89
00:03:50,250 --> 00:04:00,959
decomposed organic plant material

90
00:03:52,229 --> 00:04:02,699
basically in these and there's an

91
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,620
abundance of hydrogen carbon that can be

92
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:08,219
formed into all sorts of Airy shapes and

93
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,658
chants and then like I said the final

94
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:13,098
part of that definition is that they're

95
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:16,159
made of an ice cream and ice cream is a

96
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:18,569
building altar means are made of

97
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,340
classified by the number of units of

98
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:22,108
isoprene under made up which for

99
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,329
simplicity's sake you can just remember

100
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:28,529
means that it's a five carbon molecule

101
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:30,060
and if it's there's more it's heavier

102
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:31,948
and if it's heavier it means that it's

103
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,348
going to be less volatile it's going to

104
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:36,090
stay put you were to fill up some graphs

105
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:38,610
here but it's not going to necessarily

106
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:40,019
evaporate quickly so if it has it's a

107
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,509
lighter molecule it's gone

108
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,709
oxygen about already to complete it's a

109
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:45,418
heavier amount of fuel it's going to

110
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:50,038
stick around longer it also probably has

111
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:52,649
a scent that stick around longer so two

112
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:54,389
three terms three terms of everybody

113
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:57,549
probably should be

114
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:59,229
monoterpene monoterpene makes up the

115
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,040
majority of the terpenes that we're all

116
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:04,000
familiar with

117
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,250
I mean limonene piercing will go kind of

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,279
it's more just a moment but those are

119
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,860
all monitor beats they are 10 carbon

120
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,659
atoms it's a little bit confusing money

121
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,870
I think one but just remember in this

122
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,730
case mono means to assess perturb use

123
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,300
which are made up of breathe and are

124
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:24,250
slightly heavier these different care

125
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,800
for these different classes of terpenes

126
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,449
have different characteristics

127
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,530
monoterpenes tend to be antimicrobial

128
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:34,149
and antibacterial whereas for instance a

129
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:37,539
lot of suspects her penis being another

130
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:41,189
heavier have properties more along black

131
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:44,500
music pain relieving anti-inflammatory

132
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:46,209
and the third term just to kind of put

133
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,680
into perspective how many things in the

134
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:50,139
world are terpenes there's been about

135
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,470
50,000 identified but rather than actual

136
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:55,810
interview like I said so if monitor

137
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:59,830
means are two units and Sussman terpenes

138
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,389
our research units rubber is any variety

139
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:03,039
of proteins that have more than a

140
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:12,669
hundred units of ice cream

141
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:15,640
so just so what an aromatherapist might

142
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:17,650
say about what intermediates yeah and

143
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,199
I've also loved in as consumers into

144
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:21,339
this aromatherapies the practice of

145
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,709
using aromatics

146
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:26,439
volatile plant oils for psychological

147
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:28,500
and physical well-being keep in mind one

148
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,420
one more time

149
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,610
and aromatic doesn't mean that it

150
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,199
necessarily is actually incentive it's

151
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,900
more along the lines of what the

152
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,269
chemical structure says so there's quite

153
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,279
a few more chemicals than we might think

154
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:42,779
as an aroma therapist might say

155
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,029
scorpions are the building blocks that

156
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,709
collectively come together to form the

157
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:50,279
essential oils that so many of us are

158
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:53,909
jointly and just two quick examples

159
00:06:50,279 --> 00:07:09,299
little wolf is found in lavender about

160
00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:17,730
33% acetate and then from the largest

161
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:19,410
list that I've seen there's 38 to bat

162
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:24,919
and that kind of seems like to be the

163
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:24,919
rule of thumb when it comes to the oil

164
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:32,009
whether it's cannabis or its or it's

165
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:33,540
Hanks or herbal preparation seems like

166
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:35,639
there's a couple outliers that really

167
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,819
define the sample and then there's a

168
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,610
multitude of small just as important if

169
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:44,189
not more important a lot of cases

170
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,870
components that really add that the

171
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:47,728
other thing that I'll just kind of off

172
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:52,050
the cuff mention is limiting which can

173
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:53,310
make up to half of lemon oil and I think

174
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,240
a lot of us are familiar with that it's

175
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,399
used in all sorts of different

176
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,400
commercial products like Google fast

177
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:03,179
orange any really sort of orange or

178
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,918
citrus scented commercial product so

179
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,939
being that turkeys make up such a large

180
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,379
portion of the

181
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:11,910
oils and our aromatics as well

182
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:14,279
cannabinoids as I said a moment ago is

183
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:17,100
also found in that same price they are

184
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:19,379
aromatic compound so really that makes

185
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:22,350
cannabis use aromatherapy by definition

186
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:26,639
we're using aromatic plant oils for our

187
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:29,550
psychological and physical well-being so

188
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,620
I don't really think that most of us

189
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,409
think of ourselves as practising around

190
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,729
apparently you know probably all of you

191
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,250
cannabis needs a little bit different

192
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,410
but I think we should really all add

193
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,769
this to our toolbox to be able to say

194
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,480
let's go have some aromatherapy rather

195
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:47,069
than say let's go stand in a circle up

196
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:53,789
front or whatever version of that you

197
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:55,410
want to say it's really acknowledging

198
00:08:53,789 --> 00:09:02,699
the fact of what we do should be

199
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:08,309
normalized that it's not it's not

200
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:09,900
druggies so generally I think most

201
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:12,299
people at least if you were like me

202
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:15,809
maybe three or four years ago you think

203
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:18,479
of aromatherapy and I thought he will

204
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:20,279
inhaling the scented candles or plant

205
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,139
oils without a protocol that without a

206
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:25,079
methodology really just relying on what

207
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:27,600
feels good and that's what cannabis

208
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,030
abuse is mostly in our culture today

209
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,019
people consume enough until they feel

210
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:36,389
good sometimes you go too far but mostly

211
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,829
there's not really at least for myself

212
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:40,409
until recently there's not much about

213
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:44,930
protocol or how we consume something

214
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:46,338
this that's not entirely because data

215
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:48,888
there hasn't been a label on our

216
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:52,069
packaging that says these chemicals are

217
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:53,749
in this in this sample and based on any

218
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:55,639
other than I can look at it based on

219
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:57,980
what I know I could say oh I better stop

220
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:02,808
after one or that that hasn't been

221
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,730
available but it is coming so I'd like

222
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:15,379
to point out that with in aromatherapy

223
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:18,110
which has been used for its ink until

224
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:20,629
about three decades ago there would be

225
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:24,230
any sort of peer-reviewed research that

226
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:26,899
shows that aromatherapy practice with

227
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:30,139
Orion or reason can have great patient

228
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:31,369
outcomes and I just really want to

229
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:36,278
encourage everybody in this room to

230
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:36,278
really look at that we're getting there

231
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,869
we're going to get to standardized

232
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:48,110
results and that's something that I'm

233
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:50,540
extremely happy about it's one thing to

234
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:53,269
I don't want to take away the crap

235
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:55,370
cannabis I don't want that kind of side

236
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:57,169
of things that disappear but for people

237
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,240
that are seeking relief I think the

238
00:10:57,169 --> 00:11:02,149
ability to really identify what it is

239
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,100
that they're consuming and come back to

240
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:06,528
that and purchase it and use it

241
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:11,778
consistently is the next evolution for

242
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:13,519
us we especially to grow to grow as a as

243
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:15,078
a body of people that are that are using

244
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,178
this sort of medicine and really promote

245
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:18,409
it I think that for us to reach the

246
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:34,428
greatest number of people we have to

247
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:36,048
give duplicate results so finally in

248
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:38,659
this section here we're gonna look at

249
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:40,610
what like a botanical you wanna stir

250
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:44,419
beans are what what a biologist might

251
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:47,089
say and terbium is a biological molecule

252
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:48,948
sorry organic molecule that produced by

253
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:51,679
living organisms in order to communicate

254
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:53,628
with the world around them they are not

255
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:56,600
produced in cannabis for instance just

256
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:58,730
because I like Angela's not they're not

257
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,709
there for that they have very specific

258
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:05,509
roles they are their part they are

259
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:07,849
manufactured within plants in order to

260
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:11,870
adapt with the world around them they

261
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:13,610
certain varieties have progeny and in

262
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,068
parts of the world where there is a

263
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:19,459
deserving microbial correct there's a

264
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:22,490
certain fungal spread and because of

265
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:25,039
this the plant has over time developed

266
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,318
the ability to thrive because of the

267
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,480
essential oil content serving content

268
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:32,688
that's fun in that plan

269
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,308
turkeys are found in just about every

270
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:36,849
living organism organism like I said

271
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:39,078
that includes plants algae fungus

272
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,678
mammals and very brilliant vertebrates

273
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:47,418
and reptiles there's been over 50,000

274
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:50,120
the 15,000 of them isolated and I

275
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:50,879
through google searching and asking out

276
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,620
and thank you

277
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,299
two different university professors that

278
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,620
have specialized with intervenes in

279
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:57,240
organic chemistry

280
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,909
have not been able to identify a living

281
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,509
organism in this house to stay there

282
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:04,620
even during all of us and that's because

283
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:06,059
turkeys are part of the class of

284
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,310
chemicals some of their produced by

285
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:13,199
living organisms known as hormone

286
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:15,149
experiments they are to kind of define

287
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,550
those returns real quick a hormone is a

288
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:21,090
chemical which communicates within an

289
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:22,949
organism and a pheromone is a chemical

290
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:26,879
which communicates with other organisms

291
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:29,820
so you know the Musk that humans create

292
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:32,240
the scent that all sorts of variety of

293
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,040
mammals leave behind in your yard

294
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,899
those are pheromones and they are

295
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,269
they're potentially containing circuits

296
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:41,279
in a recent Journal article by the

297
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:44,100
Netherlands Institute of ecology it was

298
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,529
claimed that serve uses is the most

299
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:51,210
widely spoken language on the planet and

300
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:54,120
that's because microbial creatures and

301
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,680
concrete and fungus were found to be

302
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,679
communicating with one another for

303
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,839
germane interaction and that's really

304
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:04,079
beautiful picture of what tributes are

305
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,450
are actually for the world I think that

306
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,860
being organic living biological

307
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,620
creatures were fortunate to be able to

308
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:14,070
take advantage of the fact that we can

309
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,690
go and extract or harvest terpenes from

310
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,230
all sorts of plants that really use them

311
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,600
to our benefit but at the end of the day

312
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,159
none of us would be here without

313
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,310
terpenes and none of the bulliest or the

314
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:27,068
fauna that we really

315
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:32,169
and get you enjoy as members of this

316
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:33,669
world would be here without so when it

317
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:36,219
comes to cannabis Turkey exact

318
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:38,139
experiments in various ways and I'm

319
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,759
sorry in obvious ways and likely as

320
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:45,068
formulas as well though I'm not only

321
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:47,649
familiar those side of cannabis I'm

322
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:50,438
familiar with what they do externally

323
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:51,429
and communicating with other things so

324
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:53,409
their merits and they communicate

325
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:56,198
externally and they're used as and

326
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:57,759
defense agent primarily their producing

327
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,859
the greatest value to the trichome notes

328
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,159
although they are found in the breath

329
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,870
and the stems and leaves and they

330
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:07,328
specifically do things like to thank

331
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:10,058
books from creditors small microbial

332
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:11,739
threats or insects are not able to

333
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:13,389
tolerate your being the same level that

334
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,680
we are they they have solid link

335
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:18,938
properties and they probably most of you

336
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,008
aren't like me but I've overdone it

337
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:23,078
orally or another pretty bad chemical

338
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:24,909
burn in my mouth and I can only imagine

339
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:26,588
that that's what happens to some sort of

340
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:31,480
light that's munching down on the wrong

341
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:34,329
plant for instance they also primarily I

342
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,730
think especially you guys are very

343
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:38,909
familiar with this the right turning

344
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:41,620
content can make all the difference in

345
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:43,448
fighting off a fungal or bacterial

346
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,299
infection you know your powdery mildew

347
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:47,740
certain varieties do very well it's not

348
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:49,269
just the terpenes obviously is the

349
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,960
structure and morphology of the plant

350
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:53,509
foot the right chemical

351
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:57,950
the right environment really does make

352
00:15:53,509 --> 00:16:02,480
all the difference so in the evolution

353
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:05,600
of terpenes it's obvious that Pleasant

354
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,840
smells also have have a benefit that

355
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,840
what that really is is that the

356
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,840
predators of herbivores are drawn in by

357
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,740
these Pleasant smells and early humans

358
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,060
is surmised by Robert Clark actually

359
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,529
were brought to the plants and shown

360
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:23,989
that they were special because of the

361
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:26,750
scents in the beautiful flowers and

362
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:30,320
because the turbines also make the

363
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:32,120
flowers rather unpleasant to consume we

364
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,730
left them alone but we admire them and

365
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,370
our presence can't wait

366
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:39,500
other mammals that might interfere with

367
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,899
those plants and because the plant

368
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,309
really isn't usable to an early human

369
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:46,059
until the seeds have been produced

370
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:49,399
we were Co contributors in allowing

371
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:53,659
these plants to run their lifecycle to

372
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:55,429
be pollinated and to progeny seeds so

373
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:57,199
they completed their mission and then

374
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:58,879
we've even helped them by picking those

375
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,150
thrashing them against the ground

376
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,649
allowing some of them spread and it's

377
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:05,240
you know a lot of that had to do with

378
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:08,059
the pleasant smells that these plants

379
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,529
have so kind of one picture and I think

380
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:13,099
at a level that most of us can

381
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:15,019
understand terpenes really as far as the

382
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:19,549
lifecycle of cannabis have contributed

383
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:20,970
to the evolution that it seemed so I've

384
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:24,490
read the

385
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:27,788
so what one thing that I think is

386
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:30,940
notable for Kansas consumers is that the

387
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:33,609
when were consuming cannabis we're not

388
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,350
really getting it as Peter being content

389
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:38,740
because that plan does not produce

390
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:41,558
turkey and spring use after its diet as

391
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,960
new uses for them so really about ninety

392
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:45,668
percent of the way through flour really

393
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,440
you're introduced to the most beautiful

394
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:51,909
aroma at candis's able to produce

395
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,600
because that plant is screaming to be

396
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:54,520
minded

397
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:56,918
you know it's secreting the most amount

398
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:59,679
of resin so they can capture so the ball

399
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:02,950
a so they can pull moisture but also so

400
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,960
that I can capture some collagen bring

401
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,298
it itself in and produce those seeds and

402
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,100
that's what it's trying to do the most

403
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:13,389
amount of terpenes because it's trying

404
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:15,778
to it's trying to prevent itself late in

405
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,919
season from molding or becoming

406
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:27,759
susceptible to some sort of other

407
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:29,620
invasive so I just I think a lot of you

408
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,269
who probably went into a grow room right

409
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:32,589
after your rights and switched on and

410
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,490
experience this you know you get in

411
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:37,000
there it's kind of

412
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:39,308
earthy scented the lights come on 70

413
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,750
degrees hits things start to volatilize

414
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:43,178
right around there you get the all the

415
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,648
paintings burst balloon Rises you start

416
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:46,750
getting into some of the citrus notes

417
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:48,729
and keep going I might get into some of

418
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:53,589
the earthy tones but very awfully and

419
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:56,099
things of that nature meaning and the

420
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:58,538
same thing will be set outside in

421
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:00,189
hillside and outside bro you go from

422
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,750
those cool mornings when you're out

423
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,659
dragging lines to get water in the

424
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:09,210
ground and then as it warms up you go

425
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:13,179
from the cooler the morning to be to the

426
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:16,269
oral at citrusy in a tiny sense I think

427
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:18,429
that that's a big part as to why growing

428
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:19,869
cannabis is so therapeutic we're in the

429
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:22,090
room with these plants that are

430
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:24,548
respirating chemicals levels that are

431
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:27,398
definitely detectable and definitely

432
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:29,740
therapeutic it is way that putting

433
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:33,609
essential oils in them to be diffuser in

434
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:35,890
the back room twist them in this I know

435
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:37,359
from experience and putting them into a

436
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,190
room like this it really allows people

437
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:45,038
to loosen up and become a little exudate

438
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:47,019
and the space where anxiety kind of

439
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:48,788
melts in you know obviously we all come

440
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,038
from these that were different before

441
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:54,220
this but I really like to think that we

442
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:58,859
were consuming the same essence we

443
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,860
really starts us get into a vibe

444
00:19:59,528 --> 00:20:05,288
so that's kind of what I how I would say

445
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,820
that there's three different fields that

446
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:08,919
really contain the terpenes that were

447
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:10,500
probably interested in we've got a

448
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,500
biological mechanical

449
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,869
I look we've got a chemical outlook and

450
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,329
we've got a aromatherapy and cannabis

451
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:20,250
outlook I think I'm a little bit better

452
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:21,779
answering specific questions on that so

453
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,369
afterwards I think we have any questions

454
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:25,649
that we move down those paths I never

455
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:27,599
invite them what I'd like to move on to

456
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,340
right now is the extraction of terpenes

457
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,159
however getting them out of the plants

458
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:34,589
and kind of then we'll go into what to

459
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,050
do with them so turkeys are extracted by

460
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:40,559
a few different methods right now it's

461
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:45,589
primarily done through the reduced

462
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:51,149
elation of a central way or through the

463
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:53,490
use of food refuse like for instance the

464
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:56,030
greatest amount of limiting comes out of

465
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,410
the refuse from orange juice factories

466
00:20:56,029 --> 00:21:01,049
they're cold they're cold-pressed

467
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:05,070
through the process called expression

468
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:06,509
basically a spike that presses and it's

469
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:08,789
really the only turkey that's done like

470
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:12,930
this and it made me start to think

471
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:15,930
recently about how rosin is is a very

472
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:18,180
unique aromatic preparation because

473
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,610
there's not very many plants that are

474
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,860
produced under under pressure for

475
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:24,599
certain rather everything aromatic oils

476
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:27,990
that are produced under the expression

477
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:29,699
technique and the use of pressure in

478
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:34,019
this in this regard just is unique so

479
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:36,029
just as just doesn't thought or kind of

480
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:39,089
looking into why that particular

481
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:40,920
preparation is unique all these other

482
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,480
processes we're going to go would say

483
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,740
the next one is steam distillation I

484
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,640
think most of you are probably familiar

485
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,079
that basically taking a flask you're

486
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,970
filling with water you're putting plant

487
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:55,019
material above it the water is passing

488
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:56,670
through it and it's it's not actually

489
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:58,289
dissolving the terpenes

490
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:01,890
because they're oils they're hydrophobic

491
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:02,668
it's actually it's creating pressure

492
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,940
which is

493
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:07,528
lifting them off of the plant materials

494
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,808
and then it's going through a cooling

495
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:12,509
chamber where it then read condenses

496
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:15,989
into the liquid all down and the water

497
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:18,089
has separated there is solvent

498
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:21,269
extraction which produces products known

499
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:23,099
as absolutes and basically this is the

500
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:24,569
process that most of us familiar with if

501
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:27,689
you're making if you're after you're

502
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:29,788
hanging you've been a natural oil or co2

503
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:33,929
is kind of on the edge and its own thing

504
00:22:29,788 --> 00:22:38,368
but butane propane ethanol these are all

505
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:40,559
producing absolutes and basically it's a

506
00:22:38,368 --> 00:22:41,788
process where you're washing plant

507
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,829
material lot of us are familiar with

508
00:22:41,788 --> 00:22:46,378
that and then you've got to remove that

509
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:50,368
solvent from the final liquid and what's

510
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:52,079
left over is a different version

511
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,608
instance you know it's not the same

512
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,528
thing as an essential oil which is only

513
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:57,749
the youth it's mad we can't live didn't

514
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:59,669
turn me about the plant its got further

515
00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:01,618
phytochemicals that are in there and I

516
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:03,330
think it's our assumption the cannabis

517
00:23:01,618 --> 00:23:06,028
community just think oh there's there's

518
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:08,460
more phytochemicals that must mean that

519
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:11,038
it's better medicine not necessarily the

520
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:14,369
case absolute primary generally are not

521
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:17,009
used for consumable products just

522
00:23:14,368 --> 00:23:21,658
because they can't have leftover

523
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:25,679
solvents in them and it's it's it's just

524
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:27,929
not quite as messes and then what my

525
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,309
company primarily relies on is backing

526
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:34,200
this delicious which is very similar to

527
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:36,089
steam distillation but we're doing it at

528
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,649
lower temperatures and under vacuum oh

529
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:39,928
so you're taking that same last where

530
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:42,148
and you're putting it under vacuum

531
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:43,889
you're suddenly after the atmosphere out

532
00:23:42,148 --> 00:23:45,168
of it through removing the oxygen so

533
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:48,000
that the boiling temperatures go down

534
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:50,730
because these are volatile chemicals

535
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,490
both than the heat they expand when they

536
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:55,710
expand when they come back the molecule

537
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,299
is distorted it might begin to oxidize

538
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,829
there's a variety of different chemical

539
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,349
reactions that happen depending on what

540
00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:03,419
were working with and what the vacuum

541
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:05,159
distillation allows you to do is to use

542
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,810
less energy just to distort that

543
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:13,310
molecule less in order to get it to

544
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:16,109
travel up that path come back down and

545
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:19,009
then I was actually a surprise with mass

546
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:21,269
nobody tonight who does this method of

547
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:23,549
turning or rather an essential oil

548
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:25,170
extraction it's not primarily used in

549
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:26,519
terpenes but it is used in essential

550
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:28,230
oils and I think would just be good for

551
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:30,240
everybody to know how far we come I

552
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,579
actually think of vacuum distillation

553
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,180
often it's like space necessary because

554
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:38,039
we are removing the atmosphere we're

555
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,660
literally doing an experiment that could

556
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,559
not be done on the surface of Earth

557
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:45,300
without that pumps and highly advanced

558
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,099
equipment invested so that the original

559
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:51,750
form of the extraction was actually hot

560
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:53,039
for us which is taking which I might get

561
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,859
corrected every business evening which

562
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,019
is taking animal fats flavoring plant

563
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:01,319
material in them and because it because

564
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:04,920
terpenes are limits because the animal

565
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:07,200
fat you're able to get intervenes to

566
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,450
dissolve into the animal bath and then

567
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,910
basically just continually continually

568
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:14,309
layer layers of plant material by

569
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:19,259
replacing it and kind of give this this

570
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:22,169
rich fatty essential oil preparation

571
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:28,170
yeah it's not something that I

572
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:29,410
particularly find it's not something I

573
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,600
would necessarily

574
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:33,610
you see life but it is just kind of a

575
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,669
picture you know people did whatever

576
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:39,509
they could at beginning of kind of

577
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:43,029
modern era of getting these oils into a

578
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:46,690
format and they found that that fat

579
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:49,029
would do it and it was worth so I kind

580
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:52,299
of touched on what my company does that

581
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:55,539
we create a quick rundown on what that

582
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:58,839
looks like we will take it as simple of

583
00:25:55,539 --> 00:26:01,599
particular interest and we will send it

584
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:04,359
to a canvas lab if we're trying to get a

585
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:06,490
quick result or we will send a tan for

586
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:09,219
me and left they work with the company

587
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:11,079
that's at the University of Indiana

588
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,160
actually was founded them then they kind

589
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:14,230
of separated this bunch of guys from

590
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:18,820
there then they separated out started a

591
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:21,339
company and because their human lab and

592
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:24,220
they built this specific library for

593
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:27,579
their GCMs gas chromatography mass

594
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:31,299
spectrometry they are able to identify

595
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:32,679
more individuals than any other lab in

596
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,129
America and maybe the world at this

597
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,350
point

598
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:38,730
and that's good because more data allows

599
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:38,730
us to get closer to a profile

600
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:57,089
yeah and niceness so-and-so will

601
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:59,939
basically send it off for a report and

602
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:02,159
they basically sent us back a recipe it

603
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:09,410
says in this sample of oil that you

604
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:11,070
mailed to us we have down the list

605
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:13,529
generally we're getting somewhere

606
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:14,970
between fifteen eighty hits from this

607
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:17,730
particular lab there's a lab in

608
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:20,640
Vancouver Canada that's able to do over

609
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,919
250 but it's extremely expensive

610
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,549
processing you've got wait why am I

611
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:28,080
getting so with that data we don't even

612
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:29,970
have a lot of components to actually be

613
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,308
able to redo it so any things to be

614
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,929
about the ones that I actually see it's

615
00:27:32,308 --> 00:27:37,319
giving us a lot of great results that

616
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:39,690
are also kind of cost effective energy

617
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:41,970
state market so we're getting this

618
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,910
recipe we take from our isolated stock

619
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:47,539
intervenes we've rebuilt the profile

620
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:49,740
it takes some because we're not

621
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:51,210
identically replicating the process it

622
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,569
takes some trial and error to actually

623
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:56,850
be able to produce something that we can

624
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:59,339
sell out into the market that's you or

625
00:27:56,849 --> 00:28:01,019
myself or anybody could take add to

626
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:03,269
distillate add the CEO to you and get a

627
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:04,168
product I think like we provide a recipe

628
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:05,940
for

629
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:08,669
profile as to how much you should use

630
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:14,190
them in concentration pretty

631
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:16,169
straightforward so the application of

632
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:19,710
terpenes and product development like I

633
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:21,090
said there's there's taking trip

634
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,850
products that are devoid of terpenes

635
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:27,028
like distillate reintroducing a profile

636
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:28,498
of your favorite of your choice what we

637
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:30,329
really encourage people to do and what

638
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:32,970
we work off those whenever were able to

639
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:34,618
with those canvas lab samples is we try

640
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:37,440
to reproduce the flower grow bottle

641
00:28:34,618 --> 00:28:41,668
rather than the profile and extract or a

642
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,859
distillation specifically because in you

643
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:47,159
know my experience in cannabis medically

644
00:28:43,858 --> 00:29:00,808
in kind of an overwhelming majority on

645
00:28:47,159 --> 00:29:02,519
the community obviously this is exactly

646
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:06,118
exactly so they wanted and they wanted

647
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:14,069
you to say exactly but you can't really

648
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:17,388
get flowers so we really try to recreate

649
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:20,069
the profiles as if I'm a flower and then

650
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:22,019
because of that it gives people the

651
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:24,049
ability to concentrate it and they like

652
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:26,700
to think it needs more

653
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:35,519
double up you'd be closer to an extract

654
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:37,860
for a bottle in a row so I kind of

655
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,660
making a quick shift here I want to just

656
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,089
point out a couple things that people

657
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,170
could do at home pretty easily all the

658
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:45,750
components that I'm going to talk about

659
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:47,279
are available on our website you give me

660
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:53,970
a call and said we're here I'll give you

661
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:55,710
a real good deal experience it so addict

662
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,089
terpenes first two aromatherapy diffuser

663
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,980
Zhai think is one of the easiest things

664
00:29:57,089 --> 00:30:01,889
that you can do at her business or at

665
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,740
home we put them in our accuser every

666
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:06,780
night before we go to bed and you know

667
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,059
if you think about it a lot of these a

668
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:10,470
lot of these compounds have all of these

669
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:13,440
visual properties that were suggesting

670
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:18,390
or anti-inflammatory they are bacteria

671
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:20,430
like Romeo there by fungal and it's it's

672
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,470
my thought that getting them in our

673
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:25,620
environment frequently can lead to

674
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:27,329
better basically putting something

675
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:30,209
that's antibacterial into the air in

676
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:32,879
your bedroom you know what does that do

677
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:35,130
overtime to your he'll never lose that

678
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,240
sort of thing so aromatherapy diffuser

679
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:41,370
'he's extremely easy to use one of my

680
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,259
favorite things to do is to take beta

681
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:47,399
terry awfully medicare at Leena's the

682
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:49,740
terpene that is in black peppercorns and

683
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:53,220
cloves primarily it's a success which

684
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,839
hurt me and it's heavy it's spicy and I

685
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:58,350
like to combine it with olive oil or

686
00:30:54,839 --> 00:31:01,139
coconut oil in either a one-to-one all

687
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:02,939
the way up to like one one part baby

688
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,009
periodically five parts olive oil

689
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:10,570
formulations kind of

690
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:12,150
is the most rapidly anti-inflammatory

691
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:14,740
substance that I've ever encountered

692
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,870
I've read things that say it's 300 times

693
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,120
more anti-inflammatory the traffic

694
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:21,429
aspirin I didn't come up with this I

695
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:24,539
actually have Asia out of Texas the

696
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:26,380
gentleman that has he's a quadriplegic

697
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:27,909
basically said you know over the last

698
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:32,020
thirty years I've used every single

699
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:34,570
available topical treatment to work on

700
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:36,849
the phantom limb pains that I that I

701
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:38,409
deal with and nothing has ever worked

702
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:40,029
for me there's that nothing as you know

703
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,519
things that have worked I've taken time

704
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:44,589
and he said basically from about two

705
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:47,710
minutes in from using the substance he

706
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:50,379
was he went from having like a knife

707
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:52,509
digging through his skin to really just

708
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,310
being needed healing healing just

709
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:56,589
pressure but not the feeling pain and

710
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:58,450
uses it still to this day give him a

711
00:31:56,589 --> 00:32:01,569
really good deal kind of just to keep up

712
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:03,940
with us and giving us feedback on it but

713
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:05,099
it's a very easy preparation is one of

714
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,110
the early things that I

715
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:11,369
we first met that I think really

716
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:13,558
impressed him another thing that I hear

717
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:17,609
from a lot of our clients is using

718
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:20,279
limiting or per gastro esophageal reflux

719
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:22,349
disease or you know basically you're

720
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:27,509
calming your Commons acid reflux or

721
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:29,459
indigestion it is pretty simple but I've

722
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:30,750
been told by people again I'm not a

723
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,210
health care professional but what I've

724
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:36,329
been told by people is three five drops

725
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:41,579
add to a glass of water consumed before

726
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:52,558
a meal and then basically it's people

727
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:54,000
are placing another thing that a lot of

728
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,158
people are using right now that I find

729
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,679
an interest is they're using geranium

730
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,929
which is if you wanted to take a common

731
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,460
phrase rephrase it you would say take

732
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:05,309
time in life to stop and smell the

733
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:09,620
cranial it's the primary serving that's

734
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:12,629
funny roses this substance is being used

735
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:13,949
diluted in water and sprayed on golf

736
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:17,159
courses in Florida right now

737
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:19,798
one of my largest clients as a specific

738
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:24,270
pesticide to keep insects off of the

739
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:28,440
greens I don't I've looked at so there's

740
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:30,150
a couple of set asides that are made for

741
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:34,409
the Kansas industry right now that are

742
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:35,880
using turbines and all of them have to

743
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:37,320
raining all this to disturb my merry

744
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,490
active degree

745
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:42,329
so that would give that for people

746
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:44,759
looking to and then kind of going back

747
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:47,759
to limiting what a lot of people use it

748
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,710
for as I mentioned earlier is or

749
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,720
increasing things whether that's

750
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,640
cleaning the kitchen or their hands

751
00:33:51,720 --> 00:34:00,000
after doing some auto where that sort of

752
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:05,850
thing a organic means moving by itself

753
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:10,159
uncut is one thing that you want to make

754
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:13,589
everybody aware of is that limiting is

755
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,899
photosynthesize since tighten it so if

756
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:18,480
you are putting it on your skin directly

757
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:20,880
and I would really highly advise

758
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,909
avoiding the Sun right because you can

759
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:27,360
get burnt very very easy it enhances the

760
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:31,399
effects of UV and formatic we got very

761
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:36,690
very severe burst of someone be careful

762
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:40,639
sure alright so fun time I'm going to

763
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:40,639
ask Shane going to be again here right

764
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:03,320
whether it's showing people your kit or

765
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:12,019
just having acknowledged really identify

766
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:14,420
things I'm gonna share just real briefly

767
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:15,860
usually this is we have attendance what

768
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,269
published literature and my own

769
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,519
experience to say about each one of

770
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:31,940
these terpenes and basically I'd like

771
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:33,409
you to take it out to know about

772
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,570
business these are the terms that are

773
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:37,789
taught in the greatest quality but they

774
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:40,370
are not necessarily the terpenes that

775
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:43,119
contribute the most amount of smelt and

776
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:45,349
he's one particular strength so the

777
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,139
example that I would use as my company

778
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:50,869
makes a blue cheese replica it doesn't

779
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:53,629
smell and as an adverb you can call the

780
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:56,329
next America has this absolutely acid is

781
00:35:53,630 --> 00:36:00,530
less than a tenth of a percent less than

782
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:02,029
100 percent the entire profile but it is

783
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:04,250
overwhelming and the first thing that

784
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:07,720
will smell another Turkey is similar to

785
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:10,349
that metal door cabinet which is mystery

786
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:14,998
and

787
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:16,798
so keep in mind small small bodies can

788
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:19,468
have great dramatic effects and they

789
00:36:16,798 --> 00:36:22,139
also contribute greatly to the actual

790
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:30,329
therapeutic effects so when it comes to

791
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:33,358
meetings more is not everything I sell

792
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:36,209
food great so we'll start with your seat

793
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:42,659
it's gonna have an orange label on and

794
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:48,358
I'm going to so you're seeing as a

795
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:50,759
monitor view it is 13 to 20 feet it's an

796
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:54,838
aroma that is suggestive of hops and

797
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:56,759
clothes and proper vetting its regular

798
00:36:54,838 --> 00:37:02,940
botanical sources are hops

799
00:36:56,759 --> 00:37:06,449
I'm lemongrass basil and Bailey's it's

800
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:08,519
the most dominant turkey in common

801
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:11,068
circulating strains of cannabis and

802
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:13,288
that's partly due to as we all know many

803
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:15,389
of us know the drug war we require that

804
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:17,489
we drive up the THC in order to get the

805
00:37:15,389 --> 00:37:22,949
least amount of drugs out there the

806
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:25,440
greatest bang for their buck and steep

807
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:28,380
hill Labs defines any strength with over

808
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:35,278
0.5 percent by volume you're seen as an

809
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:37,199
industry and of anybody's titled it here

810
00:37:35,278 --> 00:37:40,349
but many people have been led to believe

811
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,900
that mangoes contain a large amount of

812
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:45,539
you're seeing a notable amount I found

813
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:49,048
analysis which goes over 20 varieties of

814
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:55,229
mangoes and they found one at most in

815
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:58,559
one 3.86 milligrams of Nursing whereas

816
00:37:55,228 --> 00:38:02,889
even middle-of-the-road varieties of

817
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:06,099
cannabis my two milligrams per gram

818
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:08,588
so what that's not to say that using

819
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:10,809
that mangoes don't get you higher but

820
00:38:08,588 --> 00:38:12,818
it's really probably more of an

821
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:15,278
entourage effect because there's quite a

822
00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:26,469
bit of terminally in mangoes there's

823
00:38:15,278 --> 00:38:29,139
also yeah so there's not your scene

824
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:32,558
mangoes its mangoes are an incredible

825
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:37,298
botanical source of variety turkeys so

826
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:39,309
the next one is going to be cycle day on

827
00:38:37,298 --> 00:38:41,170
the carpet I can see it you're seeing is

828
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:43,480
gonna reduce pain and inflammation it's

829
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:46,510
highly sedative right now my company's

830
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,858
playing around with a sleep aid that

831
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,690
isn't here than you're seeing

832
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:52,750
multiplying into the substance that

833
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,490
makes it much more by order I have not

834
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,989
next up we have a couple couple test

835
00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:59,098
subjects from the clinic that I met that

836
00:38:55,989 --> 00:39:01,778
suffer from severe pain and insomnia and

837
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:04,960
you can easily knock them all out you

838
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:07,829
don't wake up you don't wake up with any

839
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,519
sort of after lingering effects and it's

840
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:12,130
you know it's actually kind of

841
00:39:09,518 --> 00:39:13,358
pleasant-tasting SOI 6 also I've been

842
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:16,329
looking good there will be producing

843
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:17,949
something along those lines and just so

844
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:20,019
kind of look out with that it's also

845
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:23,038
who'd elevated just like most terpenes

846
00:39:20,018 --> 00:39:25,719
are the next let's go to be limiting

847
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:28,778
limiting is also a monitoring it should

848
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:31,838
be in there with a green label it is

849
00:39:28,778 --> 00:39:34,329
fresh and sweet and citrusy clean we've

850
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:37,690
all experienced mr. bean in our

851
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:38,859
household cleaners a lot of people are

852
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:41,440
quick to say

853
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:44,210
limiting as a solvent it's in hospital

854
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,250
consume I'm just saying that limonene is

855
00:39:44,210 --> 00:40:38,079
an incredible organic compound has a

856
00:39:46,250 --> 00:40:40,940
wide variety of uses primarily as well

857
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,210
because there's no evidence that shows

858
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:46,039
that it is a stimulant but it is against

859
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,690
clinic that reduces the anxiety and the

860
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:50,299
way that I really picture is that it

861
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:52,068
allows you to take all that energy that

862
00:40:50,298 --> 00:40:54,588
you would use on a stress or some of it

863
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:56,449
and you're you're not only saving that

864
00:40:54,588 --> 00:41:00,259
and here able to do that put it towards

865
00:40:56,449 --> 00:41:01,818
other life processes so it is mood

866
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:05,358
elevating and stress relieving its

867
00:41:01,818 --> 00:41:06,650
focusing and it's got a wide application

868
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:11,980
like I said

869
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:13,700
gastrointestinal or it's also having

870
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,358
anti-inflammatory it's been used to

871
00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:18,409
dissolve all stones political settings

872
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:20,088
there's a couple studies that show

873
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:23,748
outside of the human body that it

874
00:41:20,088 --> 00:41:27,199
destroys breast cancer cells and it

875
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:29,028
affects cell permeability so a presence

876
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:31,278
of beer scene allows other

877
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:33,798
phytochemicals to actually break through

878
00:41:31,278 --> 00:41:38,239
the blood-brain barrier and take effect

879
00:41:33,798 --> 00:41:45,858
at a greater dramatic next one

880
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:48,498
prevailing interview it's fresh neural

881
00:41:45,858 --> 00:41:53,150
is sweetened piney when I smell that

882
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:58,909
I've smelled like and it is sourced from

883
00:41:53,150 --> 00:42:01,818
Apple's human Lila tea tree and - it is

884
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:04,338
very popular in the United States refuse

885
00:42:01,818 --> 00:42:10,400
and flavors and fragrances is heavily

886
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:15,880
used in soaps and detergents the

887
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:18,470
permission to cancer cells as well it's

888
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,528
the state specifically suggest that my

889
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:22,998
down-regulating specific proteins

890
00:42:20,528 --> 00:42:26,539
terminally help slow the spread of

891
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:30,230
breast cancer it's scented and calming

892
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:31,489
and also an antioxidant and one quick

893
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,170
note that I just wanna make is that

894
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:34,119
there is quite a bit more information

895
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:37,090
about each one

896
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:39,130
on our website and also the things that

897
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:42,820
I'm saying about these are the textbook

898
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:45,760
answers now your anecdotal experience

899
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:54,160
and that's a realistic story that one

900
00:42:45,760 --> 00:43:03,220
particularly is from groceries next one

901
00:42:54,159 --> 00:43:05,469
we help is red label help ie is pretty

902
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:05,919
incredible it's definitely the top of my

903
00:43:05,469 --> 00:43:10,089
list

904
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,930
it's earthy plenty sharp flavor to it

905
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:15,940
it's sourced from coniferous trees

906
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:18,869
rosemary and sage it's also founded a

907
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,869
couple varieties of citrus

908
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,860
anti-inflammatory and acts as a

909
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,900
bronchodilator I think when I first

910
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:28,360
heard this I have five is silly but then

911
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,500
I've met so many people that use it you

912
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,240
know we've heard candles we've been

913
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:35,559
present and I think that it's the

914
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:39,399
strains high amounts of all tiny ivenna

915
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:41,829
created with that as far as

916
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,110
pharmacologically it's great when pain

917
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:45,819
inflammation it's one of the few

918
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:51,450
terpenes that has to do stimulant

919
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:51,450
properties it's also good for focusing

920
00:43:54,469 --> 00:43:57,529
[Music]

921
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:06,840
so our company is always done because

922
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:12,250
there really isn't any complaining whole

923
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:14,620
standalone isolated turkey we've always

924
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:17,099
looked at is what is the highest amount

925
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:27,969
that we could find in a gram of cannabis

926
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:31,089
so in the six that were looking at right

927
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:35,649
now but really say it's really were kind

928
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:37,930
of self-discovery I think the next one

929
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:39,250
is going to be baby carry ethylene so up

930
00:44:37,929 --> 00:44:41,349
until this point everything that we've

931
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,449
discussed has been a monoterpene baby

932
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:46,059
carry athlete as a secretary and just to

933
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:49,210
remind you that's a heavier molecules if

934
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:51,699
you were to you know the consistency of

935
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:53,920
all the ones that we felt up until now

936
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:56,049
you find that they're rather thin they

937
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,849
leave us like you can screw the top on

938
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:59,860
that doesn't have that vanilla top on

939
00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:03,150
that little cone inside of it and they

940
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:03,150
will leak their way out of it because

941
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:15,309
definitely each other in silicone most

942
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:19,960
herpes is oh don't be a baby really very

943
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:23,190
nice a light green label also that that

944
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:25,269
particular beam is sweet and spicy it's

945
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:29,599
actually sourced from black pepper

946
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:32,719
caraway clove Mouse basil oregano

947
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,619
it's notable because it's the only

948
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:38,009
biomechanoid that's found in nature

949
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:47,548
outside of the cannabis family it acts

950
00:45:38,009 --> 00:45:49,318
the cb2 receptors which i think many

951
00:45:47,548 --> 00:45:54,829
people have probably heard that black

952
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:58,438
pepper and cumin come together to make a

953
00:45:54,829 --> 00:46:00,630
new plant or a combination I think you

954
00:45:58,438 --> 00:46:04,848
mean you're expert right thing and

955
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:11,939
that's very often you coming together

956
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:13,699
create a synergistic powerful so bakery

957
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:17,268
awfully like a center they are massively

958
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:20,099
anti-inflammatory relatively safe or

959
00:46:17,268 --> 00:46:22,918
topical from everything that I've been

960
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:24,929
able to read and I used a lot of it's a

961
00:46:22,918 --> 00:46:26,308
plate so I would say that so far I

962
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:28,079
personally have a Kennedy negative

963
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:30,089
reacted with it obviously there are

964
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,528
applying oils Papa please you're gonna

965
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:33,599
want to put that on a very small portion

966
00:46:31,528 --> 00:46:34,858
of your skin wait to see what happens

967
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,949
for a couple days before you dive into

968
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:40,318
that and really you know with essential

969
00:46:37,949 --> 00:46:41,909
oils and mr. Bean's it's not so much a

970
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:43,349
single application that might get you

971
00:46:41,909 --> 00:46:45,689
but it's the application over the course

972
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:46,840
of maybe 30 days just make sure that

973
00:46:45,688 --> 00:46:49,210
you're not doing that

974
00:46:46,840 --> 00:47:26,890
definitely yourself time to observe what

975
00:46:49,210 --> 00:47:30,369
happens in their label lines they're

976
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:33,069
known to spend another kind of label

977
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:34,900
it's a model chirping it's floral

978
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:37,030
attempt got kind of a spicy sweet

979
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:39,610
overtone on it it's sourced from a

980
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:43,060
variety of plants primarily those the

981
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:46,300
mint family and then also baby and pours

982
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:58,210
lab near lilac and I said earlier little

983
00:47:46,300 --> 00:48:02,500
itself makes up the stimulus blacks the

984
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:05,679
stimulus that causes us pain under a

985
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:07,239
logical level studies have shown ins

986
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,879
have linked it to decreased depression

987
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:12,549
symptoms which is likely due to the fact

988
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:16,030
that amplifies serotonin receptor

989
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:19,480
transmission so it's got a pain and

990
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:21,740
depression kind of cover there which it

991
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:27,740
also touches on inflammation

992
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:31,789
as well as highly scented and that's the

993
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:33,618
kid I really want everybody to use it as

994
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:35,210
they let's see miss I'll survive with

995
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,010
device ready to take one of my cards off

996
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:41,840
the back and give me feedback

997
00:48:37,010 --> 00:49:05,320
how are you using on the website I'm

998
00:48:41,840 --> 00:49:05,320
working on a very similar building

[Music]

1002
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:47,338
so we take the connections so he said

1003
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:52,349
what is the relationship of Dean's

1004
00:49:47,338 --> 00:49:54,150
display the first thing I think is just

1005
00:49:52,349 --> 00:49:57,568
fascinating that I think we're all many

1006
00:49:54,150 --> 00:50:01,260
of us are Isleta that we think flavonoid

1007
00:49:57,568 --> 00:50:04,349
explain it but it's actually that black

1008
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:10,470
and white lattice is is Latin before

1009
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:13,079
yellow and it is the fact that that flat

1010
00:50:10,469 --> 00:50:15,568
interaction pigments that color plants

1011
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:17,068
and so it's not that flavonoids are so

1012
00:50:15,568 --> 00:50:18,900
much related with the flavor of things

1013
00:50:17,068 --> 00:50:20,818
they're just another classic white a

1014
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,309
chemical that's found a lot of plants

1015
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:25,529
contribute to all sorts of varieties of

1016
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:27,449
memory a therapeutic benefit but don't

1017
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:32,210
have any new flavor so it's not really

1018
00:50:27,449 --> 00:50:32,210
so much that being said

1019
00:50:46,719 --> 00:51:36,579
variety of different we were in there I

1020
00:51:15,588 --> 00:51:36,578
understand various ones get the last

[Music]

1022
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:20,059
just providing nice lips for kind of

1023
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:21,500
like starting then you move into the

1024
00:52:20,059 --> 00:52:23,900
profiles and I ask myself the same

1025
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:26,659
questions what I really came up with is

1026
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,980
people are making products they are they

1027
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:30,319
are in this marketplace right now

1028
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,699
they're taking THC digital era co3

1029
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,200
they're putting it into a big planet for

1030
00:52:31,699 --> 00:52:35,809
sylveon and they need to cut it

1031
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:38,599
something and if I don't sell them sure

1032
00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:40,130
beans and they're using maple they're

1033
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:44,360
using all sorts of varieties of

1034
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:47,030
propylene glycol MCT which has very

1035
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:49,579
little very little therapeutic value if

1036
00:52:47,030 --> 00:53:05,840
not detrimental value where's that so

1037
00:52:49,579 --> 00:53:08,389
really you're absolutely right you know

1038
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:12,059
we're talking about

1039
00:53:08,389 --> 00:53:13,529
some of the smaller smaller percentages

1040
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:15,719
are actually having a career request

1041
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:20,400
that suggested it's all based on the

1042
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:23,608
ratio of a draft so so you know also the

1043
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:26,729
ratio to entertain small animal reserve

1044
00:53:23,608 --> 00:53:31,920
that's order of magnitude complexity to

1045
00:53:26,728 --> 00:53:33,389
figure out how those things yeah so so

1046
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,608
we're talking to us incredibly

1047
00:53:33,389 --> 00:53:40,129
fascinating thank you but but you know

1048
00:53:35,608 --> 00:53:40,130
combining that with some of our global

1049
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:59,880
so yeah no I appreciate you is I think

1050
00:53:48,478 --> 00:54:02,308
one of the benefits of what we do I'm

1051
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:04,410
not an expert to make this determination

1052
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:07,829
but what I found fascinating for myself

1053
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:09,808
is learning above what the terpenes that

1054
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:17,009
we do have access to actually do to me

1055
00:54:09,809 --> 00:54:19,559
like having access to very op I need

1056
00:54:17,009 --> 00:54:21,539
opens up my lungs rapidly so that's

1057
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:23,700
something that we also really fixated on

1058
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:25,289
is learning how individual components

1059
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:26,489
affect you obviously like you said

1060
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:29,190
thickness on fragile there's the

1061
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:30,869
symphony and these minor components

1062
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:35,479
matter and that's really what we're in

1063
00:54:30,869 --> 00:54:35,479
the race to discover and one porous I

1064
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:41,270
will right now we work with everything

1065
00:54:38,659 --> 00:54:43,750
be natural but to really recreate

1066
00:54:41,269 --> 00:54:47,409
everything the material at least for us

1067
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:47,409
self-discovery purpose I think

1068
00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:02,849
later

1069
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:07,260
[Music]

1070
00:55:18,559 --> 00:56:01,619
there are people that are able to go in

1071
00:55:52,559 --> 00:56:04,079
the universities and we haven't be done

1072
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:06,630
Thank You quickness I wanted to support

1073
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,730
I think what you're saying what I hear

1074
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:11,660
you saying is you're producing products

1075
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:15,949
they're allowing people to

1076
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:18,889
they replicate which is an option for

1077
00:56:15,949 --> 00:56:20,919
medications right and that even though

1078
00:56:18,889 --> 00:56:25,219
you're distilling some of these certain

1079
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:27,798
complex whole plant formulations down to

1080
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:30,469
simpler combinations right much can be

1081
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:32,119
said for the benefit of using aspirin as

1082
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:35,328
opposed to creating a teacher or from

1083
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:37,099
willow bark baby aspirin works willow

1084
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:39,798
bark might work better for certain in

1085
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:41,390
certain situations but I guess my

1086
00:56:39,798 --> 00:56:42,588
question is so I think it's great kind

1087
00:56:41,389 --> 00:56:44,058
of closes what were you're doing since

1088
00:56:42,588 --> 00:56:46,429
and I think help that locations

1089
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:50,690
tremendously have that consistent

1090
00:56:46,429 --> 00:56:53,088
effective and reliable medication I am

1091
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:54,889
wondering how far along you guys are in

1092
00:56:53,088 --> 00:56:58,009
terms of determining whether some of

1093
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:59,989
them were limited combinations for

1094
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:01,910
specific applications when you say

1095
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:05,479
limited do you mean racing mountains

1096
00:57:01,909 --> 00:57:07,368
yeah well no like instead of 18 to make

1097
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,199
sure you know

1098
00:57:07,369 --> 00:57:10,910
oh so that how many we're putting into

1099
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:14,838
our blends basically yeah let's like

1100
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:17,679
whatever 30 to 50 up to right now so

1101
00:57:14,838 --> 00:57:21,909
right now we sell 23 different blends

1102
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:24,528
released another six next week and

1103
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:26,889
depending on which stream that was you

1104
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:26,889
know some

1105
00:57:30,889 --> 00:57:34,000
[Music]

1106
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:06,889
[Music]

1107
00:58:28,059 --> 00:58:48,489
to lend them I mean aromatherapy looks

1108
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:48,490
at holes

1109
00:58:58,099 --> 00:59:04,259
we come back better so listen I know we

1110
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:07,190
could do questions on like we really do

1111
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,190
to wrap up now thank you
