designing the future Jodi has been on

16
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,439
the forefront of highly efficient state

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,780
of the art cannabis grow facilities for

18
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:54,670
the last eight years he has designed

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,350
built and retrofitted well over a

20
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,059
million square feet for some of the

21
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,010
biggest licensed producers in the world

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,570
today he'll be talking about designing

23
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,619
the future of cannabis workshop

24
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:13,929
horticulture let's give it up for

25
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:17,679
joining this never had someone doing

26
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:18,539
welcome to Portland in to Expo my name

27
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:21,310
is Jerry Lucas

28
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:24,129
smart girl pros it's a company that I

29
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:27,599
put together a few years back and doing

30
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:30,310
design builds this was about 2009-2010

31
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,259
we specialize in everything from

32
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,879
greenfield projects which basically

33
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,950
means moving earth building new

34
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:40,449
structures or retrofits which is about

35
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:42,909
80% or 90% of the market efficiency is

36
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,539
our main focus and when we're designing

37
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:48,609
and building Green Grove facilities

38
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:53,189
designing the future is pretty much

39
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:53,189
basically kind of encompasses all that

40
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:59,060
the key to success in this industry is

41
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:01,670
designed built everything revolves

42
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,549
around a grow facility dispensaries

43
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,710
extraction facilities all these things

44
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:09,409
rely on a grow facility and if you don't

45
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:11,900
keep in mind and take notes and build a

46
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:14,209
highly efficient grow facility and a

47
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,640
market that's extremely volatile these

48
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:18,080
days you're gonna be out of business and

49
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,679
is happening in states that have been

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,450
online for five six years and even newer

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,480
states that are coming online the price

52
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:28,659
volatility is is real and it's affecting

53
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,738
businesses and people are shutting down

54
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:34,280
so there's a lot of opportunities when

55
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:36,590
it comes to doing these facilities you

56
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,789
know high capex is very costly to build

57
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,680
these things especially you're gonna

58
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:41,959
build it right there's always an idea

59
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,110
that hey we'll build it right now try to

60
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,500
be as cheap as possible cheap is not a

61
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,120
word that you can use in this industry

62
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,439
mentality is we'll build it get in start

63
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,259
earning revenue we'll take some of that

64
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:57,289
money and then we'll go ahead and we'll

65
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:59,389
modify or retrofit it doesn't happen it

66
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:01,069
just doesn't you know a lot of investors

67
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:02,119
that come into the space or guys that

68
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:04,400
are trying to start off with little

69
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,109
capital you know if you have one major

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,120
failure you're out of business number

71
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:09,980
one number two if your cost of goods are

72
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,530
too high you're gonna be out of business

73
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:15,828
so with that kind of mentality I've seen

74
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,329
it since 2008 2009 do it as cheap as

75
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:19,549
possible we'll take that and we'll make

76
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,280
that money we'll put it back in it

77
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:25,370
doesn't happen it just doesn't cost of

78
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,049
goods it goes in line with your capex

79
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,659
you know you've got to be able to

80
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,920
manufacture a low cost of good and if

81
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:32,239
you're not if you're growing an eight

82
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,518
hundred nine hundred thousand dollar

83
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,920
pounds you know you're filing bankruptcy

84
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,670
it's just the way it is you know prime

85
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:43,759
example in the state right now

86
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:45,889
sixty-five percent is a hard number of

87
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,679
licensees that have not applied for a

88
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:50,839
renewal next year 65 percent of

89
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,540
recreational licenses why because the

90
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,200
market dropped down to high-end eleven

91
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:58,348
or twelve hundred dollars for high-end

92
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,598
greenhouses are saying maybe 600 or 700

93
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:01,889
and there are some exceptions but we're

94
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:03,780
talking 80 percent of the market that's

95
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:05,339
growing all the same products and

96
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,199
growing mediocre stuff because they

97
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,629
don't have the facility set up right but

98
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,459
it's costing them a lot of money out of

99
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:15,000
business we're seeing the same thing in

100
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:20,840
Colorado same exact scenario you know

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,160
value engineering ve great word to use

102
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,918
because you have to be aware of what

103
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,570
we're spending money so well we'll get a

104
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,759
little more into the value engineering

105
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:31,290
aspect but there is you know a component

106
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,168
there that you need to pay attention to

107
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,460
just because something costs more than

108
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:36,899
anything else doesn't mean you should

109
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,329
buy it yeah one of my favorite sayings

110
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,620
is just because it's on sale doesn't

111
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:42,329
mean you should buy it it's the same

112
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,850
kind of deal you can spend money smart

113
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:49,589
and buy high-end equipment without

114
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,520
spending top dollar for it as well this

115
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,589
is the big one too successful

116
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,639
methodology for commercial space you

117
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,369
know there's a lot of different ways to

118
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,660
grow this at these plants some work

119
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,490
better than others but when you're in

120
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,560
the commercial space you have to be very

121
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,650
aware of cost and how you can do it

122
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,509
effectively and cost-effective and we'll

123
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:09,779
push a little bit more into that as we

124
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:13,079
move forward the market volatility

125
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:14,309
I touched briefly on that but I think

126
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,199
you know we're gonna see a lot of

127
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,668
movement from a federal aspect sooner

128
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,620
than later there's a lot of initiatives

129
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:22,019
that are happening especially now that

130
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,720
our administration is on board with

131
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,889
pushing things you know more into a

132
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,190
regulatory environment and

133
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:31,860
decriminalizing rescheduling if you're

134
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:34,019
gonna see that the word swing even more

135
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,580
vastly as states are allowed to

136
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,430
transport product back and forth and

137
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:40,168
we've seen what California can do

138
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,590
specifically from a black market

139
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:45,389
perspective I mean in one one year they

140
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:47,159
could drive the price down hundreds of

141
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,019
dollars from black market product we're

142
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,960
going across the state imagine when that

143
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:52,068
goes

144
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:55,218
it's gonna be it's gonna be a massive

145
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:57,979
blow for a lot of businesses so the

146
00:05:55,218 --> 00:06:00,288
first the first step of all of this to

147
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:03,318
build efficiency which is my favorite

148
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:05,658
word in this industry floor plans floor

149
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,400
plans are the baseline of everything you

150
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:09,829
know workflow needs to be kept in mind

151
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,598
and it needs to be very tight you know

152
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:14,688
labor is gonna be your most expensive

153
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:17,360
cost in these facilities and minimizing

154
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:19,310
you know links of walks and pass keeping

155
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,788
employees in a tight circle you know

156
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,860
believe it or not 15 cents here a dollar

157
00:06:22,788 --> 00:06:26,149
here all these things are going to

158
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,000
affect your bottom line it's going to

159
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:32,120
affect your cost you know bench of

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,098
London lighting layouts you know educate

161
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,569
yourself you know there are vendors

162
00:06:34,098 --> 00:06:37,399
there are companies that can help you

163
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,468
lay this stuff out don't try to build

164
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:42,408
benches on your own you know what ends

165
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:44,538
up happening you seen time and time

166
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:46,459
again what adventures were being bill

167
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:48,498
because they try to save some money then

168
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:50,329
they're failing all their tests because

169
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:52,069
there's mold and mildew that's growing

170
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:54,288
on the wood that's being absorbed from

171
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:55,550
water on the floor and those spores are

172
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:57,588
flying up the plane and on the plants

173
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,449
and a failing test and that's a problem

174
00:06:57,588 --> 00:07:02,778
you know what it's a good investment

175
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:05,028
spend the money fertigation management

176
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:06,978
very important as well there's a lot of

177
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:08,689
opportunities there to control your

178
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:12,168
recipes control nutrient cause water

179
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:14,718
cost eliminate human error human errors

180
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:17,899
in this industry can be detrimental to

181
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:20,509
crops I've seen whole props or multiple

182
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:22,759
rooms get burned up because people would

183
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,930
make same nutrients by hand and a

184
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,270
hundred thousand square foot facility

185
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,750
and hand watering and then suddenly

186
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:31,128
you're out millions of dollars

187
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,478
mechanical systems this is this is a big

188
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:35,360
one calm and we're going to drill down

189
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,758
into this mechanical systems everything

190
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,800
next to lighting and your building and

191
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,129
if you're not spending some time and

192
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,300
make it

193
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:43,939
that you're going through some proper

194
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,499
designs or even entertaining some of the

195
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:48,769
stuff that's out there it's behind the

196
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:51,499
efficient your electrical costs are just

197
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:54,218
gonna crush you and last but not least

198
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:56,629
part of the efficiency equation

199
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:59,509
environmental controls

200
00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:01,459
you can't put a thermostat on a wall in

201
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:03,199
a grow room and expect your maintain

202
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:07,879
temperatures and humidity controls that

203
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:10,869
can be it'll never happen just so floor

204
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:14,149
plans you know some of the big factors

205
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:15,740
regulatory and compliance is as a big

206
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:18,069
challenge you know you have to think

207
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:21,499
about stuff with security cameras

208
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:22,699
decontamination protocols which that's

209
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:24,619
one of the big ones that actually gets

210
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:26,778
left out you know you got to have dirty

211
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:28,849
come into the building and clean go into

212
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:30,490
the gross space this way here you can

213
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:32,448
actually can handle control pressures

214
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,579
depending on where your building is at

215
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:36,468
or if you're in a greenhouse you know

216
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:38,568
greenhouses is very challenging

217
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:40,278
depending on the demographic location I

218
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:42,559
mean here in this state alone I've

219
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:45,039
worked on some stuff down south and with

220
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,198
all the you know the non-organic

221
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:50,389
wineries and and veiners going on you

222
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:52,870
know there's overspray there's bugs

223
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:56,568
there's powdery mildew there's botrytis

224
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,009
you know so decontamination is a big one

225
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:59,838
and if you handled on the front end

226
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:01,730
you'll get through your compliance and

227
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,829
you will pass your tests and you won't

228
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:07,339
be battling bugs and have to have some

229
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:09,500
crazy IPM in place maximizing your gross

230
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:12,439
base that's gonna kind of go back to

231
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,578
your benches you know if you have a

232
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:15,438
hundred thousand square foot facility

233
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:18,649
you should be able to maximize that

234
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:20,120
space and utilize about eighty percent

235
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:22,659
of that or seventy percent of that for

236
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,828
canopy space for growing specifically

237
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:27,078
and there's a lot of ways to achieve

238
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:31,519
that you know I talked briefly about

239
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:33,049
workflow I can't emphasize workflow

240
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,028
enough I've seen a lot of facilities

241
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:37,609
where people are walking down hallways

242
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:38,559
that are 80 foot long when the floor

243
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,269
plan could cut that

244
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,039
have and you can get into a flower room

245
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:46,210
you know by cutting your distance in

246
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:48,189
half again two minutes here three

247
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,320
minutes there four minutes here spin two

248
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,450
people just kind of wandering around it

249
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,340
affects your labor and a few if you

250
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:57,339
can't grow a four or five hundred dollar

251
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,230
pound endure your and for all the pain

252
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:02,529
you know because what we've already seen

253
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,909
like I've expressed high in the market

254
00:10:02,528 --> 00:10:06,519
for wholesale versity and nine hundred

255
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:08,199
dollars for large bowling you know and

256
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,809
when I'm talking two hundred pounds or

257
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,950
300-pound sales here and there that

258
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:13,028
doesn't leave you a lot of room if

259
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:17,490
you're growing an eight hundred dollar

260
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:19,778
pound out the door equipment locations

261
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,480
this really pertains to mechanical

262
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:24,070
systems and with electrical these are

263
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,110
things that be kept in mind when you're

264
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,339
designing the facility you want to know

265
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,850
where all your infrastructure is coming

266
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:29,140
in the building

267
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,690
and you want to have short runs as

268
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:34,028
possible because copper is very

269
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,529
expensive even aluminum wiring is

270
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:37,240
expensive and this is a lot of

271
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:39,730
labor-intensive kind of stuff expecially

272
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,889
from the high voltage aspect shorter

273
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,339
runs is going to cut down your

274
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:47,230
installation costs as well as mechanical

275
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:50,320
water drilling systems which we'll get

276
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:53,019
into a little bit more minimizing the

277
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,150
distance of travel is gonna be key

278
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:58,029
because you can save tens of thousand

279
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:59,620
dollars and maybe even more if you're

280
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:00,669
setting up your facility properly and

281
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,299
putting mechanical systems electrical

282
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:08,469
rooms in the right location all these

283
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:12,549
things equate to running a low cost of

284
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:14,589
good years back when I started doing

285
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:15,819
this I I saw what was going on I was

286
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:18,640
helping some friends set up their

287
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,459
facilities I built a hundred hundred

288
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,259
like grow back in 2009 which back in

289
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:25,569
2009 that was that was a very large

290
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:28,539
growth I laid the whole thing out

291
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,370
I drew it out late at I'll hand it off

292
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:32,860
to engineering and architects and they

293
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,929
were like learning like we've never seen

294
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,730
anything like this usually they're

295
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:39,539
having a coach

296
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,860
long as I started building more

297
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,110
facilities and getting some different

298
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,600
situations I was always trying to figure

299
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,240
out how can I make things more efficient

300
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,370
and how can we make more money if I have

301
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,379
a $700 pound cost of good in this

302
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,230
facility well the next one how can I get

303
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:59,129
it to 550 or 600 how can I get it below

304
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:01,350
500 because I think that they I saw the

305
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:02,519
writing on the wall I mean you know a

306
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,920
lot of people coming from the black

307
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,419
market and if you go back 10 years and

308
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:07,139
you look at what the prices are now in

309
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,708
comparison

310
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:12,659
they are 60 to 70% less in the black

311
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:16,289
market I mean all the way from New York

312
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:19,769
California the numbers are just dropped

313
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:21,149
tremendously so cost of goods are very

314
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:24,990
important which is all based on the

315
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:27,958
efficiency of your facility so so

316
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,159
benching you know it's a little costly

317
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,379
on the front end that there's a lot of

318
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:32,939
options in the market but it is a

319
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:34,889
long-term investment I mean this is a

320
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,290
long play this is this is a marathon

321
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:39,629
this is not a sprint you're into it just

322
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:41,490
try to make a quick buck you might as

323
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:43,439
well stop now because there is no such

324
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,669
thing the amount of money you're going

325
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,540
to spend on the front ends and the

326
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:47,458
amount of money you're going to try to

327
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:49,708
get your ROI by the time that two years

328
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:51,568
or three years rolls around price is

329
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:53,759
gonna fluctuate and you could be out of

330
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:56,250
business so you have to think from an

331
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,588
investment opportunity and that mindset

332
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,169
you know not just coming from a growers

333
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:03,990
mind come from a business mindset as

334
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:06,958
well that's a smart investment these

335
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:09,240
things will last decades so spend a few

336
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,828
extra bucks I mean we're talking $11 a

337
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,180
square foot on average ten dollars a

338
00:13:10,828 --> 00:13:16,439
square foot it will last you a lifetime

339
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:18,979
there's a lot of controversy around the

340
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,269
single level versus a vertical growing

341
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,180
we've worked on a couple vertical grows

342
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:25,340
and they're very challenging

343
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:28,509
flowering aspect you know from a

344
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:31,820
mechanical and environmental perception

345
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:34,250
you have two levels of temperature and

346
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,290
humidity to deal with and he rises

347
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,120
naturally and most of the girls that

348
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:40,610
I've gone into that are vertical already

349
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,500
the top layer who is this very well

350
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,970
because the temperature is right and the

351
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,340
humidity is right and then the lower

352
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,649
level suffers because the humidity falls

353
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,210
it's gonna be cool so then you have two

354
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:52,100
different grades of product and you know

355
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,530
everyone thinks so if I go vertical I

356
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,670
increase my space as well it's not a

357
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,990
hundred percent true you're gonna get a

358
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,029
little bit more space but then you're

359
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,560
gonna run static benches and you have to

360
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:02,449
we'll have Iowa is in between that so

361
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,239
how are you really gaining that much

362
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:07,520
more gross space really not I mean you

363
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,080
have to have a minimum of three foot or

364
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,689
three and a half foot base on fire code

365
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,220
so how are you gaining at your space

366
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,500
then you've run into all the

367
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,870
environmental challenges I'm not saying

368
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,340
it can't be done but it has to be well

369
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,929
planned and well thought out and there's

370
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,389
a lot of new options in the market too

371
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:25,969
with actual to tear rolling benches that

372
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:28,759
that can help increase that canopy space

373
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:32,870
but from a mechanical perspective it's

374
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:36,080
it's challenging canopy management it's

375
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:39,139
very important and air movement these

376
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,060
things kind of play hand-in-hand it all

377
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:43,370
comes back to environment controls and

378
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:44,750
mechanical systems being set up properly

379
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:47,899
and making sure that you can move air

380
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,000
you can D humidify and you can cool as

381
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:51,079
much as you need it and be able to move

382
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,120
that air through the canopy

383
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,379
you know canopy management's you know

384
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,480
there's a lot of guys go and really tall

385
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:58,960
plants and they're shaving off or

386
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,070
skirting three or four foot of the plant

387
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,629
doesn't really make a lot of sense you

388
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,180
know for me as a Gore I would rather

389
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:07,309
grow shorter plants and control my

390
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:08,959
canopy and have a three-foot plan and

391
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:10,849
that way their light penetration you get

392
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,259
down but we can also get air through

393
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,750
there instead of trying to pull air up

394
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:16,220
through this deep dense Camden canopy of

395
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,840
plants that are six or seven feet tall

396
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,550
you have the same performance out of the

397
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,899
for a plan and you have shorter cycles

398
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:24,269
as well because you've altered edges

399
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:26,870
long it's a whole different subject but

400
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:33,179
you know canopy management air movements

401
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:34,169
very important lighting design there's a

402
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:36,389
lot of options there's a lot of

403
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:38,159
companies in the market you know educate

404
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:39,779
yourselves talk to them you know there's

405
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,669
reps that will give you information and

406
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:45,149
you know don't take everything as gospel

407
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:46,769
but listen take some notes and then do

408
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:48,779
some comparisons yourself and then make

409
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:50,370
your own decision or talk to some guys

410
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,339
that are using these fixtures but

411
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,049
there's a lot of options in marketing

412
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,570
some of them work better than others and

413
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:59,099
this is kind of falls into play with

414
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,830
don't you know buy just because it costs

415
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,360
more because it necessarily it's not

416
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,060
gonna get you more performance out of

417
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,500
your out of your lights you know the

418
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:10,169
technology hasn't really changed a lot

419
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,450
you know there's high pressure sodium

420
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:14,879
still dominates the markets EMHS made

421
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,700
some you know as made some advances and

422
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,559
could be used with certain applications

423
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:22,560
but you know HBS's still seems to be the

424
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:26,339
dominant source LEDs have made some

425
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:29,519
progress but as far as performance and

426
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:32,730
you know cost associated with you know

427
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,490
the capital expense it's very costly for

428
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,860
LEDs and I might still like to stick

429
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,259
with something that I know this working

430
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,120
day in and day out versus running with

431
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,460
an LED that you know they had their

432
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,529
challenges there's one thing that a lot

433
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,450
of people don't understand they they do

434
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:49,529
a doping effect because there's certain

435
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,990
color spectrums that they can't achieve

436
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:54,779
so they take a phosphorous they coat the

437
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,850
the actual the diodes when they heat up

438
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:59,879
then it manipulates the color special

439
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:03,750
well you know phosphorous has a shelf

440
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:05,220
life of 45 days a half-life so at some

441
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,559
point of time it's gonna integrate and

442
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,269
when it does degrade you don't know you

443
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,889
have no idea you know from a veggie

444
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:13,379
perspective we don't see it being

445
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,590
affecting the plants nearly as much so

446
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,300
from a vertical rack and veg LEDs things

447
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,939
work great but from a flowering

448
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:22,259
perspective you know a year year and a

449
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,680
half two years you're gonna have to have

450
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:25,539
a spectrometer and you're

451
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,950
we take measurements at certain periods

452
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:29,259
of time to ensure that your color

453
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:31,630
spectrum has not fallen off because if

454
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:34,210
you don't you lose 3% across your canopy

455
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,220
that's a lot of money especially if you

456
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,990
have twenty thousand even ten thousand

457
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,660
squared of canopy it's a lot of money

458
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:44,049
that's going to be lost ppfd in

459
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,850
methodologies you know know what numbers

460
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:49,240
you need and what those numbers mean you

461
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:50,889
know 900 ppm ppfd or a thousand eleven

462
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,950
hundred you know these matters the

463
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,930
numbers matter know what you're working

464
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,559
with and if you're gonna run higher P

465
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,820
PFDs

466
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,889
which is something I like to do it comes

467
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:04,689
with challenges you know more nutrient

468
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,000
more feeding you know you have to have a

469
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,650
more robust mechanical system but in the

470
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,049
offset you don't have to run your

471
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,610
electrical as much I mean we're running

472
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,440
nine and a half to ten hours and flower

473
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:17,019
you know and over the course of the day

474
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,850
that's big cost savings because you can

475
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:20,980
scatter your timing in between peak

476
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:23,319
hours and the whole peak hours you know

477
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,769
you're saving yourself money because

478
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:29,289
there is an actual thing of photo actual

479
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:31,329
photon saturation plants will get to a

480
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:33,220
point where it's they've had enough and

481
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:35,769
they're going to shut down there was a

482
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,970
paper that was issued by a Purdue where

483
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:39,430
they talked about the over saturation

484
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,680
and what they discovered that there was

485
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,930
effect and it affected a plan so

486
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,120
negatively that it would detrimental a

487
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,700
shutdown the photosynthetic engine of a

488
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:50,969
plant so if you're crushing your plans

489
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,170
for twelve hours at a high ppfd

490
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,450
more than likely you're gonna get stress

491
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:58,060
which is gonna call us lack of yields

492
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:01,240
lack quality norm Aphrodite I mean all

493
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:05,019
kinds of problems can happen mechanical

494
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,970
systems have I mean very very very very

495
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,950
important you can never have too much

496
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,049
coin you know your mechanical system is

497
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,430
going to cover coin humidification you

498
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:15,879
got to have redundancy in your systems

499
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:17,230
if you set up a system properly you

500
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,540
should never have to turn off a light if

501
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,519
an HVAC unit goes down or if a water

502
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,930
chiller goes down if you're turning off

503
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,180
lengths because you don't have enough

504
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:27,519
cooling or your systems are failing and

505
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,940
you don't have backup I mean you kind of

506
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,139
lost the race to

507
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,809
you know the systems that we design and

508
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,270
build we use a lot of options with

509
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:38,859
natural gas we do heat recapture on a

510
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:40,529
heat exchanger that we pump back into

511
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:43,659
the hydraulic system which is part of

512
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:46,660
dehumidification so they're highly

513
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,730
efficient they cost about 25 percent

514
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,830
more on the front end 30 percent but

515
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,599
your ROI is gonna happen a whole lot

516
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:54,909
faster because we've seen savings and

517
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:56,619
you were running ten fifteen thousand

518
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,690
dollars a month up to 30 or 40 thousand

519
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:00,669
dollars month in life and at the end of

520
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,230
the day that's a lot of money in twelve

521
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:06,610
months and that will affect your bottom

522
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:09,099
line also it helps you know going with

523
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:10,750
these natural gas options you know we've

524
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:13,209
see on the exchange rate anywhere from

525
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,369
Denver for example is 12 or 13 cents a

526
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,289
kilowatt hour overall once you throw on

527
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:18,339
demand charges here's another thing

528
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:20,170
people to understand you throw on a

529
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:21,579
bunch of lights there's a demand charter

530
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,860
so that electric company's gonna hit you

531
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:25,990
for and it's gonna tax you for 15

532
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:27,549
minutes and increments you know so you

533
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,440
don't see that your initial billing I

534
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:31,960
mean you actually have to take a class

535
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,570
to understand an electrical bill but

536
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,819
they find ways to hit you and next thing

537
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:38,200
you know you're paying an extra four

538
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,369
thousand five thousand dollars a month

539
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,390
because you're turning all your lights

540
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:45,579
on at one every single time we try to

541
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:48,910
find ways to offset that and find ways

542
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:50,980
to slowly ramp up lights you know use

543
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,990
natural gas so if you're paying 13 cents

544
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:56,140
a kilowatt hour even for an ear cold

545
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:59,349
water chiller on a gas exchange is about

546
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:03,400
2 cents 3 cents for a natural gas water

547
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:06,639
shoulder so these things can add up

548
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:09,490
quick we also developed a system to

549
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,930
where not only will recapturing heat and

550
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,079
use that for power

551
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:15,970
we're also capturing the exhaust and

552
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,699
cleaning and treating it and the

553
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:21,789
byproduct of exhaust is co2 makes up

554
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:24,100
about 60% of it and exhaust 50% so

555
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:26,470
suddenly you pay the same amount for the

556
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:28,629
setup if you're gonna use liquid co2 but

557
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,950
then you're you have no additional cost

558
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,980
because it's a byproduct for the water

559
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,440
shows themselves so from day one you pay

560
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:38,259
a set-up cost after that for the next

561
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,759
five seven ten years you got free co2

562
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:44,799
you're coming off your water chilling

563
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:46,869
system fertigation management the

564
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,509
seminar before me Sarah was talking

565
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:51,129
about RO systems and I think a lot of

566
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:53,470
things get lost in water people don't

567
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:56,470
realize that how important water is with

568
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,089
nutrient delivery using just the carbon

569
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,829
filter is not going to cut it you know

570
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:01,659
there's a lot of minerals that are in

571
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:03,419
your city water especially will even

572
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,610
well water they could be very damaging

573
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:09,160
but a plant can't uptake those minerals

574
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:11,490
that are in your city water and what

575
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,750
does that end up doing it ends up

576
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,549
causing problems with plant performance

577
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,839
because then it's gonna actually slow

578
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:17,769
down your uptake because the plant

579
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,899
doesn't know what to do with the

580
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:22,299
minerals that are put in front of it

581
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,970
with RO water day in day out you know

582
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:27,250
exactly what you have it's clean water

583
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,339
and your new two programs will also be

584
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,230
highly effective on the recapture side

585
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:34,119
we also use another RO system where we

586
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,069
can capture the condensation as well of

587
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,808
a leach a you know Alisha are generally

588
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:40,419
gonna see ten to fifty percent runoff on

589
00:22:37,808 --> 00:22:43,269
average but condensation you're gonna

590
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:46,480
see forty percent of forty five percent

591
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:48,129
of water coming back to transpiration so

592
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,808
if you're pumping 10,000 gallons a day

593
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,760
through your nutrient and through your

594
00:22:49,808 --> 00:22:53,440
irrigation you're gonna see at least

595
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,640
four thousand gallons coming back a lot

596
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,460
of people are just dumping that straight

597
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,800
out of into the sewer why not grab that

598
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,600
water you can get about an 80% rejection

599
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:03,789
rate on that which means you'll get a

600
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,109
person of four thousand gallons you can

601
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:08,079
get thirty-two hundred gallons of

602
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:09,788
reusable 100% clean water

603
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,769
and why would you do that it makes a lot

604
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,359
of sense you know there are going to be

605
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:15,460
regulations on stuff that's being dumped

606
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,129
down the drains we do a lot of work with

607
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,950
canopy growth in Canada and Aurora and

608
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,990
they're already on you know super

609
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,730
vigilant about what's going down the

610
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,038
sewer and they're already happy to put

611
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,808
protocols in place to eliminate what

612
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,460
they're putting down or minimizing the

613
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:30,668
amount of PPM's that are going down the

614
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,890
drain

615
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:35,590
it's going to happen here too I mean

616
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,028
don't be fooled you know as well as we

617
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:40,569
had a conversation outside about

618
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:43,359
slighting and and FCC regulations that's

619
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:45,788
coming you know of a fixture cannot pass

620
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,500
FCC regulations you're gonna see a

621
00:23:45,788 --> 00:23:48,940
problem with that eventually because

622
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,278
there's a lot of frequencies that are

623
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,778
being shot out into the atmosphere

624
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:54,929
coming from these lights and if you

625
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:57,720
don't run with some fixtures that are

626
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:59,409
regulated or that are listed on the FCC

627
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:04,659
eventually we're gonna see some

628
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:05,559
challenges with that the automation of

629
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:08,019
thing I love about fertigation

630
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:10,388
management is removing the human error

631
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:13,058
is the big one the second thing is it

632
00:24:10,388 --> 00:24:15,638
allows you to tweak recipes to a

633
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:17,259
specific cultivar some OGIS are very

634
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:18,849
particular some sativa is a very

635
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:21,129
particular i mean golden code is one of

636
00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:23,500
them you can't feed that plant very high

637
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:26,110
ec values she just she won't take it

638
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,980
so with these systems they're all

639
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:29,079
computer-controlled

640
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,110
you can capture your nutrient programs

641
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:33,819
plug them in they'll never be they'll

642
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:35,829
never change unless you change them and

643
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:37,658
then you could take test results take

644
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:39,490
that data and then cross-reference it

645
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:41,769
and make adjustments where you can

646
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:44,798
figure out where in dial in plants for

647
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:47,019
specific camp anoints profiles terpene

648
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:50,048
profiles you know there's a lot more

649
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:52,569
than just feeding nutrient to to your

650
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:54,250
plants into your benches and the other

651
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:57,339
great thing is that also that minimizes

652
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:59,589
cost of nutrient and water you know we

653
00:24:57,339 --> 00:25:01,629
do water delivery into rock wall we're

654
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:04,359
only doing about a liter a day for

655
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:06,159
feedings a liter a day versus if you've

656
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:09,009
run a three gallon plant with Coco

657
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,528
perlite mix or peat moss you know you're

658
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:13,379
looking at a gallon so multiply that

659
00:25:11,528 --> 00:25:15,690
across 14,000

660
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,240
or twenty or a hundred thousand plants

661
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:21,660
it adds up I mean everyone knows

662
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,150
nutrients in a liquid form its tonics

663
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:26,550
it's not super expensive but on that on

664
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:28,200
that level that's very costly and unless

665
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:32,339
you know what you're doing with you know

666
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:34,259
with powders you know that's a whole

667
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:35,369
different ballgame it's a whole

668
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:39,089
different ballgame if you're gonna try

669
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:43,229
to mix powders on your own environmental

670
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:44,819
controls last but not least the great

671
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:48,450
thing about environmental controls is

672
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:51,259
once you set it it's gonna run every day

673
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:53,759
you want to set you want 42 percent RH

674
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:55,950
that's what its gonna give you and it's

675
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,660
gonna give you a one percent swing plus

676
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,240
or minus all dependent on your

677
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:02,308
mechanical systems if you want your

678
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,900
temperature 82 percent that's what

679
00:26:02,308 --> 00:26:05,519
you're gonna get if you want seventy

680
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,620
eight percent in your mother room that's

681
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,000
what you're gonna get you know they are

682
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:11,428
a little costly on the front end but

683
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,829
again you're able to dial everything in

684
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:15,929
and every single day you're able to

685
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:17,730
control the environment which is one of

686
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:22,410
the most important things next to the

687
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:24,509
plan itself these systems will also such

688
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,980
as pre verbal capture data for you as

689
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:28,170
well tell you how much power you're

690
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,610
using that day what the peak load is if

691
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,590
you ever have an issue down the road

692
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:33,869
with a crop you know what and you're

693
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:35,339
down 20% you can go back and access all

694
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:36,750
your data you can go back into your

695
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:38,490
irrigation system you can go into

696
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:41,308
environmental controls and you can

697
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,779
determine what happened what happened

698
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:45,210
here and if something goes sideways

699
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:47,039
which is also great you get text

700
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,230
messages you get emails there's alarms

701
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,089
so there's never a moment that something

702
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,069
goes sideways on you that you don't know

703
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:55,980
because the system is there monitoring

704
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:58,139
all for you and the best part is you

705
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,579
keep everyone's hands out of it so no

706
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,009
one's going to playing with things you

707
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:03,899
know you can control your controls and

708
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:06,509
you're good to go and all these things

709
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,300
matter and to the portion of Labor

710
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:10,829
you know 30,000 40,000 square-foot

711
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:13,109
facility you know we set one up in

712
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:16,089
Florida 40,000 and they're running in

713
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:18,250
staff of 1718 people that include

714
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:20,529
it's the harvesting team because there's

715
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:23,109
all these systems in place that minimize

716
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:26,619
having to have 40 bodies to hand

717
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:28,509
transplant cocoa or take a container and

718
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:29,379
go into a deconstruction room and rinse

719
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:32,559
it and clean it

720
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,360
I mean labor again it's gonna be your

721
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,309
biggest thing and all these things are

722
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:41,199
gonna give you the efficiencies that you

723
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:47,559
need and that's gonna do it any

724
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:53,830
questions yeah he's I think the

725
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:56,200
microphone check check Hey

726
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:58,059
so I've heard a lot of debate over just

727
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,850
kind of a general questionnaire by a lot

728
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:04,149
of debate over having multiple smaller

729
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:05,619
rooms or having one large room can you

730
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,050
talk about like what would be more

731
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:10,869
efficient or what what's your opinion on

732
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:13,509
it so and and I didn't touch base on

733
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:15,669
that I usually do so there is this long

734
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:17,529
go in controversy and primarily is

735
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:19,480
really more about containment you know

736
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:22,599
but you have smaller rooms we can

737
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,029
control bugs we control pests if tom is

738
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:26,589
going into room one then he's going into

739
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:28,809
room two and there's Anna fest station

740
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:32,980
of room one where's the containment

741
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:35,230
there isn't there isn't its delusions

742
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:38,650
unless one person is going in and out of

743
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:41,110
each room that's never gonna happen and

744
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,880
also controls become much more intricate

745
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:44,859
it much more difficult to control a

746
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,370
bunch of small rooms versus larger rooms

747
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:51,399
so in a larger room we design larger

748
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:53,679
rooms primarily two reasons one control

749
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,410
becomes a lot easier the larger the room

750
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,210
is the more volume of air you have the

751
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:01,540
less modulations you have in your

752
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:05,140
environmental controls so 12-foot

753
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:07,089
ceilings is a little low 14 or 15 foot

754
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,620
ceilings makes a lot more sense because

755
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:11,470
even though you have this air above the

756
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:13,629
lights the lights are your vessel of

757
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,789
cool inventiveness everything is based

758
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,800
on your lighting load so you have the

759
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:19,720
space up here but that's conditioned so

760
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:21,178
if temperatures start to rise you have

761
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,338
this volume of beer to help buffer

762
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:27,419
so your modulations are a lot slower

763
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:28,739
which is what you want right so I mean

764
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:31,019
this is what we've been doing for about

765
00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:32,999
five or six years larger rooms versus

766
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:35,878
small I used to do the smaller rooms and

767
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:45,929
then realize yeah this this is the way

768
00:29:35,878 --> 00:29:47,338
to go well the problem with the vertical

769
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:48,929
is not necessarily about the the size of

770
00:29:47,338 --> 00:29:50,878
the room does matter but it's about you

771
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:53,159
have two different levels then of plants

772
00:29:50,878 --> 00:29:54,778
that are transpiring and you have you

773
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:57,359
know from top to bottom you've got two

774
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:58,919
levels of temperature load as well so

775
00:29:57,358 --> 00:30:00,449
whether you're LED or you're growing

776
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,999
with a high-pressure sodium or something

777
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,769
that has more heat and and and let's

778
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:06,960
just say real quick a watts of watts of

779
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,308
WA the law of physics it's very clear to

780
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,899
generate that one want there's going to

781
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:11,848
be he and just because an LED doesn't

782
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:13,558
have radiant heat it has dispersed heat

783
00:30:11,848 --> 00:30:16,019
coming through a ballast or a driver as

784
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:19,048
heat nonetheless there is there is no

785
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:21,329
LED is the magic answer to heat there

786
00:30:19,048 --> 00:30:23,848
will be heat so on the first level

787
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:25,648
there's a second level see heat rises

788
00:30:23,848 --> 00:30:27,778
transpiration will rise and then drop

789
00:30:25,648 --> 00:30:29,939
back down so then you have this lower

790
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:32,038
level of humidity that you have to deal

791
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,808
with the higher level is going to have

792
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:35,098
less because the light and load and heat

793
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:37,108
load is higher up there it's going to

794
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:39,388
burn off a bit more that that humidity

795
00:30:37,108 --> 00:30:41,158
and the more problem really comes in the

796
00:30:39,388 --> 00:30:43,258
off hours when the lights turn off

797
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,869
because when the cooling shuts down and

798
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:48,479
hits its target number so you go from 82

799
00:30:45,868 --> 00:30:51,329
agrees to come down to 62 when the HVAC

800
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:52,499
shuts off the dehumidification the HVAC

801
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:55,288
was supporting and the lights were

802
00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:56,969
helping with is gone then what are you

803
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:58,588
going to do how are you going to

804
00:30:56,969 --> 00:31:01,349
dehumanize that space because it's going

805
00:30:58,588 --> 00:31:03,538
to spike it will spike and you will have

806
00:31:01,348 --> 00:31:04,769
problems all through the dark hours and

807
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:06,538
you know when you get too much humidity

808
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:09,509
in the room the plant that's on a

809
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:11,579
cellular level the cells themselves will

810
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:13,858
stretch and when they stretch and absorb

811
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:15,298
more humidity well then it opens up too

812
00:31:13,858 --> 00:31:18,019
if there's anything in that room that

813
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:18,019
plants gotta get it

814
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,529
what are you saying for costume is for

815
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:34,400
outdoor grows a straight outdoor yeah

816
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:35,359
what's that canopy you know fifty

817
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,400
dollars a pound

818
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,250
I mean most of the cost there is gonna

819
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,410
be I mean there is some nutrient cost I

820
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,059
mean but a lot of its watering watering

821
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:48,380
a nutrient you don't have a lot of labor

822
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:50,240
associated with it it's about what we've

823
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:53,180
seen greenhouse has been averaging about

824
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:57,410
150 it's about normal and again that

825
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:59,060
depends on demographics depending on

826
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,250
demographics so you know if we built in

827
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:03,049
desert ponds for example the cost is

828
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:06,019
more because we have to put in you know

829
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:07,549
infrastructure for cooling so we have to

830
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:09,650
still condition the air so we're

831
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:12,829
building full mechanical systems to

832
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:16,100
offset that heat so it can swing but

833
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:18,079
yeah you know about $150 $200 you know

834
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:20,619
on the indoor side we're seeing 350 to

835
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,619
400

836
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:30,009
I am setting up a nursery in Southern

837
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:33,790
Oregon okay and I wanted to go back to

838
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:38,200
your comments on natural gas was that

839
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:41,559
just for water chilling or was that also

840
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:44,410
related to age fact I've got natural gas

841
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:48,700
coming into my place it's not hooked up

842
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:51,370
yet but we're playing using it for the

843
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:55,450
propagation room I was reading some

844
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:59,259
articles on dark heart nursery in

845
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:02,680
California and they had mentioned that

846
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:03,759
they were analyzing their costs and they

847
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,740
were figuring out that they're spending

848
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:09,730
more money on dehumidification than they

849
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,809
were on on cooling and I'm sure they

850
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,390
were using an electric do you

851
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:15,940
modification I'm not sure most opposed

852
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:19,210
most likely electrode Rima Fakih Asian

853
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:22,090
is like it's just like AC so I mean it

854
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:25,090
consumes a truckload of power yeah so

855
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:26,559
they had moved to DX minutes yeah and I

856
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:29,019
haven't bought my HVAC systems yet

857
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,940
working with Energy Trust Oregon and

858
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:33,160
evaluating everything but if you had any

859
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,950
thoughts on that for propagation

860
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,300
hardening off room I mean they

861
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,680
appreciate it yeah I mean you still need

862
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:40,210
some dehumidification there I mean

863
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,420
you're naturally running them you know

864
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:45,309
higher humidity is 65% you know 70% so

865
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:48,460
you really only need to stop it from you

866
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:50,200
know peaking past that but you know the

867
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,029
dehumidification that we like to run I

868
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,950
mean everything is water-based you know

869
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:55,839
so we use a hydraulic system where we

870
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,519
have a boiler as a backup and we're

871
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,789
capturing heat off the chill inside but

872
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,190
I mean there are a couple options in the

873
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:05,470
D hue side that you could probably take

874
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,769
a look at it'll be a little bit more

875
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:09,559
efficient than just running standard

876
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:12,019
electrical

877
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:14,630
but yes supplementing the gas is is

878
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:16,579
gonna be helpful it just depends on the

879
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:18,220
space and the budget I mean you know all

880
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:20,869
those things are gonna matter

881
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:23,959
but yeah electrical duplication about

882
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:25,639
you I've got one for you Jody so I know

883
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,650
that you're continually driving

884
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:31,279
efficiency to be able to get your price

885
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:33,110
per pound down as the primary driver and

886
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,240
also when I'm down covering and talking

887
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,519
to folks in NorCal right they're very

888
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:40,250
much into artisan and you know one acre

889
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:42,710
cap and you know the the flour is better

890
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,179
with the with the shadow of the farmer

891
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:47,449
and you know off you know small-batch

892
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:49,099
artisanal up right so so setting aside

893
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:50,599
the price per pound for a moment right

894
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:51,829
because obviously that's a really

895
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:53,869
important driver if you want to play at

896
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:56,299
all absolutely what kind of quality of

897
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:58,279
product and the final flour are you

898
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,070
seeing at these level of efficiencies

899
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,710
and mechanization versus you know

900
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:05,950
smaller traditional gardens that we saw

901
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:08,539
during during the Prohibition era where

902
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:10,609
there was a lot more labor involved and

903
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,259
in California build its name on the

904
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,570
quality about that product because of

905
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,730
that and it's good question I mean but

906
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,990
the reality is as we you know

907
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,429
essentially we're building those

908
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:22,099
facilities so that it gives us the

909
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:24,109
ability to grow nothing but high-end

910
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:25,759
product and that's all gonna be you know

911
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,500
based on certain factors and the

912
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,720
genetics themselves are gonna play a big

913
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,940
role in that but we do all these things

914
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:34,129
so that we can grow the best product

915
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:36,019
that we can it's not about just a cash

916
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,500
crop in less turn as much volume as we

917
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:38,570
can

918
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,219
let's turn as much volume of high-end

919
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:42,170
product and because the market is very

920
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:44,929
small when it comes to that high-end

921
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:47,930
product but all of the stuff is so that

922
00:35:44,929 --> 00:35:50,299
you can't grow a high-end product and

923
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:51,710
alleviate all those stress points as

924
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,390
stress as what's going to affect your

925
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,639
harvest in your crops and from

926
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:57,829
generation to generation the more stress

927
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:59,230
that it cooks over the years the less

928
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:01,090
quality that you're going to have

929
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,429
to the smaller eels you're gonna start

930
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:05,740
seeing but that's I mean that's what all

931
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:07,239
these things are for this is the B in

932
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:08,829
that 8 percent of the market then the

933
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:10,209
high end of the market because if you're

934
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:12,819
going to spend the money and you're

935
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,440
trying to grow a cash crop why grower

936
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,789
level stuff because it's gonna cost you

937
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,409
the same amount of money you always want

938
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:20,559
to grow the high-end stuff so that's

939
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:22,358
that's the target here is to grow grow

940
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:29,799
better quality product than other guys

941
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:30,590
down the street Thank You Jody thank you

942
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:35,609
anybody

943
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:35,608
[Applause]
