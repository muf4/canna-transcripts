1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,720
I first met even a Miss on a tour

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:09,029
he led of this one garden and right here

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,820
is on a street like a days about

4
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:14,730
beautiful fruits that he was growing and

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,550
I was doing it all organically this

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,260
incredible

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,778
ethan miss Osen board certified

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,630
neurologists with a long-term interest

9
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:27,230
in the discipline plans this led to a

10
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:30,538
second career focused on the therapeutic

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:33,719
application of campus and other herbal

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:40,649
treatments his busted sod since

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:42,840
childhood and was the founder of the

14
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,030
Blackfoot organic fruit and flower

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,149
operation one of the first state

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,969
certified organic farms in Montana and

17
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:54,090
his sole exotic exotic produce at the

18
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:57,120
middle of farmers market for two years

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,239
in the nineteen nineties he has lit up a

20
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:03,448
salon for ten years and slowly turned

21
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:06,228
his available quarter acre in tomorrow

22
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:08,908
is strictly organic and every landscape

23
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:12,260
let's please give a warm welcome to dr.

24
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,260
Ethan result

25
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,269
thank you for coming really great I go

26
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,340
all over the world giving talks about

27
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:27,310
dismal plants whether it's nice to just

28
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:31,990
drive a little bit up a brother and be

29
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:35,530
able to speak to come on people so

30
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:38,019
anyway this is the introductory slide

31
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:42,849
and you'll see a picture of a book by

32
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:44,679
Michael Phillips holistic orchard we're

33
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:47,589
talking about today is derived from that

34
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:48,549
but as I was reading I think it's

35
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,829
fantastic

36
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:52,959
what kind of those tremendously feeling

37
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:56,349
they're the only Christmas mocha day

38
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:59,020
yeah is that for the person who just

39
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:04,178
wants to know how to do it it's a little

40
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:06,699
bit better than if you buy the book you

41
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:09,009
may find yourself making notes for all

42
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,739
you'd like to do it later we try to help

43
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:14,949
with that by distilling some of the key

44
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:18,280
ingredients with spray portions that are

45
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:20,439
needed in the hand optically see if you

46
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:28,319
have questions about any of this my

47
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:31,009
email is up there pretty easy my name I

48
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,579
will get back to

49
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:39,259
la for instance McFly in Manila Scotia

50
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:42,739
tomorrow and Newfoundland on Friday for

51
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:46,459
other talks not not the same way anyway

52
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:52,670
next place so yes that is a picture of

53
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:54,890
me by Ellis Beach members to who to me

54
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:56,899
was just this crappy old lady but a

55
00:02:54,889 --> 00:03:00,919
bundle later that she would slide you

56
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:11,829
know you've quite an active leftist and

57
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:14,598
on New England politics even them so key

58
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:16,209
questions that people have why do you go

59
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:20,479
to the trouble

60
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:22,549
well one answer is because this block by

61
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,378
another it is because we think it's

62
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:26,540
important and there are arguments from

63
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:28,818
people all over the world about whether

64
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:33,048
nutritionally it's better to grow

65
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:35,579
organically it is and then there's the

66
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:38,849
whole environmental aspect

67
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,100
about ready it's critically important to

68
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:43,889
me that I do things organically and I've

69
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:48,829
heard approach decades from people that

70
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:52,709
it's impossible to go good fruit without

71
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:57,240
synthetic pesticides which is not

72
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:59,670
terrible and for years I was asking

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,430
everyone do you know of a preventive

74
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:06,839
organic spray program that you can just

75
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:09,300
do proactively to be able to grow good

76
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,460
at perfect and everyone said no that's a

77
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,070
nice idea of an unknowable penny and

78
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,350
then about six years ago Michael

79
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,230
Phillips came out with this book and it

80
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:22,860
was exactly what proverbial doctor

81
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:25,920
ordered or even three so here the

82
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,340
reasons it's definitely safer it's

83
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,379
ecologically sound you're working with

84
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,418
rather than against

85
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:35,759
the idea of this great program that

86
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:38,668
we're going to do it's going to be okay

87
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:42,360
for the good bugs and repel the bad bugs

88
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:45,689
but not necessarily kill anything just

89
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:50,330
keep things in proper balance it's a

90
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:53,430
sustainable approach and again there is

91
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:55,859
positive evidence of nutritional

92
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,040
benefits sometimes bigger pretty clearly

93
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:03,150
more of these secondary metabolites

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,240
things like bio flavonoids that help

95
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:09,629
prevent aging by this degenerative

96
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,530
diseases but it's very satisfying and

97
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:38,639
how many people before this can say my

98
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:41,629
food is 100% on Amazon not discounted

99
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:46,069
from the regular price I was happy

100
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:48,620
oh Christ when I first came out he has a

101
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:51,980
website that's really good and there's a

102
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:56,930
blog that goes along with it and he

103
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:58,970
figures the book in the back this is

104
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,689
like me sometimes he takes a lot of the

105
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:05,210
answer is email but when I had questions

106
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:09,319
that weren't handled in the book like

107
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:12,979
God why won't my when straight afraid it

108
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:15,019
will at least give it a try but remember

109
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,360
your resources here too if you remember

110
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:21,289
the print Club take a picture of your

111
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:24,199
diseased or damaged trigger Bushman send

112
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:28,460
it around and get that opinions next one

113
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:32,120
place kind of organic growing it's

114
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:35,750
realizing how fruit grows and what most

115
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:39,439
fruit trees that we count or designed to

116
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:41,600
grow up before us - yeah it's an

117
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:47,060
environment where there's lots of stuff

118
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:50,600
that falls off leaves and twigs but I'm

119
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,060
not a cosmetic gardener if you took the

120
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,960
tour of my place

121
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:59,199
that doesn't necessarily look right but

122
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:01,299
the results are really good so a lot of

123
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,659
that stuff that we cosmetically

124
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,770
breakaways actually good for the plant

125
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:11,380
will break down and provide nutrition

126
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:15,969
Harbor good organisms that need to be

127
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:19,120
there so you can promote this by using

128
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:22,120
we're called ravioli which s so these

129
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,379
are the thin 2 inch or less branches

130
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,870
from hardwoods and done you can check

131
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:32,529
these to get this chip or you're gonna

132
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,660
spend a lot of time beat them in one by

133
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:38,289
the line might be better

134
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:44,350
do they have a bigger of worship chipper

135
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:46,780
a bigger property next please and this

136
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:51,400
is what they look like a dealing they're

137
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:54,339
different shades and this is like solid

138
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:57,849
nutrition for the trees and can be

139
00:07:54,339 --> 00:08:01,418
spread just like mulch you'll be amazed

140
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:04,210
next please just close up being leased

141
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:06,418
up quickly this song gets incorporated

142
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:10,449
into the soil

143
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:12,269
next please um apparently though we're

144
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:16,000
going to be talking about this

145
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:18,849
preventive organic spray program that

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,228
Michael Phillips develop so what's it

147
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:27,060
all about again the idea is a general

148
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:30,728
spray that's a tonic for the plants

149
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:33,879
providing things that needs on keeping

150
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:38,620
things in ecological balance the idea is

151
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:41,038
to improve for growth the vigor and the

152
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,038
nutrient

153
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:48,309
when properly done and my spraying he

154
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,620
recommends every seven to fourteen days

155
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:53,919
throughout the season the season starts

156
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:58,509
earlier I usually start in late February

157
00:08:53,919 --> 00:09:00,759
and go through September might be one

158
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:03,519
spray late the season and help break

159
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:07,149
down some of the leaves and other stuff

160
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,759
that's falling on the trees but what

161
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:15,970
this will do is markedly reduce

162
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:17,860
predation by bad bugs so the need in the

163
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:22,210
spray that we're going to talk about has

164
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:24,909
some panty feeding property it sort of

165
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:29,530
tastes bad for the bugs and go somewhere

166
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:32,949
else but it's not harmful to pollinators

167
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:35,379
I got plenty of mason bees and other

168
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:38,980
pollinators in the garden providing we

169
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:42,309
don't have a spring like this one so if

170
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:45,879
you didn't have a great he'll go welcome

171
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:48,779
to the club but we don't want to be in a

172
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:51,970
lot of the components of the spray or

173
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:54,819
antifungal goodness notes in our

174
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:57,519
environment that's our biggest problem

175
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,790
things like peach leaf curl blacks

176
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,710
bottom

177
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:07,699
are really an issue in this felony

178
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:12,680
despite the fact that it reduces those

179
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:15,050
pathogenic disease formation fungi it

180
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:18,949
improves the micro rifle growth of the

181
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:21,349
soil Michael rise ir1 chai that grow

182
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,720
around degrees and it's a symbiotic

183
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,899
relationship both get something out of

184
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,580
it punch I have a place to grow and it

185
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:34,699
helps provide nutrients to the tree

186
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,370
itself through the grades additionally

187
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:43,460
this spring will reduce both bacterial

188
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:47,690
and viral diseases so the real base to

189
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:51,400
this is pure organic neem oil now

190
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:54,680
there's tons of neem oil on the market I

191
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:56,629
use a brain called ahi'm son I'm gonna

192
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:59,059
pass this around and ask you to be

193
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:01,700
really careful this is like melted

194
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:04,759
butter here it's the consistency of

195
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:07,780
butter it must have been warmed up as

196
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:10,129
normally it'll be more

197
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:16,189
look like butter that's been on the

198
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:19,309
counter for a few minutes this is

199
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,470
expensive but if you by default you can

200
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:24,799
start the refrigerated for long periods

201
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:27,649
of time and what I do is I buy little

202
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,769
bottles like this and measure up 75

203
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:33,709
milliliters that's five tablespoons in

204
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:35,720
each one that I keep in the fridge and

205
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:39,639
then when I'm ready to spray just grab

206
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,639
one and set it up on the comment

207
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,290
so we would go from left to right we've

208
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,569
got the neem oil this is what it looks

209
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:55,529
like in the bridge when it's warmed up

210
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:59,460
it looks like that middle and then you

211
00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:02,399
need a soap to emulsify it break it up

212
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:05,550
and little tiny droplets will spread

213
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:09,299
through the spraying up float on top and

214
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:11,759
the scud be done one people asked me if

215
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,799
you can store the spray the answer is no

216
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:17,029
you cannot it's got to be done on the

217
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:20,309
spot next please

218
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:21,389
second component is hydrolyzed fish

219
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:24,539
fertilizer

220
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:25,379
now there's again this is not fish

221
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:27,959
emulsion

222
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,700
that's just fish that are ground up this

223
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,240
is different this is broken down a

224
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,640
little bit with enzymes and it's much

225
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,389
more fire what we hold of the plant

226
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:41,669
I also doesn't smell as bad since this

227
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:43,470
is a distinct product as compared to

228
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:48,469
fish emulsion that you might be more

229
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:52,680
familiar yes

230
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:55,160
that's Neptune and honor if you got the

231
00:12:52,679 --> 00:13:16,319
handout all the stuff here on

232
00:12:55,159 --> 00:13:21,299
including the price itself next please

233
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:25,910
question to those available if you want

234
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:30,419
to make your own I think that Dakota

235
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:34,639
Dallas can be worth the time we'll have

236
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:34,639
time for questions at the end so I don't

237
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,350
have an answer

238
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:42,089
outstanding issues so the next one is

239
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:46,519
liquid count then this is also

240
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:50,190
hydrolyzed no we do have Kalpana Beach

241
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:53,809
this is made from good stuff and non

242
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:59,459
polluted areas the key thing here is

243
00:13:53,809 --> 00:14:04,250
this got one more tax factors trace

244
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:07,079
minerals primarily using these is folded

245
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:10,919
so foliar feeding means they are

246
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:14,970
spraying on Belize but also some next

247
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:17,879
please the next ingredient are

248
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,370
beneficial microbes this is the brand

249
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,070
that I have use you can choose this

250
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:26,610
three different ways

251
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:28,520
this one comes pre-mixed you can magnify

252
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:34,909
it because this is a little bit pricey

253
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:38,370
but you can mix this and

254
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:41,100
mix it with a little bit of molasses and

255
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:43,139
you let it ferment again because this

256
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,769
has got a combination of bacteria and

257
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:49,139
fungi in it you let it ferment for a

258
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:53,429
while until it gets the right pH and

259
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:56,879
then you can increase the guilt 24 so

260
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:59,279
you can count this you can brew this you

261
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,250
can buy it just premix that can't be

262
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,879
expended for the people that want to

263
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:09,509
make compost tea they need that again a

264
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:12,000
little bit more labor-intensive that's

265
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:15,929
what we end up with this liquid and

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,149
we've got to aerate it for a few days it

267
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:21,809
really is a lot very good for plants and

268
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:24,090
can be used as a fertilizer but because

269
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:29,389
I travel a lot it's better if I can just

270
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:32,310
make stuff on the spot next this is

271
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:33,120
blackstrap molasses make sure it's

272
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:35,609
organic

273
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,590
you don't let it sulfur because that's

274
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:42,480
gonna kill the the good bonus then

275
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:44,399
you've got max this is in the mix

276
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,830
because it nourishes the beneficial

277
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,299
microbes so when you spray it they've

278
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:54,350
got something that grown perfect

279
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:57,599
next please finally a spreader sticker

280
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:02,040
there various of these this was called

281
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,980
thermos 70 it's the only when I found

282
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:06,009
that

283
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:09,459
listed as organic us in various forever

284
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:13,028
Snickers on the market but he might come

285
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:15,219
out to get this one or what to see if

286
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:15,600
there are others their commodity market

287
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:22,529
there

288
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:24,659
and next place so I realize that I'm not

289
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:26,429
gonna be able to read this too long but

290
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:29,669
you don't have to because we provided

291
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:31,919
the students but this is what we call

292
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:34,319
orchard spray rates and the stinking

293
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,870
from Michaels blood it's just he didn't

294
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,900
have a table like this and we've killed

295
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,690
this all the way from like doing a

296
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:45,750
corridor pint at once all the way up to

297
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:49,080
a hundred gallons he's got a relatively

298
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:55,009
bigger operation and extreme northern

299
00:16:49,080 --> 00:17:02,670
New Hampshire and he uses 100 tractor

300
00:16:55,009 --> 00:17:05,420
that that's what I use

301
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:09,029
[Music]

302
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:12,120
so this is the meet again this is a

303
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:16,078
little used to be a different maker this

304
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:19,469
is passed by the wayside I did the Apple

305
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:23,338
for almost forty years but it shows you

306
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:27,600
the transition from the green even more

307
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:31,139
solid need to one of the most like when

308
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:35,159
it's heated up the heating is not that

309
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,200
much 105 degrees Fahrenheit it's all you

310
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,850
don't want to do anything over 120

311
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,419
degrees

312
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:45,319
my 50 degrees Celsius because that'll

313
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:49,580
kill the bugs next please

314
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:53,359
so it's absolutely necessary that you

315
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:55,909
have clean water idiots now that's right

316
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:59,869
you do that one of two ways either a

317
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:04,390
good filtered water or because if you're

318
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:08,058
on numb district 19 water is chlorinated

319
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:10,460
you should second water out overnight or

320
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:13,009
they can out gas the floor again

321
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:16,220
otherwise it's gonna kill the good bugs

322
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:18,140
okay so that's very important you can

323
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:22,279
use distilled water but it's going to be

324
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:25,070
wait way too expensive so you know I've

325
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:28,339
got a water filter in the kitchen

326
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:30,529
I've got no problem with it so we heat

327
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:34,279
up a bunch of water for something less

328
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:38,058
than 50 degrees Celsius because he want

329
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,529
that work to keep the mean suspended

330
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:44,960
that's very important and the reason

331
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:47,839
that you can't story please this is

332
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,079
about the effect of microbes and so if

333
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:54,019
you do buy the profile for example and

334
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:57,939
one of its wrong this is what it's got

335
00:18:54,019 --> 00:19:01,240
in it lactobacilli and bifida bacteria

336
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:03,529
these are things that you find in yogurt

337
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,169
they're on vegetables if you do

338
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:09,500
lacto-fermentation of vegetables you've

339
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:12,360
got same kinds of bugs so one of these

340
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,130
you can drink

341
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:19,169
see now it's poor they weren't your

342
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:22,230
plants to drink and it's got again these

343
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,330
yeasts there are other beneficial

344
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,690
bacteria it's a sea bear remember

345
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:30,839
through the names and to meet this brood

346
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:33,539
what you do is you use 3/4 of a cup of

347
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:38,069
beneficial microbes quarter cup of

348
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:43,889
Blackstrap gallon Philip the gentleman

349
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:47,849
chug up keep it at 90 degrees Fahrenheit

350
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:51,840
until the pH is 3.8 or less that's about

351
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:54,359
a week's worth and then it will store

352
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:57,269
for several weeks at open temperature

353
00:19:54,359 --> 00:20:00,539
and you've got 20 times more for the

354
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:06,779
same price so like anything else there's

355
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:10,700
no investment of money next place this

356
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:15,420
pH paper is readily accessible together

357
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:20,160
Raintree or sports happen to you just

358
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:23,730
dip the strip and when it's the same

359
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,240
colors the three-pointer they're so not

360
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:32,009
her little bit of kitchen chemistry

361
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:34,410
next please and as I mentioned you can

362
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:38,660
get the premix this by the way and it's

363
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,660
the same but the difference is this

364
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:48,629
[Music]

365
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:54,779
now this next part is only for the

366
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:57,030
hardcore Michael Phillips is into doing

367
00:20:54,779 --> 00:21:00,599
a lot of herbal teas as an additional

368
00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:04,410
supplement plans and this is usually a

369
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:06,539
one-seater proposition and these are

370
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:09,779
things you can find readily on Vashon

371
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:13,740
when I first did it I had to go to an

372
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:16,440
herbal herbal early interested friend's

373
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:20,308
house and get Humphrey but I knew that

374
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,320
we had horsetail down by tram Harbor I

375
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:32,089
got those Nettles

376
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:34,889
everywhere but the first one is comfrey

377
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:36,569
when we're going to recommend comfrey

378
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:40,650
it's a really interesting plant

379
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:43,139
it is invasive however the company that

380
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:47,009
used to be called horizon is not called

381
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:51,780
sprinkling the dismal myself of Russian

382
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:54,599
high credit concrete and it's in terms

383
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:56,970
of its constituents the good stuff in it

384
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,939
it's exactly the same but it'll just

385
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:03,089
grow abundantly every year but it won't

386
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,220
spread okay so I really recommend that

387
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:07,799
I've got that standard through the dirt

388
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,829
what this does nobody thinks it's

389
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:16,289
aerates the soil and really recruits

390
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:19,460
calcium from deep in the ground but in

391
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:22,980
the spring you can cut some of this down

392
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:25,690
you cover it with hot water and you brew

393
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,970
it for a week what this is

394
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:31,660
there is service another tonic to the

395
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:35,289
plant produces trace minerals

396
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:38,970
it also has empty fungal properties is

397
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:44,619
very good to add to the minutes next one

398
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:45,759
horse tail basically if you go area

399
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:49,119
standing water

400
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:53,109
there's a creek nearby there's after the

401
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:57,669
horse hills readily identifiable what

402
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:59,829
this does it's very strong and silica so

403
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,840
like this what's it seen but this is in

404
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:06,039
a form where you can spray it on the

405
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:09,459
planet and it really toughen up the

406
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:14,859
plant and helps prevent predation from

407
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:17,170
bugs like just like that plant drop so

408
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:21,490
that's the main ingredient there the

409
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:23,800
next one is the nettle tea not morning

410
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,809
you've got to be hardcore to do this

411
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:29,529
because what's the stuff from that it's

412
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:32,679
pretty great no it can be stored at

413
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:35,049
ambient temperature outside temperature

414
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,930
as long as it's out of the Sun and I

415
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:39,549
just use it throughout the season

416
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:42,820
basically what I've done here is they

417
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:48,970
fill up five gallon buckets you know

418
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:51,819
food grade one of the hardware stores as

419
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:54,610
I said dump the hot water on it again

420
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:58,000
that should be chlorine free or a

421
00:23:54,609 --> 00:24:02,859
builder and let it sit for a week and

422
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,619
then you can store it and I do a quarter

423
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:07,779
beach get into the mix throughout the

424
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:11,469
season next please

425
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:12,519
you don't need to go to the step but you

426
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,470
can put

427
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:18,440
airlocks on them and you know they're

428
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,579
pretty good told they start throwing

429
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,429
fudge

430
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:24,319
in them which looks bad remember why

431
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:31,309
you'd be spraying this on their plant

432
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:34,159
but yeah it's good fun okay this is what

433
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:36,019
the makes looks like all together sort

434
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,529
of muddy but I think you'll appreciate

435
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:41,859
that you don't see good loves of oil on

436
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:43,960
top it's actually well mixed

437
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:47,058
particularly if you've got that water

438
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:50,990
temperature right you'll see tiny

439
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:53,178
droplets of needs and the bottom will

440
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,419
will look just like the top that's

441
00:24:53,179 --> 00:25:00,950
that's done right

442
00:24:55,419 --> 00:25:05,049
next please just some notes about things

443
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:08,360
let's see what you need to mention isn't

444
00:25:05,048 --> 00:25:10,400
pointed out keep recommends everyone to

445
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:14,209
two weeds rough season I've done it

446
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:18,250
every two weeks I can't manage once a

447
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:20,750
week you've dropped the fish which is

448
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:24,558
fertilizer of course for the nitrogen

449
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:30,980
component he dropped that about the

450
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:34,730
beginning of June we do the various

451
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:36,950
herbal teas from the tide met when the

452
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:40,759
nettle flowers that's the time to make

453
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:44,360
it that's the time to start by doing it

454
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:50,629
you do that through the beginning

455
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:52,699
I'm done with that bird the neem oil

456
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:56,179
should be refrigerated particularly if

457
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:59,028
we're gonna buy a football if you leave

458
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:02,419
it out and were meant to get it up

459
00:25:59,028 --> 00:26:04,788
bottle you can't do that forever

460
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:06,350
I what I'd really recommend it's

461
00:26:04,788 --> 00:26:09,288
definitely well if you think is

462
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:12,319
reasonable on your fianc which lasts me

463
00:26:09,288 --> 00:26:14,569
a couple of seasons I pour out 75

464
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:22,879
milliliters and these little jars they

465
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:26,589
go into French too and once again the

466
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:30,169
fish and kelp should be hydrolyzed and

467
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:32,119
the effect of microbes is as is or you

468
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:38,538
can multiply them burning to make your

469
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:40,759
own compost tea the black strap keep in

470
00:26:38,538 --> 00:26:45,379
mind if you're not work used to working

471
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:49,490
with molasses very qatari stuff that's

472
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:56,120
going to be warmed up to in the water to

473
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:58,849
get it to mix otherwise if you're

474
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:01,638
worried about how all this smells what

475
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:04,819
I'd like to say is that that complete

476
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:09,769
mix with a fish needs smells like a Thai

477
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:11,750
restaurant full production let's drop

478
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:15,669
the fish it just smells in a bit of

479
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,669
night there's really nothing

480
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:33,828
[Music]

481
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,509
[Music]

482
00:27:42,319 --> 00:28:23,279
these are only a few of the emails that

483
00:28:18,808 --> 00:28:28,440
are really organic and pull that arm

484
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:31,619
even consider a guarantee you don't hurt

485
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:36,090
the trouble of doing this with the wrong

486
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:38,009
braveness another thing that comes up is

487
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:42,899
how much trouble the business really

488
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:46,048
well how important is your first I can

489
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,860
tell you that I've seen a lot of fruit

490
00:28:46,048 --> 00:28:50,710
operations

491
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:54,490
there's a lot of money very before I was

492
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:57,370
doing this we inherited some delicious

493
00:28:54,490 --> 00:29:01,000
ham and I happen to know we were really

494
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:03,909
getting between the birds and monkey

495
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,450
berry there is no production but as

496
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:10,090
you'll see we're doing really well with

497
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:14,308
no money during the reason is because of

498
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:19,240
this appropriate with the right setup I

499
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:22,210
can get this down to weirder than doing

500
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,429
it out every two weeks that's eluded us

501
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:27,970
from the time that say okay I'm going to

502
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:32,500
spray until I'm done and things are set

503
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:34,329
them out to air out is an hour okay so

504
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,980
now we're every two weeks of me is a

505
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:42,009
good investment I think well worth while

506
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:47,200
there is some initial outlay for this

507
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:52,089
stuff some ingredients are pricey but to

508
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,819
me in wall with water on next place in

509
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:59,918
terms of other equipment I use a

510
00:29:54,819 --> 00:30:02,859
backpack sprayer 20 only trees that

511
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,110
we've got spraying something like twelve

512
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:06,240
or fourteen

513
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:10,278
punching berries this is all on a

514
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:15,960
quarter-acre so I can do the one thing

515
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:20,898
all the berries and roses and fruit

516
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:24,298
trees that I want to spray with 140 on

517
00:30:20,898 --> 00:30:27,658
application every two weeks I started

518
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:29,908
out the best the solo I figured up a

519
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,340
German trader it should be really good

520
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:36,990
liable but I've gone through it one a

521
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:38,579
season this is a manual one where you're

522
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:42,019
spraying with the right hand you're

523
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:46,079
pumping off all the time to the left and

524
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:49,710
I'm afraid that when these go that's it

525
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:52,888
it can be service but service is like 40

526
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:54,870
bucks an hour and god you can't take one

527
00:30:52,888 --> 00:30:56,759
of these apart and put it back to the

528
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:59,089
other in less than a couple of hours so

529
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:07,200
yeah

530
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:09,609
abundant so I went through two of these

531
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,970
and another similar

532
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:16,240
rhetoric out lies if you do get dust you

533
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:21,470
do want to spring for the better

534
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:23,359
shoulder pads and the waistband if

535
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:26,058
you're like the beatings of a certain

536
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:29,439
age and have a bad back

537
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:32,269
this weighs 40 pounds when it's fall and

538
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,798
you want to distribute that weight I can

539
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:36,288
tell you I've never heard like that

540
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:39,528
doing this I've hurt my back plenty

541
00:31:36,288 --> 00:31:50,329
other ways and you probably want to get

542
00:31:39,528 --> 00:31:54,349
with these to stick it on next I started

543
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:56,689
by pure us a couple of months ago away

544
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:59,689
I got an automatic car for the first

545
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:02,480
time in my life and listen because I've

546
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:07,600
wanted that it's because manual cars

547
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:09,819
barely really exist anymore against some

548
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,039
yeah and I felt the same way about the

549
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:13,899
sprayer if you could do it me in LA

550
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:17,710
that's what I thought I should do but I

551
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:20,920
was wrong because it breaks down so I

552
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:24,299
decided okay I'm going to spend the

553
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:27,490
extra twenty bucks or whatever it is

554
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:30,789
electric and this is actually pretty

555
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:33,009
neat it's a lithium battery and all the

556
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:37,539
sudden you're not doing this all the

557
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:40,089
time it also is much steadier and much

558
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:43,029
faster and because there's not the wear

559
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:47,589
and tear I think it's going to last so

560
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:50,079
it costs a little more but for the time

561
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:51,849
they actually come spring is half as

562
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:57,909
much and then clean that's much easier

563
00:32:51,849 --> 00:33:03,899
too because you just put some water in

564
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:09,460
there letter read this is been using and

565
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:14,610
so far really happy yeah

566
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:14,610
times important next please

567
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:23,759
or is that your story by this I was out

568
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:32,899
there one morning and saw when the

569
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:39,420
neighbors don't worry it's all organic

570
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:42,870
I'm not sure he's ready to my realtor a

571
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:56,640
few days later and she said well which

572
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:58,769
house wasn't down at all this stuff is

573
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:04,050
absolutely safe as I pointed out you can

574
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:06,240
drink it I got this why you want to the

575
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:07,589
fact is you don't need to be getting

576
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,280
this on your clothes

577
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:13,648
it does smell when the fishes minute and

578
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,800
so I found out for the first couple of

579
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:19,039
sprays that GU all yeah not gonna wash

580
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,429
these clothes and take a second shower

581
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:26,550
again more time so I'm kind of X to

582
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:30,659
costume nothing it's really cheap again

583
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:33,419
you get a bunch of these and so I just

584
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:36,960
cover up and I'm gonna take this top off

585
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:43,819
my clothes are fine so that's the way to

586
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,820
do it so yeah you don't need to breathe

587
00:34:50,500 --> 00:35:03,349
next so what does all this do well

588
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:05,750
starting in the winter it really

589
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:07,909
provides a good wakeup for the plant get

590
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:11,030
things started I think if you do this

591
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:13,339
you'll really notice that you have but

592
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:15,820
break and then you spray and then all

593
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:19,490
the sudden things go

594
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:22,700
y-yeah you know between the rain and

595
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:25,879
general Sun and merge that's a factor

596
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:29,869
but boy it's different once you start

597
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:32,210
spraying with the apples I noticed that

598
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:35,869
they were much larger the flavor was

599
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:38,510
better I have not had any more alcohol

600
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:41,000
maggot I should mention that the year

601
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:43,730
before it started this a trade tried the

602
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,340
little net things where you go around a

603
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:51,769
little fruit and put these babies on I

604
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:55,820
hated that job I spent like five hours

605
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:56,639
doing it it didn't work I was really

606
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,720
happy

607
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:02,079
never did that

608
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:05,709
yeah so much rather spend an hour every

609
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,869
two weeks during analysis the bags don't

610
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:11,309
do anything except supposedly keep the

611
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:16,019
bikes up with abrasive mention already

612
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:18,789
totally eliminated the mummy girly and

613
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:22,389
senior man and then everywhere else

614
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:29,619
there's a marked increase in yield with

615
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:31,659
appears I if you spray on the day we're

616
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:34,510
this bright Sun which is going to be

617
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:37,179
anytime in july/august here we have a

618
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:43,030
chance that to get a photo sensitivity

619
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:49,089
reaction on some of them needs to get

620
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:52,150
black spots and won't show it I roses

621
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:56,800
not usually fun is a fruit but we get a

622
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:59,170
terrible of black Leafs like that it's

623
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,390
not eradicated it's still there but it's

624
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:04,740
controlled we've got really good roses

625
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:05,920
no it's more like I do spray those

626
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:09,309
raspberries

627
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:14,349
better slice and you know strawberries

628
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:16,299
bigger better tasting plants I highly

629
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:18,369
recommend to see pictures of in a few

630
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:22,390

so yeah this is a grapefruit not well

634
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,280
known to most modern Americans but most

635
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:40,019
beautifully here you don't mind bread

636
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:46,150
mix the walkway because it stains but

637
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:52,659

stager persimmon and we'll see coming up

640
00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:00,000
also a blue crab passion flower of

641
00:37:57,849 --> 00:38:04,150
government for eight a couple of times

642
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:23,889
really nice flowers so let's show some

643
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:30,340
elements next place LM going ever very

644
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:33,789
for a treehouse I try to keep it so

645
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:39,490
again you know you don't want to be

646
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:42,369
picking small I admire people grow sweet

647
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:42,939
cherries but no I try to keep it with

648
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:49,949
every

649
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:49,950
that's crazy so there's an amateur and

650
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,680
they look like what trying to pick them

651
00:38:56,199 --> 00:39:04,808
when they're all black but the birds

652
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:09,489
people I found that the aluminum of my

653
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:15,369
water sphere tape works very well our

654
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:17,439
dog also likes these so I decided that

655
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:27,548
I'll just share with the birds and

656
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:29,470
easily fit Robins next serve got dog

657
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:32,639
won't breeze in the colander and this

658
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:35,048
was my best year on the advert cause

659
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:38,318
this year I will be God

660
00:39:35,048 --> 00:39:50,798
I think they're really pretty but I only

661
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:55,088
got three this year okay next I've got

662
00:39:50,798 --> 00:39:57,599
one apple tree left and it's Cortland it

663
00:39:55,088 --> 00:40:01,389
seems to be a biennial bearers not

664
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,809
necessarily supposed to be but I ended

665
00:40:01,389 --> 00:40:03,808
up bringing

666
00:40:04,389 --> 00:40:17,528
it's more than we can eat but it seemed

667
00:40:08,778 --> 00:40:23,829
next so let's clean I don't see bugs

668
00:40:17,528 --> 00:40:29,920
spray yeah miss Canada this year

669
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:32,119
no this year are quite a little baby not

670
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:37,099
really not much at all

671
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:40,660
next please I got two real girls like

672
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:45,849
that about this one small trade Wow

673
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:49,129
and later next that's one of the

674
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:50,450
passiflora national flowers pretty good

675
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:58,749
or something that's supposed to be a

676
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:58,748
tropical plant from Brazil next appears

677
00:40:59,978 --> 00:41:05,960
in the next place

678
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:07,879
there's the acquaintance I'm pleased to

679
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,309
say after being frustrated with this

680
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:13,849
tree for several years I've got about

681
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:18,230
ten this year for some reason

682
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:24,980
just once I'd probably need a ladder for

683
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:29,809
those next blueberries in the best every

684
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:35,719
couple of days they're really pretty

685
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:37,639
clean this is what they look like so in

686
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:41,389
other words since their growth with

687
00:41:37,639 --> 00:42:00,349
grace is really pretty few weeks from

688
00:41:41,389 --> 00:42:07,569
now by next and the next one this was a

689
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:07,569
plan the Buffalo currents or right

690
00:42:12,028 --> 00:42:47,949
and it's normally a tremendous amount of

691
00:42:42,518 --> 00:43:00,639
sour cherries but this year cause the

692
00:42:47,949 --> 00:43:15,818
trees just covered if you deceive you

693
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:18,278
like because it's imported that to get

694
00:43:15,818 --> 00:43:21,219
about that if you get affirm Raintree

695
00:43:18,278 --> 00:43:26,998
the first year I started out and leaped

696
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:26,999
out about a week before it throws

697
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:33,750
it came back the next year of the early

698
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:39,650
crew and slowly slowly it's got the

699
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:39,650
point where it's now about 15 Tennessee

700
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:51,778
last year there were about a hundred I

701
00:43:43,108 --> 00:43:53,940
couldn't find my pictures it's really a

702
00:43:51,778 --> 00:43:58,018
beautiful tree in all seasons

703
00:43:53,940 --> 00:44:01,650
it's both big green it's got these

704
00:43:58,018 --> 00:44:07,558
peculiar little blossoms and end up with

705
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:09,298
food that's ill orange like this a lot

persimmons but this will be ready

708
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:17,849
summer after Thanksgiving so it's sort

709
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,980
of the catheter the season line the

710
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:22,200
fruit would be ready have double beets

711
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,869
inverted fallen off so you've got these

712
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:29,159
yellow orange fruit on the bitter traits

713
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:31,858
really pretty striking anyway that's the

714

branches and Trunks to the trailer the

720
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:25,389
very ready to spray again what we're

721
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:27,050
doing this is beefing it up with its

the driest summers

727
00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:57,269
why should point out to with a mulch

728
00:45:54,570 --> 00:46:02,780
I've got an inch layer of mulch

729
00:45:57,269 --> 00:46:06,150
i watered maybe three times as here okay

730
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:09,990
rubbish for this whole thing I want

731
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:24,900
those trees to have deep roots in terms

732
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:28,919
of nutrition that's easily chips

733
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:33,269
yeah then the radio wood chips of the

734
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:36,599
best coming out yeah less than two inch

735
00:46:33,269 --> 00:46:39,750
diameter that's good bit of labour the

736
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:45,690
chip these otherwise you want to use her

737
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:49,800
glutes all their best around here but

738
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:56,570
yeah you don't want cedar Cedars got a

739
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:56,570
pungent throat sorry how hard

740
00:47:38,010 --> 00:49:10,930
the question about in the springtime

741
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:13,660
with the spraying you have to be careful

742
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:15,818
about the blooming time and then you do

743
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:18,639
coming to the tree will be in full bloom

744
00:49:15,818 --> 00:49:20,500
and still spray or I've done it in every

745
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:23,469
stage you know different trees are going

746
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:42,789
to be a different stages and Michael

747
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:44,980
addresses that the book is well I really

748
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:47,858
watch this I've sprayed I've gone out

749
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:50,019
the same day and seen plenty of

750
00:49:47,858 --> 00:49:53,159
pollinators working on the same stuff

751
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:57,099
that got sprayed a few hours before so

752
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:59,519
clearly it's not exporting them from

753
00:49:57,099 --> 00:49:59,519
nearest

754
00:50:01,849 --> 00:50:07,289
I've got a question about your recipe

755
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:09,058
like on a four gallon line here you

756
00:50:07,289 --> 00:50:10,410
start with four gallons of water and

757
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:14,609
then add these other things to do other

758
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:18,629
I don't know quick and how I do it is

759
00:50:14,608 --> 00:50:19,650
something along the lines of all I heat

760
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:22,229
up the water

761
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:25,588
I put in the molasses and get that mixed

762
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:28,368
in the Negroes in this is sort of waters

763
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:28,369
warm already

764
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:38,278
so the need goes in while it's still

765
00:50:36,298 --> 00:50:44,278
warm and that's already been mixed with

766
00:50:38,278 --> 00:50:47,880
the Bronner soak so that emulsifies then

767
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:51,478
I went downstairs and person the fish I

768
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:55,979
put in the microbes they put in the kelp

769
00:50:51,478 --> 00:51:02,068
and the spreader sticker that goes in

770
00:50:55,978 --> 00:51:05,129
the sprayers then I have any herbal teas

771
00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:08,818
if I'm using them and then I fill up the

772
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:10,559
rest with warm water and then you go

773
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:13,038
straight to work you don't let it sit

774
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,450
because you want to keep things warm

775
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,580
keep in mind when it comes out with a

776
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:20,980
spray it's kind of cool

777
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:22,840
kill me in that way what you don't want

778
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:26,460
to do except for one or two hot so

779
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:31,630
they're killing your beneficial microbes

780
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:37,119
but no you don't mix it all I just stay

781
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:38,550
out of the water together how much water

782
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:44,890
I missing something

783
00:51:38,550 --> 00:52:05,680
worth it how does a cordial expressive

784
00:51:44,889 --> 00:52:08,980
in the tea I use a quart of each so how

785
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:10,929
do you determine how much to spray any

786
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:13,329
particular plan you've got small

787
00:52:10,929 --> 00:52:15,909
blueberry patch got big trees probably

788
00:52:13,329 --> 00:52:18,849
can't over these though but how do you

789
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:21,429
make sure you get them enough ah it's

790
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:24,819
good question particularly with the

791
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:25,868
electorate sprayer it comes up nicely

792
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:29,109
and evenly

793
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:33,358
I knew it so that it looks like I'm

794
00:52:29,108 --> 00:52:36,279
giving some on each leaf gonna be fruit

795
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:40,840
and on the stones a little bit on the

796
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:44,790
ground as you said we can't have too

797
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,789
much occasionally

798
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:52,480
[Music]

799
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,929
quickly some of the trees are bigger

800
00:52:52,480 --> 00:53:01,719
than the tops but the plant will slow

801
00:52:55,929 --> 00:53:15,219
down some respect I think there's a lot

802
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:25,500
of leeway it's a curious question what

803
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:29,859
is neat oil this

804
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:31,900
it's got insurance or ingredients that

805
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:37,110
come along with it all right turbine

806
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:42,760
blades so these are essential oils

807
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:50,019
thicker more oily more small like do I

808
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:52,000
have room temperature but you know good

809
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:53,230
thing about the book is if you really

810
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,570
want to dig in

811
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:58,750
he's got a lot of explanation for the

812
00:53:55,570 --> 00:54:02,260
reasons behind this also he can dig up

813
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:04,809
the references there in America he can

814
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:08,760
get it under a very scientific level you

815
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:12,989
want yeah but that's important to do I

816
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,990
need aggressive Florida

817
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:21,169
do you have a fertilizer program in

818
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:26,000
addition to the spray or is this a hard

819
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:30,880
lesson I bulk I do this and that's it

820
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,880
the exception is I use organic

821
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:37,939
fertilizers of spring and fall just a

822
00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:43,639
little graze because you know they're

823
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:48,740
not native here and it's a special tax

824
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:59,529
again from Raintree its passive yes it

825
00:54:48,739 --> 00:55:03,579
lands additionally I haven't provided

826
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:13,150
compost or nitrogen in any form anything

827
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:13,150
last and it's thrown like crazy

828
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:21,000
you spray on me degrading women yeah

829
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:23,849
good question you don't want to spray

830
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:28,289
unless you've got like four hours for

831
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:31,490
things to say no this year isn't our

832
00:55:28,289 --> 00:55:34,800
problem some years is really a problem

833
00:55:31,489 --> 00:55:38,250
particularly the spray get that right

834
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:42,690
again say it's going to be sunny you

835
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:45,480
probably Grutter oh and get it on as I

836
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:48,019
mentioned if it's bright Sun in the

837
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:50,579
afternoon it's possibly get some

838
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:51,599
photosensitivity reactions a lot of this

839
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:54,299
would be because they're going to be

840
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:57,600
droplets on the plant that acts like a

841
00:55:54,300 --> 00:56:03,260
magnifying glass to the sunrise

842
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:03,259
ladies so it's not necessarily chemical

843
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:12,750
magnification we have to do is type of

844
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:17,880
Awesome

845
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:23,519
he said enzymes are breaking it down so

846
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:24,890
it's not a big protein that smaller yeah

847
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:29,009
it would be considered like a

848
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:32,279
fermentation so it's treated with

849
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:35,550
enzymes what it means is that the planet

850
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:38,519
can get benefit of the nitrogen and

851
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:40,410
other nutrients really quickly because

852
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:45,769
it doesn't have to break them down and

853
00:56:40,409 --> 00:56:45,769
you can't benefit of not smelling as bad

854
00:57:17,909 --> 00:57:20,989

[Music]

857
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:56,929
with the chips last long

858
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:24,809
[Music]

859
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:41,219

00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:58,340

[Music]

862
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:07,769
yeah I think it's great I admire people

863
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:10,880
that have a discipline do the big pluses

864
00:59:07,769 --> 00:59:14,130
that said I'm not sure I'm needed

865
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,990
between the spray and the thick layer of

866
00:59:14,130 --> 01:00:29,280
Polish

867
00:59:15,989 --> 01:00:32,459
I talked about disease-resistant

868
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,390
varieties which i think is the great

869
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:37,369
foundation

870
01:00:33,389 --> 01:00:37,368
yeah sure I did in relation

871
01:01:06,989 --> 01:01:10,079
[Music]

872
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:57,569
is it an optimum if you had any time

873
01:01:52,920 --> 01:02:00,829
that you do a double dose of need in the

874
01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:02,720
winter and last spring in the fall

875
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:06,319
Freitas

876
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:10,079
like just in the editor you to be humble

877
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:14,730
but fish in the fall that help break

878
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:18,210
down the residual leaves and stuff oh I

879
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:21,869
got excited if you have too much mean

880
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:27,480
you sittin there cooling down and coming

881
01:02:21,869 --> 01:02:44,519
up your sprayer you know again system

882
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:48,500
that experiment do you have to lose

883
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:53,280
plenty of the chips like and dishes

884
01:02:48,500 --> 01:03:01,639
no I can't eat interested blasted my

885
01:02:53,280 --> 01:03:04,980
third season they weren't very small but

886
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:08,219
yeah I think you can dig down see what's

887
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:10,730
going on in the soil again I have

888
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:22,018
another water pistol

889
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:22,019
[Music]

890
01:03:50,889 --> 01:03:54,069
[Music]

891
01:04:03,338 --> 01:04:14,078
also trying to be friends yeah electric

892
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:26,239
fences work to support my chance

893
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:28,940
yeah well there's a guy Johnny you know

894
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:34,458
I am serious about the dog because my

895
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:41,679
wife when I was here we are in the jar

896
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:41,679
regularly eating my plants that stop

897
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:49,889
so I was just looking in the book about

898
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:52,710
that moment Barry business and talk

899
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:54,659
about a little source there grab and I

900
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:55,199
didn't see that but sure I've never seen

901
01:04:54,659 --> 01:04:58,230
it before

902
01:04:55,199 --> 01:05:03,139
sure yeah there it is you can do about

903
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:07,199
mommy birdies you want to disturb the

904
01:05:03,139 --> 01:05:11,789
material around the tree - so around the

905
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:17,429
bush and you want to replenish pine

906
01:05:11,789 --> 01:05:21,920
needles preferably each season that

907
01:05:17,429 --> 01:05:21,919
alone but the spray does a great job

908
01:05:31,489 --> 01:05:44,779
later steamy mrs. forest land it's

909
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:46,920
described in the spray really there's no

910
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:49,260
I'll take one more

911
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:52,800
if do you mulch all the way out to the

912
01:05:49,260 --> 01:06:00,270
leaf line on the tree or just yeah

913
01:05:52,800 --> 01:06:03,350
that's the best advice that the

914
01:06:00,269 --> 01:06:03,349
surrounding soil

915
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:09,819
but jumped out would be the least amount
