2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:10,019
for decades it's been the habit of most

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,240
cannabis growers to dedicate themselves

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,939
to using several bottles of various

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,109
synthetic nutrients to grow their plants

6
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:18,509
what we've seen in the last few years

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,429
though is a revival of natural growing

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,560
techniques that focus on building

9
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:25,230
healthy soil which in turn grows

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,089
thriving plants instead of dumping raw

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,518
chemicals into the soil and demanding it

12
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:31,439
grow true gardeners are learning to work

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,359
in cooperation with the soil and its

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,009
inhabitants to create the healthiest

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,039
environment possible for their plans to

16
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,649
live these natural cannabis growers work

17
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,839
with the soils microbe communities fungi

18
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,730
and organic food web to strike a balance

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,980
where they no longer need to add raw

20
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:48,689
nutrients at all because the soil itself

21
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,599
contains everything the plant needs to

22
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:53,369
thrive naturally if you enjoy hearing

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,320

48
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,420
show host I was fortunate to have the

49
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:51,030
opportunity here Jeff speak at the 2016

50
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,820
Emerald cup in Sonoma California he is

51
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,829
an incredibly lively speaker and he kept

52
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,500
the room laughing with fallacious jokes

53
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:00,118
about fungi in the food web I knew I had

54
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,978
to ask him to come on this show and he

55
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,618
was kind enough to accept the invitation

56
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,688
welcome to the show Jeff host my

57
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:09,360
pleasure to be here so Jeff when I was a

58
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:11,669
kid the folks on my block would would

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,710
actually cook their soil in old coffee

60
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:16,099
containers on the grill to make

61
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,659
it was good and dead before adding their

62
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:21,060
store-bought inputs and potting up their

63
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:23,099
plants but now though the idea of

64
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,900
creating a living soil community to

65
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,370
nourish the plants instead of just

66
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,250
adding nitrogen phosphorus and potassium

67
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,030
is really taking over and for many

68
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,740
growers the idea of creating a

69
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,140
self-sustaining soil system instead of

70
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,570
just pouring in more fertilizers is a

71
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:41,879
huge jump in their thinking how do you

72
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,250
like to describe living soil in a way

73
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,829
that makes sense to folks who are new to

74
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,520
thinking about it this way great

75
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,640
question

76
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,170
and it takes me back to my father's

77
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,839
sterilizer he has the biggest compost

78
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:57,439
pile literally in the town I mean this

79
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,200
was almost half an acre of compost and

80
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:04,710
and he would then take that compost and

81
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,599
put it into a sterilizer Wow I remember

82
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,730
how bad it smelled so let's start right

83
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,099
there I think he could you could sort of

84
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:14,569
say that you know living living soil is

85
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:19,169
all that smell that occurs when you

86
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:22,620
sterilize soil and and so I would start

87
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:24,209
right there obviously soil is is not

88
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,670
what it used to be we used to think it

89
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,550
was just this inert substance that was

90
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:32,639
there to hold plants and on which you

91
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,920
could put fertilizer and you know which

92
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,299
allowed water to drain through we now

93
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:40,409
know that that's absolutely not true

94
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,210
it's organic matter its minerals from

95
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:46,969
rocks that have broken down over the

96
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:50,070
eons and it is a tremendous amount of

97
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:54,030
living organisms which require oxygen

98
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:56,579
and water in order to be able to live so

99
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,530
it's it's completely different than what

100
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,870
it was when you and I were were younger

101
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,819
yeah absolutely my actually my dad did

102
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,129
that same thing with with taking his

103
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,289
soil and sterilizing it and and nowadays

104
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,269
when we think about living soil it's

105
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:12,689
much more of a instead of considering it

106
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:14,520
in an inert thing it's it's more about a

107
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:16,589
neighborhood we're trying to create a

108
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,199
neighborhood of good neighbors that'll

109
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,419
that'll you know be a nice buffet for

110
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,879
the plant instead of essentially being

111
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,830
dead and therefore needing to rely on us

112
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,730
for everything well I think what we're

113
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:28,349
really trying to set

114
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,700
yeah you're right we're trying to set up

115
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,240
a neighborhood and so if you've got a

116
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:36,930
good a good soil situation what you got

117
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,629
is a condominium that's operating

118
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,670
properly so it's a it's a perfectly

119
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:44,430
constructed condominium never needs any

120
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,439
repairs it's got all of the inhabitants

121
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,199
that you'd want to have in a condominium

122
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,540
so that everybody has fun and they can

123
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,519
you know help each other out and they

124
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,530
don't irritate each other too much and

125
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:59,310
they take care of the bad guys when they

126
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:02,039
appear and and it's fully stocked with

127
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,240
great food so everybody has a great time

128
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,160
in that condominium you're absolutely

129
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,650
right it's you know it's a neighborhood

130
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,689
it's a condominium of you know that just

131
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:15,629
hums and it really is the soil food web

132
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:18,750
concept that's taking over I think you

133
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:21,240
know how we're looking at not just how

134
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,899
we grow cannabis but it's how we grow

135
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:28,290
food it's how we what we eat it's how we

136
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:30,569
eat it's why we eat the comparison

137
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,650
between the stomach and how it operates

138
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:33,719
I should say the stomach with the

139
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:36,599
intestines and how it operates you know

140
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,340
versus you know the the soil food web

141
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,800
mean at all is everything ties together

142
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,949
it's a beautiful beautiful system so

143
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,500
because there are so many ways to coax a

144
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:48,959
biologically active community along in

145
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,449
the soil what do you see is a good place

146
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,039
for a beginner to start well I think

147
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:57,329
compost is always the best place to

148
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:59,430
start yeah you know compost contains in

149
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:04,500
it all of the organisms that you'd

150
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:07,650
really want to have just to hold the the

151
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,089
foods that the plants eat and or that

152
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:11,909
yeah well I guess that's the proper term

153
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:14,189
and in all of the organisms that eat

154
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,010
those organisms and poop out that food

155
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:20,189
so that it's available in plant usable

156
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,839
form so it's got all of the fungi and

157
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:23,879
the bacteria which are at the bottom of

158
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,919
the soil food web and then it's got the

159
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,290
nematodes and protozoa in phenomenal

160
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,870
numbers and that that cycle the

161
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:33,830
nutrients so that so that compost

162
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,120
becomes usable for the plants and and

163
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:37,859
you know compost is just the easiest

164
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,379
thing to get your hands on it's easy to

165
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,379
make it's it's easy to buy course

166
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:45,149
by lousy compost but it's also easy to

167
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,980
buy good compost and it's easy to make

168
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:49,859
so I would start right there that's

169
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,750
that's that's the be all beginning so so

170
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,490
when people have you know found their

171
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,779
way to either a good source to buy their

172
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,340
compost or they've done a little

173
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:58,679
homework and they've figured out how to

174
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,289
make compost at home most folks tend to

175
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,540
move on from that to nutrient teas and

176
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,819
and we're huge fans of nutrient teas

177
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,740
you're exchanging fire one of your what

178
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,949
are some of your favorite wild crafted

179
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,900
nutrient teas for encouraging probiotic

180
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:14,339
growth in the soil well again I mean

181
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,629
let's think you're thinking in terms of

182
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,729
the beginner I mean you take that

183
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,290
compost your rises once you have that

184
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,850
compost then you learn that you can do

185
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:24,060
designer things with it you can make

186
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,310
more fungally dominated compost or more

187
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,459
bacterial dominated compost for cannabis

188
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:33,509
you want that clearly dominated compost

189
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:36,989
and and for all sorts of reasons you

190
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:38,879
could make teas out of that compost and

191
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,500
you can make fungally dominated teas or

192
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,899
more fungally dominated teas and and

193
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,879
that clearly dominated teas which you

194
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:47,399
can use as soil drenches and which you

195
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,129
can then spray also on the leaves where

196
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:53,250
the microbes that are in that compost

197
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:55,079
tea out-compete the bacteria that well

198
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,639
actually yeah the bacteria in the fungi

199
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:59,099
and the bit and the nemetes the bad guys

200
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,990
that might be on those leaves or might

201
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,060
get on those leaves so if you spray good

202
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,040
stuff on them there's no room for the

203
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,780
bad guys there's no food left of the bad

204
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,740
guys there's no entry ways for the bad

205
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:12,599
guys so compost he definitely something

206
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,569
that people want to get into the

207
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,510
intermediate step would be a compost

208
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:20,009
extracts you don't need a brewer you

209
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:23,430
don't need a tremendous amount of time

210
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:25,319
in 15 minutes you can you can take

211
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,790
compost wrap wrap it up and in

212
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:32,129
cheesecloth and this just need it in a

213
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:34,200
in a you know a couple of gallons of

214
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:36,120
water then you've got you've got an

215
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,560
extract of a lot of those microbes they

216
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,200
haven't multiplied themselves but you

217
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,728
pull them out of the compost and then

218
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,060
the next step of course is the compost

219
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,680
teas which require a brewer it's often

220
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:50,369
called fermentation because you're

221
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:52,529
brewing the tea you're taking energy and

222
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,789
you're pulling out the bacteria and the

223
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:57,120
fungi and the nematode

224
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:59,459
the protozoa and you're then feeding

225
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,289
them and causing them to either grow or

226
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:07,410
to multiply or to change their ratios

227
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:09,360
during a 24 to 48 hour period and that

228
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:12,719
that to many people is sort of the

229
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,519
ultimate way of adding biology I would

230
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,269
have said so when I wrote teaming with

231
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,870
microbes

232
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:21,179
the first edition back in 2006 I'm

233
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:24,179
beginning to think that it is certainly

234
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:25,889
important but that there are other

235
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:29,129
things that you can do namely

236
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:31,830
mycorrhizal fungi which which can be

237
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:35,129
added of course we already know about

238
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:38,460
adding nitrogen fixing bacteria to the

239
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:41,279
proper plants so so I think I think

240
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,769
compost tea is a large part of a bigger

241
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,959
picture so when you were talking about

242
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:49,259
the nutrient teas you were talking about

243
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,480
a fungally dominant one and and then or

244
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:54,419
bacteria lead um or or bacteria lead um

245
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,009
and and um you know a lot of people who

246
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:58,769
have not gotten to the point yet where

247
00:09:56,009 --> 00:10:00,269
they're prepared for a Brewer either

248
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:01,319
they don't quite have the budget yet or

249
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,629
they're just you know on their learning

250
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,270
path and they're just not there yet um

251
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:08,490
they'll be probably be using more the

252
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:10,379
the second version that you suggested

253
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,399
which is simply take your compost and

254
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:16,139
put it in some in some cheesecloth and

255
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:18,689
squeeze it in grab you a five-gallon

256
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:20,429
bucket of water that has had the you

257
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,320
know chlorine vaped off of it or

258
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:24,959
whatever and then there's and use that

259
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,000
to to water your plants and that's great

260
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,310
but some folks still would like to be

261
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,370
able to get that fungal e dominant tea

262
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:35,969
effect can you suggest a way that we can

263
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:38,129
perhaps inoculate our compost pile so

264
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,710
there's going to be more mycelium there

265
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:44,070
for when we do this this squeeze the

266
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,690
cheesecloth approach sure well well what

267
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,720
happens of course is that if you add

268
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,920
more Brown material to your compost pile

269
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,290
particularly once you've got that

270
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,419
compost cooking and really going you're

271
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:58,620
breaking down more more materials which

272
00:10:54,419 --> 00:11:01,939
which are likely to feed the fungi so

273
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,929
you can start there you can take the the

274
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,540
material that you can be using either

275
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:10,109
for your tea or for your compost extra

276
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:13,990
which is that second method and you can

277
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:17,279
inoculate it with foods that will grow

278
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:20,320
the fungi and then you take that

279
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,329
material and you use it to make your tea

280
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,190
or your extract and in that particular

281
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:30,520
instance you can use a baby oatmeal you

282
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,720
know ground-up barley but baby oatmeal

283
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,939
is probably the easiest thing to get

284
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,910
your hands on and you just simply you

285
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,860
mix it in so that you can see the flakes

286
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:41,379
and then you keep it in a dark warm area

287
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,830
for 24 48 hours and the fungal hyphae

288
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:47,529
will grow and multiply and form mycelium

289
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,930
and then you can use that block because

290
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:52,360
it will become a block for your compost

291
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:56,199
here your compost extract that will be

292
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:59,259
more fungally dominated or you can and I

293
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,330
should say you can use fungal foods in

294
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:02,740
your compost tea not in the abstract

295
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:06,700
because they're not there long enough to

296
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,710
be able to grow in a compost tea the

297
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:12,370
bacteria will start to multiply in the

298
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:14,170
first 15 20 minutes fungus will grow but

299
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,929
they really will multiply for 24 48

300
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:18,849
hours probably more like 48 hours and

301
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:21,250
really what they're doing is growing

302
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,779
them in a compost tea so you want to use

303
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,419
foods that will feed them

304
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:29,230
turns out molasses will actually feed

305
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:31,029
compost tea a fungus as well as bacteria

306
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,930
just don't use too much you'll get a lot

307
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:37,419
of bacteria if you use too much the fish

308
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:41,079
hydrolysates will will also feed the

309
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:43,179
fungi and some people use green sand in

310
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,420
their compost tea as a substrate to try

311
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:48,639
to feed fungi so yeah what you really

312
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:50,649
want to make however for cannabis is a

313
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,549
bacterial dominated tea so you really

314
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,029
don't even have to worry too much about

315
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:57,309
this stuff well then let's add just that

316
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:59,169
begs the question right so if that was a

317
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,789
how to make a fungally dominant how

318
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:02,919
would we flip to the other side and make

319
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:04,750
it more bacteria lead um well remember I

320
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:08,349
said they multiply within 20 you know

321
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:10,419
within 15 minutes if you do nothing to

322
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,860
the tea but just you know aerator for 24

323
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:12,969
hours days it's going to be multiplying

324
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,980
because they'll be living off the

325
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:18,519
organic material but if you add molasses

326
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,690
they will go nuts and

327
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,870
you know of course it's got to be non

328
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:26,470
sulfur and mil they'll multiply like

329
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:30,460
crazy a lot of people will throw a

330
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:33,490
little bit of alfalfa in their compost

331
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,259
teas the last the last couple hours

332
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,480
because there's they're covered with

333
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:38,799
protozoa and they'll multiply and so

334
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,350
you'll get a nice little mix that

335
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:44,949
recycles itself or cycles the nutrients

336
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:47,080
throughout so you know it's a pretty

337
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,330
interesting system and above and beyond

338
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,610
everything else whatever kind of tea you

339
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,470
make it's ultimately up to the plant to

340
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,870
adjust its extracts to be able to

341
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:58,090
attract what it needs so the plant will

342
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,639
adjust things to make it work right on

343
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,950
so to kind of to summarize that for

344
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,929
folks who are new to this idea and it

345
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,759
isn't just fitting in immediately you

346
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:10,739
start by taking some of your finished

347
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:13,600
compost wrapping it in a cheesecloth

348
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,639
squeezing it into a five-gallon bucket

349
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,620
of water just sort of want to do this

350
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,090
kind of kneading it for 15 minutes you

351
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,029
know you rack it up and you just need

352
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:25,060
that cheesecloth for 15 minutes just I

353
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:26,740
can make some sound effects you know and

354
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:28,750
you squeeze these things up because let

355
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,919
me let me just back up for a second just

356
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,029
to make sure for people who really don't

357
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,349
know what we're talking about that and

358
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:34,240
it's all outlined in the first book

359
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,100
teeming with microbes which by by the

360
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,620
way everybody should get and if you get

361
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,990
it and don't like it I'll buy it back at

362
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,009
three times the price I guarantee you're

363
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,870
going to you're going to get a lot of

364
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:45,340
use out of it but the bottom line is

365
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,990
what's happening is the plants are

366
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,750
putting out chemicals through their root

367
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:52,060
system that attract the bacteria and the

368
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,320
fungi and they eat the stuff that the

369
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,439
plants putting out because it's got a

370
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,330
lot of carbons in it they in turn

371
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,540
attract nematodes and protozoa who eat

372
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,980
them they poop the excess it's got a lot

373
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:04,990
of nutrients in it particularly nitrogen

374
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,039
which feeds the plant that's all

375
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,620
happening right there in the root zone

376
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:11,740
the plant can change those extra dates

377
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:14,110
to attract what it needs so you know if

378
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,820
it's if you put down something and it's

379
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,680
something in there the plant wants it'll

380
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,220
change the extra date to attract what it

381
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:24,339
needs the plant is in control not you

382
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:26,440
but again so so you you you you need the

383
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,060
stuff for 15 minutes you if you pull out

384
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,330
the nematodes on the protozoa in the

385
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:31,739
bacteria and and and the bacteria and

386
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:36,480
the

387
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:38,340
in the fungi makes soil structure and so

388
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,139
that's why you've got to use the energy

389
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,710
of your hands to make the compost

390
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:46,830
extract or the energy from a pump to

391
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:49,710
make compost tea because these things

392
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:52,770
are sticky and they they bind together

393
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:55,500
it's like the bacteria on your teeth you

394
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:57,449
don't just swish your teeth out in the

395
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,799
morning with water you brush them with a

396
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,780
lot of energy to get rid of that

397
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,629
bacterial slime and that's what you have

398
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:06,929
to do to the particle of soil to break

399
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:08,939
off that bacteria and and and and to

400
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:11,639
strip out that fungi so you use energy

401
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,380
and you make this super these T's and

402
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:17,129
then you and then you use them on your

403
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:20,370
your system and so the you know I tend

404
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:23,399
to use a what you call an aquarium pump

405
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:26,340
of that act both aerates the tea but

406
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,909
then also provides the energy to break

407
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,220
it up

408
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:31,259
do you find that that that works good

409
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,720
for you as well no because I think

410
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:35,340
unless it's a gigantic aquarium like the

411
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,050
size of the you know the monterey

412
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,269
aquarium I think the pumps probably too

413
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:41,639
small you know in the beginning we used

414
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:43,470
to use those aquarium pump a lot of

415
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,059
research was done by dr. Laningham who

416
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,860
was certainly the goddess of all of this

417
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:48,449
stuff and anytime you get a chance to go

418
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,789
hear dr. Elaine or read anything she's

419
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:54,810
written she's you know well what can I

420
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:56,699
say I mean we bow at her feet but yeah

421
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:59,519
those pumps don't don't provide the six

422
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:03,780
or seven parts per million air that you

423
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,700
really need and so you really got it you

424
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:08,490
really got to step up the air if you

425
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,910
want to make it really work so write out

426
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:13,380
great I'm glad I have that glycogen you

427
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:16,200
shouldn't use those aquarium stones

428
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,450
either because those stones when you

429
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,819
turn the pump off fill up with water and

430
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:23,490
it's got the bacterial slime in it it

431
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,529
forms and grows in those little little

432
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,599
holes and they're impossible to clean

433
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:31,170
and then you get bad situations so you

434
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,599
just you know just bubble sure sure yeah

435
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:36,120
so after after folks have gotten into

436
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,039
you know nutrient and compost teas a lot

437
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,619
of folks really enjoy moving on to

438
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,299
fermentations and labs and such what are

439
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:45,029
your favorite fermentations for thriving

440
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:46,769
soil well you know I don't

441
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:49,470
I'm not really into them in a big way

442
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:51,960
you're talking about eeehm and yeah

443
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,339
exactly yeah you know to me if you're

444
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,600
using compost tea you're getting what

445
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,869
you need

446
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,879
eeehm is it certainly works that means

447
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:02,009
people tell me it works I don't use it

448
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,450
other than making Bo Kashi in the

449
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:06,420
wintertime because it's a great way to

450
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:09,140
so that make compost in a cold climate

451
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:11,779
in the winter without getting smells

452
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:15,509
when your piles not working obviously

453
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:18,000
but but it's got you know six six 15 16

454
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:20,339
different microbes in it compost tea is

455
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,769
35 thousand different microbes and you

456
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:25,529
know there's a world of difference and I

457
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:27,450
think the diversity makes sense when you

458
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:29,339
when you believe that the it's the plant

459
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,900
that's choosing what it needs going to

460
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:33,179
give it as much opportunity to choose

461
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,950
what it what it really needs so I like

462
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,049
the diversity of compost tea over these

463
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,600
ferments but but I'm certainly not

464
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:42,450
discouraging of them I think all of them

465
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,250
do one thing that that's important and

466
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,250
that was sort of outlined in the second

467
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:49,559
book teeming with nutrients which don't

468
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,630
guarantee cuz I think it's a much more

469
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:53,819
difficult book to get to but I think

470
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:57,120
it's an important book and that is the

471
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:58,740
law of return and we we violate the law

472
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,899
of return when we deal with soils

473
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,630
because we harvest things from that soil

474
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,030
that stuff's supposed to fall down and

475
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,980
be decade and go back in and feed the

476
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:10,769
plant again and feed the soil again and

477
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,839
feed the microbes again we harvest it so

478
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:15,869
you know we're taking stuff away and

479
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,879
when you put these ferments in you're

480
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:19,469
adding a lot of some of the stuff that

481
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,210
you've taken away you're you're you're

482
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:25,500
helping to rebalance the Law of Return

483
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,819
right that makes it yeah yeah I follow

484
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
you right so we're going to take our

485
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:30,210
first short break and be right back you

486
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,099
are listening to shaping fire and my

487
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,220
guest today is organic gardener and

488
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:36,929
author Jeff Lowen tells if you grow

489
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,029
cannabis with sunshine you can often

490
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,710
feel limited by the seasonal cycle you

491
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:42,480
want to grow sustainably and save money

492
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,490
so you use as little electricity as

493
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,349
possible but if you haven't studied or

494
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,849
implemented light deprivation techniques

495
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:49,589
into your greenhouse you're leaving a

496
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:51,089
lot of money on the table by

497
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,799
incorporating light deprivation

498
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,329
solutions into your greenhouse you can

499
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,399
often add two or three additional

500
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,990
growing cycles to your year when you

501
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,220
pencil out the financial benefit of

502
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,870
those additional size

503
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,150
you'll realize why commercial-scale

504
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:05,699
light deprivation technology is remaking

505
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,380
the cannabis industry what used to be

506
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,180
done by pulling tarps over hoop houses

507
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,410
has been scaled up over the last few

508
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,990
years in such a way that has become

509
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,279
mechanized easy and affordable to even

importance of intelligent greenhouse

benefit of incorporating light depth

528
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:52,230

forward slash FFG to find out more now

548
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,330
that the health benefits of terpenes

549
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,430
have become well known in the cannabis

550
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:36,929
industry people everywhere are looking

551
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,910
for the purest terpenes without

552
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,500
adulterants the problem with most

553
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:42,540
chirping providers is that they're not

554
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,059
sourced naturally and instead are made

555
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:47,579
as a byproduct of refining petroleum and

556
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:49,169
that's so sketchy the terpenes sold by

557
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:52,289
true terpenes are entirely different

558
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:54,060
they are certified organic non-gmo and

559
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:56,639
food grade that means that they are

560
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:58,500
extracted from real plant sources there

561
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,630
are no solvents of any kind they are

562
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,990
distilled only with steam that's right

563
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:05,640
only steam in fact terpenes from true

564
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,920
turbines are so pure that you can eat

565
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,259
them not only that but you can stack

566
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,310
them with better results - what I mean

567
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:14,470
is other company's turbines have

568
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:16,389
a few percent of impurities and when you

569
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,640
stack those terpenes to make your blend

570
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,070
you're adding a variety of impurities

571
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,480
that degrade your final product true

572
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:24,819

organic gardener and author Jeff

601
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:29,529
lowenfeld so Jeff you know often with

602
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,539
crossover gardeners coming from foods

603
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,980
and ornamentals over to cannabis they

604
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:34,990
don't know too much about cannabis

605
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,029
sativa but you know from hearing you

606
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,910
today and more especially listening to

607
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:41,950
your 2017 emerald-cut presentation you

608
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,269
definitely seem familiar with growing it

609
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:47,019
where did you learn about growing

610
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:49,990
cannabis Qi where did I learn about

611
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:54,940
growing cannabis um I'm trying to think

612
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:58,900
I was I guess I was in college so back

613
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:02,410
in the oh my god it was a long time ago

614
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:04,090
um maybe I was in law school when I grew

615
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:06,400
my first plant but I've always grown

616
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:08,139
things and cannabis is you know and I

617
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,690
tell people aside for those who don't

618
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,400
don't know on this broadcast I write a

619
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:15,460
garden column I've been writing one for

620
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,300
oh my god forty some odd years for the

621
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:22,029
Anchorage newspaper in Alaska and and uh

622
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:23,619
you know I write about cannabis now

623
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:25,019
because is legal here and I tell people

624
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:27,869
it's just a plain

625
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,700
so it doesn't take any real special

626
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:32,219
skills to grow I think the biggest

627
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:35,400
problem that I am beginning to notice

628
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,500
with growing cannabis is that there are

629
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,630
too many myths that people follow

630
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,579
without thinking about what they're

631
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:44,010
doing and why those myths may might have

632
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:47,250
developed and why they might might be

633
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:50,220
myths and and therefore not fact but I

634
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:54,539
started way back when back in the I

635
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:58,160
guess back in the late 60s growing

636
00:24:54,539 --> 00:25:02,009
cannabis first in my apartment in Boston

637
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,779
then I moved to Alaska I remember having

638
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:06,619
a couple of cannabis plants here it was

639
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:09,859
legal because our Supreme Court back in

640
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:13,489
1975 came out with a conclusion that our

641
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:16,319
Constitution allows you to grow cannabis

642
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:18,359
privacy of your home and so I had some

643
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:21,359
cannabis plants growing on my property

644
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,309
and I remember my father coming up to

645
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,279
visit and wandering around saying gee

646
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:27,869
what is that plant and he was he was the

647
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,430
guy that taught me all the stuff I knew

648
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:31,949
about growing plants although he had

649
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:33,390
never seen a cannabis plant so I've been

650
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:36,059
growing it for a long time it's been

651
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:40,800
legal here in Alaska as I said since

652
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:42,509
1975 and therefore I've had a lot of you

653
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,159
know opportunity to practice without

654
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:45,990
having to worry about the law coming

655
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,640
down on my head yeah that makes a lot of

656
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,470
sense it must be really exciting for you

657
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,110
you know with your relationship with the

658
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:54,390
plant going so far back and now suddenly

659
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:56,250
people asking you more questions about

660
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,750
cannabis instead of you know the more

661
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,609
traditional gardening topics that you

662
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:01,230
might get through your column it must be

663
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:03,929
interesting and exciting for you to be

664
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:06,539
able to you know talk more about this

665
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,980
plant that you love now that it's it you

666
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,930
know it's being normalized across the

667
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,910
rest of the country yeah I mean for the

668
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:14,519
most interesting thing is first of all

669
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:16,350
that my both of my publishers timber

670
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:21,150
press which has published all three of

671
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:25,679
my books you know said this books got to

672
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:27,810
have cannabis in it Wow have they said

673
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:31,140
that to me in 2006 teeming with microbes

674
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:34,409
would have been all about cannabis but

675
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,450
my publisher in my newspaper also has

676
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:39,058
said gee we in your column we'd like you

677
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:42,419
to address cannabis what

678
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:46,288
a lock you know I don't have to disguise

679
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:47,850
it as a tomato planned anymore it's

680
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:48,628
really quite a change so that's that's

681
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:50,548
that's interesting

682
00:26:48,628 --> 00:26:52,678
the excitement is that cannabis growers

683
00:26:50,548 --> 00:26:54,599
as you know are some of the finest

684
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,610
growers in the world I mean they

685
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:59,219
I shouldn't say growers finest gardeners

686
00:26:56,609 --> 00:27:02,609
in the world and and so the opportunity

687
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:05,639
to be able to kick around questions and

688
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:09,240
and things about cannabis and to learn

689
00:27:05,638 --> 00:27:13,469
things from from them is exciting and

690
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,269
finally you know speaking of tomatoes in

691
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,679
Landers if she was a garden columnist

692
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:19,888
would have said how many times can you

693
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:22,350
repeat a tomato column to get something

694
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:25,138
new to be able to write about and

695
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:28,109
something with so much to write about

696
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:31,408
Wow it's fabulous and I am convinced on

697
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:33,719
a gardening side that cannabis is the

698
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:35,759
next tomato plant you know the tomato

699
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,129
has always been the holy grail of the

700
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:42,599
home gardener to grow a beautiful tomato

701
00:27:38,128 --> 00:27:45,689
you know and I and I think now we're

702
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:48,298
going to see cannabis replacing the

703
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,649
tomato as the holy grail plant oh that

704
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:51,868
sounds like such a beautiful vision

705
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:53,729
right there well in fact it's not even a

706
00:27:51,868 --> 00:27:56,278
vision I can tell you that three of us

707
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:59,159
are going to be speaking at the Garden

708
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:01,769
Writers Association's conference the

709
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,179
National Conference on cannabis i'm

710
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:04,169
going to be speaking about how you write

711
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:07,169
about it

712
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:08,549
you know for a generalized public we've

713
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:11,038
got a gentleman is going to be speaking

714
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:13,470
about the breeding efforts that are

715
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:19,970
going on so that it's available as a as

716
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:21,899
a you know outdoor six pack plant a

717
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:24,808
gentleman who is very very heavily

718
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:26,579
involved in in micro propagation and

719
00:28:24,808 --> 00:28:28,109
then the third part of the speaker is

720
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,788
going to be somebody who's going to be

721
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:32,609
pointing out you know some of the

722
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:35,730
stupidity that people have bought into

723
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:37,558
that has resulted in the stigma that

724
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,909
makes it difficult to write about this

725
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:41,069
stuff so it's going to be very

726
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:42,509
interesting the first time ever this

727
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:44,730
national organizations had a

728
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:46,710
conversation about a plant that I'm

729
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,980
virtually certain three-quarters of them

730
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:51,670
use you know on a weekly basis it's so

731
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,680
nice to see

732
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,740
you know we're essentially priming the

733
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,320
pump of the next generation of educators

734
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,690
to reach out to even more people you

735
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,669
know I spend a lot of time speaking with

736
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,410
with doctors and naturopaths and other

737
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:07,240
caregivers about how to work with

738
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,240
patients and their endocannabinoid

739
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,670
system and so I'm creating new educators

740
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,839
similarly with the event that you've

741
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:18,400
just described you are educating

742
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,859
gardening writers how to then reach out

743
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,080
to their following and teach them how to

744
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:25,059
grow cannabis and this is how you know

745
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:27,819
these are force multipliers of education

746
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:29,889
call absolutely I mean in once trust P

747
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:32,529
once the garden writers start writing

748
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:34,030
about it we reach and we say garden

749
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:37,960
writers but these are the folks that do

750
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:40,359
television shows and you know podcasts

751
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,150
and radio shows newspaper columns and

752
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:45,189
magazine columns and books once they

753
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:47,230
start writing about cannabis on a

754
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:50,320
regular basis the same way they write

755
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:52,569
about Tomatoes it's over folks I don't

756
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,059
care whether it's Jeff Sessions uh you

757
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:59,319
know his mother or his grandmother it's

758
00:29:55,059 --> 00:30:02,500
over because it's just a plant folks

759
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:06,429
it's just a plant well that could be a

760
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,349
good book title I really enjoy seeing

761
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,779
all the people who have not ever really

762
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:12,609
kept a garden before suddenly decide

763
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:13,509
they want to start growing food because

764
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:15,399
they've had such a good experience

765
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:17,980
growing their first couple cannabis

766
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,870
plants and then realizing that that more

767
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,870
than anything cannabis is actually a

768
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:25,659
gateway to gardening absolutely yeah I

769
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:28,659
mean you know it's an easy plant to grow

770
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:30,580
yeah I mean I'll admit to grow to grow

771
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,150
really great cannabis takes a little bit

772
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:36,730
of skill but but once once you grow a

773
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:39,310
nice cannabis plant you say whoa wait a

774
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:42,400
second you know I could I can grow

775
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:43,569
anything and you can cannabis is a fun

776
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,090
plant to grow they're a couple little

777
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:48,849
tricks but once you once you nail those

778
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:50,949
down man what a fun plant to grow right

779
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:53,289
so let's get back into the garden so you

780
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,670
know gardeners use a lot of nutrients as

781
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:57,359
we were talking about in the first set

782
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:59,830
what do you see is a good model of

783
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,259
recycling these nutrients back into the

784
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:05,769
ecosystem in a sustainable way after you

785
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:08,710
harvest hmm a good model

786
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:10,470
cycling well I think what you're really

787
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:15,400
describing is sort of regenerative

788
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:17,140
gardening and if I understand your

789
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,960
question properly there are a number of

790
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:23,050
things that I do to try to again it all

791
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,390
goes back to this law of return that I

792
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:26,980
that I try to do in order to balance the

793
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:30,040
fact that I've broken the law of return

794
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:33,069
so I guess do my time this property so

795
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:35,470
first of all I reuse my soils I know a

796
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:37,779
lot of people fill their soils out at a

797
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:40,059
minimum put the soils in the compost

798
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:41,740
pile let them compost for a season or

799
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:45,190
two and then reuse them after that but I

800
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:47,470
reuse my soil right away I don't disturb

801
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,809
the roots that are in the soil I let

802
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,220
that organic matter become available to

803
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:54,190
the microbes and therefore the soil

804
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:57,579
system itself during during the growth

805
00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:00,190
of the next plant I let that root system

806
00:31:57,579 --> 00:32:02,289
act as a guide way for the new roots of

807
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:04,120
the plants that I plant in there and I

808
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:06,279
let the mycorrhizal network which I know

809
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:11,739
has developed in that pot or in that

810
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:14,859
garden bed remain undisturbed so that it

811
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:18,069
going out to get goodies which which

812
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:21,729
which I'm adding into the garden or into

813
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:24,250
the pot by a using soluble organics and

814
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:27,460
be putting compost in organics on the

815
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:29,829
surface any leaves that come off the

816
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,289
plant on the surface any sticks and

817
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:34,149
stems either go into the compost pile

818
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:36,339
that then goes on the plant or go right

819
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:38,050
on the surface of the plant and I always

820
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:40,659
always have mulch

821
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:42,639
whenever I'm growing cannabis so it

822
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,529
actually sounds like you're sounds like

823
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,800
you're that's a no-till technique really

824
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:49,119
I like but in a container and you know

825
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,319
my next question was actually going to

826
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:51,669
wrap into this I was going to ask you if

827
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:55,480
you think's it may think it makes more

828
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:58,060
sense to no-till and simply replant in

829
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,039
the same pot using fresh top amendments

830
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:02,079
that will get watered in or you more a

831
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:04,089
fan of emptying the pots in the pile and

832
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,039
and amending the whole pile but it

833
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:09,399
sounds like you're of the mind that no

834
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:11,170
just just pop out the the top of the

835
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,970
root system of the prior plant and then

836
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,710
just put your new start right on in that

837
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,019
same hole yeah I don't think you can do

838
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,950
it forever while you probably can't do

839
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:19,089
it forever you got to keep an eye on

840
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,610
what's going on but it's true

841
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:23,470
worth people experimenting and trying

842
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:26,529
you know the other system works as well

843
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:28,180
don't get me wrong but butchy you've

844
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:30,460
done a lot of work for that book let's

845
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,380
take a male plant for example people

846
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,509
just throw them out wait a second that

847
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,480
male plant has been throwing out the

848
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:40,809
extra dates that a cannabis plant throws

849
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,120
out into the soil wait why would you get

850
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:44,710
rid of that you know it's full of these

851
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,989
wonderful delicious extra dates as

852
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:48,789
Elaine says cook cooking candies and

853
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,109
stuff that these microbes love you never

854
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:51,940
throw it out just because it's a male

855
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:54,879
plant no no no no you cut off the

856
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,410
flowers you know you compost the rest do

857
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,210
you keep that soil and you plant right

858
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,740
in there's good bingo you got all the

859
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,850
extra days you need right away to start

860
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,640
with Wow

861
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:06,969
no it's it's just to me it just makes

862
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:11,079
logical sense but I've written three

863
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:13,210
books on the subject so earlier you were

864
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:15,340
talking about Bokashi and Bokashi really

865
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:17,010
seems to be taking over and for those

866
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:19,870
who don't know it's a fermented

867
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:22,180
inoculated fermented bran I guess and

868
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:23,980
and do you have any tips or insight that

869
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:25,839
you'd like to offer on making or using

870
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,940
it because you know you've probably come

871
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,700
across them over the days well you know

872
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:32,289
it's supposed to be a proprietary makes

873
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:34,599
you supposed to buy it only from people

874
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:36,670
who've got licenses to Center etc but if

875
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:38,259
you go on the internet and I won't do it

876
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:40,180
for you but you can certainly use Google

877
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:44,350
which is the cannabis growers finest

878
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:46,839
tool you can you can find all sorts of

879
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:49,869
recipes to make your own it's not hard

880
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,340
it's very very easy to do so and you can

881
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:53,710
use some of your old Bokashi to sort of

882
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,650
you know inoculate the stuff that you've

883
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:59,650
used but again to me compost is much

884
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:01,900
better than just the newsing and I can't

885
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:04,539
figure out why it's taking over right on

886
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:07,000
you know sometimes you can we came on

887
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:09,489
coming back to compost tea and it makes

888
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,789
me think that sometimes you know people

889
00:35:09,489 --> 00:35:14,649
like to get more complex just for the

890
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:16,000
complexity sake because they're active

891
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,039
learners and they're curious and they

892
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,349
want to do more and more stuff but since

893
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:23,800
we keep on circling back would you say

894
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:26,710
that you know the using a quality

895
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,630
compost tea is you know I mean the air

896
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,880
quotes this but all you need that like

897
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,119
really keep it simple and if you use the

898
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,619
compost tea you're going to

899
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:35,989
get where you want to go and if you want

900
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:37,489
to learn this extra stuff by all means

901
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:40,219
do it for your own enjoyment

902
00:35:37,489 --> 00:35:42,709
but really it's it's you're adding icing

903
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:44,750
on an already done cake well it depends

904
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:46,970
on what you're growing in I mean if

905
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:50,449
you've got phenomenal soil like we have

906
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:52,009
here in Alaska you know yeah a compost

907
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:53,869
tea is all you need our soil is full of

908
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:55,340
volcanic ash it's got all the minerals

909
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:58,130
you'd ever want cetera et cetera et

910
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:00,019
cetera I you know I understand and I

911
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,910
believe that it is possible to grow

912
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:04,789
plants without ever adding anything

913
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:08,000
other than the microbes no question in

914
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:10,610
my mind but that takes longer than you

915
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,469
want to wait perhaps you know you've got

916
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:14,480
a season you don't want to wait three

917
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:16,909
seasons you've got a business it cetera

918
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,420
et cetera and so adding stuff is not bad

919
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:22,909
and using just compost tea can certainly

920
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,650
work if you've got the right soils but

921
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:28,670
it each to his own so you've got to do

922
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:32,930
some testing now I am I am a big

923
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:35,360
believer in banding organics underneath

924
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:38,389
plants when I put them in that doesn't

925
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:41,090
mean I rototill when you put in a seed

926
00:36:38,389 --> 00:36:43,009
or you put in a transplant you make up

927
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,780
whole for it well you can put a little

928
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,130
fertilizer in down at the bottom and a

929
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,620
whole you can make the whole little

930
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,670
deeper you know I'm saying you don't

931
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:51,440
have to further you don't have to

932
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,260
rototill the whole area to destroy it

933
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,019
and still be able to apply fertilizers

934
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,730
or what I call microbe food so and

935
00:36:57,019 --> 00:37:02,449
certainly by all means you can use

936
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:04,159
solubles and and and certainly by all

937
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:05,689
means you would want to use mulches and

938
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:07,849
compost site includes one of those

939
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,450
mulches what is that term you use this

940
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:11,210
new to me

941
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:12,679
banding organic well if you if you take

942
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,570
a look at my second book which is called

943
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:17,569
what is my second book called oh yeah

944
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:19,309
it's kind of nutrient oh my god so yeah

945
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,630
your eye if I may just digress for a

946
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:23,000
second I wonder right this second book

947
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,530
why cuz I had nothing else to do I guess

948
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,139
no I because I was curious about how

949
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:29,390
plants ate and so I thought it was going

950
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:31,250
to be teeming with nutrients how plants

951
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:33,920
eat of an organic gardeners guide you

952
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:36,590
know thinking you know how teeming with

953
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,289
nutrients organic gardeners guide to

954
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:42,000
optimizing plant nutrition what the hell

955
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:46,150
is that anyway

956
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:50,920
you know you learn how plants eat what

957
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:52,960
they take in and one of the methods of

958
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:56,260
course well there's three ways plants

959
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,970
get their food you want is by flow in

960
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,830
other words there it's in water its

961
00:37:57,969 --> 00:38:03,189
soluble and then it goes into the root

962
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:06,039
system by mass flow the other is by you

963
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:08,500
know osmosis diffusion which you know

964
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:10,599
you struggle through in tenth grade and

965
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,869
then you've got mycorrhizal mycorrhizal

966
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:15,039
fungi the osmanthus diffuses you know

967
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:17,108
that's really sort of when you've got

968
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,730
direct contact and then you've got

969
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:22,539
mycorrhizal fungi that go out into

970
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:24,250
little pores and bring food back and I

971
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:26,679
forgot exactly what you were asking me

972
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:28,989
about but I was just asking you to

973
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:32,618
define the banding organic yeah yeah

974
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:36,939
yeah so when you band below where you're

975
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:38,769
planting and and by bending you just put

976
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,019
a little flat area in there and you just

977
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:43,329
put your fertilizer right down there or

978
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:45,070
you might call it microbe food maybe a

979
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:48,279
little soil on top of it then you put

980
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:53,200
your transplant or your seed so that the

981
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,119
roots grow out into that band I see okay

982
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:58,629
now I understand so essentially you're

983
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:01,119
creating a preset buffet of nutrients

984
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:04,180
and and then the the roots are growing

985
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,680
you know aspiring for nutrients and then

986
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:08,469
they grow down and then they hit that

987
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:11,259
band and then they're there waiting for

988
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:12,759
them well the band is there they've

989
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,410
already diploma SHhhh but you know

990
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,050
what's what's what's in that little zone

991
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:19,420
as they're growing the mycorrhizal fungi

992
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:21,609
which you've also inoculated your season

993
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,619
your roots with are growing and are

994
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:25,569
going out into that band and bringing

995
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:27,340
that food back quicker you know it's all

996
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:29,500
part but it but there's that little bit

997
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,119
of food in there that you could add so

998
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,108
you know when you break that law of

999
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,220
return by removing the cannabis plant

1000
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:38,769
then if you're going to use the same

1001
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:40,989
soil you've got to return the nutrients

1002
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:43,960
that would have decayed had you not

1003
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:46,989
remove that plant as I say in my talks

1004
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:49,240
whoever fertilizes the Redwoods how do

1005
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:50,589
they get that dig nobody ever puts

1006
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:52,299
fertilizer down there nobody puts

1007
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:54,680
Miracle go down there nobody use general

1008
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:57,980
hydroponic crap no

1009
00:39:54,679 --> 00:40:00,250
uh had that happened if it's this thing

1010
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:03,650
it's the law of return wasn't ignored

1011
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:05,510
wasn't broken all that stuff fell down

1012
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:07,670
and decayed fascinating innit

1013
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,960
so anyway so yeah so the fact but the

1014
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,369
but do go back so the second book

1015
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,690
teeming with nutrients which people

1016
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:13,969
should read and struggle because it's

1017
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:15,920
important to know no it's got some

1018
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:17,750
chemistry in it and I apologize but it's

1019
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,340
got the least amount of chemistry I

1020
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,139
could put in it I promised myself I

1021
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,269
would never ever talk about the krebs

1022
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:24,920
cycle and so it's no krebs cycle in it

1023
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:26,719
whatsoever I don't even think I have the

1024
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,780
formula for photosynthesis and it's

1025
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:33,469
people know not to panic it's got sort

1026
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:34,880
of a a picture of how you would band as

1027
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:37,189
well as the description to some of the

1028
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,309
things you might use in order in order

1029
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:43,579
to to make that band when I saw you in

1030
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:45,139
December it the Emerald cup I'm going to

1031
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:46,639
paraphrase this poorly but you'll know

1032
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:47,000
where I'm going and you can take it from

1033
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:49,009
there

1034
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,599
you were you were you were talking about

1035
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,910
some of the topics from your teaming

1036
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:55,400
with fungi book and and you were talking

1037
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:58,759
about that you recommend it for cannabis

1038
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:03,530
folks to to roll their seeds in a

1039
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:06,800
particular fungus add to to support them

1040
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:08,240
as soon as they pop and and I was I was

1041
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,620
taking as many notes as I can but I

1042
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:14,959
missed which which which my coryza it

1043
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:17,449
was and what your actual strategy was

1044
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,099
and it was fascinating so so with that

1045
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:21,230
set up will you just kind of deliver

1046
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:24,170
that that little nugget to everybody

1047
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:27,079
well you put me in a real but you put me

1048
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:28,309
in a very difficult position so you so

1049
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:30,500
let me back up for a second all right

1050
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:32,329
all right so I've got these three I got

1051
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,860
a trilogy of books right which I'm

1052
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:36,469
supposed to sell let's say I make my

1053
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,420
living right and the last book is

1054
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:39,619
teeming with so I call myself Lord of

1055
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,680
the routes incidentally because I have

1056
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:45,619
this trilogy bump-bump

1057
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:49,279
so my last book is teeming with with fun

1058
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:55,250
funky people should I buy it and find

1059
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:57,290
where that one is in the book rather but

1060
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:59,449
myself I always go so fast when I talk

1061
00:41:57,289 --> 00:42:00,739
so that people can't write it down so

1062
00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:02,000
they will go out and buy the book but I

1063
00:42:00,739 --> 00:42:04,069
know everybody's going to go out and buy

1064
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,269
the book anyway so I'm going to I'll

1065
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:07,160
talk about it but

1066
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:10,009
quickly go back a little bit and talk

1067
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:11,839
about these micro raschel fungi 90 to 6%

1068
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:14,210
of the plants on the planet Earth have

1069
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:18,289
them this is the reason why plants were

1070
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:22,130
able to colonize terra firma 400 million

1071
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:25,130
years ago and 200 million years ago a

1072
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:27,619
second type developed and this second

1073
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:29,450
type of mycorrhizal fungi does exactly

1074
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:31,339
what the first one does only in a

1075
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:33,739
slightly different fashion and that is

1076
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,000
in return for these extra dates which we

1077
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:39,019
talked about at the beginning in the

1078
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,019
program these guys take the extra dates

1079
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:43,639
from the plant by literally taking you

1080
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:46,460
from the plant they're inside the plant

1081
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:49,250
living inside the plant and the other

1082
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,110
end of them are outside the plant and in

1083
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,869
return for those extra dates they go out

1084
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:57,470
and get all sorts of nutrients which

1085
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:59,239
they then transfer to the plant and if

1086
00:42:57,469 --> 00:43:02,449
they don't transfer them to the plant

1087
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:04,459
then the plant doesn't give them the

1088
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:08,319
extra dates so this is a very symbiotic

1089
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:11,599
relationship and they get nitrogen

1090
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:16,850
phosphorus those two in particular but

1091
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:18,739
copper and zinc and a couple of the m's

1092
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:23,389
which always I always forget this group

1093
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:25,309
right out of mine manganese and anyway

1094
00:43:23,389 --> 00:43:28,069
they go out and get all these terrific

1095
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:31,009
things that the plant can't get itself

1096
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:34,870
and so they feed the plant so they're

1097
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:40,310
very very important and we know of about

1098
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:44,659
360 different kinds we know that we can

1099
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:47,420
only grow about 15 of them and if you

1100
00:43:44,659 --> 00:43:50,629
buy a package of what's called Mike

1101
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:52,460
arisal fungi even though it may say

1102
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:55,670
mycorrhizae it's really called

1103
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:58,490
mycorrhizal fungi mycorrhizae is the

1104
00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:00,230
symbiotic relationship that forms and it

1105
00:43:58,489 --> 00:44:01,759
always includes a root so that's not the

1106
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:04,369
right term for what's in the package you

1107
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,840
get mycorrhizal fungi you'll see that

1108
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:10,099
there are about eight or nine of them

1109
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:12,800
listed on that package only one of them

1110
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:15,789
happens to associate and form that

1111
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,400
relationship with cannabis

1112
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:22,110
and this particular one forms that

1113
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,789
association with cannabis sativa indica

1114
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:28,599
Rudy Alice it doesn't matter whether

1115
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:30,880
it's Durban poison Jack Herrera you know

1116
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,319
whether it's teeming with microbes no

1117
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,110
there is no one call teeming with

1118
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:38,950
microbes ignorant it doesn't matter what

1119
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:42,190
it is there's only one that feeds these

1120
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:44,799
guys and it is called so get the pens

1121
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:49,179
and paper out oh wait a minute here's a

1122
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:54,390
problem when I first started writing the

1123
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:58,750
book it was called Glomus mossy mo sSAE

1124
00:44:54,389 --> 00:45:04,839
a or AIDS in the U on the Latin mossy

1125
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:09,159
dry ropes GL o ma Glomus unfortunately

1126
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,750
or fortunately I guess over the two or

1127
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:14,559
three years three years it took me to

1128
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:16,809
write the book the genetics of these

1129
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:19,000
individual mycorrhizal fungi became

1130
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:21,549
important enough to know that they began

1131
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,719
to study them and they have now

1132
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:27,519
reassigned the names of all of them my

1133
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:30,789
poor editor had to go back through the

1134
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:33,659
book and rewrite all of these Latin e

1135
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:36,309
that's why we've got second editions

1136
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:38,079
easy to write a second edition people

1137
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:41,650
don't understand just as an aside a

1138
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:44,679
second edition they say okay if you can

1139
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:49,180
take out six words you can put in six

1140
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:51,879
words they're not that easy right they

1141
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:54,669

00:45:54,670 --> 00:46:05,860
I could go back the one that you want is

1144
00:45:58,269 --> 00:46:13,090

in the package you'll see it as Glomus

1150
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:42,489
Massey or as Glomus interest CDs or Rago

1151
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:44,050
faggus Massey so it's very confusing but

1152
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:44,409
but you get the idea that's the one you

1153
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,360
want

1154
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:48,489
yeah you guys we've got our key search

1155
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,760
terms now and you know that that should

1156
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:54,159
get us there and and you know hopefully

1157
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,590
everybody who's listening is is super

1158
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:59,889
geeked about this now and you can find

1159
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:03,130
links to the teaming with fungi book on

1160
00:46:59,889 --> 00:47:05,829
the shaping fire podcast on the episode

1161
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:07,269
page for this interview and also you

1162
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:08,949

so so so let's go ahead and take our

1166
00:47:11,739 --> 00:47:15,399
second break when we get back we're

1167
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:17,950
going to take some questions from the

1168
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,480
show audience how exciting you are

1169
00:47:17,949 --> 00:47:20,980
listening to shaping fire and my guest

1170
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,099
today is organic gardener and author

1171
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:25,750
Jeff Lowenthal's we'll be right back

1172
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,940
using pesticides when growing cannabis

1173
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:30,369
has been common for a long time nowadays

1174
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:32,380
though we know better we know that most

1175
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:34,000
pesticides formulated for food crops

1176
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,430
have never been tested for use with

1177
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,710
cannabis they've been tested to be eaten

1178
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:40,719
in tiny doses they have not been tested

1179
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:42,809
to be inhaled and especially not

1180
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:45,189
concentrated into a cannabis oil

1181
00:47:42,809 --> 00:47:46,900
chemical residues from pesticides are

1182
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:49,420
not healthy for anyone but they are

1183
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,039
especially dangerous for patients for

1184
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,349
commercial cannabis growers this has

1185
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,119
become very impactful cannabis

1186
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:57,759
enthusiasts and patients have gotten

1187
00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:00,699
educated enough that they avoid growers

1188
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,350
who used pesticides not only that but

1189
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:04,659
states across the country have begun

1190
00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:08,199
making pesticide testing mandatory on

1191
00:48:04,659 --> 00:48:09,699
all licensed cannabis crops the time has

1192
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:11,829
come to find a better way to fight

1193
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:13,869
garden pests than covering your cannabis

1194
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:17,819
and chemicals and there is a better way

1195
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:20,170
let some good bugs fight your bad bugs

1196
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:22,000
beneficial insects and predatory mites

1197
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:24,250
have come a long way since we were

1198
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,170

1199

listening to shaping fire I am your host

1253
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:38,409
Shengo Louis and our guest this week is

1254
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:40,330
organic gardener and author Jeff Lowen

1255
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:42,489
sells so during this last set we're

1256
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:44,799
going to take some questions from the

1257
00:50:42,489 --> 00:50:46,689
the shaping fire audience that I asked

1258
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,310
for a couple weeks ago since I knew that

1259
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:50,530
you're going to be on the show and the

1260
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:53,259
first question is from Mike West and and

1261
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:55,869
Mike asks since most of the plants

1262
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:58,749
cannabinoids are created by NZ

1263
00:50:55,869 --> 00:51:01,690
maduk bio pathways but the precursors

1264
00:50:58,748 --> 00:51:03,909
are provided by symbiotic relationships

1265
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:06,700
would Jeff please describe the

1266
00:51:03,909 --> 00:51:10,118
microbiology biosynthesis of terpenes

1267
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:12,759
and cannabinoids in the roots as well as

1268
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:15,400
foliar biomass so so what do you have

1269
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:18,099
for that there Jeff oh yeah well you

1270
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,920
know now she just felt might should read

1271
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:22,269
my second book teeming with nutrients

1272
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,690
because it really sort of discusses that

1273
00:51:22,268 --> 00:51:27,818
in a in a much simpler way what I think

1274
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:31,088
he's saying is listen all of these

1275
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:33,190
things are built inside the plant but

1276
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,869
they're there they're created using the

1277
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,269
enzymes inside the plant the enzyme

1278
00:51:34,869 --> 00:51:38,858
factories make all of the things that

1279
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:41,169
are inside a plant I'll go back and

1280
00:51:38,858 --> 00:51:43,568
discuss that in a quick second but but

1281
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:47,230
all of the enzymes are taking goods that

1282
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:50,409
come from the soil through a biological

1283
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:53,139
pathway ie and the microbes mineralize

1284
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:56,409
it and didn't make it available to the

1285
00:51:53,139 --> 00:51:58,118
plant and the mycorrhizae fungi go out

1286
00:51:56,409 --> 00:52:00,460
and get it bring it to the plant and you

1287
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:04,180
know it's kind of an interesting it can

1288
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:05,710
get converted inside the plant from one

1289
00:52:04,179 --> 00:52:07,358
sort of energy outside the plant to

1290
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:09,159
another kind of inside the plant so let

1291
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:11,440
me just back up for a second and say

1292
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:13,268
that the second book and one of the

1293
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,789
reasons why people find it a little bit

1294
00:52:13,268 --> 00:52:17,649
complicated talks about how plants eat

1295
00:52:15,789 --> 00:52:20,589
and you can't talk about how plants eat

1296
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:23,460
unless you talk about cellular biology

1297
00:52:20,588 --> 00:52:25,389
the first book is microbiology

1298
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:27,369
microbiology is a lot of fun because we

1299
00:52:25,389 --> 00:52:29,440
studied in high school and you know we

1300
00:52:27,369 --> 00:52:31,239
know paramecium's and amoebas and all

1301
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,670
that kind of stuff is kind of fun cuz

1302
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:36,278
you know we you know we're bacteria

1303
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:38,528
folks is a group and you know fungal

1304
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:40,778
folds and so to study them and read

1305
00:52:38,528 --> 00:52:42,369
about them in the microbiology is fun on

1306
00:52:40,778 --> 00:52:44,440
the other hand cellular biology was

1307
00:52:42,369 --> 00:52:46,210
always a pain in the butt nobody really

1308
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,579
liked it you couldn't see this stuff you

1309
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:50,650
had these microscope microscopes even in

1310
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:52,450
microscopes you couldn't see things you

1311
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:55,059
had to use pictures in books everything

1312
00:52:52,449 --> 00:52:58,358
was two dimensions it wasn't fun today

1313
00:52:55,059 --> 00:53:00,099
on the other hand it is not only sort of

1314
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:02,108
fun because we have electron microscopes

1315
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:05,380
of now we know a lot more about what

1316
00:53:02,108 --> 00:53:07,210
happens inside the cell but as gardeners

1317
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:08,289
and growers of cannabis there's a need

1318
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:11,949
to know what goes on

1319
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:14,889
in cellular biology so so what happens

1320
00:53:11,949 --> 00:53:17,739
in the soil is described in the first

1321
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:18,909
book teeming with microbes and I you

1322
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:21,359
know those three methods that I

1323
00:53:18,909 --> 00:53:24,190
described before are used to bring in

1324
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:26,500
individual nutrients into the plant and

1325
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:28,480
the nutrients enter the plant and there

1326
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:31,030
are only 18 of them and they enter the

1327
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,670
plant each through their own gateway and

1328
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:35,970
their own gateway through each

1329
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:38,409
individual cell in the plant and each

1330
00:53:35,969 --> 00:53:42,129
cannabis plant might have twenty

1331
00:53:38,409 --> 00:53:46,000
trillion individual cells each one of

1332
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:48,760
them has a plasma membrane just inside

1333
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,250
the cell wall and that plasma membrane

1334
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:56,410
has these little tunnels and gateways

1335
00:53:51,250 --> 00:54:01,210
and each individual tunnel takes in only

1336
00:53:56,409 --> 00:54:04,690
one kind of nutrient molecule and each

1337
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:08,050
one of those gateways is constructed by

1338
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:10,869
the enzymes as is the plasma Dermott

1339
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:14,410
which is that plasma membrane as is the

1340
00:54:10,869 --> 00:54:18,460
cell wall and as is every single thing

1341
00:54:14,409 --> 00:54:21,940
made inside the cell by using enzymes

1342
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:25,900
and each individual cell has ten

1343
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:31,000
thousand or more different kinds of

1344
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:34,480
enzymes and at least a thousand of each

1345
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,849
one of them in an individual cell in

1346
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:40,480
which a cannabis plant or of which a

1347
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:44,349
cannabis plant might have a twenty to

1348
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:48,490
thirty trillion and these enzymes take

1349
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:51,670
these individual 18 elements you can't

1350
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:54,639
play cards with 18 cards but they're

1351
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:57,639
able to convert these 18 elements into

1352
00:54:54,639 --> 00:55:00,460
every single thing you see in a plant

1353
00:54:57,639 --> 00:55:03,009
and therefore every single thing

1354
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:05,170
basically you see in an animal because

1355
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:07,870
that animal you may not be a vegetarian

1356
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:10,180
but that animal you eat is and they're

1357
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:12,429
eating plants which are made up of these

1358
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:14,549
cells which have all these enzymes which

1359
00:55:12,429 --> 00:55:19,359
have made up every little piece it's

1360
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:20,950
mind-boggling and so Mike should read

1361
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:23,320
the second book

1362
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:25,839
and and we're that question in mind

1363
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,610
right I mean that's a great answer and

1364
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,890
you know it's a really on point answer

1365
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:31,450
too because you know you mentioned about

1366
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:33,730
you know you know at the cellular level

1367
00:55:31,449 --> 00:55:36,250
we can't see them and when I when I

1368
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:39,429
actually you know asked for four

1369
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:41,920
questions for you Trent Rinka wrote in

1370
00:55:39,429 --> 00:55:43,509
he says Oh tell Jeff that his three

1371
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,119
books caused me to buy my first

1372
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:47,980
high-powered microscope that's what I

1373
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:51,099
mean you know you think about it let's

1374
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:54,130
take a you know the idea that you flush

1375
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:55,960
your plants or hydroponics you can't

1376
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:57,820
understand how you can't understand

1377
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,500
either of these things I like to say you

1378
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:02,289
can't understand why you shouldn't flush

1379
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:04,389
and you can't understand you know even

1380
00:56:02,289 --> 00:56:06,849
the use of hydroponics if you don't

1381
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:10,269
understand the cellular biology involved

1382
00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:11,920
and this it is fascinating and it's very

1383
00:56:10,269 --> 00:56:16,210
very important for the grower that's

1384
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:19,269
trying to grow good organic weed and and

1385
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:21,190
it's also important from a philosophical

1386
00:56:19,269 --> 00:56:23,949
perspective because you can't help

1387
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:26,849
reading the second book walking away

1388
00:56:23,949 --> 00:56:30,369
with the idea that wait a second

1389
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:33,460
you know we maybe you know maybe you and

1390
00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:36,489
I are just part of a big cell you know

1391
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,929
we're two enzymes and these ideas that

1392
00:56:36,489 --> 00:56:40,149
we're kicking back and forth or like

1393
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:43,179
that enzyme making we're making ideas

1394
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:46,000
here and these ideas build up and all of

1395
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:48,159
a sudden somebody comes a grower boom

1396
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,559
wow this is the same thing that happens

1397
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:53,049
inside an individual cell maybe we're

1398
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:56,519
just one of 37 trillion cells in a

1399
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:58,630
gigantic cannabis plant okay I'm done

1400
00:56:56,519 --> 00:57:00,969
it's different just a difference of

1401
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:02,440
magnitude you know is you can't just

1402
00:57:00,969 --> 00:57:05,109
read these books you've got to sit back

1403
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,150
after you read them you know and ingest

1404
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:10,090
a little bit of this wonderful chemical

1405
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:14,590
and let the cannabinoids you know help

1406
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:18,309
you think about what you're doing you

1407
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:20,769
know for me 360 degree way up in the air

1408
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:22,719
view and we have the science from these

1409
00:57:20,769 --> 00:57:26,199
books you can do that did you did you

1410
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:28,779
say in that last bit that um that you

1411
00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:30,730
don't recommend flushing I don't I don't

1412
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,320
recommend flushing and I don't recommend

1413
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:33,670
you know I don't recommend using kelp

1414
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,510
for the reason that people use kelp I

1415
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:38,230
mean though you know

1416
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:39,010
plant has these 18 nutrients you put

1417
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,710
kelp down

1418
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:43,300
it's got 5662 nutrients they don't need

1419
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:47,440
the rest of those nutrients you put the

1420
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:49,330
kelp down to feed the soil food web yes

1421
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,849
you know but not to feed the plant

1422
00:57:49,329 --> 00:57:54,429
really and then flushing me why do

1423
00:57:51,849 --> 00:57:56,319
people flush hmm if you're feeding your

1424
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:59,289
plant properly and is growing properly

1425
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,880
its balanced properly what are you

1426
00:57:59,289 --> 00:58:02,019
trying what are you flushing out what do

1427
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,390
you flush out you flush out

1428
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:06,009
carbohydrates I mean I can't think of

1429
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:08,139
anything else you can flush out well it

1430
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:10,450
seems to be a holdover from people still

1431
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:12,819
using bottled salt nutrients right and

1432
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:14,589
you know most of the most of the hard

1433
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,269
core probiotic growers are like it

1434
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:19,510
what's the point once once you're all

1435
00:58:16,269 --> 00:58:20,829
green yeah yeah so that was a seaman

1436
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:22,780
with the salsa man I got a question I

1437
00:58:20,829 --> 00:58:24,849
mean you can all you you go

1438
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:26,380
hydroponically basically as far as I'm

1439
00:58:24,849 --> 00:58:29,650
concerned you can almost always taste

1440
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:31,869
the chemical um you know you can flush

1441
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:33,430
all you want I think what do you think

1442
00:58:31,869 --> 00:58:35,500
you're doing you're growing in water

1443
00:58:33,429 --> 00:58:37,960
that's flushing I don't get it I just

1444
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:40,269
don't get it but right on so so another

1445
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:43,269
question comes in from sea bass wolf he

1446
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:45,460
asked what mycelium from my home garden

1447
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:48,849
or a nearby forest could I dig up and

1448
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:50,590
use on my cannabis plants what plants or

1449
00:58:48,849 --> 00:58:52,809
trees and nature would provide good

1450
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:56,530
mycelium starts for me to mix into my

1451
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:58,299
soil okay a great question you know

1452
00:58:56,530 --> 00:59:00,220
first of all not from your trees because

1453
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,769
your trees use the other kind which is

1454
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:05,829
the exfil mycorrhizal the cannabis

1455
00:59:02,769 --> 00:59:08,980
plants and notice I say cannabis I think

1456
00:59:05,829 --> 00:59:12,819
using the word marijuana is is still

1457
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:15,519
racist it was racist when it started

1458
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:18,220
back in the 1930s so I don't use it I

1459
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:20,409
use I use the word cannabis like it's

1460
00:59:18,219 --> 00:59:23,769
kerbals me that Alaska for example has

1461
00:59:20,409 --> 00:59:25,869
the marijuana act or agon is the Oregon

1462
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:29,110
marijuana program no it should be called

1463
00:59:25,869 --> 00:59:31,329
cannabis but anyway um uh where was that

1464
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:33,370
question again let's this was my silly

1465
00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:35,139
yeah from the olden garden Kenny 3 oh

1466
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:37,329
yeah two trees no good

1467
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:40,539
cannabis requires that one that I

1468
00:59:37,329 --> 00:59:44,110
mentioned the Rezo feigus riser faggus

1469
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:45,550
Erie you've got the yellow root of town

1470
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:50,019
right

1471
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:52,000
and and you can get it from carrots

1472
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:55,630
I think peonies

1473
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,010
I believe potatoes so there are some

1474
00:59:55,630 --> 01:00:00,519
things that you grow in your garden that

1475
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:02,830
also use the same the same fungi but but

1476
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:06,159
why not you know why not use your

1477
01:00:02,829 --> 01:00:07,599
previous plants Yeah right not because

1478
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:09,699
we know it's there because it's about

1479
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:11,469
Rijo thoris yeah we certainly hope it's

1480
01:00:09,699 --> 01:00:15,369
there and it's certainly there if you

1481
01:00:11,469 --> 01:00:16,779
put it there so it makes a great deal of

1482
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:18,279
sense the other thing that I think

1483
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,140
people are beginning to notice at least

1484
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:23,230
least I've been told this number of

1485
01:00:20,139 --> 01:00:27,369
people who do know and that is that when

1486
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:29,199
you grow in a container you get some

1487
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:32,609
pretty quick multiplication of the

1488
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:35,739
spores when you grow in a field

1489
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:38,740
situation or a big bed situation you get

1490
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:41,289
you get the mycelium and it turns out

1491
01:00:38,739 --> 01:00:44,349
that when that mycelium is broken up it

1492
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:48,369
will produce propagules that will grow

1493
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:52,839
into the the ore will actually act as

1494
01:00:48,369 --> 01:00:54,849
spores and grow new fungi so you know

1495
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:56,220
it's pretty cheap to buy particularly

1496
01:00:54,849 --> 01:00:58,420
when you know that you only need the one

1497
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:59,589
it gets more expensive when you're

1498
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:01,599
buying seven and eight and nine

1499
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:04,000
different kinds so now that you know

1500
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:06,819
what to look for on the package you just

1501
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,190
buy the one you know you might want to

1502
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:11,860
be thinking that way right on so here's

1503
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:13,539
kind of a fun one listener Tony Leyva of

1504
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,230
boneyard seeds in the Emerald triangle

1505
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:15,969
down there

1506
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:18,190
rights to ask if you have any particular

1507
01:01:15,969 --> 01:01:21,369
cannabis cultivars that you personally

1508
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:24,700
like for ease of growth yield and the

1509
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:27,549
terpene profile well hi you know my

1510
01:01:24,699 --> 01:01:30,099
all-time favorite is Durbin poison yeah

1511
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:32,680
I mean who doesn't like Durbin poison

1512
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:35,589
quick quick grower a beautiful plant

1513
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:38,889
best terpene taste I can think of god I

1514
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:41,860
love it here in Alaska you know we've

1515
01:01:38,889 --> 01:01:44,440
had a funny funny situation it's been

1516
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:48,280
legal here in Alaska in the in the

1517
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:50,170
privacy of your home tent hotel room etc

1518
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:52,390
and so we've been growing in here

1519
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:54,880
forever but for years and years and

1520
01:01:52,389 --> 01:01:56,609
years we grew two things though the

1521
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,140
first was what people you know

1522
01:01:56,610 --> 01:02:02,590
euphemistically call mts

1523
01:01:59,139 --> 01:02:05,139
and and I don't know whether we are but

1524
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:07,780
it was always the same stuff and so for

1525
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:10,779
I'm swear I got four five or ten years

1526
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:13,000
we were all smoking the same stuff you

1527
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:17,500
know it got pretty boring huh

1528
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,539
then Northern Lights appeared and so

1529
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:22,960
they're not okay and now of course we've

1530
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:24,820
got legalization but we we've got a very

1531
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:28,030
interesting problem here and that is our

1532
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:30,369
day length situation does not coincide

1533
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:31,810
properly with the temperature and so

1534
01:02:30,369 --> 01:02:34,119
when you live in Alaska you have this

1535
01:02:31,809 --> 01:02:35,710
wonderful burst of daylight and if you

1536
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:37,960
use light deprivation you could have a

1537
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:40,840
phenomenal crop but if you just got a

1538
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:45,119
regular backyard greenhouse it gets cold

1539
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:47,470
before the plant sits the flowers fully

1540
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:49,450
didn't last year was the first year ever

1541
01:02:47,469 --> 01:02:51,279
and people were just rejoicing beyond

1542
01:02:49,449 --> 01:02:52,779
belief and so we're limited to what we

1543
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,050
can grow and a lot of people grow OTO

1544
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:58,390
flowers and you know when you grow

1545
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:59,920
flowers you don't end up with clones you

1546
01:02:58,389 --> 01:03:01,929
don't end up with giving seeds to other

1547
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,659
people and so there really isn't sort of

1548
01:03:01,929 --> 01:03:06,190
that you know what do you like to grow I

1549
01:03:04,659 --> 01:03:09,279
like to grow OTO flowers because they're

1550
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:10,480
easy but see they're all different yeah

1551
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,660
you know you never know what you're

1552
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,639
getting so but to go back again if I had

1553
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:18,608
my way oh god the whole world would be

1554
01:03:15,639 --> 01:03:20,769
growing durbin poison right on so the

1555
01:03:18,608 --> 01:03:22,779
last question for you Mike Flanagan

1556
01:03:20,769 --> 01:03:25,389
writes in to ask about your thoughts on

1557
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:28,540
Korean national career natural farming

1558
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:31,809
yeah well you know and interestingly

1559
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:33,608
enough teeming with microbes which has

1560
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:37,750
been translated and I think nine

1561
01:03:33,608 --> 01:03:39,940
languages now uh was early on translated

1562
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:44,699
into Korean like I couldn't figure out

1563
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:48,429
why it's called Combe Sumida amoeba

1564
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:49,809
which I love and every now and then I go

1565
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:52,239
into a Korean restaurant here in

1566
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:56,820
Anchorage and I like to bring the book

1567
01:03:52,239 --> 01:04:01,118
with me and they are very impressed that

1568
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:04,510
and and $16.50 gets me a pretty good

1569
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:09,940
Korean meal here but anyway uh you know

1570
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:11,560
it is a it is a form of soil food web

1571
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:12,789
gardening I guess if that's what you

1572
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:16,269
want to call using benefit

1573
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:20,259
organisms there's all there's you know

1574
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:23,650
and it's it's very similar to e/m lactic

1575
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:27,990
acid bacteria it's got about six or

1576
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:33,940
seven or eight really key bacterias and

1577
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:36,759
is you know it cycles the nutrients uses

1578
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:39,250
mycorrhizal zits it's not different from

1579
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:41,650
a soil food web system it's just that

1580
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:43,269
there's a bunch of different ways that

1581
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:45,550
to add amendments so that there's

1582
01:04:43,269 --> 01:04:49,829
fermented fruit juices and fermented

1583
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:53,170
plant juices and amino acid juices and

1584
01:04:49,829 --> 01:04:55,239
also all sorts of nutrient mixes that

1585
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:58,210
you can make and yeah I think you know I

1586
01:04:55,239 --> 01:05:01,750
mean I think it certainly works it's it

1587
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:05,199
is a variation of adding either foods or

1588
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:08,590
minerals I mean or minerals on some of

1589
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:14,009
the foods foods or microbes so that the

1590
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:19,329
soil food web will give the plant the

1591
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:20,560
the microbes it needs to work with right

1592
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:22,809
on yes

1593
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:25,059
you know it's a lot of work but I you

1594
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:27,909
know and it's very interesting I can't

1595
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:30,219
see how you can't go through the Korean

1596
01:05:27,909 --> 01:05:31,659
system without learning a tremendous

1597
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:33,730
amount of stuff it's almost like

1598
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:35,949
biodynamic farming yeah I think that

1599
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:39,130
it's for somebody who's moved beyond

1600
01:05:35,949 --> 01:05:40,480
their compost teas in the basics Korean

1601
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:43,210
natural farming and even very

1602
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:46,590
specifically the fermented the juice

1603
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:48,670
ferments are really exciting and nerdy

1604
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:51,789
well yeah I mean I've been I think

1605
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:53,710
there's also animal involvement and all

1606
01:05:51,789 --> 01:05:55,529
sorts of stuff so so yeah I mean you

1607
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:58,389
know and let's face it there's

1608
01:05:55,530 --> 01:06:01,840
spectacular spectacular farms and

1609
01:05:58,389 --> 01:06:03,159
Gardens in Korea it must work Jeff

1610
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,510
thanks so much for being on the show

1611
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:07,359
today this has been really exhilarating

1612
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:09,670
and has opened so many new doors for

1613
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:11,890
folks I really appreciate you sharing

1614
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:14,530
your time with us well I hope we get to

1615
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:17,199
meet again and any time you want to have

1616
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:17,920
guests to you can hardly shut up you

1617
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:20,349
give me ring

1618
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,210
Jeff Lowen fells is the author of the

1619
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:24,610
books teeming with microbes teeming with

1620
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:26,610
nutrients and teeming with fungi you can
