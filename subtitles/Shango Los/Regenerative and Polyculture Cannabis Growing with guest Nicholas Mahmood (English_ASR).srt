1
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:10,259
so thank you for spending some time with

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,660
us today it was beautiful to see the

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,699
farm you know one of the reasons why I

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,278
wanted to come over and visit you Nick

5
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:20,189
was because you know you do something

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,469
that I haven't seen done much at all but

7
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,629
especially in commercial cannabis and

8
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:27,479
that is you do a lot of inner planting

9
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:29,429
right you do you do inter plant in where

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,420
there's the cannabis plants and then

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:36,509
plants that are around it but then also

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,739
you also do companion planting which I

13
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,229
would think is a different thing you

14
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,538
know plants that are doing a job right

15
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:45,479
attracting pests or or something like

16
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:47,879
that and you know most commercial

17
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:52,648
cannabis farms you get grids its

18
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:55,108
monoculture and and yours look

19
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,160
significantly different than that so so

20
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:58,499
tell me a little bit about the

21
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,259
experience that you've got with with not

22
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:05,640
using a monoculture and instead doing

23
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:09,780
tons of inter planting yeah so I would

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,810
say I've gone through some evolution of

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:17,099
like growing more from market style kind

26
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,379
of situations and that so I have done

27
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,449
like more like this is for managing for

28
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,429
easy harvest and this is for that but my

29
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,219
evolution has always been further

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:29,430
towards nature and that you know I spend

31
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:35,009
a lot of time out and about in the world

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:37,320
on foot and then living by fire and

33
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,140
under a tarp and and walking around the

34
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,869
woods and the canyons and paddling lakes

35
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:47,129
and oceans and so like I had this

36
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:50,010
imprinted in me all these natural spaces

37
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:53,189
and Ecology's that were really dynamic

38
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:56,790
and and never fragmented in straight

39
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:59,280
lines and so you know as I realized I

40
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,770
wanted to learn more about taking care

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,960
of food and and growing plants and

42
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:06,269
feeding myself from the land and that

43
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:11,449
way instead of the hunting and fishing

44
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:16,530
and walking the land I started it I just

45
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:17,629
like we started to inner plant like what

46
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,699
we were seeing

47
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:21,469
and then recognizing the benefits of

48
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:24,349
different plants and what they do and

49
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:27,530
starting to learn more about how plants

50
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:29,989
are interacting with their ecological

51
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:34,159
role what is that ecological role and

52
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:36,740
and so yeah you know that the foundation

53
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,870
that diversity all those different

54
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,969
plants are playing different roles at

55
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,890
different times of the year based on the

56
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:45,859
climate you're in you're gonna develop

57
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:48,500
your own spectrum of diversity and

58
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,710
complexity your matrix to whatever

59
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,259
degree you want because at the more

60
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:57,349
complex it is the the more intelligent

61
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:59,989
it is and so you know there's definitely

62
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:01,579
a lot of information so you can research

63
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,770
what different plants are doing but

64
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,400
there's needs to be more spent time

65
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,450
spent outside observing and and

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,599
interacting with plants without

67
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:13,519
necessarily having to understand them

68
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,199
completely but rather open up to

69
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,930
listening to the plant and see what a

70
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,969
good information it brings to you and

71
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,010
not that's where I feel like you know

72
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:25,129
the the relationship to the garden

73
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:27,679
becomes this listening this place of

74
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:31,389
listening and then interacting and

75
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,730
always trying to honor that space to

76
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:36,829
give back to it and to hold it in this

77
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:39,590
sacred manner that it's taking care of

78
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,750
you and not approach it with this idea

79
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,819
that I just want to get this one crop

80
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,389
out of here and it's going to this

81
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:48,739
market and I don't regardless I'm I just

82
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:51,589
want to figure out how to grow that one

83
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,150
well you know and it's I don't think you

84
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,879
know I don't think that's a very healthy

85
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,800
relationship it seems very like we're

86
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,500
taking too much from the space and so

87
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,380
what also happens in that case where you

88
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,530
take so much biomass from a place all at

89
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:09,169
once is you take stuff from it and so if

90
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,469
there's nothing else there to recover or

91
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:15,429
to feed the system you deplete it very

92
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:18,920
quickly and so modern agriculture is

93
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:22,090
depleting soils very rapidly which is

94
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,850
why there's such a kind of like

95
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:27,918
everybody is going and remineralizing

96
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,080
Andrea mending and all these things

97
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,930
because of this fear that it's not going

98
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,569
to be enough

99
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:36,900
and then they're also cropping the place

100
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:38,939
harder than maybe it can create so the

101
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:41,879
bringing things into a regenerative

102
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:44,490
place in requires bringing the

103
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:47,038
perennials into the garden and allowing

104
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,560
a root system of greater depth and

105
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:52,560
complexity that remains in the ground

106
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,829
all year to be there as the carbon sink

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,860
for the water to store and for more

108
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,849
growth to occur in that space it's it's

109
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,600
interesting because you've already

110
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,550
started harvesting for this year and and

111
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,620
your rows that you've already harvested

112
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,840
it looks like your garden is still full

113
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,740
because of all of the additional

114
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,239
planting and and I like your idea that

115
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,699
you know even after you've removed all

116
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,850
the cannabis biomass your garden is

117
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,770
still full and alive whereas in a mono

118
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,439
crop you remove all the biomass and

119
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:27,329
you've just got a you know bare place

120
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,538
right your garden is going to be very

121
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:33,240
much alive all winter long even even

122
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:37,740
once the once the plants have left

123
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,180
now this particular farming spot you've

124
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,460
only been here for about three years so

125
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:46,978
you you are you're helping you know

126
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:48,839
build and and you know help help give

127
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:51,569
that give a lance more personality and

128
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,839
bring it back to how it was before they

129
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:57,779
put up all these the this this timber

130
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,779
did you choose plants for the inter

131
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:01,408
planting and companion planting

132
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:04,918
intentionally because they were

133
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:07,769
indigenous to this area or because you

134
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:12,299
knew that they were positive companion

135
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:15,329
plants for cannabis or both both and I

136
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,550
would say in the development of the

137
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:20,158
garden I look at what's already there

138
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,129
and what plants are already there and I

139
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:25,649
I do my best to make sure that all those

140
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:29,939
plants are kind of like that I have some

141
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:31,529
level of care and and that I like those

142
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:35,038
plants you know like we don't want to

143
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:37,829
engage in the design of our space and

144
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,019
always point out what's not working so I

145
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:42,418
like to approach a new space regardless

146
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:44,408
of if it's been abused or if it's a

147
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:47,978
thriving grass or if

148
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:49,899
it's this and honor it for what it is

149
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:51,188
and how great that is and to try and

150
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:54,129
figure out how to partner with that

151
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:55,989
space to encourage that biological

152
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:58,899
because everywhere on the earth there's

153
00:06:55,988 --> 00:07:01,209
biology that exists and even in less

154
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:02,738
productive places it's there to some

155
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:04,778
extent so really what we should be

156
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:07,149
trying to do is encouraging the

157
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:11,139
evolution of that biology to become more

158
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:14,559
and so establishing garden should be you

159
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:21,699
know more about aligning ourselves with

160
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:24,639
the culture of microbiology and ecology

161
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:29,978
of the place that it is and less

162
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:32,829
invasive action and less machine use and

163
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:35,918
less straight lines and more integrated

164
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:37,749
poly culture that incorporates some of

165
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,299
the things that are naturally there to

166
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:42,429
begin with as well as introduce things

167
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,879
that are really good at recovering

168
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:47,828
minerals and are have really extensive

169
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:51,158
root systems that are good at catching

170
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:53,110
excess nutrients that might be in the

171
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:55,899
beds where you're putting a lot of your

172
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:59,800
manures and your waste your your carbon

173
00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:01,838
and mulches and so you know setting up

174
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,119
your guild and in in relation to a

175
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:05,889
hillside you know the downhill side is

176
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:08,949
where the nutrients leach and say you

177
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:11,019
want a recovery crop on the downhill

178
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,179
side so that when you do water if you

179
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:17,439
water you know usually on a hillside you

180
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:19,418
have to water in in this climate and and

181
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,909
when you do you whenever you put water

182
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:24,038
out there you want to make sure that if

183
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:25,538
you're putting a certain amount you want

184
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:27,278
all that water to be used the most

185
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:29,139
efficiently that it can so you want the

186
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:31,868
most extensive root system that can

187
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:34,000
recover those nutrients into biomass

188
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:36,699
which is the plant matter itself and

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,948
then that plant matter becomes the

190
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:41,500
biomass that feeds the soil again and

191
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:43,718
the more you care and maybe utilize

192
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,179
those crops to become biomass for the

193
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,430
microbiology the more that crop will

194
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:50,588
start to grow even more vigorously and

195
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:52,120
and I find this a lot especially with

196
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,850
like comfrey and these kinds of if you

197
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,490
let the crop just grow or if you let the

198
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,200
comfrey just grow and don't cut it and

199
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,180
use the

200
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,250
you'll see that it stalls out and flower

201
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:06,159
and it doesn't get any bigger but if you

202
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,350
use the biomass and cut it it the root

203
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,939
system grows more the plant grows bigger

204
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,190
and so our comfrey start to become

205
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,260
bigger and bigger and we've got monster

206
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,050
comfrey yeah yeah and that's you know

207
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:19,269
that's the the goal is to over grow your

208
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:21,639
garden space with biomass and then you

209
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:24,970
utilize the biomass that's in excess or

210
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:27,789
you manage the strongly competitive

211
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,519
varieties of weed species and use those

212
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:33,129
as bio biomass recovery so their root

213
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:35,259
systems are now valuable the bind weeds

214
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:37,720
the star thistles the things that people

215
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:42,009
don't want are all contributing in a

216
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,930
really good way to complexify aback by

217
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:45,909
ology so we shouldn't just be focused on

218
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:47,979
the crops we want to grow we need to

219
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:51,399
take into account the bigger ecological

220
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,379
picture so on the on the flip of that

221
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,149
though there are some crops that we do

222
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:56,679
want to grow and one of the things that

223
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:59,740
I thought was pretty cool it was that

224
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,120
you've got all of this food intermixed

225
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,860
with the cannabis plant so you've got

226
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,149
you know you've got your your comfrey

227
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,680
and you're thistles and your things that

228
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:08,500
you're probably not gonna do much with

229
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:12,009
but then you also got you know potatoes

230
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,379
and apples and and I think rutabaga you

231
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:16,360
had and so so tell us a little bit about

232
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:19,509
that about what you're pulling from the

233
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,070
garden that's both providing your income

234
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:23,919
through the cannabis but also feeding

235
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:26,110
you yeah a lot of it can feed us and a

236
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,569
lot of it that even can feed us we let

237
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:32,050
feed the garden too so a lot of our

238
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:34,240
crops are our crops that we eat you know

239
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,799
we grow thousands of pounds of potatoes

240
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,370
but they're also there for other

241
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:41,709
purposes so like we we use that crop in

242
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:45,720
particular to keep the rodents really

243
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:48,160
well fed and we've had zero issues with

244
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,660
any kind of rodents even though we have

245
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,039
tons of rodents in there so we have

246
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:53,409
you're just giving them something better

247
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,149
than cannabis talk you're you're super

248
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:57,879
charging the ground with lots of

249
00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:01,049
nourishment and whether that starch gets

250
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:04,360
consumed by a person or by an arthropod

251
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:07,089
you know and the the more it stays in

252
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,279
that space the kind of more regenerative

253
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,960
the crop becomes so it's like every time

254
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,399
something leaves

255
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:17,410
a space it enters a the realm of

256
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,909
becoming energy-intensive so you have to

257
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:20,559
carry it somewhere and then you have to

258
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:22,240
drive it somewhere and then you have to

259
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,089
sell it and then somebody drives it to a

260
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,060
fridge that's turned on to ya story you

261
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:30,460
know but we're we're trying to move in

262
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:32,319
this direction of naturalizing systems

263
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,300
creating abundance it's always in the

264
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,460
ground and teaching people how to

265
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:39,009
establish those things around them so

266
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,259
that they can go outside and identify

267
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:43,240
the food and utilize it when they need

268
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:46,809
it and that it doesn't have to be as

269
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,180
much go to the market as it is to you

270
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:55,329
know understand what's growing around

271
00:11:49,179 --> 00:12:16,629
you and participate in that process yeah

272
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:19,870
they they do this every day sometimes

273
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:23,740
it's triggered by an arrival sometimes

274
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,360
it's triggered by dogs barking it's hard

275
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,490
to say for sure they're pretty crazy

276
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,680
right on I got one more question for you

277
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,440
before before I let you get back to the

278
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,870
harvest which is exactly that right you

279
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,780
know a lot of a lot of the farms that I

280
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,789
tour not only are they on grids but

281
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,709
they're they're set up to be easily

282
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:44,500
mechanically harvested right they've got

283
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,060
they've got easy to walk rows and and

284
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,309
you know they've got areas that you can

285
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:51,219
pull the sled down and then chop and

286
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:53,199
drop and all that and and yours is like

287
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,730
the antithesis of that right here you

288
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,070
know your rows are a little bit like

289
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,710
this and they get wider and thinner and

290
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,720
and you know you've got you've got all

291
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:05,590
this companion planting right and so you

292
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:09,519
might have to like dig out the stem to

293
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:11,050
get to it you know to cut and and I you

294
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,269
know I can imagine a lot of these guys

295
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:15,189
that I've talked to who all they want to

296
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:17,079
talk about is scalability down in the

297
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,650
valley right you know we've got we've

298
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,120
got 40 acres of hydroponic greenhouse or

299
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:22,959
you know these these these types of

300
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,139
things where everything's super

301
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,620
mechanized you're

302
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:31,009
opposite so can you say a little bit

303
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:34,129
about your process and what I'm what I'm

304
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:38,149
looking for is you're not mechanized and

305
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:40,220
yet I just saw your your curing room

306
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:44,659
filled with plants everything looks

307
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:48,649
perfect and and and you know uniform

308
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:52,370
enough you know yeah how essentially how

309
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:54,500
are you doing that coming from what

310
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,740
looks to an outsider has a disorganized

311
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:03,620
garden but which is incredibly abundant

312
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:08,539
yeah yeah you know I think we in the art

313
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:11,899
of scaling like you can own you can't

314
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:16,219
scale craft beyond a certain point craft

315
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:18,949
to me craft cannabis or artisan cannabis

316
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:23,210
is something that stops at a pretty

317
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:26,090
small scale and so you know the the

318
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:28,660
mechanized piece only takes you further

319
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:33,710
down the path of commercial cannabis or

320
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:35,269
you know corporate cannabis and as we've

321
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:37,009
evolved we've played with the machines

322
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:39,679
we've played with the big Leafers and

323
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,419
and doing that and what that did and we

324
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:45,229
just haven't liked it you know it feels

325
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:48,889
abusive to an extent to the bud and it

326
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:52,430
feels like it's just losing a certain

327
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:54,289
level of sacredness and you know now we

328
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:56,659
do all the big leafing on the live

329
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:59,629
plants and prep really well for big

330
00:14:56,659 --> 00:15:02,449
chunks of harvest to come in and that is

331
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:04,669
really helped us so we big leaf and then

332
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,620
we spend one day bringing lots in at

333
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:09,439
once we do a good job taking care of

334
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,509
those plants before its time and and so

335
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,020
the system's really good it and it only

336
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:17,539
takes like four people to kind of do the

337
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:20,299
whole thing efficiently we we might use

338
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:23,719
up to six or seven here and there when

339
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:26,629
things get tight in terms of weather or

340
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:30,470
some kind of component like that but but

341
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:32,059
yeah really it's for us it's we went

342
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,950
that direction and we just start going

343
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:37,049
further back the other direction more by

344
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,670
hand outgrowing what we can even dry

345
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:41,250
and then just only taking the

346
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:43,399
highest-quality into the to the shop and

347
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,200
then knowing that some is gonna end up

348
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:48,089
feeding the soil for next year yeah

349
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,680
that's that's not a bit bad at all you

350
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:52,890
know you grow a hundred percent of your

351
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:55,739
plants you you take the top fifty to

352
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:57,360
seventy-five percent and then the last

353
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,909
twenty five percent you just let drop

354
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,200
right there and now it's got all of the

355
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:02,819
nutrients that you know next to your

356
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,220
needs yeah and it's a really nice to

357
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,528
start that in the fall cut all the

358
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,629
branches and make little piles of

359
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:11,070
branches and bury those with mulch for

360
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:14,789
the winter and you create these little

361
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:17,940
pockets of of underground homes and so

362
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:21,088
you get a lot of underground biology

363
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,010
that lasts way longer and more places

364
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:26,310
for things to hunt and more places for

365
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:29,100
things to lay eggs and really focusing

366
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:30,869
on creating that habitat for the

367
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,528
evolution of the biology they become

368
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:37,879
more complex means continually layering

369
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:41,189
different sized chunks and branches and

370
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:43,649
layers of hay and manure in the spring

371
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:46,529
and and it just keeps getting better and

372
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:49,019
better and better so to a certain degree

373
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:51,480
your entire garden is like one big

374
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:53,639
google cuz everything just drops and

375
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,709
rots on top of each other season after

376
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,659
season and you know it was pretty

377
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,609
remarkable actually when you know you

378
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,649
actually pulled up the hay often so

379
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,240
you're you pulled it up at potatoes and

380
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:05,578
hold it up oh here's some you know cool

381
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,380
bugs and then but then the one time you

382
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:09,750
pulled it up and you bought brought up

383
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,270
some of the soil and it was I mean it

384
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,980
looks decadent right yeah and and and

385
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:16,980
and if I understand what you said

386
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:20,818
correctly you really only bring in hay

387
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:24,630
from elsewhere everything else is is

388
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:26,629
sourced from here on on your acreage do

389
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,910
you feel like you're you're missing out

390
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,540
with anything no no your mind everything

391
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:35,790
you need on the property I mean so the

392
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:39,509
we take care of animals and so animals

393
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:42,119
have some inputs and so our inputs that

394
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:43,950
come onto the farm always go through the

395
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:47,159
animals so we take care of the animals

396
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,900
so if if there's we're not getting them

397
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,130
out into the forest around pasture as

398
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,780
much because we're managing

399
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,760
it's business in this new place and all

400
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:56,210
this and we want to use them more in the

401
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,980
woods but we can't we'll bring them

402
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,509
minerals that they need if we can't get

403
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,039
them into the space where they can

404
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:05,220
acquire them for themselves

405
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:07,049
so you know our inputs are hay and

406
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,650
whatever the animals kind of need which

407
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:15,589
is just some minerals there's a really

408
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:19,560
good salts that for animals that are

409
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:24,619
important so so the important thing is

410
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:32,549
is that the process of the production is

411
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:35,159
surrounding the the biological breakdown

412
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:37,680
of anything that's coming into the

413
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,810
garden so anything that comes here goes

414
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,320
through a lot of biology before the

415
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:44,669
plants get any use out of it and so

416
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,470
that's how we think about everything and

417
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,080
then we think about our garden beds as

418
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:53,279
the digestion chambers for it all so we

419
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:55,829
don't do any you know like teas and we

420
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,170
don't do fermenting and we don't have

421
00:18:55,829 --> 00:19:00,809
recipes for anything we just make sure

422
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,029
that we mulch really well that and have

423
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:05,309
a lot of home and diversity and space

424
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:08,399
and habitat for the biology to really

425
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:10,589
express its potential in that raizo

426
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,690
sphere and then that brings all the

427
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:15,179
wildlife and it really does increase and

428
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,670
stimulate the health of the whole area

429
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:21,360
the garden becomes this like birthing

430
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:23,759
point for all kinds of animals and the

431
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,159
return of different kinds of species of

432
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,559
snakes that we'd never seen here show up

433
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,960
on year three and you know so it's like

434
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,940
it keeps bringing the wildlife and the

435
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,190
deer get in there and it's all good you

436
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,350
know and it's so diverse that nothing

437
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,740
can really do too much damage to any one

438
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:42,480
thing so and it certainly helps with

439
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,549
with the balance sheet since you're also

440
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,230
running a company right you mean you're

441
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:48,329
saving a lot of money on inputs that

442
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,970
other people are putting in and your

443
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:53,519
flowers actually look better so you know

444
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,200
it's it's it's you know you might as

445
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,910
well save where you can especially since

446
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,460
you're in Oregon and the prices are here

447
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,470
so rock-bottom yeah and the bonus if

448
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,930
you're actually if you are actually a

449
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,380
small farm

450
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:08,570
and you know like just a cult a couple

451
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:13,120
people taking care because it's my wife

452
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:17,000
and I and and you know having animals

453
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:19,549
really helps because now when you do

454
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,980
spend money on the inputs you're also

455
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:24,710
creating food systems and you're

456
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,710
creating other benefits and so you're

457
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:30,279
getting a lot more bang for your buck

458
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,569
when you're running it through a herd

459
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,629
scenario where then you're able to make

460
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:37,490
all your own fertility or at least

461
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,640
enhance your fertility to a great degree

462
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:42,819
but the end goal really in a garden

463
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,780
becomes that the garden has enough

464
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:51,079
energy minerals and everything it needs

465
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:53,329
that just with simple human relationship

466
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:56,389
to all that biomass it doesn't need

467
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:58,009
anymore things to come to it so you try

468
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,620
to establish a certain level of

469
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:03,099
fertility and then if your system is

470
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:06,889
regenerative enough it never lets any

471
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:09,829
minerals or nutrients leach out of it

472
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,750
and so it recovers all of the important

473
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:14,569
stuff and makes it available later and

474
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:17,059
so your job becomes making the space for

475
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:18,769
the things you want to do better and

476
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:21,259
that's the real art of regenerative

477
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:24,019
agriculture is growing all your own

478
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:26,329
biomass to have a certain level of

479
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:29,389
carbon content in your soil so that the

480
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:31,639
production and the health is is high and

481
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:34,580
a big part of that is just having that

482
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,070
diverse habitat and allowing the voles

483
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:40,009
and the moles and the Gophers and the

484
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:43,490
snakes and the you know the things that

485
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:45,200
we're normally taught to be afraid of be

486
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,720
the things that are actually making the

487
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,460
spaces productive as it is that's the

488
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,920
shift we are all you know that we

489
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,019
believe in the most is that though we

490
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,340
can partner with all those components as

491
00:21:54,019 --> 00:22:00,529
long as we take care of them in the your

492
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:02,449
you're living life forms are palpable

493
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:05,839
right you know we walk the garden and

494
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:07,490
unlike a lot of monocultures where it's

495
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,099
just plant plant by plant because you've

496
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:12,859
got all this other stuff you can feel it

497
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:14,240
the the the the bees and the wasps and

498
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:15,649
the little beetles I don't know what

499
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,579
their names are and then the garter

500
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,649
snake and they

501
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:20,629
you know you can you can you can feel

502
00:22:18,648 --> 00:22:23,599
that you're in a living area instead of

503
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,789
a sterile area and you know it feels

504
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,980
good on my human yeah it feels good to

505
00:22:25,788 --> 00:22:30,079
be in the garden yeah and that can only

506
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,519
benefit up up the plants plus you go

507
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,609
right into the soil right you're not in

508
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,750
bags and so underneath all your plants

509
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:37,699
are talking to each other

510
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:40,849
yeah and that's gotta help intertwine

511
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,100
with a diverse number of different kinds

512
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:45,740
of plants and we watch the relationships

513
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:48,769
of root systems working with each other

514
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:51,169
and there's some that take over nutrient

515
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:53,419
availability there's some that work in

516
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:56,720
opposition to let other plants grow and

517
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:58,700
it's not really this thing about being

518
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,308
mad at them or saying one is good or bad

519
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,048
it's just about understanding what's

520
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:04,579
going on and making the right choices

521
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,319
and putting the right things in the

522
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:09,470
right spaces and understanding the

523
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:11,898
relationship so you can manage them to

524
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:14,509
the least amount of like destructive

525
00:23:11,898 --> 00:23:16,129
ways possible because that's the goal

526
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:19,579
you know is to be enhancing the

527
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:21,260
environment not destroying it yeah well

528
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:22,879
