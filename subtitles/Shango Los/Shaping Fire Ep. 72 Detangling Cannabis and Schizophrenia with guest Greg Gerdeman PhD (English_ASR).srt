2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,199
for folks who have been defending and

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,199
teaching about cannabis for years

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,119
it's often difficult to let any argument

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,838
stand that suggests that cannabis is

6
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,160
anything short of a perfect wonder herb

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,160
and while cannabis is a wonder herb it's

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,760
also true that because of prohibition

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,439
there's still a lot we don't know about

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,800
the cannabis plant and how it acts on

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,640
the human body

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,719
unfortunately politicians law

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,160
enforcement pharmaceutical companies and

14
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,558
concerned parent types

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,159
have used this absence of research to

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,799
promote cannabis fears

17
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,599
that are not based on evidence one of

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,919
these ideas

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,800
is that cannabis use causes psychotic

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,800
breaks

21
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,078
there's just not evidence for that but

22
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,159
here's the rub

23
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,640
cannabis and schizophrenia don't appear

24
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,398
to be totally unrelated either

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,840
based on the science we have it is a

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,359
complex understanding

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,680
and not the kind of thing easily

28
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,280
discussed casually in a facebook group

29
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,119
if we are to really understand the

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,239
relationship between psychosis and

31
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,799
cannabis use

32
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,679
we need a gently considered long-form

33
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,640
answer

34
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,799
welcome to that discussion have you used

35
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,478
cbg dominant cannabis flower tincture

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,118
and other preparations in the last six

37
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:13,840
months

38
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,359
dr ethan russo asked me to let you know

39
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,880
that he and others are conducting a

40
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,200
study to determine the benefits and

41
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,478
drawbacks to cannabidirol and they would

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,240
love your opinion

43
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,319
the questionnaire takes about 10 minutes

44
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,039
and can be anonymous if you wish

45
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,599

gerdeman

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,199
greg gerdemann has joined me joined me

93
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,159
on shaping fire before

94
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,158
way back on episode 14 to discuss

95
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,199
synthetic cannabinoids and then again

96
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,519
on episode 46 to discuss exercise

97
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,958
athleticism and cannabis

98
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,480
greg's work has been highlighted

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,840
throughout cannabis media and in

100
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,000
crossover publications

101
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,280
like science national geographic and the

102
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,039
new york times

103
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,878
his scholarly research has spanned

104
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,759
topics ranging from the synaptic

105
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,318
physiology

106
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,479
of the endocannabinoid system behavioral

107
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,560
pharmacology of cb1 receptors and their

108
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,318
regulation of habitual memories

109
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,158
the physiological activation of the

110
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,119
endocannabinoid system signaling and

111
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,959
exercise

112
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,799
and the evolutionary and comparative

113
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
biology of cannabinoid receptors through

114
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,319
studies on invertebrate

115
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,759
marine chordates totally great

116
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,919
scientific work

117
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,158
greg has also consulted for a handful of

118
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,079
nationally recognizable canvas brands

119
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,878
helping them develop medicinal cannabis

120
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,879
products today we will be detangling

121
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,878
schizophrenia and cannabis use

122
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,239
and teasing them apart to get a clearer

123
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,878
understanding of both

124
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,840
welcome back to shaping fire greg really

125
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,079
glad to be here

126
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,400
great to hear you so you know greg we

127
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
read in major media the assertion that

128
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,000
cannabis

129
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,599
causes schizophrenia and psychosis but

130
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,199
you know for most of us those are like

131
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,839
buzz words without very much

132
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,479
basis in reality would would you start

133
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,878
us off by describing schizophrenia first

134
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,399
and then

135
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,000
psychosis so that we can have a better

136
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,759
grasp on what we're even learning about

137
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,720
today yeah sure i will give that a shot

138
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,160
it's complicated you know for one thing

139
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,600
these are descriptions

140
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,800
of mental experience and mental illness

141
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,520
that

142
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,240
first of all we certainly understand now

143
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,319
exist on

144
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,319
on a continuum right it's like many

145
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,560
other situations of

146
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,478
psychiatric or neurological disease it's

147
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,839
not like something real simple like hey

148
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,519
your blood sugar is off you've got

149
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:45,119
diabetes

150
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:48,639
schizophrenia is a complex disorder

151
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,600
of really characterized by disordered

152
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,280
thought

153
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,199
and symptoms of disordered thought and

154
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,359
if that sounds like a broad net again

155
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,840
it's covering a broad

156
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,479
array of symptoms and let me be clear

157
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,879
that i'm

158
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,240
not a neurologist i'm not a medical

159
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,600
doctor

160
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,519
and things like clinical diagnoses

161
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,199
change over time so i wouldn't be the

162
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,120
most cutting edge person

163
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,720
necessarily you know i certainly

164
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,478
wouldn't diagnose someone

165
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,840
but that disclaimer aside schizophrenia

166
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:24,319
is characterized

167
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:28,719
by imbalances and a lack of control

168
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,719
over ordered thinking and

169
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,038
of course there are different levels of

170
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,799
severity and there are also two major

171
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,240
clusters that have classified

172
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,520
classically been described

173
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,199
of schizophrenic or

174
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:45,279
psychotic-like symptoms so psychosis is

175
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,079
kind of schizophrenia falls into a kind

176
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,519
of

177
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:52,879
of psychosis which again

178
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:56,318
is is sort of an imbalanced you know

179
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:58,639
disturbed thinking

180
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,000
schizophrenia symptoms classically get

181
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,280
divided into

182
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,399
what are called positive symptoms and

183
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:09,599
negative symptoms and

184
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,719
the negative tends to in many cases come

185
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
on first and

186
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,240
when when people say negative symptoms

187
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,560
of schizophrenia it doesn't mean that

188
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,680
they're bad and positive ones are good

189
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,639
it refers to mental experience

190
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,600
sort of being absent when it should be

191
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,478
there

192
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,919
or present when it shouldn't and what i

193
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:29,758
mean by that is

194
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,680
um well maybe i could start with with

195
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,240
the positive symptoms first because that

196
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,079
includes things like hallucinations

197
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,000
and uh paranoid ideations you know

198
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,478
paranoid conspiracies that go on in the

199
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,639
mind

200
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:48,318
or or thinking that goes on these are

201
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,199
imagining if you will or or sensing

202
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,240
reality that isn't objectively there to

203
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
the rest of us

204
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,319
you know total auditory hallucination of

205
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,639
someone speaking to you when

206
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,080
nobody else has any evidence that

207
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,720
there's someone there

208
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,359
that kind of hallucination is a positive

209
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,919
symptom because something is layering on

210
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,199
to your conscious experience that is not

211
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,478
objectively there

212
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,800
um then you have the negative symptoms

213
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,399
that

214
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,918
are more like apathy

215
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,758
which is related to not having

216
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,519
motivation um

217
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,960
anhedonia or lack of you know feeling

218
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,279
pleasure and blunt affect where you're

219
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,079
just

220
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,478
flat a flat sort of facial expression

221
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,478
lack

222
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:37,439
a loss of emotional expression

223
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,279
um and how does that get us to as an

224
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,959
introduction to what schizophrenia

225
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,959
and psychosis are

226
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,959
well it's really interesting i had never

227
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,919
considered the positive and the negative

228
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,000
aspects but

229
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,839
but as you describe it yeah i get that

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,439
with with the positive ones

231
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,239
the the disordered thoughts are creating

232
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,279
things that

233
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,639
are not objectifiably there

234
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,959
in the in the outside world

235
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,800
and then the negative ones are like of

236
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,198
some sort of lack of action a lack of

237
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,680
participation a lack of expression

238
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,478
and and so when you in earlier when you

239
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,879
use the term

240
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,519
disordered thoughts would would these

241
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,759
positive

242
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,799
and negative schizophrenic symptoms be

243
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,520
considered disordered thoughts

244
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,478
yes they are they are generally

245
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,719
considered disordered thoughts and

246
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,959
you know the extreme psychosis you asked

247
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,158
me where that fits in you know psychosis

248
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,879
is a more general term it's not

249
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,479
necessarily part of schizophrenia but it

250
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,599
is a

251
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,038
severe mental condition or disorder

252
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,240
where

253
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,319
thought and emotions are so

254
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,000
called and disordered or impaired that

255
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,959
that the person

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,440
is sort of lost from external reality

257
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:58,559
you are you are in your own world

258
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,680
and that's where a state of psychosis is

259
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,799
referred to

260
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,319
um but some of that

261
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,639
that can be obvio you know obviously

262
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,080
that's a disordering of sorts

263
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,319
or at least it makes sense to call it

264
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,600
that but what about something

265
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,879
more mundane like blunt affect

266
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,959
um you know it

267
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,799
i the way i liken it and this isn't

268
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,759
meant to be a textbook definition but

269
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,000
more my

270
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,958
you know what's coming out of my way of

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,240
thinking

272
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,119
and and i should say you know when i

273
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,959
started grad school 25 years ago

274
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,959
i started going into neurosciences an

275
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:36,239
interest in schizophrenia and

276
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,679
finding you know therapeutic

277
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,120
outcomes to help schizophrenia

278
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,039
discovering something this was a big

279
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,159
motivation to me i've always

280
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,799
had interest in this subject um

281
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,639
and so part of my speculation my

282
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,399
conjecture um

283
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,319
when someone i mean even just being a

284
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,320
teenager is sometimes associated with

285
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,278
you know being blunt affect right

286
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,278
yeah whatever i'm gloomy um

287
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,600
but i think in the in this situation

288
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:09,278
we're talking about

289
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,879
this can come about because of a

290
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:15,679
disconnect between like yourself and

291
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,720
future self like making the association

292
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,078
between

293
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,560
what i want to do and where my hopes

294
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,120
of where i want to be are or what my

295
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,319
plan

296
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,399
is um or maybe just

297
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:33,760
not feeling the a

298
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,200
joy um you know you could probably

299
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,958
nitpick about whether this is

300
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
a disorganized thought or just something

301
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,119
that's not really well wired or

302
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:45,120
connected with in a

303
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,639
productive way but they're certainly all

304
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,919
symptoms that come together

305
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:55,360
in diagnoses of

306
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,838
schizophrenia which progress into more

307
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,480
and more severe conditions

308
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,399
where the individual does become

309
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,759
psychotic where this

310
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,240
combination of you know

311
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,519
so-called negative symptoms and not

312
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,799
feeling

313
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,320
or expressing normal

314
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,278
emotions and and sensations combined

315
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,360
with

316
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,399
experiencing things that really aren't

317
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,519
there

318
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,879
to just create massive confusion that

319
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:30,078
becomes an agitation from that confusion

320
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:32,799
that becomes sort of the hallmark of

321
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,599
you know madness i mean the names for

322
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,879
these things have

323
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,240
changed many times over the years right

324
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,600
but

325
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,440
schizophrenic illness is a you get

326
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,278
various levels of severity

327
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:50,320
but the popular thinking

328
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:54,000
is one of madness insanity

329
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,040
sometimes violent you know insanity but

330
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,679
not always

331
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,360
sometimes just utterly withdrawn

332
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,638
oftentimes complex you know

333
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,519
the brilliant mind kind of um reality

334
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,278
where

335
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:10,159
someone um in a fixation with

336
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,439
understanding patterns in the world

337
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,278
which is actually interesting because

338
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,800
our whole conversation is couched around

339
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,639
conspiracies and

340
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,919
making patterns in the world you know

341
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,560
sometimes that

342
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:22,159
is in a very leads to extremely

343
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,679
brilliant outcomes right

344
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,679
mathematical insights in someone who is

345
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,439
otherwise incapable of functioning

346
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,639
except being utterly withdrawn from the

347
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,079
world

348
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,519
[Music]

349
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:38,799
so it's a it's a really fascinating

350
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:42,000
terrain of the human brain

351
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,120
you know and we have uh

352
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,519
here i go into being an evolutionary

353
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,440
neurobiologist

354
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:53,759
but we evolved these

355
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,959
utterly miraculous cognating brains

356
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,278
you know which were clearly

357
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,319
evolved in in humans because it made us

358
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,600
successful we

359
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,278
are able to figure things out that is a

360
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,519
recipe for

361
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,519
planning and success and reproduction

362
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,039
and it led to agriculture and

363
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,720
architecture and culture and so many

364
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,958
aspects of what it means to be human but

365
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,759
it kind of

366
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,559
has these traces of what makes us

367
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,600
sometimes

368
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,000
neurotic about not only being able to

369
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,440
figure

370
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,679
things out but being driven to have to

371
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,320
figure out connections

372
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,638
and and one way this manifests in both

373
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,200
subtle and sometimes really neurotic

374
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,839
ways

375
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,040
is seeing patterns that aren't

376
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,959
necessarily there

377
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,159
and getting convinced by them whether

378
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,958
it's a

379
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,000
theory of a con global cabal controlling

380
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,679
everything with

381
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,519
the flip of a switch or um

382
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:55,439
other things like you know my teenager

383
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,759
wouldn't have happened like this

384
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:03,440
if he hadn't experimented with that weed

385
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:06,720
it's really remarkable how

386
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,079
it's pretty startling actually to listen

387
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,759
to you describe

388
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:14,838
the negative symptoms of schizophrenia

389
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,159
and how similar they sound to clinical

390
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,959
depression

391
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,838
and you know you're describing this

392
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,559
range

393
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,680
from you know some amounts of

394
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,159
schizophrenia

395
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,359
and some slight expression of the

396
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,078
symptoms all the way

397
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,720
up to you know violent outbursts and

398
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,439
people

399
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,920
becoming you know unhinged with reality

400
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,680
yeah

401
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,078
i i've just got to think that there's a

402
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:41,278
lot of people in the

403
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,638
um you know on the on the less

404
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,838
obvious side where it looks like

405
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,680
depression that are undiagnosed

406
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,320
for sure and then of course then you get

407
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,359
in the world the world of

408
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,760
comorbidities which is you know when you

409
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,800
diagnose you seem to have both diagnoses

410
00:14:53,759 --> 00:15:00,000
um and there's lots of overlap in these

411
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,039
in this world there's someone in in my

412
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,839
sphere right now

413
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,759
that is dealing with being diagnosed

414
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,880
with schizophrenia but he's like no i'm

415
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,600
bipolar

416
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:11,120
um you know and i certainly over the

417
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,440
years

418
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,198
sometimes i mean i try to be very

419
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,440
deliberate in what i'm saying i mean the

420
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,479
last thing i want to do is create stigma

421
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,440
towards people who have struggles with

422
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,000
their mental health

423
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,959
whether it's depression or schizophrenia

424
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,519
and

425
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,599
um and you know with at risk of going

426
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,480
down a tangent which we won't i mean i

427
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,839
i go so far as to you know really follow

428
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,480
people's thinking about

429
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,519
cognitive liberty i mean just because

430
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,199
someone is a

431
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,278
i mean people can be functional

432
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,559
schizophrenics if

433
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,799
their surroundings and community

434
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,000
you know and vocation allows them to

435
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,319
function

436
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,360
um but anyway that that could go down a

437
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,399
little wormhole

438
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,278
um yeah it it

439
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,958
there's similarities for sure and again

440
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:02,639
i've never been a

441
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:04,958
medical doctor and i have empathy for um

442
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,759
for psychiatrists when they have a

443
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:09,919
balancing act like this and

444
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,199
in figuring out you know and putting a

445
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,719
name to things

446
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,719
there again our underlying human

447
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,519
neuroses we've got to put names to

448
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,040
things

449
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,440
um and molecular psychiatry

450
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,559
meaning you know since the advent of

451
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,680
pharmaceutical

452
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:29,359
drugs that you know have

453
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,879
useful roles in in psychiatry um

454
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,480
well it's changed everything i mean on

455
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,480
the one side it's made things kind of

456
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,799
a medicine bowl approach like here try

457
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,560
this bill and if it

458
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,479
has an effect well that'll influence my

459
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,958
diagnosis yeah because of what we've

460
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,759
learned

461
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,679
um and and then we go you can go back to

462
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,839
the very first antipsychotics like

463
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:53,120
thorazine that came out

464
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:56,079
in the 50s and 60s that um

465
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,919
that that had huge social impact i mean

466
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,879
there was a mindset hey we don't have to

467
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,519
have

468
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,318
homes for the mentally insane anymore um

469
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,359
and and so those sort of sanitariums and

470
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:10,078
inpatient mental health

471
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,879
facilities are now sort of historical

472
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,399
vestiges

473
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,839
um and of course there were horrific

474
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,839
things that happened you know lobotomies

475
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,000
and other things like that but

476
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,359
on the other hand it wasn't really a

477
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,959
golden

478
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,719
ticket you know the many many homeless

479
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,400
people are schizophrenic many

480
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,038
of them end up on the street um so

481
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,519
it's it's a very complex issue how about

482
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,759
that

483
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:38,240
yeah schizophrenia is complicated and

484
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,160
there are many ways to simplify it

485
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,160
including the idea that

486
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,240
you know there's some simple trigger

487
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,038
schizophrenia

488
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,759
typically when it gets more serious it

489
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:53,519
happens

490
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:56,480
in the late teens to mid to late 20s

491
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,079
and there is very often a precipitating

492
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,759
kind of event

493
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,918
and it has been observed you know

494
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,480
without being cued to go further into

495
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,160
our conversation i mean

496
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,240
associations have been observed

497
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,480
scientifically that

498
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,558
sometimes people who are precipitated

499
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,679
into having a psychotic event that

500
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:21,279
turns into more manifest schizophrenia

501
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:24,080
have experimented with cannabis

502
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:25,599
smoking tobacco is statistically

503
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,439
associated with

504
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:31,599
a greater likelihood of sec of of

505
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,440
developing schizophrenia going to

506
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,719
college is more

507
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,160
statistically likely to lead to a

508
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,160
psychotic event that turns into

509
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,440
schizophrenia you know but but nobody

510
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,360
talks about

511
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,960
you know banning kids from college it's

512
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,599
a matter of

513
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,440
uh someone and we'll get into much of

514
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,159
this you know as we go on to the hour

515
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,880
but

516
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,480
someone who may already you know be be

517
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,280
disposed to

518
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,679
schizophrenia experiencing that stress

519
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,119
and

520
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,559
and you know environment so those other

521
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,038
causalities are

522
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,639
uh really interesting and you're right

523
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,119
they're never mentioned and we will go

524
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,320
we will go into that more um in the

525
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,519
second set

526
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,839
but before we before we go into that um

527
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,798
now that we've established what

528
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,879
schizophrenia

529
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,798
is this kind of this basket of

530
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,840
attributes both positive and negative

531
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,160
attributes

532
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,918
things that we see that don't exist and

533
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,679
then ways that we should express

534
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,160
ourselves that we're not

535
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,240
if they're all in this big basket um

536
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,480
let's let's look at a different basket

537
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,919
and

538
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,038
and that basket is you know what people

539
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,080
experience

540
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,319
when they they over medicate you know

541
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,918
most people who have used cannabis at

542
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,240
some point or another have had that

543
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,440
experience of taking too high of a dose

544
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,919
of thc

545
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,720
and feeling like they're coming unhinged

546
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,200
right i'm very familiar with it myself

547
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,279
paranoia situational hallucinations

548
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,279
about what is and is not happening

549
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,119
sometimes freestanding hallucinations if

550
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,038
you get a really big dose and

551
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,678
you know it eventually goes away as the

552
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,919
body processes the cannabinoids

553
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,880
so what i'd love for you to clarify

554
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,120
gregor

555
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,320
what are these over medicated

556
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,599
experiences

557
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,960
in medical terms and are these moments

558
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,079
of psychosis

559
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,519
well you know i mean thc is a a

560
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:25,599
profoundly powerful

561
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:28,158
um substance isn't it and uh

562
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,279
you know i flashed back some to being a

563
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,760
college professor and

564
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,359
um you know the secret was pretty well

565
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,480
known that i was the

566
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:39,038
a pot guy you know scientist and

567
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,798
uh and so a lot of kids with the a lot

568
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,440
of students in the college would

569
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,480
feel like therefore i was a safe person

570
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,798
to open up to

571
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,000
on their experience of you know the

572
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,879
classic experience right

573
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,599
i went to amsterdam i tried a cookie and

574
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,440
it wasn't

575
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,199
hitting me an hour later so i ate two

576
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,240
more and

577
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,558
those those edible experiences are

578
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,159
you know the the classic ways to get

579
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:06,000
into that place

580
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,600
and you know frankly

581
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,200
i learned this from our mutual friend

582
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:13,439
ethan russo you know

583
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,360
that clinicians will refer to that state

584
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,000
of having way too much and being in that

585
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,279
place as

586
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,240
a toxic psychosis meaning that a

587
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,240
psychosis

588
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,279
being completely like i mentioned you

589
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,440
know separated

590
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,678
you're you're kind of out of it not

591
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,038
sometimes you know your way out of it

592
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,240
um in your own mental state in your own

593
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,279
mental bubble

594
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,400
and basing toxic psychosis meaning it's

595
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,279
brought on by a toxin in this case and i

596
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
know that

597
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,558
cannabis people sometimes myself

598
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,679
included

599
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:48,399
can be averse to calling thc a toxin

600
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,240
but it takes you to a place you don't

601
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,640
want to be i mean

602
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,200
hey it always stands to to mention that

603
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,679
the reason why we're all so

604
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,360
enamored with cannabis is because of all

605
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,840
the good things it can do and the fact

606
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,839
that

607
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,359
even in these worst case scenarios

608
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,839
you're going to wake up in the morning

609
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,439
and be

610
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:09,439
over it but

611
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,840
yeah it it can be called a toxic

612
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,600
psychosis

613
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:15,678
now this happens with other substances

614
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,879
right i mean

615
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,400
amphetamine and cocaine likewise can

616
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,200
create a very different kind of

617
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,360
psychosis

618
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,360
which in the case of amphetamines

619
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,639
is i've been i learned this when i was

620
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,678
taking med school classes

621
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,240
as part of my graduate training that an

622
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,840
amphetamine induced psychosis from

623
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,120
taking way too much

624
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:42,558
um you know speed he used to call it uh

625
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,639
adderall other kinds of amphetamines

626
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:47,200
in an emergency room setting that's

627
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,038
indistinguishable from someone having a

628
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,480
paranoid schizophrenic

629
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:54,720
psychosis and and indeed there's a whole

630
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,079
dopamine hypothesis of

631
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,279
of why amphetamines stimulate dopamine

632
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:03,119
um and there's in the drugs many of the

633
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,399
drugs that are therapeutic

634
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:09,678
for schizophrenic patients for uh

635
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,840
that illness are blockers of those drugs

636
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,280
so i don't want to confound them too

637
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,639
much i mean they're very different

638
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,759
experiences

639
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,960
going way too far on thc than going

640
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:23,919
you know overdosing on an amphetamine

641
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,759
but they both can be called psychosis

642
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,799
that are triggered by

643
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:32,240
uh by another substance um

644
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:34,319
it is interesting how if we go back to

645
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,159
the the positive and negative

646
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:39,200
schizophrenic

647
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,679
symptom definitions you know take let's

648
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,120
take

649
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,840
a a a a minor

650
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,759
negative which would be for example like

651
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,558
the lack of expression on your face

652
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,038
right um they're you know there are it

653
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,319
is not

654
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:57,200
uncommon for somebody to have so much

655
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:59,119
thc that they're that their facial

656
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,159
expression is is checked out they're

657
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,519
just so

658
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,320
stoned right yeah yeah and and at that

659
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,798
point

660
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,319
you know um you know they would they

661
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:12,400
would be

662
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:15,359
showing evidence of of schizophrenia

663
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,159
and and certainly if we go on the

664
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:18,000
positive

665
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,278
attributes like seeing things that

666
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,558
aren't there or

667
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:24,480
uh in my experience imagining situations

668
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:27,119
that are happening that are not

669
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,440
right which which from your definition i

670
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:32,158
think would would fit as a positive

671
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,759
symptom um you know i think we've all

672
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,200
been in a situation where like wait is

673
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,079
this is this thing happening the way i

674
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,919
think it is and

675
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,439
you know more often than not you know

676
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,240
you totally are misinterpreting the

677
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,159
situation but

678
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,599
it's a type of hallucination i would

679
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,080
suggest

680
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,519
so um well and it's important you know

681
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,199
clinically and again i

682
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,558
you know okay i've said the disclaimer

683
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,200
enough i'm not a medical doctor

684
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,798
but you know before someone could be

685
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,120
diagnosed with schizophrenia there's

686
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:59,359
there needs to be you know it's

687
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,079
recognized that many of these things are

688
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:02,639
are real or phenomena that we all

689
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,319
experience

690
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,720
at different places in time you know

691
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,759
imagination creativity

692
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,720
is involves imagining things that aren't

693
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:14,158
there

694
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,798
um and being you know

695
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,278
distracted in your thoughts is not in

696
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,798
itself

697
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:22,400
a disorder um but

698
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:23,918
you know i mean so that there's just the

699
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,880
disclaimer there but you you bring up an

700
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,640
interesting point

701
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,159
i hope i didn't interrupt you but i keep

702
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,840
going i liked the way you were saying

703
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:35,919
how getting stoned can lead to

704
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:37,519
a blunting of affect and i do

705
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,038
tend to think in many of those cases

706
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:42,079
it's because

707
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,720
you're in your head um or

708
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:47,119
in the ways that cannabis sort of can

709
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,278
take you out of the temporal moment

710
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,319
you know you've lost jack of time and

711
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:54,480
you're just

712
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:56,240
sort of there and and being and

713
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,960
i sometimes and this goes into my own

714
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,319
conjecture but i i think

715
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,240
people who are um experiencing it as

716
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:08,720
part of a mental condition

717
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:11,038
that may be something more um like a

718
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,720
schizophrenic or someone who's prodromal

719
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,839
going to be schizophrenic

720
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,360
um the blunt affect can

721
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:21,119
it it may be that there's an inability

722
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:24,079
to sort of

723
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,719
want to feel where you're at or plan the

724
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,038
future

725
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,919
or maybe it's a rumination going in your

726
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,960
head

727
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:34,799
there's something similar to

728
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,558
cannabis in particular thc

729
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,038
you know also sort of taking you out of

730
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,639
your head and and being blunt like that

731
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:43,919
and

732
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,679
maybe maybe that's um

733
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,600
part of why schizophrenics can find

734
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,278
cannabis therapeutic it gives them a

735
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,558
sort of a ease and a comfort in that

736
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,240
space

737
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,000
and there again is a subject i know

738
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,720
we're going to talk about a little bit

739
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,640
later

740
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,079
but there's overlap and this sort of

741
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,480
there's

742
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,319
i think it's important i go into this in

743
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,919
this you know

744
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:12,000
essay for project cbd that

745
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:15,600
the the link the accusation

746
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,599
of reefer madness that that cannabis

747
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,719
leads to madness to schizophrenia that

748
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:21,278
it is a trigger

749
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,600
you know a little time bomb there's all

750
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:27,380
kinds of metaphors that are used

751
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:29,199
to drive this association home

752
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,480
[Music]

753
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,399
part of the reason it's why it's

754
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,720
successful is there is a sort of face

755
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,599
value validity that you have to realize

756
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,360
that

757
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:41,759
that cannabis is a is a powerful

758
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,398
psychoactive substance and there are

759
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,440
aspects

760
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:48,798
of it that will look to

761
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,480
the non-user as being as as

762
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:55,519
sharing traits with symptoms

763
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,240
of disordered thought i mean smoking

764
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,599
cannabis

765
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:03,440
does take your thought out of the

766
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:05,519
normal order than it's in

767
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,038
but that doesn't mean it's the same kind

768
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,119
of situation

769
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:10,480
of schizophrenia and again you've

770
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,839
brought up the

771
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,720
talk what i've called the toxic

772
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,439
psychosis of a going way too far on thc

773
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,720
yet you know

774
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,600
tec overdose as it were

775
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,558
and that even you know someone who

776
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,959
experiments

777
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:28,639
with with cannabis and goes too far

778
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,558
may come away from it saying yeah it

779
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,440
made me crazy i mean look at the article

780
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,079
that

781
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,519
uh journalist maureen dowd wrote a few

782
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,759
years ago that famously

783
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,599
you know she decided to just way over

784
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,960
indulge in edibles and wrote about it as

785
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:44,158
a horror story

786
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:47,278
and going back to the marijuana

787
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,159
tax act that really was the major piece

788
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,200
in

789
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,200
this age of cannabis prohibition we

790
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,798
hopefully are we that we are coming out

791
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,038
of um

792
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,319
you know one of the powerful testimonies

793
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,200
that supported

794
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,798
criminalizing marijuana aside from the

795
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,640
fact that they threw the name marijuana

796
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,679
on it

797
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,120
was was a um a

798
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:14,240
psychologist from temple university who

799
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:16,319
who testified that he uh

800
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,159
used to forget if he smoked it or ate it

801
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:19,519
or he used cannabis and that he turned

802
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,840
into a bat

803
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,440
and flew around the room he didn't say i

804
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,879
imagine it he said like on the

805
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,080
congressional record that he

806
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,679
turned into a bat here's someone who

807
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,519
clearly

808
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,360
if he didn't have some ulterior motive i

809
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,200
mean if you take him as believable

810
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,558
he nonetheless had a really disturbing

811
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,080
experience

812
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:43,440
and again we you know

813
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:46,558
we as humans tend to look for

814
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,600
simple explanations and

815
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,519
science is really not different from

816
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:54,639
that and certainly politics

817
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,519
and and rulership isn't you you come up

818
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,520
with a simple

819
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,558
an explanation like hey i experienced

820
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:02,319
this really

821
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:04,158
out of my mind phenomenon i believe it

822
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:05,678
that somebody could go crazy

823
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,360
i felt like i wasn't going to come out

824
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,960
of it what if that's true what if

825
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:11,759
sometimes you never come out of it and

826
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,880
you stay there forever

827
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:17,200
there's a certain level where you gotta

828
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,399
sympathize with where people could come

829
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,558
to that

830
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,239
conclusion and even when we look at

831
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:23,599
ancient history you know those of us who

832
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,640
are really

833
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:27,759
cannabis buffs have enjoyed learning

834
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,640
from some of our

835
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,240
some research into ancient history and

836
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,880
and we

837
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,399
i mean it's it's really informative that

838
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,960
humans have used cannabis

839
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,959
therapeutically and as a sacrament since

840
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,159
before human written history

841
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,360
but also some of those early texts

842
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,919
that refer to cannabis as medicine

843
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,398
and what have you make reference to them

844
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,720
as

845
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:54,558
to cannabis as being like a substance

846
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,679
that takes you out of your mind

847
00:30:54,558 --> 00:31:01,599
um this isn't new

848
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:06,000
you know that that we have a

849
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:09,439
recognition that cannabis can cause

850
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,880
serious impact to your mental state

851
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,480
but you come out of it and in many cases

852
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,840
it's what we're going there for in the

853
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,720
first place right yeah

854
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,798
yeah i think that um one of the

855
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,319
challenging aspects with this particular

856
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,879
topic greg and why i

857
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,879
so appreciate both the tone you took in

858
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,120
your article for project cbd and

859
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,519
and just you know how you are as a

860
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:34,879
scientist overall is that

861
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:37,919
so much of the cannabis

862
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,600
media and and you know and stoner family

863
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,200
and everything you know

864
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:46,240
me included we we want we were so

865
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,798
used to being on the defensive from the

866
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,558
taboo reefer madness people saying that

867
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,519
cannabis is so

868
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:55,278
terrible and will just destroy your life

869
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,319
that it puts us in a position

870
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:02,159
to kind of be reactive to that to

871
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:03,278
to react to it their gross hyperbole of

872
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,679
how bad it is

873
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:06,640
by by kind of taking our own hyperbole

874
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,840
and saying

875
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,200
there is you know cannabis is flawless

876
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:13,038
right there's nothing that could

877
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,319
possibly be wrong with it and and you

878
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:15,919
know what i don't even feel comfortable

879
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:19,278
using the word wrong right

880
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:21,440
um but there there are certainly

881
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:22,398
parts there are certainly experiences

882
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,679
that

883
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:28,719
i and others have with cannabis which

884
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,360
was not necessarily the intention and

885
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,200
are

886
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:36,479
dysphoric and and generally as humans we

887
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,440
we want to avoid dysphoria

888
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,440
and and it feels like so much so many of

889
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,159
us in cannabis

890
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,080
we feel constrained from talking about

891
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,960
some of those

892
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:51,199
less attractive aspects of cannabis

893
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,000
because we're really afraid that

894
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,080
that the the prohibition folks will like

895
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,720
grab on that little thing that we say

896
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,199
and say aha see here is the evidence

897
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,839
that it

898
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,759
is the absolute worst and we're like no

899
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:04,639
all we're saying is that if you get too

900
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,839
high it really

901
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,360
sucks you know which is which is

902
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:11,918
not hyperbolic and and and so it pushes

903
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,240
us

904
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,320
to not say anything and that's one of

905
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,159
the reasons why i appreciate

906
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,319
the shaping fire audience because the

907
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,640
shaping fire audience can make that

908
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,599
delineation you know the folks that

909
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,200
listen to this show

910
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,839
are you know pretty reliable thinkers

911
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,159
right and they're

912
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,278
like oh i get i get this right i get

913
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,200
that there can be

914
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,119
some parts of cannabis which are less

915
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,120
attractive to me without

916
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,479
the opposite being true and that it's a

917
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,439
demonic drug

918
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,440
right and so so um we're gonna go to

919
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,159
commercial break right now but when we

920
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,759
come back

921
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,679
that is where we're gonna start with

922
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:50,720
this idea of reverse

923
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,720
causality that that just because there

924
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,319
are some of these attributes

925
00:33:52,720 --> 00:34:00,079
that um cannabis that we don't like

926
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,798
does not mean that uh the inverse is

927
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,240
true

928
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,000
and then and then we're gonna take a

929
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,120
look at um how

930
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,480
the the nature of our country is set up

931
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:12,319
that that reinforces this reefer madness

932
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,559
you are listening to shaping fire and my

933
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,960
guest today is neuroscientist greg

934
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,960
gurdaman

935
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,960
as cannabis regulations become more

936
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,679
demanding and consumers become more

937
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,599
educated

938
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,200
it is increasingly important to avoid

939
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,879
the use of chemical pesticides when

940
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,559
cultivating cannabis

941
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,398
beneficial insects have been used for

942
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,000
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and

943
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,319
ornamental plant industry

944
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and today many cannabis cultivators are

945
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,039

946
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,039

1038
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,760
oxygen is an essential plant nutrient

1039
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,838
and keeping sufficient dissolved oxygen

1040
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,000
in the root zone is a challenge

gaia's brand of ultrafine nanobubble

systems will help your garden thrive in

1043

ways you may not have considered

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,839
no matter if you grow in soil

1045
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,320
hydroponics or aquaponics

1046
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:10,159
gaia's ultrafine nanobubble systems will

1047
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,200
increase your dissolved oxygen

1048
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:15,279
and increase your yield often the first

1049
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,199
sign of inadequate oxygen supply to the

1050
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,079
roots is wilting of the plant under warm

1051
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,719
conditions and

1052
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,960
high light levels insufficient oxygen

1053
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:24,719
results in an accumulation of toxins

1054
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,240
and an insufficient amount of water and

1055
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,799
mineral absorption

1056
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,559
if oxygen starvation continues mineral

1057
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,480
deficiencies will begin to show

1058
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,679
roots die back and plants will become

1059
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,679
stunted

1060
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:38,239
healthy roots supplied with sufficient

1061
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,919
oxygen are able to absorb nutrient ions

1062
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,679
selectively from the surrounding

1063
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,000
solution as required

1064
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:46,000
in studies this has shown a 30 percent

1065
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,320
increase in plant growth

1066
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,838
not only do ultrafine oxygen bubbles

1067
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,519
allow your plants to thrive

1068
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:53,759
but they will keep your drip lines and

1069
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,000
irrigation pipes and plumbing clean too

1070
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,000
because algae pithium and other invasive

1071
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,119
species only survive in low

1072
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,039
oxygen environments and the gaia system

1073
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,160
only costs about two dollars per day to

1074
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,199
run

1075
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:09,358
gaia ultrafine oxygen nano bubblers

1076
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:11,439
are also great for making compost teas

1077
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,838
and wild crafted nutrient teas

1078
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,559
the smaller bubbles of truly dissolved

1079
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:17,599
oxygen

1080
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:21,519

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,480

shaping fire and i'm your host shango

1088
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:38,000
los and our guest this week is

1089
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,640
neuroscientist greg gerdeman

1090
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,880
so greg during the first set we set up

1091
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:44,879
what schizophrenia and psychosis

1092
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,000
are the the baskets of attributes that

1093
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,240
they tend to have

1094
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,920
now we talked a lot about um what it's

1095
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,078
like to

1096
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,920
over medicate on thc and what's that

1097
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,000
like and we definitely found some

1098
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,400
similarities between the two

1099
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,440
but it doesn't mean that one necessarily

1100
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,400
causes the other

1101
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,318
or is even the same thing we've seen

1102
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,680
this happen historically

1103
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:10,159
in the press and and how um you know the

1104
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:13,358
general population looks like cannabis

1105
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:14,318
never so obviously as when there is some

1106
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:16,639
sort of

1107
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:17,440
you know psychotic crime or murder or

1108
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:19,920
something

1109
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,838
and they find out that the individual

1110
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,079
who committed the crime

1111
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:25,838
you know was a cannabis user or used

1112
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,400
cannabis earlier in their life

1113
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,159
and then and then they they suddenly tie

1114
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,440
these psychotic breaks

1115
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:35,118
to the actual crime which of course was

1116
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,440
very useful during the

1117
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,559
the height of the prohibition and reefer

1118
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,039
madness days

1119
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,000
um i know that you have studied this in

1120
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,039
depth so

1121
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,760
would you kind of uh summarize how that

1122
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,119
has happened

1123
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,319
and and that that um that phenomenon in

1124
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,960
the media of

1125
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:54,800
of taking these these folks who commit

1126
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,000
these crimes and and dumping

1127
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,079
all that at the feet of cannabis

1128
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,119
yeah i'll i'll try to do that i mean

1129
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,960
it's

1130
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,200
it goes in line with this you know

1131
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,119
thinking of it as a conspiracy theory

1132
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:12,559
in that um evident when something

1133
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,920
seems to a story has been told that

1134
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:20,078
you know the reefer causes madness

1135
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,599
and when that story is out there and

1136
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,760
there's

1137
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,440
a believability to it and a desire to

1138
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,680
believe it

1139
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,480
for ulterior motives and and what have

1140
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,440
you

1141
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,599
um it snowballs every time you get you

1142
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,280
know something that can be seen

1143
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,720
as a piece of evidence and and you

1144
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,480
mentioned that it was instrumental in

1145
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,838
prohibition it certainly

1146
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,960
was and there's a a very

1147
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,559
specific case that i came to

1148
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,559
find out about because i was living down

1149
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:53,039
in st p florida and

1150
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:57,440
this case happened in ybor city in tampa

1151
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:58,159
in the 1930s early 1930s this fella

1152
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,280
named

1153
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:04,318
victor licata

1154
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:07,119
was a terribly troubled young man

1155
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:07,920
and it's a horrible story this guy

1156
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,559
became an

1157
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,000
axe murderer he he killed his entire

1158
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,039
family his parents

1159
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,318
his siblings um and

1160
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:20,960
it became a um

1161
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:23,440
cause celeb sort of you know a

1162
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,559
publicized face because

1163
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,599
he was um it was said that he was a

1164
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,719
marijuana

1165
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,280
addict the police

1166
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,279
found in some way i mean i don't

1167
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,920
remember all the details but

1168
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,680
um the the police had like a marijuana

1169
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,480
cigarette and said he had been

1170
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,199
addicted to smoking marijuana cigarettes

1171
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,240
for

1172
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:49,759
you know like six months um well

1173
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:52,239
this was as these things happened um

1174
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,200
picked up by powerful figures like harry

1175
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:55,519
anslinger who was

1176
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,639
probably the most well it was the most

1177
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:59,759
important

1178
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:03,199
driving force in in that you know

1179
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,839
prohibition um and

1180
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:06,960
they he became the face of the drug

1181
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:10,480
crazed

1182
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:14,400
murderous uh madman the

1183
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:18,960
the marijuana dope fiend all of these

1184
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:22,160
pejorative terms got created

1185
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,679
justified by an individual case of

1186
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:28,799
shocking horror value you know an

1187
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:31,919
absolute tragedy but

1188
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,960
um as historians have looked back at

1189
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,960
that

1190
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,960
case and i think it happened you know it

1191
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,519
didn't take too long for it to

1192
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,119
to happen that it was recognized that

1193
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:44,159
this person had

1194
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,960
um a history of pre-existing

1195
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,879
history of disturbing mental illness in

1196
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,280
fact he never did time

1197
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,440
for that crime he was institutionalized

1198
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,680
for his

1199
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,720
psychosis because he was considered

1200
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,879
unfit

1201
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:01,199
to stand trial he was diagnosed at the

1202
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,000
time what was called dementia precocks

1203
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:06,960
with homicidal tendencies

1204
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,838
but it was it called that some kind of a

1205
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,358
powerful psychotic schizophrenia

1206
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:15,679
um it also it's worth noting

1207
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:18,318
so he was committed to the hospital or

1208
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:21,358
the insane

1209
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:25,039
he his he had a family history

1210
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:27,199
of uh of meant severe mental illness

1211
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:30,800
like an uncle his parents had

1212
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:32,719
some uh insanity in their family his

1213
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,960
parents were actually first cousins of

1214
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:38,318
one another and

1215
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,639
during his time at um uh

1216
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,880
the mental institution uh his the

1217
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:44,960
records never really focused on

1218
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,079
saying that his you know that marijuana

1219
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,039
use had any

1220
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:55,200
cause and uh in his condition

1221
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:58,719
but that creates such a graphic

1222
00:44:55,199 --> 00:45:00,000
story um and became very powerfully

1223
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:03,519
associated with

1224
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,559
a drug that was not well known

1225
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:09,920
certainly not as marijuana in

1226
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:13,039
the united states and it it helped to

1227
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,800
propel cannabis into the prohibited

1228
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:16,719
status

1229
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,480
when it was effectively banned by the

1230
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,159
marijuana tax act

1231
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,159
these kinds of things do go on you know

1232
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:25,199
i don't at the top of my

1233
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:27,118
head have a more graphic

1234
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:28,399
you know example is that there may not

1235
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,760
be another example

1236
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,358
as important but there's been you know

1237
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,200
there are elements of that that still

1238
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:37,039
continue i mean

1239
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,439
i remember when i was in florida a few

1240
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:42,480
years ago there was a case of

1241
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,440
remember that case of uh the

1242
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,280
the guy who like was caught by police

1243
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,599
like trying to eat the face of another

1244
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,400
man

1245
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,800
yeah completely psychotically deranged

1246
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,639
and

1247
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,839
the media had a field day with that

1248
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:57,039
without any

1249
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:59,119
details and field day and it it was at

1250
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:02,639
least for a brief period of time

1251
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:05,760
blamed on marijuana because of

1252
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,118
a drug talks that this guy had thc in

1253
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,880
his system

1254
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,440
it was actually it was something that

1255
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,760
was uh he had also been ingesting like

1256
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,920
some of these powerful bath salts that

1257
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:21,760
are just intensely psychoactive

1258
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,559
and certainly can lead to psychotic

1259
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,560
be pregnant severe psychotic behaviors i

1260
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,799
mean the notion that it was

1261
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,880
linked to cannabis at all is ridiculous

1262
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:35,200
but it serves

1263
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,800
what has you know been a political will

1264
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:39,519
to support

1265
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,839
the theory i mean the the mindset the

1266
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:45,519
the fallacy that

1267
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:47,519
cannabis creates schizophrenia

1268
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:48,960
you know there there are lots of ways

1269
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,639
that i think these

1270
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,920
theories get supported you know what

1271
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:52,960
i've said you've got to have some face

1272
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,760
value believable

1273
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,119
believability to it right okay check

1274
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,359
secondly

1275
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,640
for something like the conspiracy of

1276
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,679
reefer manas

1277
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:06,639
um it i think you know there tends to be

1278
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:08,000
certain ulterior motives certainly ann

1279
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,639
slinger had interior

1280
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,119
ulterior motives he was a prohibitionist

1281
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:13,598
he

1282
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,039
was on a crusade against satanism which

1283
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,160
he associated with

1284
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:21,199
jazz music and their reefers

1285
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:23,440
he was racist and there's another

1286
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:24,799
insidious ulterior motive right when the

1287
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,639
bulk of the country doesn't know

1288
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,720
anything about marijuana

1289
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:33,519
and it gets colored as something that is

1290
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:34,078
associated with the ethnic minorities

1291
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:36,639
that

1292
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,079
you might want to blame for something

1293
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:40,400
there are ulterior motives that get

1294
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,160
these things set up and

1295
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,440
when a story gets so heavily

1296
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:50,078
institutionalized

1297
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:52,559
that marijuana is a slippery slope

1298
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:56,000
to to madness it's one of the ways that

1299
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:58,079
cannabis hijacks your brain

1300
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,400
there are vested interests in just not

1301
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,240
being wrong you know certainly

1302
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,240
the prison industry and in person you

1303
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:05,439
know law enforcement doesn't want to be

1304
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:07,279
wrong with that

1305
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,800
clinicians that you know have come to

1306
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,519
think that that's how it works they

1307
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,720
don't want to

1308
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:14,239
believe that they've uh been wrong about

1309
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:17,439
it

1310
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:20,558
and and you know flash forward to

1311
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,720
you know the last 20 30 years the

1312
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,760
funding structure for research into

1313
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:27,118
cannabis

1314
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,680
has all been biased

1315
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,519
it's not anymore but for many years it

1316
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:32,639
was very perniciously biased towards

1317
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,039
you're not really going to study

1318
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:36,960
marijuana unless you're proposing to

1319
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:39,039
understand how it's bad for you there's

1320
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,358
a presupposition

1321
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:42,480
and in the world of brain sciences that

1322
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:44,880
was

1323
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,318
i'm going to conduct university-based

1324
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,559
research to show

1325
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:50,800
how cannabis leads to the use of other

1326
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:54,640
drugs or how you get addicted to it like

1327
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:58,079
you do other drugs or how it leads to

1328
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:59,519
insanity which was never really based on

1329
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,640
a scientific

1330
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:05,318
argument or scientific evidence

1331
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:06,719
but nonetheless it gets kind of

1332
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:09,599
institutionalized and

1333
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:11,759
and sheltered by a scientific paradigm

1334
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,559
it's it's like it's become this cultural

1335
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,680
prejudice

1336
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,079
like like like it was posited at this at

1337
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,598
one

1338
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,880
point and people jumped on it and

1339
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,800
started repeating it

1340
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,400
and so that beak suddenly became the

1341
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,240
status quo

1342
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,800
and then everybody kind of fell in

1343
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:30,959
behind that status quo

1344
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,240
because either a it was convenient and

1345
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,679
useful to them

1346
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:38,078
or b um there was not

1347
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:39,118
um good reason for somebody to stand

1348
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,920
against

1349
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,119
this this wave of belief in this

1350
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,599
cultural prejudice

1351
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,318
yeah you know i mean the history is just

1352
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,640
fascinating

1353
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:49,358
there's so many fascinating things about

1354
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:51,118
cannabis

1355
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:53,519
whether it's scientifically social

1356
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,920
cultural right i mean when

1357
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,318
i've mentioned how this you know this

1358
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,519
reefer madness mythology and this axe

1359
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:01,599
murderer

1360
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:03,280
and the testimony from the from the

1361
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,760
professor munch who said he turned into

1362
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,760
a bat

1363
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,119
all these things drove prohibition the

1364
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,040
one voice that was

1365
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,280
standing out against the marijuana tax

1366
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,639
act in 1937 was the american medical

1367
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,200
association

1368
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:16,799
saying wait that's characterizing this

1369
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:19,039
briefer

1370
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,160
in ways that you know cannabis is a

1371
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:22,639
medicine

1372
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:23,920
it's been an apothecaries you know we

1373
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:26,960
understand this it's got

1374
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:30,000
great potential but

1375
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,639
man there was i guess the convergence of

1376
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,199
world war

1377
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,440
ii and everything else going on and how

1378
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:37,519
successful anslinger was with literally

1379
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,318
going to these apothecaries and smashing

1380
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,039
it up

1381
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:41,838
destroying all of the bottles of

1382
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:45,440
cannabis were

1383
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:48,880
it was removed from the pharmacopoeia

1384
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,318
it changed our cultural memory and

1385
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,519
yeah then you get into the situation

1386
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:53,599
where there's a story that's been

1387
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,079
repeated it has a certain face value to

1388
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,920
it

1389
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,400
there are horror stories that you just

1390
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,639
don't want to be true

1391
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,599
it's associated with the counter culture

1392
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:06,558
or with racial minorities

1393
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,160
and but but for me coming into this you

1394
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,839
know i came to cannabis as a brain

1395
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,440
scientist and it wasn't because i wanted

1396
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:12,799
to study cannabis it was more because i

1397
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,200
wanted to study

1398
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,318
these intersections of the mind and the

1399
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:22,000
brain and when they go wrong

1400
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:23,838
but a lot has been said rightly so

1401
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,920
a lot will be said for many years to

1402
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:28,880
come about how

1403
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,639
the research bias has existed that's

1404
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,280
made it so hard to study

1405
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,039
cannabis as a medicine you know and

1406
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,680
there's many ways we can go into that

1407
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,239
but

1408
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:40,000
one of them is this you know the fact

1409
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:43,199
that cannabis

1410
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,920
research has been so

1411
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:46,480
monopolized so to speak by the drug

1412
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,599
abuse

1413
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:53,119
arm of the national institute of health

1414
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,400
the national institute on drug abuse

1415
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,318
and the whole paradigm that you're

1416
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,680
studying it as a problem and trying to

1417
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:00,960
understand how it can

1418
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:03,919
damage the brain one of the beautiful

1419
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,119
fun ironies is that research led to show

1420
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,119
that

1421
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,119
it protects the brain i mean the

1422
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,039
cannabis acts on an endocannabinoid

1423
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,599
system that is fundamentally part of our

1424
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:14,719
brain's

1425
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,440
neuroprotective system and so the

1426
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,000
fallacy

1427
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,039
in that level that cannabis damages the

1428
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,760
brain

1429
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,079
has just been completely debunked and

1430
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,200
and

1431
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:27,920
um and reversed but

1432
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:29,199
the fallacy that it leads to insanity

1433
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,119
still kind of lingers

1434
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:33,679
and big grant dollars are still reserved

1435
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,519
and or

1436
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:38,639
go to applying new tools to ask the same

1437
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:41,679
questions

1438
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,480
like really sophisticated brain imaging

1439
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:45,679
methods

1440
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:49,760
to say what's different in the fine

1441
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:52,799
granular you know tracts of the brain

1442
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,599
if someone's experienced it you know

1443
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,039
experimenting with cannabis and there

1444
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,880
have been papers

1445
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:01,119
that have been splashes i've had a whole

1446
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,880
talk on this

1447
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,640
over the years that there have been

1448
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,519
papers that really hit the media like

1449
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,318
whoa

1450
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:10,000
the verdict is out you smoke cannabis it

1451
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:11,519
changes your brain

1452
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
we know it because we can see it in

1453
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:17,199
these super powerful magnet scanners

1454
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,559
but most of those studies

1455
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:23,838
find these very small changes

1456
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:25,920
in structures of the brain

1457
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:27,199
without correlating it to any functional

1458
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,318
deficit

1459
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:31,598
so because of this institutionalized

1460
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:34,719
story

1461
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,640
the deficit can be inferred and even in

1462
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:40,480
a scientific paper you're writing an

1463
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:42,078
article in a way that will most

1464
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,599
you know be accepted by the funding

1465
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,839
structures and tell the story that

1466
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:48,640
you've been trying to tell

1467
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:50,639
and you are i mean and i don't like to

1468
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:53,199
discredit or or

1469
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:54,000
be harsh on scientists but i see these

1470
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:57,039
places where

1471
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,719
some difference

1472
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:59,920
in the brain structure a very small

1473
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:02,239
difference not something that a

1474
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,159
neurologist could point out on a

1475
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,000
on a looking at the brain scan you have

1476
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:07,279
to have computer algorithms say hey

1477
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,599
there's a slight difference in the

1478
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:13,200
volume of the left amygdala

1479
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:15,440
in someone who's been using cannabis and

1480
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:18,318
that difference is interpreted as damage

1481
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:21,920
or compensation for damage which gets

1482
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:25,199
really pretty ludicrous

1483
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,200
so greg i would like to change the

1484
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:28,719
i don't know maybe the vocabulary of

1485
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:31,838
where we go next for a moment

1486
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:33,358
because um one of the things that i so

1487
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:35,759
enjoy is that you know i

1488
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:37,119
you can teach things very very

1489
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,119
effectively in

1490
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,880
common folk language because you know

1491
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,358
you've been a professor and you've been

1492
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,920
teaching

1493
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:45,759
students and people for for a long time

1494
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,798
but then i also know you

1495
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:51,200
as a research scientist and

1496
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:52,318
have heard you get like super nerdy and

1497
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:54,879
you do both

1498
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:56,079
in this recent article for project cbd

1499
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,358
and so

1500
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:02,400
what i'd like to ask you to describe is

1501
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:06,000
this idea of reverse causality capital r

1502
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:09,280
capital c um in its uh

1503
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,079
scientific terms because up till now in

1504
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,760
this set

1505
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:16,960
we have um hit the nail pretty hard that

1506
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:20,319
that uh this idea of

1507
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:23,599
having too much thc

1508
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:27,119
giving this this dysphoric experience

1509
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:30,640
has similarities with with

1510
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:34,720
schizophrenia and how

1511
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:36,400
historical criminals um who had some

1512
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:38,239
connection to marijuana were then

1513
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,240
used as kind of like scapegoats or

1514
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:44,558
patsies for this

1515
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:47,838
um political uh racial

1516
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:51,760
position that people wanted to take but

1517
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:55,759
at the same time um there is a very

1518
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,680
specific logical premise that fails

1519
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,000
that that these these the studies that

1520
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:01,440
try to support these taboos of reaper

1521
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,880
madness they fail they

1522
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:08,880
the the the science itself fails

1523
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:11,519
to prove the point that cannabis

1524
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,480
will cause um schizophrenia and

1525
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,920
psychotic breaks in cannabis users

1526
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,000
and and and you don't have to go down

1527
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,720
this path too far but i

1528
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,400
for those folks who are really into the

1529
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:26,159
forensic nature

1530
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:29,280
of the science if you would describe

1531
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:32,558
reverse causality and why um

1532
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,119
the mad the reefer madness fails on this

1533
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,798
very

1534
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:38,640
important um uh standard of evidence

1535
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:40,159
um i think that i think that that would

1536
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:43,920
be tasty

1537
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:44,239
okay well you know it's not just that

1538
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,960
there

1539
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:50,318
are associations made in you know the

1540
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:54,159
popular press and the shock stories

1541
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:58,000
there have been correlations observed

1542
00:56:54,159 --> 00:57:00,798
in scientific studies between

1543
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,159
cohorts of people who are schizophrenic

1544
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:04,559
and

1545
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:06,558
cohorts of people who are not and

1546
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,440
finding that those who

1547
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:12,240
develop schizophrenia were slightly more

1548
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,318
likely to have used cannabis

1549
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:15,679
prior to that earlier in their life you

1550
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:17,599
know almost all of these are sort of

1551
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:18,480
these retrospective studies that are set

1552
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,798
up like that

1553
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,559
basically you find a clinical population

1554
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:25,920
the first one that had impact

1555
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,960
was a group of army soldiers in sweden

1556
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,798
now they

1557
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,240
found they took a group of them that had

1558
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:31,119
been diagnosed with schizophrenia and

1559
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,598
then

1560
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,280
the you set up you've tried to find an

1561
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:38,559
equally sized group that's

1562
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,720
similar um and and

1563
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,720
that don't have schizophrenia and you

1564
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:43,838
ask the question well was cannabis use

1565
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,078
different

1566
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:47,679
and these kind of situations have looked

1567
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,480
back and said well there is

1568
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:52,159
a correlation science is always a

1569
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,519
looking for correlation

1570
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:56,480
and it's often said that correlation

1571
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:59,599
does not prove

1572
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,400
causation and it gets a lot harder

1573
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:04,720
to to do that and yet we want to ask the

1574
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,358
question of does it cause it

1575
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:09,598
so there have been multiple studies and

1576
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:12,000
of course this gets very politicized and

1577
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,280
is why it's important for the cannabis

1578
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,960
culture and industry to not just dismiss

1579
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:22,160
this because there is

1580
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:26,079
a considerable body of science

1581
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:29,759
that says the use of

1582
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:34,079
or the the diagnosis of schizophrenia

1583
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:36,880
is correlated with a greater likelihood

1584
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,559
of having experimented or being a

1585
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,000
cannabis user

1586
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:43,280
all right it's more often like a heavy

1587
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,000
cannabis user so there's a correlation

1588
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,760
and there and that gets flipped around

1589
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,318
into saying that

1590
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,520
heavy cannabis use is therefore a risk

1591
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:55,039
factor

1592
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:58,159
for contracting schizophrenia

1593
00:58:55,039 --> 00:59:00,400
this starts to imply causation

1594
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:02,798
the cannabis use is a risk factor when

1595
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:06,079
really rigorously the statistics of it

1596
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:09,519
just mean that they are associated

1597
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:12,160
and several you know studies have

1598
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:13,838
have in more recent years you know when

1599
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:17,199
i think that that

1600
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:20,480
the bias and even the scientific

1601
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:24,239
you know bravery

1602
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:26,719
to challenge assumptions has arisen

1603
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:28,959
people have taken very close looks at

1604
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:30,959
this and tried to tease out

1605
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,000
where there could be family history

1606
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,119
involved

1607
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,280
or other compounds as we call it

1608
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:39,200
if you make a correlation but you know

1609
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,319
what it could be due to other factors

1610
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:43,439
like the weed smokers came from a

1611
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:45,440
different background a different

1612
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,079
socioeconomic background than the others

1613
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,559
and that maybe was leading to

1614
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:52,720
the problem in some studies

1615
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:55,440
socioeconomic background is a compound

1616
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:57,439
that's not well controlled

1617
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,519
family genetics is certainly one that

1618
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,318
has been hard to track down

1619
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:03,519
but just you know in the last 10 years

1620
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:06,159
or so

1621
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:08,798
it's become much more the abilities to

1622
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:11,118
sequence dna

1623
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:12,559
have led to so much insight into the

1624
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,079
human genome

1625
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,960
and you get these powerful like

1626
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:20,480
genome-wide association studies

1627
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:22,720
that are able to let's keep it

1628
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:25,119
a little simple and say you know just

1629
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:29,358
categorize people's genetic history

1630
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:32,559
more carefully and and qualify it

1631
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:33,679
and it at least two there are two

1632
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,440
particular studies

1633
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:39,039
um that really looked well at this

1634
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,798
many studies that said well there may be

1635
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,400
a confound you know and there are

1636
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:45,838
studies that show like

1637
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,720
identical twins um you know the cannabis

1638
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:48,480
use if there's

1639
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,959
identical twins that are discordant for

1640
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,719
cannabis use one uses and one doesn't

1641
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,240
um it doesn't really pan out that the

1642
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:56,078
cannabis user is more likely to get

1643
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:57,439
schizophrenia

1644
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,079
but there have been a couple of studies

1645
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,079
that have indicated that you know

1646
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:03,440
there's a that yeah we too see a

1647
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,559
correlation

1648
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:09,119
and that there is a risk associating

1649
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:10,160
heavy cannabis use with schizophrenia

1650
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:13,440
but that it seems

1651
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:15,519
to be connected to genetic markers

1652
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,280
meaning that there's a genetic

1653
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:21,039
similarity to people

1654
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:23,200
who are that is a more strong driver

1655
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:24,318
in these studies that wasn't necessarily

1656
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:26,159
obvious

1657
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:28,558
but that if you look at the genetic

1658
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:30,879
markers there's a stronger drive

1659
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,000
to the schizophrenic associate cannabis

1660
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,798
schizophrenia

1661
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,159
so again this does get delicate

1662
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:39,759
difficult to talk about

1663
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:43,199
but it's scientifically very um

1664
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:46,160
accepted and rigorous and what it points

1665
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:49,358
to is the idea that

1666
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:51,920
cannabis users i mean that is this

1667
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:55,519
there are people with latent sort of

1668
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:58,480
predisposition to schizophrenia

1669
01:01:55,519 --> 01:02:00,079
that may be more inclined to use

1670
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,199
cannabis heavily

1671
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:04,559
prior to being diagnosed i mean this

1672
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:07,279
isn't a new

1673
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:09,039
idea but it's fairly new research has

1674
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,400
been able to test it well

1675
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:15,839
using modern genomic methods

1676
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,599
and so i'm we've talked about negative

1677
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:21,679
and positive symptoms to begin

1678
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:25,119
the first set cannabis i mean

1679
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:27,838
schizophrenia very often

1680
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,720
is associated with what's called a

1681
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:32,000
prodrome

1682
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:33,038
or prodromal patient or prodromal

1683
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,440
schizophrenia

1684
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:40,559
meaning it's been long recognized that

1685
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:43,440
individuals can suffer from

1686
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:45,280
those negative symptoms of blunt affect

1687
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:49,838
and anedonia

1688
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:52,240
it gets identified in them prior to

1689
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:54,159
actually having a psychotic you know

1690
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:56,000
break from reality and

1691
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:58,318
becoming diagnosed with more manifest

1692
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,880
schizophrenia so

1693
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:02,798
we know that there are latent

1694
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,400
individuals that are lately predisposed

1695
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:05,280
to schizophrenia they start to

1696
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,798
experience

1697
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,680
the prodrome early and studies have

1698
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:13,358
shown that

1699
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:15,199
that um well

1700
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:16,400
i get a little confused about what i'm

1701
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,919
saying with what studies have and

1702
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,760
haven't shown

1703
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,400
those prodromal patients tend to have

1704
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,400
negative symptoms first

1705
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,160
a study that i cite out of australia in

1706
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,838
the in my article

1707
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:30,000
found it was not the only one that found

1708
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:32,078
that

1709
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,039
schizophrenic patients do self-medicate

1710
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:36,160
with cannabis

1711
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,680
and it's primarily to alleviate negative

1712
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:39,679
symptoms

1713
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:41,038
by self-report you know and i could give

1714
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:42,078
some of my conjecture about why that

1715
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,400
might be

1716
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,400
but the users themselves say yeah i'm

1717
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,720
smoking to medicate

1718
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,240
and it helps to alleviate these aspects

1719
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:54,000
of not feeling

1720
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:57,679
you know connected to my feelings um

1721
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:01,599
so the question of

1722
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:04,639
reverse causality is an important one

1723
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:06,798
and helps to explain the

1724
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:08,078
confounds between environment and

1725
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:11,358
genetics

1726
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,000
and this association the reason that

1727
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:14,159
triggered my

1728
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,920
article in my little essay in project

1729
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:17,440
cbd i've thought about these things for

1730
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,798
many years but i

1731
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,798
actually you know the other night when

1732
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:22,318
we're all anxiously thinking about

1733
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:24,159
counting ballots and the election

1734
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:25,279
returns and you can't get your mind off

1735
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:28,719
anything else

1736
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:32,000
and in the my inbox dropped this new

1737
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:33,519
table of contents from jama psychiatry

1738
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,719
the journal of the american medical

1739
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:38,079
association

1740
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:40,239
psychiatry publication

1741
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:41,760
and it had this brand new study that is

1742
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:43,679
a breakdown and by these authors

1743
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,839
gillespie and kendler

1744
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:46,879
two different i'm no affiliation or

1745
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:49,838
don't know them

1746
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,720
um but they wrote what i consider a

1747
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:53,759
really elegant

1748
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:54,000
review and and statistical re-analysis

1749
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,640
of

1750
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,838
studies looking at the question of

1751
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:01,279
causality

1752
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:03,599
and they you know they reviewed the

1753
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,599
literature they looked at these

1754
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,920
including studies that and you know

1755
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,960
concluded there was reverse causality

1756
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,760
but their paper

1757
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,559
again is brand new asked the question

1758
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,799
they said let's

1759
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,319
consider that there are three hypotheses

1760
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:17,759
hypothesis one

1761
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:19,199
which is the one that's been kind of

1762
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,240
traditionally ingrained is that

1763
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:22,879
schizophrenic

1764
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:23,519
cannabis is causal for schizophrenia

1765
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,119
it's like

1766
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:26,880
putting a match where there would not

1767
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:30,079
otherwise be a fire

1768
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,838
those are my words not theirs but that

1769
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:34,079
you know cannabis is a risk that will

1770
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:35,199
make someone turn schizophrenic who

1771
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,318
otherwise would not

1772
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:40,078
hypothesis two is that it's complicated

1773
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:42,159
by confounding factors and that

1774
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,640
someone's genetics may be predisposing

1775
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:44,639
them

1776
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:46,558
and cannabis use could kind of tip the

1777
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:49,679
scale

1778
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:51,599
and hypothesis three

1779
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:53,199
was that it's a completely reverse sort

1780
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,039
of thing that there's i mean that

1781
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,798
cannabis that that only if you're

1782
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,119
schizophrenic do you use cannabis and

1783
01:05:56,798 --> 01:05:59,759
there's

1784
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:01,440
you know it's there's no real connection

1785
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,119
um

1786
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,119
and and what they found in a nutshell i

1787
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,920
mean i direct people to the article in

1788
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:10,079
in my

1789
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:12,079
project cbd essay is that it the

1790
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,280
hypothesis one is completely out the

1791
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,440
window

1792
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,440
the studies that have shown reverse have

1793
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,798
found evidence for reverse causality

1794
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,200
which were published in very good

1795
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:23,838
journals very good science

1796
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:25,439
were are compelling and they did a fresh

1797
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:26,558
statistical breakdown that i won't try

1798
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,880
to explain

1799
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,000
about how the data point to the fact

1800
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,358
that

1801
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
the that studies showing increased use

1802
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:38,159
of schizo

1803
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:41,199
of cannabis leads to a greater risk of

1804
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:45,519
psychosis are

1805
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:49,038
greatly overstating the the relationship

1806
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:51,679
that the reverse causality

1807
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:53,119
may actually be the case for and for the

1808
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:53,519
kind of reasons that i've embellished

1809
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:56,640
here

1810
01:06:53,519 --> 01:07:00,000
that someone who

1811
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:02,558
is already likely to be come

1812
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,679
schizophrenic or at greater risk because

1813
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,200
of their genes

1814
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,759
because of how their brain is getting

1815
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:09,439
wired up throughout your teenage and 20s

1816
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,599
years

1817
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:14,400
schizophrenia is a risk for that person

1818
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:18,318
say with a family history and

1819
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:21,680
that person may be more likely to enjoy

1820
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:23,279
cannabis and getting into a habitual

1821
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:25,358
pattern with cannabis

1822
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,440
so there's a statistical association

1823
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:31,279
that is actually in the reverse

1824
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:32,798
being someone that is because of your

1825
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,319
the nature of your genetics and

1826
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:36,000
environment

1827
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:38,318
are going down a path towards a

1828
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,318
schizophrenia

1829
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:42,639
that that more likely pushes them or

1830
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:46,639
influences them to be ever so slightly

1831
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:46,639
more likely to be a cannabis user

1832
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,280
that would be so interesting i mean it

1833
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:54,559
is so interesting

1834
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:57,920
that simply because people

1835
01:07:54,559 --> 01:08:01,039
who may be experiencing early life

1836
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:04,720
mental challenges turn to

1837
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:08,079
cannabis for comfort

1838
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:09,038
could actually be misread as being the

1839
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:12,640
cause

1840
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:16,400
and then all of this hyperbole

1841
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:20,318
and reefer madness culture

1842
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:21,278
has come from that before we go into

1843
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:23,120
that

1844
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,799
let's go ahead and take our last break

1845
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:26,880
you'll be right back we'll

1846
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:28,640
all be right back you are listening to

1847
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:32,159
shaping fire and our guest this week is

sometimes the topics i want to share

1850
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,960
with you are far too brief for an entire

1851
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,880
shaping fire episode

1852
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,000
in those instances i post them to

1853

newsletter

1920
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,880
as a business owner you are incredibly

1921
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,239
busy in reality you are responsible for

1922
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,079
everything your company does

1923
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:51,759
you've got so many responsibilities

1924
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,600
every single day that often you just

1925
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:56,079
don't have the time to really dig into

1926
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,280
your marketing as deeply as you'd like

1927
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:58,880
you know there's more that you could do

1928
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,559
to reach out to new customers and

1929
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,279
encourage loyalty in the customers you

1930
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,880
already have

1931
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:04,238
but you certainly don't have the time

1932
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,640
for it and you're not ready to hire

1933
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:09,439
somebody full time for that role either

1934
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:11,520

you know most marketing firms are

1939
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,840
excited to make your logo

1940
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:21,839
packaging and website very pretty but

1941
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,800
they leave responsibility for improving

1942
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,840
your bottom line

1943
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,719
up to you they don't want that kind of

1944
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,360
responsibility but that's pretty much

1945
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,679
the most

1946
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:31,198

whether it be online or a storefront and

1951
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:39,279
keep them coming back to you and telling

1952
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,039
their friends

1962
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,440

1964
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:06,079
at moon time medicinals.com kirsten and

1965
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:07,039
her team put together a whole brand

1966
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:08,399
package for them

1967
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:10,800
built their website and wrote their

1968
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:12,319
sales materials no doubt this is a paid

1969
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,760
commercial spot but that does not mean

1970
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:15,679
they bought my opinion

1971
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,199
i've worked with blunt branding on five

1972
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,920
projects now for various of their

1973
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:19,599
clients and

1974
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,880
every single time they have done more

1975
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,320
than they have promised and over

1976
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,400
delivered on results

1977
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:26,319
i love how they generate new revenue and

1978
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:28,399
focus on that as the goal instead of

1979
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:30,238
just making a pretty logo

1980
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:31,920
similarly every single friend i have

1981
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:32,319
referred them to has come back to thank

1982
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,480
me

1983
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:36,158
and that just does not happen every day

1984
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:37,519
grab a pen and paper because the website

1985

i'm your host shango los and our guest

2003
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,400
this week is neuroscientist greg

2004
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:12,238
gerdeman

2005
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:13,759
so right before the break greg you were

2006
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:15,359
telling us about the gillespie and

2007
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:18,480
kendler study

2008
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:22,000
and um what it was showing the

2009
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:25,839
um the fact that folks

2010
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:29,039
who turned to cannabis for comfort

2011
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:33,360
because they were experiencing um some

2012
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:37,600
mental challenges then got conflated

2013
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:40,880
and were seen as it being the cause

2014
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:43,679
you're also you bring up in the your

2015
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:46,440
project cbd article

2016
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:49,039
how other data points kind of

2017
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:51,519
miraculously appear

2018
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:53,840
in the science that are not actually

2019
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:58,080
supported by science but they become

2020
01:13:53,840 --> 01:14:01,119
the default setting like this belief

2021
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:03,279
that cannabis causes madness as well and

2022
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:06,880
another one that you point out is

2023
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:08,800
the 10 thc threshold and that

2024
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,000
um and so now we're starting to see

2025
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,480
suggestions

2026
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,039
like we like we did you know two years

2027
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:14,718

2028
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:16,158
having a lot of states say yes we will

2029
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:19,119
have legal cannabis

2030
01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:20,879
but we'll be cbd only which of course

2031
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:23,760
that's just playing into fears and

2032
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,800
not at all based on science this idea

2033
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:28,400
that cannabis

2034
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:29,039
that would be sold in recreational

2035
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:32,639
stores

2036
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:34,479
should not be more than 10 it also has

2037
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:37,840
got a questionable

2038
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:39,678
um genesis tell us more about that

2039
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,960
well i'm not sure where it first

2040
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:44,079
appeared but

2041
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:48,319
there has been a real thrust

2042
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:51,840
that i saw in the state of florida

2043
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:55,439
to identify this 10 percent level as

2044
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:58,960
where thc becomes too high

2045
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:59,198
and again you know the cannabis culture

2046
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,439
and

2047
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:04,000
industry is very quick to dismiss this

2048
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:06,399
hey it's just more prohibitionist talk

2049
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,238
but people were pointing to a

2050
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:08,719
publication in a very prestigious

2051
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:12,639
journal

2052
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:15,520
lancet lancet psychiatry

2053
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,400
that said this is all based in science

2054
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,000
you know the the

2055
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:20,238
you got to follow the science that's a

2056
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,319
catchphrase and that's why we have to

2057
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:23,759
we do have to look at the science and be

2058
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:26,319
able to address it

2059
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,440
on its real terms and not just turn that

2060
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:29,840
over

2061
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:30,559
to those who are making a counter

2062
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,039
argument

2063
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,640
so the the notion is that you know

2064
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:36,560
there's been a long

2065
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:38,560
connection with with cannabis and

2066
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,560
schizophrenia right and we've all been

2067
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,960
hearing for years that today's cannabis

2068
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:45,199
isn't your daddy's weed is much stronger

2069
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,480
but in order to make something

2070
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:49,759
actionable

2071
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:53,759
there's a statement that 10 thc

2072
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:55,360
is too high where does that come from

2073
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,960
the fuel that people were pointing to

2074
01:15:55,359 --> 01:16:01,839
was this article in the lancet

2075
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,239
that had a great deal of prestige to it

2076
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:06,400
it

2077
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:07,599
was a multi-center study in numerous

2078
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:10,639
countries

2079
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:12,560
it put itself as a study across europe

2080
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,000
but it also included brazil

2081
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,920
and i think another latin american

2082
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,840
country

2083
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:22,719
and it was primarily led by a group

2084
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:25,199
in london that is one of the most

2085
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:27,520
productive groups that have

2086
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:28,719
published over the years again and again

2087
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:33,040
this notion that

2088
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:35,920
that you know strong cannabis the skunk

2089
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:37,279
leads to psychosis there really are only

2090
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:40,800
a handful of labs that have

2091
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:40,800
put the most of that out there

2092
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:46,839
this study um what it did

2093
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,079
break down how it was designed it

2094
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:52,000
basically

2095
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:54,479
recruited into the study um clinics

2096
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,479
from various different countries and

2097
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:56,879
this adds to the prestige of the article

2098
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:58,479
because

2099
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,679
there are lots of authors on it from

2100
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:01,519
different countries and they've got

2101
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,399
funding from their national institutes

2102
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,239
of

2103
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:06,319
of health or research and so you get

2104
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:07,198
this byline that's enormous that looks

2105
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:10,238
very

2106
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:11,678
impressive um and and

2107
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:13,439
and i can tell you you know in

2108
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:14,960
legislature committees a lot of times

2109
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:16,000
that's the most influential thing well

2110
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:19,119
this was published by

2111
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,000
all these important people

2112
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:23,198
but what they did is they recruited

2113
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,920
clinics

2114
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:26,960
and and clinicians within them so that

2115
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,000
when someone

2116
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:33,600
showed up with a first episode

2117
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,840
psychosis um that they would go

2118
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:38,239
follow this certain protocol to assess

2119
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:41,600
their cannabis use

2120
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:43,439
in the past and you know it

2121
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,280
and that's not schizophrenia right we've

2122
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:49,119
described psychosis is a break from

2123
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:49,119
reality and it can be triggered by

2124
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:52,559
it can be triggered by taking a

2125
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,000
substance

2126
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,600
it can be triggered by having an

2127
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,640
enormous amount of stress

2128
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,800
or trauma but

2129
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:02,640
in instances of instances of first

2130
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:06,640
episode psychosis there was an

2131
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:09,840
interview following where individuals

2132
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:12,400
were asked about their history

2133
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,360
with cannabis and they were allowed it

2134
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:15,119
was the study is

2135
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:18,559
designed so that people would use

2136
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:20,158
whatever their local expressions were

2137
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,600
you know there's no looking at labels

2138
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:23,439
there's no describing

2139
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,280
you know quantitatively what they had

2140
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:27,919
taken but they would say you know they

2141
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:30,158
smoked homegrown or they smoked hash

2142
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,679
or you know whatever you refer to these

2143
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:34,079
things in

2144
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:36,319
french or portuguese or what have you

2145
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:40,319
they would use their colloquial terms

2146
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:41,198
and then that that would be correlated

2147
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:44,158
with what

2148
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:44,719
the like national record was on what

2149
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:49,198
those

2150
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:51,039
substances are in terms of thc so

2151
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:52,639
now i this isn't even obvious in the

2152
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:54,000
main body of the paper

2153
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,480
when you're reading it they're just

2154
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,079
saying that individuals

2155
01:18:56,479 --> 01:18:59,759
were and there's a lot of complicated

2156
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:00,800
statistics but they were saying that

2157
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:04,159
people that had

2158
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:08,000
were users of potent cannabis

2159
01:19:04,158 --> 01:19:10,000
greater than 10 thc were

2160
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,600
more i mean that psycho people with

2161
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,039
psychosis were more likely

2162
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:17,760
to have used if they had used uh

2163
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:20,840
potent thc it was a greater risk factor

2164
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:24,000
sorry i was garbling that a little bit

2165
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:27,920
whereas low potency thc

2166
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:30,000
under 10 the correlation wasn't there

2167
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,359
and you know when i'm reading it and

2168
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,520
it's being waved around like well how

2169
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:35,599
did it get to this 10 percent so i'm

2170
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,880
you have to go to the supplemental

2171
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,600
materials online

2172
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,560
and then still you just see these tables

2173
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,360
where it's

2174
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,920
you know determined that like hashish in

2175
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:46,079
spain

2176
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,960
is greater than 10 percent hashish in

2177
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:50,319
brazil or

2178
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:53,039
or in england is less than 10 percent

2179
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:55,279
homegrown self-reported homegrown in

2180
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:58,319
england is higher than 10 percent

2181
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:59,359
but imported is less than 10 percent if

2182
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:01,759
they call it skunk

2183
01:19:59,359 --> 01:20:02,960
it's above 10 and and all of these

2184
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,159
different things

2185
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:08,639
which that was buried in the references

2186
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:10,399
and where they got to that was buried in

2187
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:11,199
the references of the supplementary

2188
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:13,119
material

2189
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:15,198
and it were like it was like these

2190
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:16,960
government white papers like reports on

2191
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:19,519
health in europe

2192
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:21,439
and you know that's how i had to dig and

2193
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,040
realize that they're basically taking

2194
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:27,119
police records

2195
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:30,399
that say hey hash from spain

2196
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:31,760
was like this moroccan stuff that was 12

2197
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:35,279
percent

2198
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:38,159
and those kinds that kind of chain of

2199
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:41,039
custody if you will was used to define

2200
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:42,158
an arbitrary border where where they

2201
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:44,399
said and you know

2202
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:46,000
scientifically you shouldn't you should

2203
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:48,238
make your hypothesis in advance

2204
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,920
but it certainly leads one to suspect

2205
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:51,919
that they chose a border

2206
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,600
of high low where the statistics might

2207
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,440
work out

2208
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,120
maybe 10 was just what they were looking

2209
01:20:55,439 --> 01:21:01,198
for but i don't know

2210
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:04,158
at any rate it was arbitrary and

2211
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:05,678
it's just that gets claimed as being

2212
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:09,679
scientifically based

2213
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:13,199
when anybody who knows about the

2214
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:17,119
process of testing cannabis for potency

2215
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:19,759
in terms of thc percentage knows that

2216
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:21,198
it's tricky and how you prepare the

2217
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,159
sample and the

2218
01:21:21,198 --> 01:21:26,399
kinds of machines you run it on and

2219
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:29,279
there's lots of different variability

2220
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:30,559
in in substances and first of all the

2221
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:34,079
notion that a

2222
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:37,440
you know a sample of recording

2223
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:38,158
you know that of confiscated imported

2224
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:40,879
cannabis

2225
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:43,279
in england is necessarily representative

2226
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:46,719
of what somebody was smoking

2227
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:48,319
is i think quite a stretch

2228
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:50,319
but it was really beheralded actually

2229
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:52,799
there was an editorial that accompanied

2230
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:55,119
it in the lancet

2231
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,239
that was saying well this is an

2232
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:58,479
innovative approach

2233
01:21:56,238 --> 01:22:00,238
that's like combining like a material

2234
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:03,359
history to show that

2235
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:07,198
it's the strong stuff that really

2236
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:08,799
uh reveals a a time bomb for

2237
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:12,079
schizophrenia

2238
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:16,159
and what kills me is that

2239
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:19,920
that strength or lack of strength

2240
01:22:16,158 --> 01:22:21,839
and that correlation was used in this

2241
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:26,480
scientific article

2242
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:29,840
to justify all kinds of hand waving

2243
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:32,399
i've never read an article before that

2244
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:34,079
in so many places says if this you know

2245
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:37,839
hypothesis of causality

2246
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:39,920
is true then they conducted a whole new

2247
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:41,199
set of thought experiments saying like

2248
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,840
hey if this

2249
01:22:41,198 --> 01:22:45,198
relationship we've put out here is true

2250
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:48,560
then

2251
01:22:45,198 --> 01:22:50,638
like x percent of all of the psychosis

2252
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,480
in the netherlands is due to high

2253
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:55,199
potency cannabis

2254
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:56,079
30 half of all the schizophrenia in the

2255
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:59,119
city of london

2256
01:22:56,079 --> 01:23:01,279
is due to smoking high potency

2257
01:22:59,119 --> 01:23:03,198
i don't know how they said half yeah it

2258
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:05,439
was a tremendous jump

2259
01:23:03,198 --> 01:23:06,960
and over and over again it had i'm sure

2260
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:09,039
a reviewer made them

2261
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,399
repeat over and over again if this

2262
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:12,158
causality is true

2263
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:14,479
because they had not established that

2264
01:23:12,158 --> 01:23:17,198
causality it was no better in that

2265
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:19,519
regard than any of these other papers

2266
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:20,319
that i've you know made you know

2267
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,159
reference to

2268
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:23,599
in this course of our conversation the

2269
01:23:22,158 --> 01:23:26,879
causality

2270
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:28,000
could just be every bit of reverse

2271
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:33,039
causality

2272
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:35,840
it could entirely be a reverse causality

2273
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:38,000
where again someone reporting with a

2274
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,920
first episode psychosis

2275
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,600
and they did control they at least they

2276
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,800
attempted to control that it wasn't that

2277
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,400
they were acutely

2278
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,360
you know stoned out of their mind and

2279
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:50,238
that was the cause of the experience

2280
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:52,799
now you have to take on faith if that

2281
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:56,158
was true maybe it was or not but

2282
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,199
at any rate someone experienced a

2283
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:01,039
psychotic

2284
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:03,198
you know reaction could have been

2285
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:05,039
that that propensity could have been

2286
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:08,719
driving them to be using

2287
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:11,840
cannabis the 10 threshold at any rate is

2288
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:14,960
is arbitrary it's based on

2289
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:17,600
um a flimsy record sometimes years and

2290
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:20,880
years old the the measures that

2291
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:22,239
of how potent brazilian hashish would be

2292
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,560
the way i was digging through the

2293
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:27,039
reference it seemed to be from like 2004

2294
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,560
to 2006

2295
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:30,238
but even if it's more recent what if

2296
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:32,080
it's 2015

2297
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:34,959
who's to say how that cannabis was

2298
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:37,039
stored how it was ground up i mean

2299
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,198
as we know and i reference in the

2300
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:41,840
article you know it's been quite a

2301
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:43,759
issue in the u.s labs that are dedicated

2302
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:45,920
to the cannabinoid detection

2303
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,440
you send same sample to different labs

2304
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,319
and they can get different methods if

2305
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:50,799
they're

2306
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:52,719
not following the same methods of

2307
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,760
calibrating it and validating their

2308
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:56,319
methods and

2309
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:59,039
i'm sorry but national law enforcement

2310
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:01,279
from a scattering of you know

2311
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:02,319
half a dozen or i mean more than that 10

2312
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:04,079
different countries

2313
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:05,679
to think that they're using the same

2314
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:07,640
methods and that

2315
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:08,800
you're comparing apples to apples

2316
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:11,039
[Music]

2317
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,079
is is kind of ridiculous even like

2318
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:15,600
comparing flour

2319
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:17,039
to a you know dense packed rosin

2320
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,199
you know the preparation methods are

2321
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:22,319
different when you tell me that

2322
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:24,079
that the that the data sets that the

2323
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:27,439
studies were based on

2324
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:30,559
were using uh product categories

2325
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:32,559
like skunk or homegrown

2326
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,080
um there's so much very i mean first of

2327
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,760
all skunk really isn't

2328
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:38,000
a category right and and so it's a

2329
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:41,760
misunderstanding

2330
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:44,639
of the of the the community as a whole

2331
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:46,239
but then even even if we just had to

2332
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:49,279
have a category of homegrown

2333
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:49,919
well you know how it's grown indoor

2334
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:52,158
outdoor

2335
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,920
the the genetics the talent of the

2336
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:55,359
grower all of these things add so many

2337
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:58,480
variabilities

2338
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:58,880
to tell me that the underlying data is

2339
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:02,479
just

2340
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:05,600
garbage and then the rest of

2341
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:09,198
the study is built on this

2342
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:12,560
garbage data and then made to look

2343
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:16,000
good for whatever motivation and

2344
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:19,199
and that is the part that really

2345
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,880
red flags for me like like how why why

2346
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:23,599
is it worthwhile to even put out the

2347
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:26,960
rest of the study when it's based on

2348
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:28,880
on the sand yeah yeah but it has been

2349
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,679
sensationalized and it was right from

2350
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,600
the beginning

2351
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:33,520
even finding quotes in the media from

2352
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,480
the authors and even in the study itself

2353
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,719
saying

2354
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:38,399
you know that this was they went through

2355
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:41,359
this analysis of

2356
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:42,158
guesstimating how much what proportion

2357
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:44,238
of

2358
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:46,079
you know psychosis in these different

2359
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:48,839
areas was due to cannabis

2360
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:50,000
i mean for the sake of influencing

2361
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,719
policy

2362
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,920
out of a fear that potent cannabis

2363
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:55,119
products shouldn't be there and then

2364
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:59,119
that that jumps to

2365
01:26:55,119 --> 01:27:00,319
another you know important fallacy which

2366
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:02,880
is this

2367
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:05,359
obsession over percent composition and

2368
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:07,199
thc i mean

2369
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:08,799
if you're so scared about the percent

2370
01:27:07,198 --> 01:27:12,399
composition

2371
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:15,360
i mean dronabinol is a pill that's been

2372
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:16,238
fda approved medicine since they're what

2373
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:18,399
early 80s

2374
01:27:16,238 --> 01:27:19,359
and i mean if you're going to go down to

2375
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,439
percents

2376
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:25,679
well inside that capsule it's better

2377
01:27:21,439 --> 01:27:28,799
than what 98 percent thc

2378
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:32,239
and popping a bunch of those pills can

2379
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:35,520
lead to a pretty profound you know

2380
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:38,079
uh reaction but

2381
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,960
to say that you put this arbitrary limit

2382
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:42,238
on flour

2383
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:45,439
it's just it's not it's

2384
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:46,079
it's not it's certainly not rooted in

2385
01:27:45,439 --> 01:27:47,759
this claim

2386
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:49,679
that we got to follow the science and

2387
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:53,039
science has shown

2388
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:54,319
you know over 10 percent thc to be a

2389
01:27:53,039 --> 01:27:57,439
ticking time bomb

2390
01:27:54,319 --> 01:28:00,399
that's it's ridiculous it hasn't

2391
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:01,519
shown the causality any better than the

2392
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:04,319
rest

2393
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:05,440
and you know i would be remiss not to

2394
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:08,799
say that

2395
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:12,319
this whole body of research you know

2396
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:15,360
is still it's still consistent with

2397
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:16,000
the thinking that if someone does have a

2398
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:17,439
genetic

2399
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,600
or latent predisposition of

2400
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:23,359
schizophrenia

2401
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:26,480
even if using cannabis is something that

2402
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:29,759
they feel improves their quality of life

2403
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:31,919
it could be a risk factor for

2404
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:33,199
progressing their disease or speeding

2405
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,319
the onset

2406
01:28:33,198 --> 01:28:38,399
of frank's schizophrenia

2407
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:40,000
that may be and this is my own you know

2408
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:41,519
thinking on it that may be simply

2409
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,198
because

2410
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,760
if you get into a habit of cannabis

2411
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:48,319
you're you're more likely to eventually

2412
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:51,760
have one of those moments of

2413
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:55,158
taking a a lot or maybe that using it

2414
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:57,280
regularly high thc cannabis

2415
01:28:55,158 --> 01:29:00,000
desensitizes down regulates your

2416
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:03,840
endocannabinoid system your receptors

2417
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:06,880
and that that at a moment of

2418
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:11,039
developmental vulnerability

2419
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:13,920
sort of takes away the the buffering

2420
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:15,279
capacity that the endocannabinoid system

2421
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,560
is meant to serve

2422
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:20,079
um you know so the these are very i take

2423
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:23,520
these issues

2424
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:26,000
seriously that someone who has

2425
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,120
a family history of mental illness

2426
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,920
especially

2427
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:30,319
psychotic illness schizophrenia um

2428
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:34,079
should

2429
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:37,119
be very cautious around itac cannabis

2430
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:38,880
um and and i think that there is really

2431
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:40,399
credible and interesting research out

2432
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:42,880
there that

2433
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:44,238
having balance of cbd you know whether

2434
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:46,719
it's a type 2

2435
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:49,039
cannabis flower with balanced ratios or

2436
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:52,239
formulated products

2437
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:55,519
it may be that

2438
01:29:52,238 --> 01:29:58,638
that would be less of a risk factor

2439
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:00,800
in if there is truth that

2440
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,639
you know someone with a disposition of

2441
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:06,079
schizophrenia

2442
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:08,159
may hasten the onset by

2443
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:09,920
by using cannabis it may be less so with

2444
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:12,000
what are more modern

2445
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,199
well-controlled medicinal preparations

2446
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,319
and and

2447
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:18,638
trying to include cbd um

2448
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:20,000
you know this is a nuanced conversation

2449
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:23,920
right it's an important one

2450
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:27,279
and we value uh people's lives

2451
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:31,520
and don't want to steer them wrong but

2452
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:34,479
the the blunt hatchet of a law

2453
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:36,159
that says you know haha you've thought

2454
01:30:34,479 --> 01:30:37,839
you've legalized this but

2455
01:30:36,158 --> 01:30:39,359
we're instead going to make it only

2456
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:43,920
legal to

2457
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:46,319
use less potent thc i mean

2458
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,800
the vast majority of the population is

2459
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:52,238
never going to experience

2460
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:55,279
psychosis or schizophrenia and

2461
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:57,359
there are large swaths of people among

2462
01:30:55,279 --> 01:30:58,880
the medical cannabis community patients

2463
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:02,719
who benefit

2464
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:05,760
from higher doses of thc and

2465
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:08,960
those who are using

2466
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:11,520
cannabis and you know adult use

2467
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:12,480
responsible way i mean may enjoy i mean

2468
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:16,159
hell

2469
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:18,079
an iron an irony here is that you know

2470
01:31:16,158 --> 01:31:20,000
sort of the some of the legislation

2471
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:21,600
that's been proposed only focuses on

2472
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,840
flour at all and not

2473
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:25,199
you know a vape pen that can have eighty

2474
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:28,560
percent plus

2475
01:31:25,198 --> 01:31:29,279
thc um but that's sort of the next step

2476
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,520
if they're gonna

2477
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:32,399
if somebody's gonna ban flour on the

2478
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,880
base of 10

2479
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:36,559
thc why wouldn't they go to concentrate

2480
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,440
yeah it feels like a setup for dabbing

2481
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,840
for sure

2482
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:41,359
yeah at any rate you know if they're

2483
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,920
going to use the mantra let's follow the

2484
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:44,960
science

2485
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:48,639
yeah let's do the tide has changed

2486
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:50,800
on our canopy our perceptions of

2487
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:54,079
cannabis you know the pendulum is

2488
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:56,639
swinging back in a way that is

2489
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:58,960
exciting i mean cannabis has been

2490
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:00,880
discovered and celebrated and forgotten

2491
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,079
and demonized over and over again

2492
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,880
throughout cultures

2493
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:06,399
but one thing we can say is that it has

2494
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,359
spread around the globe more than it

2495
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:10,719
ever has

2496
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:13,198
um and our understanding of cannabis and

2497
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:15,600
how it works in our body is far more

2498
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:16,960
developed and sophisticated and

2499
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,199
scientific than it

2500
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:21,279
ever has just by the evolution of

2501
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:23,839
science

2502
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:24,800
and you know we just we know better than

2503
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,319
to

2504
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:31,679
rely on these fear-based

2505
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:35,119
simplistic models and

2506
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:37,520
i just celebrate studies by

2507
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:38,559
you know straight laced white coat

2508
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:41,840
physicians

2509
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:44,320
who look incredibly at the at the

2510
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:46,639
question and saying you know what this

2511
01:32:44,319 --> 01:32:49,679
sort of direct cause and effect

2512
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:51,520
that smoking heavy cannabis

2513
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:53,039
is going to enhance the risk of

2514
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:55,520
schizophrenia

2515
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:56,639
is is not well founded the reverse

2516
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,679
causality

2517
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:01,600
hypothesis is very well grounded

2518
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:03,600
the whole body of literature needs to be

2519
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:05,840
viewed through that lens

2520
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:08,000
and it and it changes the story to one

2521
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:11,360
that's more sober you know it's more

2522
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:14,079
it's less it's less

2523
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:15,359
demanding of cannabis being this

2524
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:19,039
boogeyman

2525
01:33:15,359 --> 01:33:22,719
that is a slippery slope to

2526
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:25,359
you know wrecking our youth

2527
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:27,600
so that's kind of where all of that

2528
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:30,719
boils down to and we can't just dismiss

2529
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:31,199
whether it's you know a new flash in the

2530
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:32,960
pan

2531
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:34,479
brain imaging study that says hey you

2532
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:36,239
smoke weed your brain looks a little

2533
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:38,238
different

2534
01:33:36,238 --> 01:33:39,519
or this kind of study that says look

2535
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:40,959
we've we've studied

2536
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,679
large numbers of people in many

2537
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:47,439
countries and we know that

2538
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:50,239
people smoking potent cannabis

2539
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:51,579
are at risk of you know a life of

2540
01:33:50,238 --> 01:33:53,119
madness

2541
01:33:51,579 --> 01:33:57,359
[Music]

2542
01:33:53,119 --> 01:34:01,039
you have to look at it from the mindset

2543
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:03,359
of really critiquing the science

2544
01:34:01,039 --> 01:34:05,119
to to understand what's there and what's

2545
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:07,359
been oversold

2546
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:08,639
greg that's great and i really

2547
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:10,479
appreciate you

2548
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:12,400
you know taking this measured approach

2549
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:13,279
this topic with me because you know as

2550
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:16,319
we talked about

2551
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:20,319
before we recorded um you know

2552
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:23,599
to to gently detangle

2553
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:26,559
a topic that's this complex

2554
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:28,320
um you know this is not usual podcast

2555
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,960
fair for most shows

2556
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:32,319
and we had to walk a lot of lines but um

2557
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,639
that's one of the reasons that i like

2558
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:34,559
you

2559
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:36,159
is that you're always willing to walk

2560
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:38,080
that line and

2561
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:39,759
um and you and you give it to us

2562
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:42,880
straight so

2563
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:45,679
um yeah well and i and i hope you know

2564
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:48,960
my motivation for this show was you know

2565
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:50,719
most of us you know you and i and the

2566
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,480
listeners of this show

2567
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:54,000
unless they're joining us for the first

2568
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:57,439
time probably

2569
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:00,639
believed all of this to be true and

2570
01:34:57,439 --> 01:35:02,158
they believed this very easily because

2571
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:04,159
they knew the fix was in against

2572
01:35:02,158 --> 01:35:05,359
cannabis to begin with and we've all

2573
01:35:04,158 --> 01:35:07,519
been smoking it

2574
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:08,559
and it's been doing good things for our

2575
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:11,600
lives

2576
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:14,239
but a show like this

2577
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:16,159
i think arms us better for conversations

2578
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:19,039
with our families and with our

2579
01:35:16,158 --> 01:35:20,079
kids school systems and and with other

2580
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:24,800
stoners right

2581
01:35:20,079 --> 01:35:28,719
who who are are jumping on the bandwagon

2582
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:32,400
um misguidedly or are themselves

2583
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:35,439
uh repeating falsehoods about science

2584
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:38,559
in support of cannabis just like people

2585
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:41,678
quote falsehoods against cannabis so

2586
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:42,960
uh so yeah man i i appreciate you and uh

2587
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:46,399
thank you for joining us

2588

it's my pleasure thanks a lot i am

2592
01:35:52,399 --> 01:35:59,198
i do a lot more educating now on more

2593
01:35:56,238 --> 01:35:59,599
straightforward and bite-sized subjects

2594
01:35:59,198 --> 01:36:02,960
but

2595
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:05,119
these deep dives are sometimes um

2596
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,319
are sometimes really important and and

2597
01:36:05,118 --> 01:36:09,279
we can't just be

2598
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:10,799
reflexive and say ah everything these

2599
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:13,279
guys say is garbage

2600
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,960

legislature committees i mean um

2605
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,039
it's important to to address science on

2606
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:28,238
