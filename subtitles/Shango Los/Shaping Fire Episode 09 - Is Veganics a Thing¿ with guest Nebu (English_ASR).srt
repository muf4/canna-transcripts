2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:11,879
this episode on began accessible ass dan

3
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:14,009
uary I was in Southern California to

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,199
speak at the green flower media cannabis

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,910
entrepreneur summit after the first day

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,640
of the event there was this incredible

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,250
VIP party at the home of Erin and Erica

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,800
justice Erin and Erica are the owners of

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,109
bud and roses cannabis dispensary in Los

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,990
Angeles the party in a gated community

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,880
was packed with like seriously major

12
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,710
players in the legal cannabis industry

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,800
all across the country there was this

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,870
amazing spread of food and the view of

15
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,819
the mountains off their land I was just

16
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:43,829
incredible the reason I mentioned this

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,829
party is because they had this cannabis

18
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,259
bar there with an array of flowers grown

19
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,090
and sold by the bud and roses dispensary

20
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:52,769
you know you could do dabs or the

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,449
bartender would pack you a ball or roll

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,250
you a joint or whatever it was all you

23
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:58,108
know very pleasant the thing though is

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,320
that each of the jars were filled with

25
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,359
incredible specimens of each strain for

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,400
example like the Strawberry Cough I had

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,978
was like the best Strawberry Cough I had

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,439
ever tasted similarly the black line was

29
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:13,289
the best lime I had ever tasted and as I

30
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:16,079
went down the line of jars the various

31
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,570
flowers had exceptional terpene profiles

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,759
and the ones I went ahead and toked had

33
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:22,829
a flavor that came right through the

34
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,290
smoke even though I was combusting and

35
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:28,200
not vaping that's when I had my first

36
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,850
began eclis grown cannabis you know I

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,890
knew of some folks that had experimented

38
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,569
on and off with Ferg annex and I had

39
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,549
heard folks talk about how clean the

40
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:37,139
tastes were but I was really really

41
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,150
impressed and caught off guard

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:44,460
so I decided that I looked you know I

43
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:47,368
needed to do a show about began excited

44
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:50,699
be interested too so off I went to find

45
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:52,680
a guest for the show on began accession

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,109
is at the top of that list because he

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,299
puts out his line of bottled for Ganic

48
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,968
inputs but I really wanted to do a show

49
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,950
more from a do-it-yourself probiotic

50
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:03,688
direction and if Kyle was on the show

51
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,900
there'd be so many other cool things to

52
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:08,149
talk about that we might not even ever

53
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,159
gigantic growing so so I searched the

54
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,169
internet for a while and never really

55
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,229
found the right person to interview no

56
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:17,479
everyone used to grow veganic but now

57
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:19,310
they include worm castings at least and

58
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:21,979
and some much more like even fish guts

59
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,800
so eventually I went to my favorite

60
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:27,169
place to learn about pro by out growing

61
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,900
and I I posted four guest suggestions on

62
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:32,179
the probiotic farmers Alliance group on

63
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,819
Facebook most everyone's comment was

64
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,860
that veganic swooz not a thing and that

65
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:40,219
some animal inputs were absolutely a

66
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,830
necessity but then Alain Adkison of grow

67
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:44,680
Kashi posted that was theirs as one guy

68
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,959
to talk to who was an old-school

69
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,750
probiotic grower breeder and High Times

70
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:54,199
writer and his name was Naboo that's n

71
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,270
EBU so it took me a few weeks to find

72
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,369
Naboo in the underground but I did find

73
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,860
him growing and working in Oregon and

74
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,020
he's my guest today on shaping fire I'm

75
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,880
your host Sheng golos and today we're

76
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,230
gonna talk about began and growing and

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,049
whether or not it's still a thing

78
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:10,429
welcome to the show Nebu thanks for

79
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,810
having me Shango I'm so glad that you

80
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,110
could make some time to be on the show

81
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:17,509
so you know we know that organic growing

82
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,300
or natural growing is how it always was

83
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:22,759
before synthetic fertilizers came about

84
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,620
and then you know the time of better

85
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:26,959
living through chemistry happened and

86
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,509
you know organic natural growing got

87
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,060
usurped by synthetics and chemicals and

88
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:34,189
petroleum inputs but nowadays we're

89
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,650
starting to come back around a probiotic

90
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:39,169
growing and living soil and nutrient

91
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,060
teas what was the reigning headspace

92
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:43,699
when you first started writing for High

93
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,949
Times I think that's a pretty accurate

94
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,780
observation I you know I've seen some

95
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:49,879
memes where they show black and white

96
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,840
pictures and they say everything was

97
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,909
grown organic

98
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,830
back in the day and and that's true and

99
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:59,659
then I think the reigning kind of space

100
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,549
when I first started with High Times was

101
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:05,509
a lot of synthetics you know salt based

102
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:08,780
fertilizers be it you know hydro hydro

103
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:10,459
was huge and you could do organic in

104
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,840
hydro but that wasn't it's not very

105
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:15,500
convenient it's a little bit difficult

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,540
not challenging so the synthetics were

107
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,548
were kind of it I mean they were the big

108
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,129
thing so it's kind of like

109
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:23,779
bypassing all the symbiotic relationship

110
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:26,780
that happens with the with the

111
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:29,119
microbiome and just giving them you know

112
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:31,219
straight injections of nutrients that

113
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,949
are already broken down and can you know

114
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,360
penetrate the rhizosphere

115
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:36,710
yeah I can I met I can imagine that

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,658
breaking everything down in its

117
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,489
individuality I mean you get the you get

118
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:43,069
the basic components but you don't you

119
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,228
don't get the song it's kind of like

120
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:47,689
force-feeding yeah and it's not it's not

121
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:50,598
the symbiotic relationship that happens

122
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:52,699
naturally so you know there you can

123
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:54,199
overfeed really easily you can burn and

124
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,419
you know you're missing something here

125
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,129
and there and ultimately it reflects in

126
00:04:56,418 --> 00:05:00,079
the quality and that's why you see it at

127
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:02,270
farmers markets or wherever you go the

128
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,878
grocery store there's a big push for

129
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:07,310
organics not only because of the ethical

130
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,718
considerations and how it impacts the

131
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,000
environment but they're really the

132
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:13,759
quality of the product is superior it's

133
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,029
just you you can't really argue against

134
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,030
all the years of evolution you know so I

135
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:22,429
think I think the quality is is really

136
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:24,829
key specifically on the quality I mean

137
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,408
I'm a big fan of probiotic flour but

138
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:30,379
what would you say are the are the data

139
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:33,468
points of quality that that sets

140
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:34,668
probiotic flowers apart well and that's

141
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:36,139
gonna be a difficult thing because I

142
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,120
don't think it'll reflect in a lot of

143
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:40,158
the tests and and there's gonna have to

144
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,468
be a big paradigm shift because people

145
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:44,418
are looking like a t HC % and they're

146
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:46,250
thinking about it as alcohol percent oh

147
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:49,399
my god this flower has 30 percent THC

148
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,649
I'm gonna get completely blotto and what

149
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:55,250
what they're not looking at is terpenes

150
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:57,439
and all the entourage endocannabinoids

151
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,718
that are there and it's it's it's

152
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,418
another symbiotic relationship that they

153
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:04,939
all work together and you can't test for

154
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:06,918
sativa versus indica there's no test

155
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:09,740
that really tells you the effect that

156
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:11,778
that's gonna have so what I've found is

157
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,509
and what I've always bred for and grown

158
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:17,389
for is really the flavor and the profile

159
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:19,340
of course but the because I've always

160
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:21,050
been against the cat a couch lock I mean

161
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:24,619
there's a time and place for it for

162
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:27,528
indicas you know if you want that if you

163
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,939
want that really synthetic sedative type

164
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:30,860
of effect there's definitely place for

165
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:33,139
it but you know during the daytime I

166
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,718
like to have sativas and those

167
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:39,499
are more difficult to grow they also

168
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:40,908
yield less and whatnot but the the I

169
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:43,669
guess I'm getting kind of far afield

170
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:45,498
here but just to bring it back the what

171
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:48,079
I've noticed is just the I guess the

172
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:49,219
flavor yeah I would say in a nutshell if

173
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,318
you had to boil it down to one thing

174
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:54,860
it's just it's just the flavor the taste

175
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,379
and the overall profile mm-hmm you know

176
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:00,020
you mentioned the the negative inflected

177
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:03,020
term salts for bottled nutrients already

178
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:05,538
and you know in in researching veganic

179
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:06,978
for this show you know a lot of people

180
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:08,718
were talking you know the kind of people

181
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:10,490
who are into vogue anacs and and

182
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:13,819
probiotics they talk a lot of trash

183
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,310
about bottled nutrients you know would

184
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:18,110
you talk a little bit to why bottled

185
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,240
nutrients are something that people are

186
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,340
turning away from I mean we've talked

187
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,740
about it being the individuated parts

188
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,049
but but why may not that be as

189
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,528
successful as building probiotic

190
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,598
communities in the soil again it's it's

191
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:35,269
it's just boils down to a simple concept

192
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:37,579
it's it's life probiotic that that means

193
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:39,758
life that's a if you follow the Latin

194
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:42,560
roots that's it that's what it means so

195
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,259
that's what it's all about when you want

196
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,199
to grow in a natural environment is

197
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:50,870
having having those um you know having

198
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,569
that symbiosis having those bacteria and

199
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,668
all the beneficial microorganisms that

200
00:07:53,569 --> 00:08:01,430
help break down and work there the micro

201
00:07:55,668 --> 00:08:04,008
is a fungal bacteria that grow the that

202
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,050
grow roots or even grow mushrooms they

203
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,460
all work together in a symbiotic fashion

204
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,278
and you can't really get that in a

205
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:12,528
bottle that's it's deprived of oxygen

206
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:14,240
and it will die I mean you can bottle it

207
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:16,250
and it will last for a little while but

208
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,158
you know shelf life is very very short

209
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:21,860
on those these these bacteria are sort

210
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:23,449
of sensitive they need that environment

211
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,949
that nurtures them so that's something

212
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,348
that you can't really get from a bottle

213
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:29,000
you can get a lot of food that you can

214
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:31,519
feed the bacteria from a bottle so you

215
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,190
can get your guano's and everything else

216
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,889
from a bottle and and feed that to them

217
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,839
but you can't really get the life from

218
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:40,788
the bottle I remember when I was first

219
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,979
starting to to learn about growing in

220
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:44,299
the early 90s all anybody wanted to talk

221
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,399
to me about was NPK

222
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:48,289
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and

223
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,789
they're like if you got those three pump

224
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:52,250
that you know plant full of them you're

225
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:54,740
good to go and and now as I've matured

226
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,240
into my understanding of cannabis I've

227
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,278
realized that there's this whole

228
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,470
community of inputs that need to be

229
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:04,730
there and and how they make each other

230
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,410
more bio accessible to the plant that is

231
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,570
that is completely true and you can and

232
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:10,789
you can grow decently with those and

233
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,050
people have produced you know decent

234
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:14,000
plants with that and then they talk

235
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:15,769
about flushing which is something you

236
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,509
know that's trying to get the salt the

237
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:19,759
salt fertilizers out of the plant before

238
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:21,169
you before you harvest and that's just

239
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,000
not a necessary step when you're growing

240
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:25,099
organic you what are you gonna flush you

241
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,708
don't need to flush anything so all that

242
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,180
has has come from that NPK that

243
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:34,250
chemicals salt based fertilizer centric

244
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:35,208
paradigm and it's yeah it's really just

245
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,730
not necessary

246
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:39,739
and and you can see it like if somebody

247
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,269
doesn't flush and you're burning I've a

248
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,399
per eyes so you can't tell us well but

249
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:46,129
if you're burning a flower I actually

250
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,230
had an old friend mine convinced me to

251
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:49,820
trade him some and I still regretted to

252
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:53,149
this day it was back when I was still

253
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,399
combusting and and instead of it burning

254
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:57,649
to ash it kind of just melted into this

255
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,208
black kind of chunk of coal and I think

256
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:01,700
that was just all it was horrible it was

257
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:03,588
I couldn't even touch it it so that was

258
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,740
all the salts just burning and melting

259
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:08,779
and yeah so obviously not natural

260
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,970
obviously a lot less healthy I would

261
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:12,860
imagine yeah yeah totally well now that

262
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,040
we've given a little context for folks

263
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,300
about you know where the idea of

264
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,699
organics lives let's get right into the

265
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:21,949
heart of the matter you know while I

266
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,610
know you have some reservations about

267
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:27,140
began at growing long-term let's set

268
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,060
those aside for a moment we'll talk

269
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:32,000
about those a little bit later but for

270
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:35,719
now would you go ahead and make the case

271
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,578
for veganic growing as people see it why

272
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,500
do people consider avoiding animal

273
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:44,448
inputs I think and unfortunately for us

274
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,860
I think that is an ethical concern and

275
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:47,750
that's kind of touchy because everybody

276
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,789
has to make their own personal decisions

277
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,409
whether it's their diet or how they grow

278
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:53,899
their plant or anything else to that

279
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:57,110
effect and I think that's where the

280
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:58,159
incentive for the Ganic sli's and that

281
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,590
they just want to use an

282
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,600
any animal products now you have to make

283
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,180
some concessions with that choice

284
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,740
because microorganisms and protozoa and

285
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:08,809
everything that go in there that are

286
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,600
beneficial are still considered part of

287
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:12,979
the gannets but in the ethical

288
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,100
evaluation they're saying that they

289
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,800
don't have you know a consciousness or

290
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,950
they don't have a nervous system so so

291
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:24,169
it's okay now I to me that's getting a

292
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,180
little tenuous but again you know I'm

293
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:28,849
making my own personal decisions I want

294
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:30,919
to have the optimal environment for the

295
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,230
plant and plants can and well thrive

296
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:35,179
without any animal inputs obviously if

297
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,960
you look at the evolution of our planet

298
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:41,389
you know plants were first they did fine

299
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,700
but if you're walking along your path in

300
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:45,799
Hawaii for instance and you see all

301
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,970
these all these plants just doing lush

302
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:48,859
and also and you come across a place

303
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,629
where a cow died years ago and it's all

304
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,480
sudden ten times as lush right there

305
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:57,049
because it's feeding the plants so it's

306
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,560
hard to argue against input so I kind of

307
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:03,229
take the ethical Avenue of looking more

308
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,389
at mitigating wastes and being efficient

309
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:08,539
so instead of just throwing everything

310
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:11,179
away like let's say all the compost or

311
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:12,679
all the byproduct from your from your

312
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:15,259
organic dairy production is just going

313
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:16,699
to get pushed away or you have all this

314
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:17,450
extra fish left over they're just gonna

315
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,759
throw it away

316
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,560
I would actually advocate more for using

317
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,419
those animal products using vermiculture

318
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:25,699
and using those because I believe that

319
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:28,490
that provides a more optimal environment

320
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,680
but I can completely relate to the

321
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,350
incentive for vyg annex based on an

322
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:35,179
ethical ethical perspective right on

323
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,399
well some of the people that I talk to

324
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:39,799
who are in division and growing you know

325
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,590
they're not necessarily doing it for the

326
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:44,120
moral ethical reasons they say they do

327
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:47,030
it because they they think they're

328
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,159
getting a healthier plant and you know I

329
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:51,289
must admit I come to this topic with a

330
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:53,899
little bit of skepticism myself anyway

331
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:57,679
because I'm a big believer in earthworm

332
00:12:53,899 --> 00:13:01,159
castings and and so what is the argument

333
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,989
that veganic folks make that that a

334
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,899
plant will be healthier and more

335
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,970
thriving without using animal products I

336
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:11,779
mean as the is the idea that the animal

337
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:14,720
products in the in those proponents

338
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:19,039
somehow is is a take from the plant or

339
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:22,160
make somehow some some sort of nutrient

340
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,929
less available to the plant well I

341
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,719
haven't had a good argument with

342
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:30,319
somebody who's a real strong advocate of

343
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,480
Vig annex but what I understand is they

344
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,879
make the argument that it's cleaner now

345
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,800
that's a pretty ambiguous statement to

346
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,330
make and I would you know any statement

347
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,599
that you're making it especially now in

348
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:43,970
the day of it that we can do testing for

349
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,889
for fungus and and everything else and

350
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,360
don't have to stay as we did in

351
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:48,590
prohibition kind of under the radar now

352
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,820
you can bring it out and actually test

353
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,310
for these things so I'd like to see

354
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,100
those claims backed up because I don't

355
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:56,509
really see it you know the the the roots

356
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,490
are gonna take in what they take it's

357
00:13:56,509 --> 00:14:01,549
not like you're you know coating the

358
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:03,139
plant with you know all kinds of well

359
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,819
actually you do if you're if you're

360
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:06,289
doing foliar feeding but the plants

361
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,879
assimilate that and that's you know

362
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:11,149
that's the whole probiotic approach is

363
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:13,189
that the the the foliar feeding and the

364
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:15,860
in the root feeding it's all feeding the

365
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:18,200
plant so it you know breaks it down but

366
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,600
I don't see veganic says being cleaner I

367
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,710
just I don't see any scientific evidence

368
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,450
to support that

369
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,860
you know twigs there could there could

370
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,050
be I'm sorry to interrupt you there

371
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,509
could be empirical evidence I mean maybe

372
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:32,000
and I haven't seen a side-by-side i i

373
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:35,059
tested i tested it myself and was

374
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,769
growing that way for a while just just

375
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:38,929
to see how it worked because i was i

376
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:41,269
felt a little responsibility since i was

377
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:43,219
writing for high times at the time and

378
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:44,870
and i wanted to you know test these

379
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,910
things to see how viable they were

380
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,259
although I wasn't necessarily advocating

381
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:50,299
it but I can also see it like if

382
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:52,250
somebody's immunocompromised say and

383
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:54,019
they don't want to be around any animal

384
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:58,789
products because they don't want to risk

385
00:14:54,019 --> 00:15:00,079
having that bacteria yeah I can

386
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:01,159
understand that too so there's a lot of

387
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,160
reasons that people could make that

388
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:06,829
individual choice but I don't see it the

389
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,149
quality argument as being valid right on

390
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,620
the website

391
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:12,919
yeah right on well that's why you're

392
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:15,200
here you know I am I'm starting to get

393
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:16,879
the idea the between the the research I

394
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,040
did in advance and chatting with you and

395
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,320
others that that you know a lot of the

396
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,000
people who go to Vig annex it may not it

397
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,750
may be for

398
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,129
for outside reasons either moral ethical

399
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,629
or maybe because their immune

400
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:31,938
compromised and they don't want to have

401
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:34,959
animal products they don't want to work

402
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:39,469
with them themselves with their hands or

403
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,938
or or something else and and I'm

404
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,990
realizing that to a certain degree

405
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:47,688
veganic smae be kind of like its own

406
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:50,539
response to not wanting to use bottled

407
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:53,120
nutrients like like it is a obviously

408
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:56,120
vague annex is a subset of probiotic

409
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,509
growing but maybe it's just you know the

410
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:03,438
more hardcore version a hardcore

411
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:05,409
reaction against salt and synthetics and

412
00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:07,789
and that's an interesting idea

413
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:11,028
that could be you know it's kind of

414
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:13,490
being defined as we go so um you know I

415
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:15,769
guess the the people who are doing it

416
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,350
and advocating and are defining it as as

417
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:20,750
they go as I did when I wrote the higher

418
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,360
organics article and High Times in 2004

419
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,250
I was just kind of putting a definition

420
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,199
out there and obviously these

421
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,568
definitions can involved the way I look

422
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,719
at the the the Vig annex isn't

423
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:34,669
necessarily probiotic it won't work

424
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,350
without probiotics I would argue but

425
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:38,958
it's not necessarily probiotic in fact

426
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:42,769
that adds living creatures which if

427
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:44,628
you're a pure vegan and I know that they

428
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:47,808
make exceptions for this because again

429
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:49,819
that they're saying that these micro

430
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:53,929
flora do not have nervous systems and

431
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:56,688
whatnot but I mentioned I've written and

432
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:58,128
advocated about a book by clay clay

433
00:16:56,688 --> 00:17:00,349
Baxter which is called primary

434
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:03,188
perception and he's tested plants

435
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,449
actually and found that they do have

436
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:07,399
feelings you could say and this is

437
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:09,230
probably a kind of an in-depth topic for

438
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:14,150
another discussion but he tested them

439
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:16,490
with a lie detector and and found

440
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,110
feedback and in a nutshell you can read

441
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,599
more about that but you know perhaps

442
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:22,879
there's communication and feeling happen

443
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:28,369
that that we're not aware of even and

444
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,809
vegetable there's it I don't know it

445
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:31,609
just gets a little fuzzy when you start

446
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:33,408
talking about the ethics of it yeah

447
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:34,639
right on I follow that so hey we're

448
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:35,670
leaving for our first break we're gonna

449
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,080
go to our first

450
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,650
our break and be right back you are

451
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:42,359
listening to shaping fire using

452
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,340
pesticides when growing cannabis has

453
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:46,769
been common for a long time nowadays

454
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:48,899
though we know better we know that most

455
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:50,430
pesticides formulated for food crops

456
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,830
have never been tested for use with

457
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,110
cannabis they've been tested to be eaten

458
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:57,119
in tiny doses they have not been tested

459
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:59,209
to be inhaled and especially not

460
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,589
concentrated into a cannabis oil

461
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,329
chemical residues from pesticides are

462
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:05,849
not healthy for anyone but they are

463
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:07,470
especially dangerous for patients for

464
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:09,779
commercial cannabis growers this has

465
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,519
become very impactful cannabis

466
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:14,190
enthusiasts and patients have gotten

467
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:17,129
educated enough that they avoid growers

468
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,809
who used pesticides not only that but

469
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,060
states across the country have begun

470
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:24,629
making pesticide testing mandatory on

471
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:26,129
all licensed cannabis crops the time has

472
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,230
come to find a better way to fight

473
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,270
garden pests than covering your cannabis

474
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:34,250
and chemicals and there is a better way

475
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:36,599
let some good bugs fight your bad bugs

476
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,400
beneficial insects and predatory mites

477
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,649
have come a long way since we were

478
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,630
buying ladybugs online and putting them

479
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:46,860
in the grow room and just hoping for the

480
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:49,020
best natural enemies biocontrol can help

I'm your host Shango Lowe's and our

503
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:45,719
guest this week is legendary probiotic

504
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,430
grower and High Times writer Nabu so

505
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,440
never before the break we were talking

506
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,269
about vague annex

507
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,278
as an idea that that some people have

508
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:56,370
used and some people have used it as a

509
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:59,038
bridge towards probiotics as they move

510
00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:01,079
away from the bottle and and this idea

511
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,028
of a gimmicks that has lasted for a

512
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:05,490
while and I gotta tell you you know when

513
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:08,638
I was researching the show trying to

514
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:10,620
find an expert to bring on you know

515
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:13,048
pretty much the only person that came up

516
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:15,839
anywhere was Kyle kushman and you know

517
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:17,519
as I dug more and more and I asked my

518
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,378
compatriots there on the on the

519
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,359
probiotic farmers alliance group on

520
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:23,250
Facebook you know about who they would

521
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,918
recommend you know your name came up and

522
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:28,470
so and so I had to you know let you hunt

523
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,139
you up I appreciate it and find out

524
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,819
where you were and the thing is is that

525
00:20:31,138 --> 00:20:34,829
you know veganic seems like this thing

526
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:36,808
that that has just kind of always been

527
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:39,569
there maybe but it hasn't really gotten

528
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:42,298
popular and and and there aren't very

529
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:44,308
many people evangelizing it anymore so

530
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:46,859
my question for you is you know did Vig

531
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:49,168
annex ever become popular or has it

532
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:52,109
always been this kind of minor specialty

533
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:54,028
ideology yeah I think it's been pretty

534
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:56,878
minor I didn't know I mean after I wrote

535
00:20:54,028 --> 00:20:59,220
about it in 2004 I don't think anybody

536
00:20:56,878 --> 00:21:02,668
that I know of was actually doing it and

537
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,769
I know Kyle started his company around

538
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:07,710
it but that was you know a decade later

539
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:09,659
or you know it was quite a bit later so

540
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:13,379
I haven't seen it be a really popular

541
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:15,870
thing and but I think you know I think

542
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:17,609
it's a good thing if it stays true to

543
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:20,339
all the other positive aspects of

544
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:22,769
growing and when you talk about shipping

545
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:25,470
soil and things like that you you know

546
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:27,329
in plastic bags you and the trucking and

547
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,579
and all that you reach the point of

548
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:31,500
diminishing returns on the benefit of it

549
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:34,798
pretty quickly as opposed to if you can

550
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,048
do it yourself yeah that makes sense and

551
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,179
you know I gotta admit you know the more

552
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:42,538
we talk about this I I think that my

553
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:45,809
understanding of a big annex is evolving

554
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:48,240
when when we came to the show I was kind

555
00:21:45,808 --> 00:21:50,369
of expecting this show to be making a

556
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,609
case for mechanics that people could

557
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:56,099
either you know take or leave but I'm

558
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:58,199
what I'm starting to realize is that you

559
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:00,778
know veganic sizz almost like a straw

560
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,960
man like yeah veganic is way better than

561
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:07,200
using bottled new

562
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:10,259
and and yet you might not have the best

563
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,009
thriving plants if as if you use some

564
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:15,509
animal inputs but really it sounds like

565
00:22:13,009 --> 00:22:17,490
it's almost like a straw man a foil to

566
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:22,289
have a discussion around that it might

567
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:24,420
not actually be a a cogent strategy in

568
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:30,230
and of itself but more like an inroad to

569
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:33,259
to probiotics and using nutrient teas I

570
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:36,839
agree yeah I can see it as being a

571
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:39,450
stepping stone as it were for some folks

572
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,069
and I think the when you when you

573
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,850
introduce all the creatures again that

574
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:46,289
kind of goes against the began expose

575
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:50,189
because now you're dealing with animal

576
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:52,289
products and I guess my concept and my

577
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:55,650
principles are just I want to provide

578
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:58,079
everything I can obviously ethically to

579
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:02,250
nurture the plant as much as possible

580
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:05,730
and it seems it seems counterproductive

581
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:07,589
to me to get away from all the creatures

582
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:11,460
that have evolved around it whether it's

583
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:14,579
vermiculture using seabird guano bat

584
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,829
guano's fish emulsion all those things

585
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:19,589
those are just tools that will really

586
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:22,289
really provide life for your plants and

587
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:25,349
really help them thrive so I don't have

588
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:26,879
the ethical concerns or hang-ups or

589
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:29,189
whatever you want to call it that I need

590
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,450
or the immune system that I'm worried

591
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,630
about in fact you know I'm very

592
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,920
probiotic in my own own health so I

593
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,510
don't need to worry about any of those

594
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,330
things in my own personal grow but again

595
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:40,950
I can see how people do it and and I say

596
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:42,178
kudos to them I think I think it's a

597
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,429
good thing if they're if they're doing

598
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:45,929
it doing it themselves now if you're

599
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:48,030
buying bags and bags of fertilizer

600
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:51,300
having them shipped in it's all dead

601
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:54,029
it's in plastic then I really don't see

602
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:56,909
any ethical advantage to that but again

603
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:58,980
it could still be an immune system

604
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,690
concern so if you have to have a real

605
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,880
sterile environment for yourself that is

606
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,230
unfortunate because a sterile

607
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,380
environment is the perfect environment

608
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:09,120
for pathogens to evolve even our own our

609
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,340
own bodies the ratio of bacteria to

610
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,949
human cells we have more bacteria than

611
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:16,289
human cells than are in our own biome

612
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:19,259
and that's something that you need to

613
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:20,759
feed and nurture and our health is

614
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:22,410
dependent upon that same same with the

615
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,660
plant the phyllo sphere that the leaf

616
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:26,910
surface is alive if you populate that

617
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,920
with compost teas you will not have the

618
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:30,800
diseases like powdery mildew you won't

619
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,930
be able to start as much if you have a

620
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,460
good foliar feeding regimen and same

621
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,990
with the rhizosphere the root zone if

622
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,410
you're feeding that you you're getting

623
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:42,480
the the symbiotic relationship of

624
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,130
breaking down all the nutrients and it's

625
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,860
just giving the plant everything it

626
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:48,600
needs so if I'm drawing on an animal and

627
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:50,939
vegetable I will really draw in on

628
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,769
everything you know that I can I'm not

629
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,230
like sacrificing animals or doing

630
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:57,089
anything you know crazy but if it's a

631
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:59,579
waste product especially that I'm taking

632
00:24:57,089 --> 00:25:02,490
advantage of then I feel very good about

633
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:04,199
it in the plants plants show it right on

634
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,509
that makes sense let's let's dig into

635
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,019
that bit about how why the plants are

636
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:11,970
doing better with animal inputs so I

637
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:14,039
recognize that you're you're potentially

638
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,259
going to go over my head here since you

639
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:18,389
know I'm I still consider myself a

640
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:19,980
novice grower compared to somebody like

641
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,530
you who's been doing it for thirty years

642
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,900
or more but so let's talk a little bit

643
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:27,690
about the biochemistry behind it so so

644
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:31,440
when you're not using animal inputs you

645
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:34,410
know what is being missed at the micro

646
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:40,080
level that the plant is looking for that

647
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:43,410
it can get from you know worm castings

648
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,639
and and you know using extra fish guts

649
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,820
and things like that that you might

650
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,009
throw into into your hole you know what

651
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:52,319
what what is the plant pulling from

652
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:57,150
these nutrient wise that it's not going

653
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:58,950
to pull from pure plant sources again

654
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:02,100
that goes to the symbiotic relationship

655
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,750
of the like nitrogen-fixing bacteria all

656
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:06,299
the all the different bacteria or the

657
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:08,039
micro easy oh I guess the the fungi

658
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:10,079
isn't considered a creature but I would

659
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,639
have to consider the bacteria and the

660
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,319
nematodes and all those things as

661
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,820
creatures and all the bacteria that goes

662
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:18,089
with them all the life that goes with it

663
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:19,169
helps break down the lot of the

664
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:20,939
nutrients some of them are already

665
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:23,610
bioavailable but it's all about

666
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,650
bioavailability and that's all those

667
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:28,469
bacteria and all those creatures add to

668
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,280
that right on that make sense to me

669
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,460
and so

670
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,470
so so if you were if the goal was to

671
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,880
produce you know we were using we were

672
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:40,140
kind of throwing around the term clean

673
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:44,010
product earlier you know if one wanted

674
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:48,150
to use animal inputs and yet they still

675
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:50,940
wanted to try to respect producing a a

676
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:53,670
clean product like somebody who had a

677
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,309
vague Anik mindset you know was trying

678
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:59,779
to attain what are some of the better

679
00:26:56,309 --> 00:27:02,669
animal inputs that could be used that

680
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:05,759
they both have a symbiotic relationship

681
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:12,000
with the soil but also won't sludge up

682
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:14,579
your soil yeah I would say I would focus

683
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,049
on your community let's say so you're on

684
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:17,939
Vashon Island right let's say that

685
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:20,069
you've got maybe a relationship with an

686
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,440
organic dairy there and you want to

687
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:25,500
start vermiculture so you take all the

688
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,850
all the droppings from the cows and all

689
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,740
the manure and everything and then you

690
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:30,809
feed that to your to your worm bin and

691
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,940
they process it that is gonna when it's

692
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:35,099
done it's going to be a so beneficial

693
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,200
for your soil and let's say you have

694
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:39,959
some relationships established with

695
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,610
fisheries instead of them throwing away

696
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,009
the fish heads and the bones or whatever

697
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:45,929
parts they don't use you can emulsify

698
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:48,029
that and then you could use that in your

699
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,710
compost teas as well as your other you

700
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:51,660
know it's kind of the biodynamic

701
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,590
approach you use everything you can now

702
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,550
there's there's gonna be other

703
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:58,919
considerations especially now since

704
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,539
Fukushima happened you may you may be a

705
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,070
little bit cautious about using those

706
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:05,099
fish you might want a little Geiger

707
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:06,419
counter there to see it's sad it's sad

708
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:09,209
to have to consider that but you know

709
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,190
there may be that's another bonus for

710
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:14,460
for veganic s--

711
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:16,620
because as the radioactive particles

712
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,720
become bio accumulated in the food chain

713
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:19,919
that's going to be something that people

714
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,809
have to consider more and more

715
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,759
unfortunate I hate to bring that up but

716
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:25,470
there's been studies and I mean there

717
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:28,470
are three total meltdowns that happened

718
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:30,360
and you know that now there's seeing the

719
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,700
cesium signature you know right on the

720
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:34,500
shores here in Oregon and that's I don't

721
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,890
see that stopping anytime soon so that's

722
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,769
another consideration but I think what I

723
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:42,630
like to focus on is is using the waste

724
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:44,460
products I guess I mean to me

725
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,710
it's crazy that there's these berries

726
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,259
harvested they throw away the fruit and

727
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:51,750
then they bring them in hundreds and

728
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:54,480
hundreds of tons and then they burn them

729
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,759
at 400 to 500 degrees and then everybody

730
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,980
drinks it I'm talking about coffee and

731
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,259
there's acrylamide in there and that's a

732
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,910
toxin it's very acidic but I'm not gonna

733
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:04,500
you know Who am I to judge you know

734
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,269
everybody you know likes their stimulant

735
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,180
and whatnot but I could take all the

736
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:12,839
coffee grounds and use that in compost

737
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:14,880
so I think you just have to kind of

738
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:18,029
think outside the box and and look and

739
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,770
and the neat thing I guess that I would

740
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:21,210
like to see is people use their own

741
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:22,769
solutions as opposed to you know getting

742
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,990
some store-bought thing that shipped in

743
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:26,700
that's completely dead sure that's gonna

744
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,099
generate some revenue for the producer

745
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,900
and whatnot but you're also getting all

746
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:32,819
that plastic and you know there's the

747
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,160
shipping and and all the rest of it and

748
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:36,990
you could be establishing local ties

749
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,000
with your community and using all your

750
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,740
waste to me that makes a lot more sense

751
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,420
and you just have to look at it very

752
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,910
closely because you could have big annex

753
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,980
you have to stay away from GMO soy you

754
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,360
have to watch out for cottonseed that's

755
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,400
you know super contaminated with

756
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:51,719
pesticides you have to keep your eye no

757
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,450
matter what you decide you have to

758
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,940
really investigate it thoroughly damned

759
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,230
if you do and damned if you don't we're

760
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,730
gonna take a short break and be right

761
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,930
back you are listening to shaping fire

762
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,519
businesses everywhere are constantly

763
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,650
striving to reach out to people through

764
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,450
advertising we all know though that

765
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,920
trying to reach a cannabis audience with

766
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,930
a quality message is pretty difficult

767
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,320
that's why many people choose to

768
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:17,759
advertise on the shaping fire podcast

769
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:19,619
advertising on this show allows us time

770
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,420
to talk about your product service or

771
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:23,219
brand in a way that really lets people

772
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,470
know what sets your company apart from

773
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,539
others bold people who own companies

774
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,730
know that getting in a relationship with

775
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:32,190
their customers is essential that is

776
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,019
what we offer we will explain your

777
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:36,420
service or product and what sets it

778
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:38,490
apart as desirable and help our audience

779
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,350
get in contact with you it's pretty

780
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,160
simple really

781
00:30:39,349 --> 00:30:44,159
advertising does not have to be all

782
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,750
whiz-bang smoke and mirrors nowadays I

783
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,450
find that people prefer just to be

784
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,730
spoken to calmly accurately and with

785
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:52,759
good intentions if you want to make your

786
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:55,620
own commercial spot you can do that too

787
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:56,309
because the podcast is young but growing

788
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:58,919
at an exception

789
00:30:56,309 --> 00:31:01,319
fast rate if you become an advertiser on

790

805
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:35,549
you are listening to shaping fire I'm

806
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,710
your host Shango Louis and I guess this

807
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:41,669
week is legendary probiotic grower and

808
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:44,130
High Times writer Nabu so before the

809
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:47,100
before the break I really don't like how

810
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,960
I gave you what you had to say negative

811
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:49,649
context I said damned if you do damned

812
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,690
if you don't

813
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:54,600
after you were talking about you know

814
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:56,820
making sure that your your inputs were

815
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:58,469
clean and I and I think I took the

816
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:00,720
positive thing that you were saying

817
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,640
about building relationships with

818
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,920
farmers and I think I just like I think

819
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,050
I spun it the wrong wrong way because in

820
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:10,350
the end you weren't talking about being

821
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:12,809
suspicious about everybody's inputs you

822
00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:15,389
were talking more about being an active

823
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:17,369
edge you know being an active learner

824
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:20,670
and getting in a relationship with your

825
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:22,409
community right yeah well I think and I

826
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,420
can understand I can empathize with your

827
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,160
perspective because there's a lot out

828
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,350
there that's pretty heavy you know and

829
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,240
it's easy to get frustrated and just ah

830
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:32,039
it's just too much you know everything

831
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,809
is bad everything's poisonous or

832
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:36,930
whatever and it's challenging you know

833
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:39,960
living in our highly toxic environment

834
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:42,269
of today but if you evaluate everything

835
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,370
I still think there's paths that you can

836
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:46,349
take and to look on the positive side of

837
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:48,089
it yes I think that one of the great

838
00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:50,309
paths that you can take is developing

839
00:32:48,089 --> 00:32:52,199
those relationships and and you know I

840
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:53,669
used your island as an example and I

841
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,620
think that's a neat community to draw

842
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:58,470
from and and that's what you can do and

843
00:32:55,619 --> 00:33:02,719
you can really personalize your approach

844
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:04,890
by using all these philosophies or

845
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,720
principles and just applying them to

846
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,120
your to your own situation and there's

847
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,680
really not one right way to do it and I

848
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:12,119
know a lot of times people want to

849
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,759
tell me the answer how do I do this in

850
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:15,989
and in there's a there are there's just

851
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,879
so many ways then and you can

852
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:19,500
personalize this so I think it's good

853
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,890
for people to always be learning always

854
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,539
be inspecting and ideally you will

855
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,460
develop those relationships and and

856
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:29,009
mitigate some waste in your community

857
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,720
and and and and you know optimize and

858
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:32,940
and build those things so I think it's

859
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,799
uh it can be a really positive thing

860
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,470
even though again there are challenges

861
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,450
for sure and I think that I think that's

862
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:42,210
a good time to point out you know bio

863
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:46,019
regionalism you know I'm a big fan of

864
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:48,029
wild crafted nutrient teas and and you

865
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:49,920
know when we do this show you know I

866
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:52,139
always get emails from people like oh

867
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,789
you know the comfrey that you talked

868
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,790
about you know with your guests it

869
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:58,230
doesn't grow wild where I live you know

870
00:33:56,789 --> 00:34:00,029
what what do you have to recommend

871
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:02,700
that's you know where I live in Kansas

872
00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:04,349
or wherever it may be and and I think

873
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,720
that's that's kind of a good point to

874
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:10,139
make is that you know if you live here

875
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,349
on Vashon Island you're you know you're

876
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:15,449
you're working with you know rabbit

877
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:17,909
pellets and oh man we've got a tofu

878
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:19,710
Factory on the island so we get tons of

879
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:22,859
acara you know meet lots of acara

880
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:25,110
whereas whereas you know wherever you

881
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:28,610
know any particular grower lives they

882
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:31,470
gotta find out what the inexpensive

883
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:33,630
healthy waste products are around them

884
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:35,689
to use and I think that's you know I

885
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:37,950
think that adds adds a little

886
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:40,829
exclamation point to what you were

887
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:43,049
saying that it really is about where you

888
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:45,779
are do your homework on what kind of

889
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,160
probiotic inputs you can have of you

890
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,810
know and find out what they're putting

891
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,250
into their products so you know that

892
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:52,259
you're clean but you know get in

893
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,699
relationship with your local business

894
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,160
folk and and find out what they're

895
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:58,439
trying to get rid of yeah that makes

896
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,179
sense and especially when you're talking

897
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,300
the soil medium because that's that's a

898
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:04,829
huge thing I will I'm glad you brought

899
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,140
it up because what you're talking about

900
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:10,110
is a little bit of the nativist argument

901
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:12,000
and you can take that to an extreme end

902
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:14,550
and I really want to draw I'm a citizen

903
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,500
of the world I'm a beekeeper too and I

904
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,910
get a lot of I've seen a lot of people

905
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,039
talk about you know this is native this

906
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:22,139
is invasive species and but people are

907
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:24,090
really behind honeybees even though

908
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:24,329
they're not native to North America but

909
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,650
we

910
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:28,529
would be you know kind of lost without

911
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:29,910
them in our current agriculture so you

912
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:32,550
have to kind of evaluate these things

913
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:34,289
not everything so cut-and-dry but the

914
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:36,000
bulk stuff if you if you're talking the

915
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:37,529
soils and things that are just really

916
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,849
cost prohibitive and silly to have

917
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:41,100
shipped in I mean if you're doing a

918
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:42,299
10,000 square-foot grow or acres you

919
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:44,519
don't want to be shipping in the soil

920
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,050
you probably want to be working with

921
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:48,989
what you've got and amending it with

922
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,330
different things now I like to draw on

923
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:54,419
the entire world ice because I want to

924
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:56,250
grow the absolute best so sure I'm using

925
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,400
soil here I'm using a lot of local

926
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:02,699
ingredients 90% but if I'm getting some

927
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,619
fossilized seabird guano from Peru boom

928
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:08,250
I'll use it or if I'm getting something

929
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:09,329
some fulvic mineral from Kentucky you

930
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:12,000
know because there's a great organic

931
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:13,319
source there or diatomaceous earth from

932
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,260
a mine in California

933
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:19,230
whatever it is neem doesn't grow here so

934
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:22,950
I use a lot of neem whether it's neem

935
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:24,809
meal or neem oil so I'm drawing on all

936
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:26,219
these resources to produce the most

937
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:29,309
optimum thing and that benefits the

938
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:31,289
people it's a fair trade fair market

939
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:32,940
type of situation so it's benefiting

940
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,949
people that just are you know not just

941
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,929
in my local community but again those

942
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:39,689
relationships in the local community too

943
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:41,609
you can bind it all together and create

944
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,190
kind of the best environment the best of

945
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:46,860
both worlds so before we wrap up cuz

946
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:49,139
we're almost done here it's kind of

947
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:52,250
funny i'ma like before we wrap up not

948
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:55,259
having a show making a case for began X

949
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:56,820
so um you know when I was when I was

950
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,510
trying to find you you know through a

951
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:04,019
few different online forums and such you

952
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:05,820
know folks you know knew about your your

953
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:08,009
high times articles but all anybody

954
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,470
wanted to talk about were these these

955
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:13,680
strains that you had put out as a

956
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:15,719
breeder and you know and everybody's all

957
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,549
like have him talk about his strains and

958
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:18,869
so why don't you take a couple minutes

959
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,670
and just tell us about some of the

960
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,839
strains that you put out there and you

961
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,180
know just a little bit about you as a

962
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,800
breeder because I know that I know I'll

963
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:27,659
get emails about like why didn't you ask

964
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,970
him so why you just share a little bit

965
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:33,269
before we wrap up okay that sounds like

966
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:35,849
a whole nother podcast but yeah the so I

967
00:37:33,269 --> 00:37:37,530
was involved geez I guess you know since

968
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:39,389
97 I've been

969
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:41,400
breeding and developing different

970
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:44,639
hybrids some of the ones that are out

971
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:47,849
there Jackie O which is a Jaclyn Orange

972
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:50,369
and there's cherry melon or cherry lime

973
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:52,440
Rickey that was really popular the black

974
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:54,960
Russian that was the original developer

975
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,210
of that and some other people developed

976
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,059
it into f2 but kind of sold it as a f1

977
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:02,940
there's been a lot of hybrids developed

978
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:05,360
from mine and then when overgrow kind of

979
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,320
got busted by the Canadian Mounties

980
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,570
decided to be probably best to go

981
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,519
underground again with that but I've

982
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,590
never stopped breeding I've been working

983
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,570
on some CBD varieties now and still

984
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,610
working on a lot that expressed purple

985
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:20,670
and always with a focus on the sativas

986
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:23,370
the real functional hi I've always been

987
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:26,700
kind of opposed to the the couch lock

988
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:28,889
just I really need you know the the

989
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:31,679
euphoric and the working working

990
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:33,539
headspace and that's that's been my

991
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,940
forte and the CBDs are really

992
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:38,940
interesting too because of the legal

993
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:42,510
aspects of it and also the the

994
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,650
physiological aspects of it and so

995
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,940
that's been pretty exciting in that

996
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,889
Beth's that's what I'm working on

997
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,139
presently so we'll see what happens

998
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:51,539
hopefully I'm able to still make some

999
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:53,670
progress and with recreational happening

1000
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:55,320
more and more I may actually be able to

1001
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,960
kind of come out of the basement and do

1002
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,090
some really big-time selection with

1003
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,829
really big numbers because again all

1004
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,539
this stuff that I've developed has been

1005
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:06,929
kind of during the prohibitionist era

1006
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:09,300
and it makes it difficult you know to be

1007
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:10,710
a quite frank because you don't have you

1008
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,750
don't have the numbers that you could

1009
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:15,119
normally draw on but I've still made

1010
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:17,429
some good progress and I'm happy that

1011
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,259
there's folks out there that remember me

1012
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:20,489
or still enjoying the hybrids that I've

1013
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,290
released over the years

1014
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:24,239
yeah you're both both the cherry lime

1015
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:25,500
and the Black Russian got a lot of love

1016
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,719
when I was looking for you

1017
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,179
people were saying specifically about

1018
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:32,489
the Black Russian about how unique it

1019
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:35,039
was and then how they had used it in

1020
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:36,629
their own breeding programs because it

1021
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,829
was such a great place to start you know

1022
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:39,510
and they were like you know speaking of

1023
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:41,519
you and you know reverent tones and

1024
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,140
stuff so so yeah that's great yeah it

1025
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,840
