1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,089
so Jeff you know a lot of people may

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,179
have respect for Verma castings or worm

3
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,269
castings or worm poop right yeah for

4
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:24,509
good reason and um for for most people

5
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:27,509
though they see it as a good organic

6
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:28,949
nitrogen source but you know from

7
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:30,809
reading your books I've realized that

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,700
that you know that's just the tip of the

9
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:36,600
iceberg and I think it's important that

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:40,020
people understand how worm castings can

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,149
really help the soil food web so we

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,350
break that out for us sure well it's

13
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,729
interesting

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,870
worms are phenomenal yes just well you

15
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:50,459
know all the books that people have

16
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:52,769
written about worms they don't need

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,329
another one for me but if there was a

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,670
subject I read about worms and ants

19
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,740
would be right there but what happens

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,189
with the worm is is that they take in

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,140
their their nutrient which is really

22
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:05,459
just a bunch of microbes they don't care

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,228
about that leaf they're pulling into

24
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,029
their body they just want to take a

25
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:12,090
couple of little bacteria and maybe a

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,978
little fun guys so protozoa yummy and

27
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,159
and the rest of it goes right right film

28
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:20,340
so what comes out of the worm is that

29
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:24,510
organic material - a few of the microbes

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,370
that the worm would adjust itself but an

31
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,219
amazing thing happens inside the worm

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,049
that makes it more valuable than just

33
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:33,750
nitrogen yes there's good nitrogen in

34
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:37,049
worm castings but there is also somehow

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,728
an increase in a number of the elements

36
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,790
that you want to have as nutrients so

37
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:43,049
phosphorus I list them in the book

38
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,990
teeming with microbes

39
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:49,580
I can't about five or six of them are

40
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:51,868
increased five six seven eight times in

41
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:54,030
concentration as they come out the back

42
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:55,950
end so what goes into the worm and what

43
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,010
comes out the back end are not the same

44
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,590
in terms of nutrient quality and when it

45
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,460
comes out it comes out in a form that

46
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,978
helps build soil structure and and so

47
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:11,729
both the increase in nutrients and that

48
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:14,459
that wonderful friable nature of the

49
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:15,289
material itself those castings they just

50
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,239
mean

51
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:19,878
terrific condominium for the soil food

52
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,650
web they are full of nutrients which the

53
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:23,929
soil food web needs and your plants need

54
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:27,469
and they still contain a tremendous

55
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,120
number of good microbes in there so for

56
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:31,158
all of those reasons one casting is

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,469
great and the reason why so many people

58
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:36,289
use worm castings as opposed to just

59
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:38,598
pure compost or Verma castings is

60
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:40,310
because of this increased concentration

61
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:43,369
in these five or six or seven nutrients

62
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,229
so I like that you said that it creates

63
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,009
a good condominium for that good white

64
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:47,568
web

65
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:49,658
so it's cuz it's gonna live there right

66
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:52,548
it creates a good living environment and

67
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:55,158
you said that it adds to soil structure

68
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:57,950
right can you break out what exactly you

69
00:02:55,158 --> 00:03:00,709
mean by soil structure sure you know if

70
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:02,568
you if you look at soil depending on

71
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:06,139
where you are it has it has a different

72
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:08,298
feel a different crumble miss cetera et

73
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:10,730
cetera I mean these are soil structures

74
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:12,769
how the soil is put together and so in

75
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:17,539
the soil food web world what happens is

76
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:19,039
the bacteria they give off a glue in

77
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:20,810
order to be able to stick themselves

78
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,030
together and that sticks the little

79
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,489
pieces of little in this case it could

80
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,439
stick to those little teeny castings and

81
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:31,009
then those castings stick to each other

82
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,090
and that begins to form a conglomerate

83
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:33,798
of soil

84
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,469
these aren't bricks that are not flat

85
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,180
and so you get pore spaces where air and

86
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:40,969
water can go on little guys tonight from

87
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,030
the big guys so it's that soil structure

88
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:46,189
and then fungi community they weave

89
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,650
around those little conglomerates and

90
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:50,299
they make a bigger one and and all of a

91
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,560
sudden and then even if you have the

92
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:53,599
worm in there you know it goes through

93
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,090
it it's a tunnel a burrow all of this

94
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,548
stuff makes it easier for a plant to

95
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,500
grow the roots can grow between and

96
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:02,150
around these pore spaces and into these

97
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,799
pore spaces if there happened to be

98
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,949
worms in the Sun they can go right in

99
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:09,290
the worm hole tunnels and burrows is you

100
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:11,900
know so so having worms is really a

101
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:14,929
great thing right on so so this time of

102
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,418
year a lot of us are you looking to

103
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,889
source worm castings and there's there's

104
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:22,289
lots options we can have our own worm

105
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:25,410
boxes we can we can buy castings

106
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,480
from a local farmer but also you know

107
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,300
most of us will end up going to a grow

108
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,490
shop and you know they've got they've

109
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,199
got bags that are pure worm castings

110
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,930
which are much more expensive but then

111
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,319
we've got these like worm casting and

112
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,000
some kind of soil mix bags and I always

113
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,129
have a hard time deciding which one to

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
buy because I like the cheaper price

115
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:48,089
right but I don't particularly like that

116
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,070
I'm paying for the soil but there might

117
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:51,869
be a good reason for it so so if you

118
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:53,339
were gonna guide somebody to one one

119
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,600
product or another what do you think we

120
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:56,159
should look for we're looking to buy

121
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,470
worm castings like the pure worm

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,290
castings myself yeah I never know what

123
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,850
the soil is now of course the label if

124
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,650
it's good soil and I know the people

125
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,340
arts that are embedded in it it's fine

126
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:10,859
but I am I also at my own compost and so

127
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:12,539
I use them I also think you have to be

128
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,360
very careful that when you buy worms

129
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,980
yourself that you make sure you get the

130
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,710
right kind of worms there's this worm

131
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,319
that bring it in from Asia as a bait

132
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:23,969
worm it looks like the regular red

133
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,279
wiggler that we all you know we're

134
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,650
taught to buy at center etc but it's not

135
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:31,309
and it's the worm that is causing the

136
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:34,649
Duff to to disappear too quickly in

137
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,970
Michigan fishermen go fishing they don't

138
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:39,149
catch anything they fill the worms down

139
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,820
on the ground these worms eat a lot of

140
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:44,039
the duck in six months that should take

141
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:45,420
two or three years to disappear and then

142
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,330
the next thing you know you you have

143
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,310
garlic mustard move in garlic mustard is

144
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:53,189
out boy am I getting off point garlic

145
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:57,680
mustard is allopathic for the

146
00:05:53,189 --> 00:06:01,459
mycorrhizal fungi that feed maple trees

147
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,100
oh so you want to be careful about where

148
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:06,409
you get the words let's take another

149
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,479
step down that rabbit hole okay so so

150
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:11,240
you said you know the red wigglers that

151
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,409
we were all taught to buy and the recent

152
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,269
feedback I've been getting for people

153
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,000
they've been recommending picking me

154
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:19,038
picking up nightcrawlers so so which are

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,860
the right worms and does it matter well

156
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,360
I don't know you know the night crawlers

157
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,689
you know they meet they there they're

158
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,770
deep they go deep and we don't have them

159
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:29,660
in Alaska so I don't have a lot of

160
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:31,189
experience with them but I know people

161
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,860
that are brought a mineral ask and I'm

162
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:35,569
beginning to wonder is that a good thing

163
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,470
first of all but all the worms basically

164
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:42,019
the United States have been imported

165
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,550
wait like all the worms yeah like even

166
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:46,159
the ones in the Soilers the ones ever

167
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,538
selling no once in the slope came in we

168
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,740
had worms in the United in North America

169
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:55,069
glaciation came and it destroyed the

170
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,978
worms except a few of them down you know

171
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:59,689
in the Arizona area there's some what

172
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:02,930
they call pot worms and they survived

173
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:05,750
but earthworms didn't and so the

174
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,720
pilgrims came and and worms in the

175
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:11,110
ballast of their boats rocks tonight

176
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,349
yeah

177
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:17,740
in Johnny Appleseed or tram blablabla

178
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:19,329
and about 20-25 years ago I started

179
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,129
getting phone calls from people in the

180
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:23,620
Anchorage Alaska we said what are they

181
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:26,379
little bumps of my long people had never

182
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,879
seen a worm wow that's hard to believe

183
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,099
yeah it is I grew up on the East Coast I

184
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,718
mean we we had the biggest compost pile

185
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:33,938
in the world that worms them that's what

186
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:35,769
you fished with it the rain anyway it's

187
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:39,159
very very interesting but worm castings

188
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:41,589
are very valuable I go for the pure and

189
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:44,319
the reason is soil structure but also

190
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:46,060
this has got a high concentration of

191
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,289
nutrients fantastic thank you very much

192
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,288
you're welcome I'll shake

193
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:57,639
you
