00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,879
to the extent that the Cannabis industry

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,000
has rock stars Dr Ethan Russo is one of

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,679
them his groundbreaking research on

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,039
cannabis tpin the Entourage effect endoc

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,000
canabo deficiency and phyto canabo in

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,880
general are all essential reading for

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,640
anyone looking to really understand the

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,079
interaction between the cannabis plant

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,359
and humans I remember the first time I

11
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:31,919
invited Dr Russo to speak here on Vashon

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,559
Island we had 75 Chairs set up like we

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,640
normally would for a Vash on island

14
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:37,079
marijuana entrepreneurs Alliance meeting

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,039
and those chairs filled up really

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,920
quickly then we used the rest of the

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,558
chairs that were in the closet and when

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,200
we were out of chairs folks sat on

19
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,878
pillows and jackets on the floor in

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,120
front of the chairs and finally it was

21
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:50,159
standing room only in the back that

22
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,640
night it was like an old school teaching

23
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,639
everybody was excited to have an

24
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,359
opportunity to hear Dr Russo speak in

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,000
person and have their questions answered

26
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,120
see for years it has been nearly

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,320
impossible for regular people to hear Dr

28
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,959
Russo speak because he worked at GW

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,680
Pharmaceuticals and pretty much only

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,040
spoke at high-priced exclusive

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,720
pharmaceutical conventions I remember

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,240
very clearly the day I received an email

33
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,478
from Ethan saying that he was no longer

34
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:15,640
at GW and he was now free to accept my

35
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:18,200
speaking invitation for a simple Log

36
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,840
Cabin gra Hall on Bashon Island he

37
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,079
sounded very excited because you know

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,118
Ethan really isn't an ivory Tower kind

39
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:25,639
of researcher he's more interested in

40
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,078
speaking directly to patients and

41
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,478
working in the field like he had done

42
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:34,158
previously in Morocco China and Peru Dr

medicine for many folks myself included

48
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,359
it was the first time we had read a

49
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,359
detailed paper explaining the interplay

50
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,438
of different phyto canabo in a

51
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,078
conversational tone that anyone could

52
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:54,438
understand you can find a link to the

ethnobotany welcome to the show Ethan

100
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,679
well thank you so much for having me I'm

101
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,000
really glad that you were willing to

102
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,159
make the time to to join us so so let's

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,360
start with something pretty basic so we

104
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:45,359
know that phyto canabo exist and there

105
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,280
must be a reason that they exist in

106
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,439
nature so you know what natural benefit

107
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,640
do phyto canabo offer to the plant that

108
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:56,438
that makes them exist in the first

109
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,199
place well uh straight out of the shoot

110
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:01,878
it's important to relate that they're

111
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:05,518
not there for uh human enjoyment the

112
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:08,679
plant itself is much older uh than

113
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,640
humans are as a species so yes you're

114
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,400
right they perform an ecological role in

115
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:18,639
the plant and actually it's more than

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:22,800
one um one of the things is that the

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:26,040
canabo uh protect the plant from genetic

118
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,038
damage from ultraviolet light

119
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,600
exposure uh one of the things we know is

120
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:34,519
that production of the canabo will be

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,520
increased with higher light pressure and

122
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:40,120
at a higher elevation uh so those two

123
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:43,399
things go together another interesting

124
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,600
role of the canabo is that uh some of

125
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:49,799
them are

126
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:52,479
insecticidal uh so if a bug lands on the

127
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,960
flower there are two ways in which the

128
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:58,680
bug can meet its demise one is from a

129
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:01,719
chemical attack by the the cannabinoids

130
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:06,240
and the other is just the stickiness of

131
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:11,160
the tricomes will trap them uh finally

132
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,560
the uh cannabinoids also are helpful in

133
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,240
pruning the plant as it's trying to

134
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,439
mature and become fertilized these will

135
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,519
rain down on the fan leaves and uh they

136
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,439
will tend to die so what the plant is

137
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:28,959
doing near the end of its year of growth

138
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:31,000
is putting all the uh effort um

139
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,680
chemically speaking into getting

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,600
fertilized and Nur nurturing that flow

141
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,959
and the hopes that it will become

142
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,400
fertilized but that's usually thwarted

143
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:42,399
by humans that want it to remain

144
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,439
unfertilized to get the greater

145
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,599
cannabinoid

146
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:49,279
production that's interesting to me

147
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,759
hearing you describe it almost as a as a

148
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,399
defense mechanism and as a plant

149
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,520
regulator because you know in our own

150
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,638
endoc canabo system that's the same

151
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:01,120
thing that phyto canabo do for us you

152
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,800
know a defense and regulation of our

153
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,360
systems um there must be some similarity

154
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,400
at at a nature level where where these

155
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,360
these chemicals are are helping living

156
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:15,918
things well that's exactly right there's

157
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:19,000
a increasing appreciation now uh that

158
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:23,519
these plant defense compounds also uh

159
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,478
extend uh towards effects on humans too

160
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,680
um there's a very interesting book by

161
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,879
Kennedy called plants in the human brain

162
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,840
that goes into these uh relationships in

163
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:37,800
in Greater depth but that that's it uh

164
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,839
some of these antioxidants that the

165
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,199
plant produces to prevent diseases have

166
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,839
the same kind of protective functions in

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,280
humans and uh this is the reason that a

168
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:52,079
highly varied plant diet uh seems to

169
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,638
help prevent aging help prevent cancer

170
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,560
and things of this

171
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,400
sort right on that's very interesting so

172
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,879
so today instead of talking about

173
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,120
necessarily about defending the plant

174
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,919
we're going to be talking about uh these

175
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,319
different phyto canabo effects on on our

176
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,639
humans and you know there's one um

177
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,319
there's a well there's a bunch of terms

178
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,038
that could be unfamiliar to folks that

179
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,720
we're going to run into today but but

180
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:16,038
one of them um that I ran into from

181
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,000
rereading the paper now because I

182
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:19,639
haven't read it in a couple years but um

183
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,879
before we get into the meat of the topic

184
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,280
I'd really appreciate if you would

185
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,479
explain the difference for folks be uh

186
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,439
the difference between an Agonist and an

187
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:30,120
antagonist because I feel we'll probably

188
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,719
using that quite a bit right well well

189
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,478
we have receptors on our cells uh

190
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,280
probably the place that's most familiar

191
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,240
to people would be in

192
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:40,959
neurotransmission and other words how

193
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,120
nerve cells communicate one to another

194
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:48,079
and it is a combination of chemical and

195
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:51,478
electrical transmission but receptors on

196
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:54,240
cells are things that help affect a

197
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:57,120
certain kind of reaction so we can think

198
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,478
of it as a lock and key model in fact

199
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:05,158
it's a lot more complicated than that

200
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:08,318
but an Agonist will be like a key uh

201
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:11,759
that fits in the lock and produces a

202
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,039
stimulation of a certain function an

203
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,960
antagonist goes in the opposite

204
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:21,680
direction it lowers the function um and

205
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:24,120
then we've got modifiers beyond that um

206
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,879
there are things called inverse Agonist

207
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,560
which despite the way it sounds uh

208
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,240
actually lower the overall activity so

209
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,038
they're like a super

210
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,599
antagonist uh but we'll we'll explain

211
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:39,360
these in context as they come up right

212
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,000
on so to to Really simplify it an

213
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,759
Agonist is more likely to increase the

214
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,839
effect and an antagonist is more likely

215
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:50,000
to decrease the effect that's quite

216
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,440
right great um uh another uh aspect that

217
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,720
you mentioned in the paper a few times

218
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,920
that I'd love to hear broken out before

219
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,320
we get into it is uh um Rafael mulan's

220
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,399
law of stinginess which I love the name

221
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,399
but um I had not heard that referred to

222
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,440
before so if you kind of explain that uh

223
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,958
example before we get into it sure what

224
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,320
he means is uh enzymes which are

225
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:15,319
Catalyst that uh help bring uh

226
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:18,160
reaction uh uh onward um may act on more

227
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,360
than one substrate a subst substrate is

228
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:26,958
a chemical that is turning into another

229
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,680
chemical um so for example uh there are

230
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,119
uh there are two basic kinds of

231
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:34,078
cannabinoids the propy with a five

232
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,600
carbon side chain I'm sorry propy with a

233
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:39,958
three carbon side chain and the Pentel

234
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,920
with a five carbon side chain um but

235
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:44,958
certain enzymes can work on both uh

236
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:47,479
there are other enzymes that aren't

237
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,919
following the law of stinginess that may

238
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,399
only work on one

239
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:56,159
compound so right on so so we're going

240
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,759
to jump into the first uh wave of

241
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,600
cannabinoids and and as I was telling

242
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,759
folks in the introduction you know we're

243
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,040
kind of going to go through them as a

244
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,759
list the way that you do in the paper uh

245
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:10,159
in in a couple of groups the first one

246
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:12,159
being uh the you know THC CBD and and

247
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,039
the ones that we're more uh familiar

248
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,559
with and then we'll move on to the tpin

249
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,480
then we'll talk about their applications

250
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,239
so I know that I know that we could do

251
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,959
an entire show just on THC but it is the

252
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,759
first uh canono that you go ahead and

253
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,719
explain so let's let's start there with

254
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:29,439
with the big elephant in the room so uh

255
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,079
if you would kind of review THC and how

256
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,760
relates to phyto canabo activity sure

257
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:37,599
well TC is probably the single chemical

258
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:40,600
most associated with cannabis and it is

259
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,320
the primary psychoactive ingredient in

260
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:48,278
other words um the uh compound that

261
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:51,560
makes people high uh but it has uh a lot

262
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:54,799
of very important medical effects uh as

263
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:55,719
an analgesic meaning a painkiller it's

264
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,559
an

265
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,519
anti-spasmodic it uh prevents spasms uh

266
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:05,879
it lowers muscle tones tone it is a

267
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,519
muscle relaxant That's the basis for its

268
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,679
use and treating

269
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,440
spasticity um muscle tone tightness that

270
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:15,239
occurs in multiple sclerosis and a

271
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,959
variety of other brain

272
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:24,320
diseases uh and that uh that benefit uh

273
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:27,638
has made uh satx which does contain THC

274
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,320
and approved drug in 27 countries just

275
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:33,320
not here in the

276
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,200
ask when I'm talking to patients one of

277
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,920
the examples that I give for how THC

278
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,839
actually decreases pain is I said you

279
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:44,838
know there's kind of uh there's two

280
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,040
paths to it uh the first path is um it's

281
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:49,000
uh you know

282
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:52,120
anti-inflammatory muscle relaxation and

283
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,839
general analgesic effect but then also

284
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,480
what I what I've gotten to started

285
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,120
calling uh cascading forgetfulness right

286
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,039
because we we we talk with cannabis

287
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,240
folks and you know you get a little high

288
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,278
and then you forget where you put your

289
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,200
keys and you go on doing other things

290
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:08,240
and you know that that kind of idea of

291
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,240
shortterm forgetting often has patients

292
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,799
forget that they're in pain it's also I

293
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,959
think why it works so well PTSD folks

294
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,039
because you just get distracted by life

295
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,399
and you get involved and and you forget

296
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,599
that you're in pain so I like to I like

297
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,799
to think about it having these two

298
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,639
different paths do you think that's a a

299
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,759
fair uh way to describe it yeah it sure

300
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,759
is because you've hit on uh two of the

301
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:33,519
key mechanisms one is a direct effect

302
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:36,439
against pain that works through complex

303
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,720
Pathways in the brain spinal cord and

304
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:43,000
nerves out in the body so that's one but

305
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,959
the other is the way it modulates the

306
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,639
emotional part of pain um and so yeah

307
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,319
part of it is distraction but

308
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,159
additionally there have been studies

309
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,440
that show that the emotional factor in

310
00:12:54,159 --> 00:13:00,679
pain is considerably reduced by

311
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:03,560
cannabinoids and specifically by DC so

312
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:06,319
that combination uh together is quite

313
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:09,559
powerful um and doing something that

314
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,240
other drugs just don't do you know I I

315
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,039
can't be the only one listening to you

316
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,039
talk right now feeling a little giddy to

317
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,078
be able to get information directly from

318
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,439
the source you know so many of us are

319
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:21,319
who are trying to learn about cannabis

320
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,639
we're getting our information from

321
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,440
secondary sources right and secondary

322
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,720
sources are not really as good as

323
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,440
hearing it right from you so so anyway

324
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,360
it's it's a real joy to actually hear it

325
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,079
in your own words so one more thing on

326
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,879
THC before we move on you know um you

327
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:41,039
know I'd love for you to review a little

328
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:44,480
bit you know THC you know in isolate is

329
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,919
not the magical thing right we we

330
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,600
understand the Entourage effect and I

331
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,559
talked a little bit about that in in the

332
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,759
introduction but would you talk about

333
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:55,078
the importance of of not using THC on

334
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:57,959
its own and that it needs the other

335
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,439
phyto canabo to be there with it right

336
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:03,518
well the easiest thing would be an

337
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,920
illustration THC as a single compound a

338
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,759
synthetic form was approved in the

339
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:12,198
United States in 1985 and that was to

340
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:17,199
treat nausea associated with

341
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:19,879
chemotherapy um but uh many people

342
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:22,679
tolerated it poorly almost no one liked

343
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:26,439
it uh the way that they might like

344
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:28,519
cannabis um and people who use both said

345
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,639
this really isn't like cannabis cannabis

346
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:33,959
works a lot lot better um that wasn't

347
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,759
something that everyone was prepared to

348
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:39,319
hear uh certainly the government had an

349
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,800
investment in the idea that well we've

350
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,519
given you access to THC you don't need

351
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:47,439
cannabis for medicinal purposes anymore

352
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,720
I can tell you that in my neurology

353
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,920
practice after um Marinol synthetic THC

354
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,839
was Downs scheduled in

355
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,599
1999 I used it pretty extensively for

356
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:03,600
the next four years in a iety of

357
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,600
contexts and it's u a very tricky drug

358
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,240
it's quite different to cannabis in that

359
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,959
it's likely to produce disphoria so

360
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,399
that's unhappiness as opposed to

361
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:16,119
Euphoria it's very

362
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:20,440
distracting uh it's very difficult to

363
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:23,639
control um and there's a very fine line

364
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,279
between a dose that might help symptoms

365
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,959
like reducing pain and that which

366
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:32,838
produces unwanted side effects like

367
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:36,439
raction or anxiety so in other words uh

368
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,720
THC as alone has what we call a very

369
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,639
narrow therapeutic

370
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,199
index now in contrast when there are

371
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,600
other ingredients aboard particularly

372
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:51,278
canaba or certain of the turpo

373
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,680
terpenoids um you get a great expansion

374
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:57,838
of that therapeutic index so that much

375
00:15:53,679 --> 00:16:00,799
more THC can be used to better effect

376
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,920
and with without so many Adverse Events

377
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,838
or side effects right on good so before

378
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,439
we move on to CBD let's let's talk

379
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,279
briefly about

380
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,519
thca which is the naturally occurring

381
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:15,799
acid form of THC now um I think most of

382
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:20,039
us know that to convert the naturally

383
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:23,198
forming thca into THC uh we need to add

384
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:25,799
some heat to uh DEC carboxilate it um

385
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:29,000
but but a lot of people are looking at

386
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:31,679
thca um for different therapeutic

387
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,399
effects than THC what what are the

388
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,838
different therapeutic effects between

389
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:39,360
the two right well they're quite

390
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,560
distinct in their activities thca is

391
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,360
considered non- psychoactive in other

392
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,000
words it doesn't produce the high that

393
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,240
we associate with

394
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,399
THC additionally it is it thca is also

395
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,360
an anti-inflammatory but through a

396
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:55,958
different

397
00:16:52,360 --> 00:17:00,318
mechanism um it affects a molecule

398
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:03,239
called uh uh tumor necr is Factor Alpha

399
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:05,879
that is important in certain autoimmune

400
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,359
diseases uh such as

401
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,679
Crohn's ulcer of colitis and rheumatoid

402
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:15,038
arthritis uh additionally and this one

403
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:19,120
needs a lot more work there seems to be

404
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:21,879
benefit in epilepsy TT uh can be helpful

405
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,838
in epilepsy too but uh there seems to be

406
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,840
a distinct mechanism um that really

407
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:31,240
hasn't been adequately explored yet so

408
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:34,079
despite raw cannabis having been used

409
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,400
medically for a long time throughout

410
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:42,038
history it just hasn't received uh the

411
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,640
research um that THC itself has uh so

412
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:46,279
it's it's a place where we need to learn

413
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,720
a lot more I'll mention one other thing

414
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:51,200
that it can do it seems to be very

415
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,240
powerful uh against certain tumors

416
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,080
particularly skin tumors um and so again

417
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,679
this is an area that really deserves

418
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:01,399
more research attention

419
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,840
so I know that we could probably do an

420
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,519
entire show just uh devoted to CBD as

421
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:11,879
well as we could with THC but let's go

422
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:15,079
ahead and review um um canabal uh and

423
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,400
and talk about um how it is uh so

424
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:20,720
helpful to the human body yeah well

425
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,798
there's this uh dichotomy that's

426
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,079
developed a lot of people tend to think

427
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:29,200
a canab dial is the good canabo where

428
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:32,720
THC is the bad canabo and I really

429
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,759
reject that uh both have their place

430
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:40,360
actually uh for most kinds of problems a

431
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:42,919
combination uh in other words uh using a

432
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:44,599
type of cannabis that contains both is

433
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:48,159
usually a distinct

434
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:51,199
Advantage but it's really fascinating

435
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:54,159
because canabidol uh being a different

436
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,798
molecule just by a little bit has quite

437
00:18:54,159 --> 00:19:01,559
distinct features some of its activities

438
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:04,279
are similar to THC and that both are

439
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:08,440
anti-inflammatory both are analgesic

440
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:12,960
painkillers but uh as compared to THC

441
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:15,279
kabid actually reduces anxiety uh it's

442
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,079
an antipsychotic in other words it's

443
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:23,319
been used in schizophrenia to treat uh

444
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:27,399
that disorder primarily um and um a

445
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:29,480
whole list of other uh properties beyond

446
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,919
that yeah well while we're on that let's

447
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,839
let's go ahead and plug the great

448
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:36,919
website at projectcbd.org

449
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,038
they've got a great uh page on their

450
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,159
website um you can click on the word

451
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,158
conditions on the website and it lists a

452
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,440
whole bunch of uh different human

453
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:48,640
ailments that that you might have and

454
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,720
you can click on any uh condition and uh

455
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,120
they will pull up for you the scientific

456
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,558
studies that are showing that uh the

457
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,079
different canab uh the different canono

458
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:00,279
uh the effect it can have whether you

459
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:02,960
have you know Parkinson's or or pain or

460
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,599
or asthma or anything so uh that's a

461
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,440
projectcbd.org

462
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:10,798
so so um so Ethan you know a lot of us

463
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:14,519
have heard of THC and CBD but there's

464
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:17,759
all these other cannabinoids is CBD so

465
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:20,079
popular because it is so unique from the

466
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,798
other cannabinoids or is it because it's

467
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:25,678
the first one to get extensive

468
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:30,038
research uh well a combination of of the

469
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:32,919
two but really uh if you ask me uh in my

470
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:36,640
experience as a physician and researcher

471
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:39,200
uh the single most versatile medicine uh

472
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,159
that I've ever encountered it would be

473
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,519
canaba there are at least 30 distinct

474
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:49,240
activities that it has so it is what's

475
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:52,679
often derisively termed a dirty drug

476
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,720
however a dirty drug may also be one

477
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,240
that works and the remarkable thing

478
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,120
about CBD is at the same time if he

479
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,519
asked me the safest drug the one with

480
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:06,199
the fewest side effects that I've ever

481
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,679
encountered it would also be

482
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,120
canaba uh because they're very few of

483
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,759
the things that it does even at very

484
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:16,319
high doses that are deleterious to to

485
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,519
the human body uh so it's really a

486
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:22,359
remarkable product and perhaps its

487
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:25,759
greatest uh attribute is that it's able

488
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:27,399
to modulate the endoc canabo system now

489
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,798
I know that you've discussed the endoc

490
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:34,159
canabo system your audience before but

491
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:36,960
just to to mention again it's a great

492
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,679
homeostatic regulator in other words it

493
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,480
brings various physiological systems in

494
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,360
the body back into balance and since

495
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,120
canabidol is a general stimulant to

496
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:52,319
endoc canabo tone it has the capability

497
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:55,519
of improving function in any of a

498
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:58,639
variety of areas uh of physiology that

499
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:01,000
might be deranged so if there's pain at

500
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,200
helps with that uh if there's too much

501
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,960
activity in the gut it will reduce it if

502
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,880
there's too little it will increase it

503
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:12,919
uh so it has a sort of buffering effect

504
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,880
to bring uh physiology back into balance

505
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,919
that's great I think that in uh Chinese

506
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,679
medicine they call that a tonifier it

507
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:22,080
brings brings you back to the neutral to

508
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:24,960
the center well that's exactly uh great

509
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,278
a great analogy there sure right on so

510
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,120
we're going to take a short break and be

511
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,919
right back you are listening to shaping

512
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:33,119
fire and my guest this week is Dr Ethan

513
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,640
Russo now that the health benefits of

514
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,798
tpin have become well known in the

515
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,880
Cannabis industry people everywhere are

516
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:41,079
looking for the purest tpin without

517
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,760
adulterant the problem with most tpine

518
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:44,519
providers is that they're not sourced

519
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:46,720
naturally and instead are made as a

520
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,519
byproduct of refining petroleum and

521
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,720
that's so sketchy the tpin sold by true

522
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:55,000
tpin are entirely different they are

523
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,480
certified organic non-GMO and food grade

524
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,038
that means that they are extracted from

525
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,400
real plant sources there're no solvents

526
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,679
of any kind they are distilled only with

527
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,880
steam that's right only steam in fact

528
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,080
tpin from True turpins are so pure that

529
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,480
you can eat them not only that but you

530
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:13,678
can stack them with better results too

531
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,880
what I mean is other companies turpins

532
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,720
have got a few percent of impurities and

533
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,760
when you stack those tpin to make your

534
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,519
blend you're adding a variety of

535
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,200
impurities that degrade your final

536
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,079
product true turpins also have strain

537
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,600

week's newsletter welcome back you are

561
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,600
listening to shaping fire and I am your

562
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:27,759
host Shango Los my guest this week is

563
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:30,879
world renowned cannabis researcher and

564
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:35,079
neurologist Dr Ethan Russo so before the

565
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,000
break we hit the two biggies THC and CBD

566
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:39,240
and so we're going to continue down the

567
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,759
list of the other phyto canabo that are

568
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,278
mentioned in your famous taming THC

569
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:48,119
paper and we're going to start with one

570
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:50,798
of the very rarely talked about ones CBC

571
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:53,119
what can you tell us about CBC well this

572
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:56,158
is one that uh needs a lot more work and

573
00:24:53,119 --> 00:25:00,158
a lot more attention part of the problem

574
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:04,000
is uh that canab chroming is formed by a

575
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:07,520
recessive gene uh in contrast to THC and

576
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,240
CBD where the pathways are from dominant

577
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,759
genes so it's a bit of a rarer bird in

578
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,759
most uh

579
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:19,398
commercially available forms of cannabis

580
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:22,599
um additionally it has a feature of

581
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:26,239
being a little more prominent in uh

582
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:29,000
immature plants so uh if people wait

583
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,319
until maturity there's going to be less

584
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,960
CBC um but uh one of my colleagues from

585
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:39,759
GW Pharmaceuticals David Potter um used

586
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,000
young plants to to make what he called

587
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:46,319
an enriched Tricom product which is

588
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,839
another way of saying hash uh he made

589
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:52,798
this with young plants that did show uh

590
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,519
a predilection towards making um more

591
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,879
canaba chromin

592
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:58,798
CBC uh and was able to get a good

593
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,240
concentration that way

594
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:05,079
unfortunately it it's never been used in

595
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:09,399
a clinical trial yet despite uh having

596
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:12,678
great promise uh on its own when you say

597
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:14,879
uh it it appears most in young plants uh

598
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,840
you're meaning young plants that are

599
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,880
early in the bloom right so that they're

600
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:20,839
forming tricomes as part of the blooming

601
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,880
cycle or do you mean young as in they're

602
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:25,038
still in

603
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,840
veg uh well it'd be during the flowering

604
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:30,440
phase as with the other cannabinoids uh

605
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,959
greatest production is going to be in

606
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,000
the capitate glandular tricomes that

607
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,440
appear in the unfertilized female

608
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,759
flowers it would just be earlier in the

609
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,159
flowering cycle as you mentioned right

610
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,519
on I just wanted to make a difference

611
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:45,640
between that and something like uh can

612
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,398
of flaven right which is actually in a

613
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,399
young plant but also early in the veg

614
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:53,398
stage if I understand it correctly sure

615
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:54,839
even in the Sprouts right on fantastic

616
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:58,319
um so sounds like we definitely need

617
00:26:54,839 --> 00:27:02,759
more research into CBC and since it's um

618
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:05,519
um uh a less common one aggressive

619
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:08,798
breeders could start focusing on on on

620
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:12,119
hybridizing for more CBC sure there'd be

621
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:16,918
an advantage because uh as CBD is an

622
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:18,000
endoc canab noid uh uh modulator uh so

623
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,960
too is

624
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,159
CBC uh CBC is also

625
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,240
anti-inflammatory uh it's very active

626
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:29,320
against uh variety of cancer cell lines

627
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,558
so it it shows a lot of prom

628
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:35,038
great great so so I've heard of CBG a

629
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:36,879
little more often and there are um many

630
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:40,240
Labs that are are able to start testing

631
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,640
for it uh why do we care about CBG well

632
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,558
uh it's sort of the parent molecule uh

633
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,519
to the other phyto cannabinoids so that

634
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:51,440
alone makes it important normally in the

635
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:55,919
plant it doesn't stop there it uh goes

636
00:27:51,440 --> 00:28:01,320
onward to either THC CBD or CBC or the

637
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:03,720
propyl uh cannabinoids um but um again

638
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:07,278
uh there have been plants bred in

639
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,360
England uh that quit uh at CBG they

640
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:12,759
don't have the enzymatic equipment due

641
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:16,959
to a mutation to go beyond it and so in

642
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:18,440
those plants 100% of the canabo would be

643
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,278
as

644
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,880
canaberal so canaberal um again is one

645
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:27,278
I'm excited about uh for the future

646
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,720
because again this hasn't been used in

647
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:33,359
human clinical trials uh but it it uh

648
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,200
has very interesting properties uh it

649
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:39,759
seems to be a very strong anti-anxiety

650
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,519
agent without being sedating um most of

651
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:46,278
the drugs that are used that way in

652
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:49,000
humans like the benzo aines Valium Etc

653
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:51,880
um are not only sedating but addictive

654
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,319
and uh this is quite different to what

655
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:58,240
we see with CBG there's no indication uh

656
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:00,439
that it would be addictive at all uh dis

657
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,720
Al it has some muscle relaxing

658
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:07,840
properties um it uh interestingly is a

659
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,960
strong uh antibiotic or disinfectant one

660
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:12,839
of the things it does is it works

661
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:16,558
against Mera uh that's multiply

662
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:19,319
resistant stafl coic orius uh one of

663
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:22,798
those Hospital acquired infections that

664
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:27,000
uh was rampant um throughout the us a

665
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:29,839
few years ago on poses a real risk for

666
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,558
hospitalized patient that might be quite

667
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:36,319
ill so if if CBG is kind of a a parent

668
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:38,759
canabo does that mean that when it

669
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:42,439
degrades with time or light that it

670
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:45,519
could uh degrade into a different canabo

671
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:49,360
uh no not unless the plant is alive to

672
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:53,319
provide the enzymes to do it again uh

673
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:55,599
usually in the plant Machinery of canabo

674
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:58,918
production it just doesn't stop there it

675
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:02,359
goes on through uh to the next next uh

676
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:05,159
item and so usually CBG doesn't

677
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:06,240
accumulate uh in great amounts in a

678
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:11,440
given

679
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,399
plant right on you know earlier in um uh

680
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,880
2016 uh

681
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:18,119
thcv uh was all through the media

682
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:22,000
because people started talking about its

683
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:24,319
uh appetite suppression um attributes

684
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,640
and and you know supposedly uh some of

685
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,678
the forms of Blue Dream are heavy in it

686
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,320
and and people love the idea that you

687
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:35,240
could um use Canabis but also not get

688
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:38,439
the munchies um you know how how how how

689
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,000
effective is thcv to actually suppress

690
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,679
the appetite does it do it a little bit

691
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,798
or does it really not give you the

692
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,919
munchies uh well in in pure form which

693
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:50,359
would not be accessible to people it's

694
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:53,559
it's quite prominent uh in its appetite

695
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:56,519
suppression uh effects without a speedy

696
00:30:53,558 --> 00:31:00,440
effect that one would get say from an

697
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:05,159
amphetamine so this is quite distinct um

698
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:07,919
the trouble is in cannabis uh that's

699
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:10,440
available in Commerce in North America

700
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,519
usually the amount of tetra Hydra

701
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:17,840
canaban or thcv is quite quite low uh

702
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,278
but again in England uh there is a plant

703
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,240
uh where over

704
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,159
90% uh of the cannabinoids are expressed

705
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,240
as

706
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:29,679
thcv um so that one has been used in

707
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,079
humans and it has the added benefit of

708
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,320
being a pretty good

709
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:38,199
anti-convulsant A drug for seizures it's

710
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:40,558
beyond the appetite suppressant part it

711
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,480
seems to be helpful in the metabolic

712
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:46,000
syndrome so this would be the problems

713
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,639
that people get into if they're diabetic

714
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,359
or

715
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:52,359
pre-diabetic so you know what you just

716
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:55,119
said there was pretty heavy duty the

717
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:58,000
fact that the the commercially available

718
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:02,079
cannabis strains that have thcv don't

719
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,319
really have enough in it to to truly

720
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:05,879
suppress the appetite so so taking that

721
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,200
to the extreme end and talking about the

722
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:12,159
example that you gave from the UK where

723
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:15,120
it's 90% is you know if if you ingested

724
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,519
that strain would it actually suppress

725
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:20,678
the appetite or does it just make a

726
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,759
really good Target for extraction to

727
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:26,480
extract thcv out of it to then apply

728
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:29,558
that to the patient um no that

729
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,960
particular plan uh when it's extracted

730
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:35,480
even with a little bit of THC in it uh

731
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,200
does have the benefits that I mentioned

732
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:41,120
uh the point is though that uh at least

733
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,240
in the US we're not there yet in terms

734
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:47,439
of

735
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:50,638
optimizing um thcv kavars um the

736
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,480
available ones may produce less of the

737
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:54,839
munchies but they're not going to have

738
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,599
all of the attributes uh that we

739
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,480
mentioned that have been seen with the

740
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:02,199
extracts that have been used

741
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:06,440
in clinical trials so far right on so in

742
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:08,558
your paper uh taming THC after thcv you

743
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,880
move to

744
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:15,960
cbdv right well this one also has just

745
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:20,639
started uh in human use so this is the

746
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,840
um corresponding agent to CBD so as THC

747
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:28,558
is to

748
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:32,439
thcv cbdv is to as is as to CBD

749
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:35,200
um so uh this is looks like CBD but it's

750
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,240
got a three carbon side chain instead of

751
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,319
five and it's being investigated for

752
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,399
seizures of partial onset what used to

753
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:47,879
be called focal seizures um there seems

754
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:51,038
to be a good signal there um I really

755
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:54,360
couldn't say a lot more about uh how it

756
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:56,200
affects people yet uh except that it it

757
00:33:54,359 --> 00:34:00,119
appears to be non-

758
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,679
intoxicating um appears to be quite safe

759
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:05,398
uh in the experiments that have been

760
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,639
done so far in the last year uh we've

761
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:11,960
seen a lot of new products coming out

762
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:13,878
that are um uh supplemented with CBN and

763
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,838
uh most of them are uh people are saying

764
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:18,480
well CBN totally helps you sleep and so

765
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:19,838
and so they'll take their product you

766
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,480
know an edible or something and they'll

767
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:26,119
they'll add CBN to it uh do you think

768
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,679
that CBN will have that kind of effect

769
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:33,720
when supplemented into edible

770
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:37,280
uh I'm not a proponent of spiking things

771
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:40,519
uh in that manner um my personal bias is

772
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,079
that uh with uh time and attention and

773
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:46,639
proper selective breeding uh you can get

774
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:49,519
the effects you want uh from a g given

775
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,000
cannabis kovar without uh needing to add

776
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:55,159
anything to it additionally there's some

777
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,559
misconceptions about canab andol or

778
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:02,960
CBN um as a pure compound it really is

779
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:05,880
not very sedating uh it is THC like but

780
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:11,400
about a quarter of the potency uh the

781
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:14,880
confusion may arise because CBN is an uh

782
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,838
non-enzymatic breakdown product of THC

783
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,800
in other words in old cannabis it will

784
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:25,799
oxidize from THC into

785
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:28,039
CBN um at the same time you get a l loss

786
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,400
of the monoterpenoids

787
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:34,358
and you get remaining some of the higher

788
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:38,358
molecular weight sesquiterpenoids that

789
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:41,239
tend to be sedating and so old cannabis

790
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:44,679
tends to be soporific that's a medical

791
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:49,039
ease for uh saying that it makes you

792
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:51,719
sleep uh but the CBN uh itself is not

793
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,159
strongly sedating I was going to save

794
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:54,719
this for the next section when we talk

795
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:56,239
about terpenoids but let's talk about it

796
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,239
right now would you explain the

797
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:02,358
difference between monot turp oids and

798
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:06,838
CES to terpenoids sure um terpenoids are

799
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:10,279
built up of uh five carbon blocks the

800
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:13,639
so-called monoterpenoids have 10 carbons

801
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,680
the CES terpenoids have 15 the

802
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:19,519
diterpenoids have 20 and the

803
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:24,519
triterpenoids have 30 carbons so that

804
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:26,519
that's it and uh turpine means um

805
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:28,119
there's confusion about these terms but

806
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:31,358
a turpenoid

807
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:35,039
uh as a broader term and would include

808
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:38,119
um agents that uh have oxygen in them or

809
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:41,838
occasionally other molecules a tpine

810
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:44,318
strictly speaking is has just carbon and

811
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:47,239
hydrogen right on so what one more thing

812
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:49,838
on CBN before we move on to to the group

813
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:52,838
of terpenoids you know it's it's common

814
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:55,519
said amongst uh Canabis folk that say

815
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:58,559
for example oh I've I've got this flower

816
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:01,838
left over from last Summer's grow

817
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,920
um it's all CBN now if you smoke it

818
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:06,639
you'll just get couch lock and fall

819
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,680
asleep and and you know while that's you

820
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,920
know kind of a rule of thumb uh you

821
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:13,559
mentioning that CBN is not really all

822
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,760
that sedative um is there is there truth

823
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:18,480
to the rule of thumb that I just uh

824
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,599
explained or is that is that more myth

825
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,599
well the phenomenology in other words

826
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:25,200
the description you gave is probably

827
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,960
accurate a lot of older cannabis is

828
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,598
going to be sedating uh it won't be

829
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,559
stimulating

830
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:37,838
necessarily um a lot of people find it

831
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:40,358
less uh attractive um but again it would

832
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,719
be from the sedative influences of the

833
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:44,759
remaining

834
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:47,078
turpenoid right on so so most of us know

835
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,680
that terpenoids are the smell of the

836
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:51,359
plant now the aroma therapy if you will

837
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,078
would you explain what exactly a

838
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:56,318
turpenoid is and why the plant bothers

839
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,400
to produce them sure well these are

840
00:37:56,318 --> 00:38:02,239
produced in the glandular tricomes along

841
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:05,680
with the cannabinoids and again these

842
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:08,318
are molecules that the plant makes uh

843
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:11,118
often in its defense some of these are

844
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:14,039
insect repellants or

845
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:18,160
insecticides others actually attract

846
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:20,880
certain desirable bugs um and they're

847
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:25,000
often antioxidants and

848
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:29,000
antibiotics uh but again um we can

849
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,639
leverage uh what the plant has done uh

850
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,119
to help our own

851
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:37,920
ailments I I know that when I'm shopping

852
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:40,318
for cannabis I usually shop with my nose

853
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,159
I mean obviously I I I I've like bag

854
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,199
appeal as much as anybody does but

855
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:46,399
really you know we're we're opening jars

856
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:49,279
we're sticking our nose in there and

857
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,318
when our body has this reaction of yeah

858
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,000
I want more of this you know we go ahead

859
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:57,440
and choose that strain is there any um

860
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,318
support or truth to the fact that our

861
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,200
our body when smelling specific

862
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:05,400
terpenoids knows what its needs and so

863
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,799
our body is self- selecting for the

864
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,079
medicine that's best for us then uh May

865
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,960
well be um you know it's a hard thing to

866
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:17,560
measure I can say this the situation

867
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,199
that you describe is quite accurate uh

868
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:24,559
Michelle sexon uh naturopath uh who's

869
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:26,799
investigated this looked at uh patient

870
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,880
preferences in Washington state and the

871
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,920
number one

872
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,640
Criterion for selection of a particular

873
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,519
cannabis chovar was it

874
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:37,358
smell yeah that does that doesn't

875
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:39,960
surprise me at all and you know what's

876
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:43,078
interesting too is how

877
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,039
how uh strains that have got wildly

878
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,039
different smells can I can be attracted

879
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:50,838
to both I can I can smell something

880
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:52,920
that's you know really foul and skunky

881
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:55,440
and smells like a baby diaper like

882
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,079
perhaps um you know like a funky cheese

883
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,720
and I'm like oh I really need some of

884
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,880
that and then I'll smell you know uh

885
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:03,959
some some Lemon Diesel with a really

886
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,800
bright Citrus smell I'm like oh I want

887
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:10,000
that too um it's interesting how we can

888
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,359
be you know our human can be attracted

889
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,519
to a variety of tpin that are very much

890
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:18,279
unlike each other well as they say

891
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:21,960
variety is the spice of

892
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:24,839
life so so um you know are terpenoids

893
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,519
from Cannabis and food and other sources

894
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:30,400
the same do they have the same effect

895
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:34,159
regardless of of where they're from when

896
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,838
they're in isolate yeah in general yes

897
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:39,879
um there are no terpenoids that we know

898
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:42,318
of that appear only in cannabis there's

899
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,358
certain profiles that are characteristic

900
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:48,480
but these are part of everyday life um

901
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,960
if you're eating Citrus you you're

902
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:55,358
exposed if you take a walk in a forest

903
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,358
you're exposed to pining um so they if

904
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:01,920
you have a plant-based diet you're

905
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:05,519
exposed to these um but the key thing is

906
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,559
how they synergize with THC and other

907
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:11,039
canono um this is the real difference so

908
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:14,799
if the question were will exposure to

909
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:17,719
terpenoids from food exert benefits yes

910
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,599
I believe that they do uh it's just that

911
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:23,519
um in terms of the experience one has

912
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:25,920
with cannabis uh they're really

913
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,119
fundamental uh to the differences that

914
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,960
one experiences

915
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:33,519
uh one chovar to

916
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,199
another so one more question before we

917
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,719
go to uh to our next commercial you know

918
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:39,480
uh one of the things that really caught

919
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:41,480
me off guard reading in your paper you

920
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,800
say that you know the terpenoids

921
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,559
increase with intensity of light but

922
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,960
decrease with soil fertility and that

923
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:50,719
that really kept caught me off guard

924
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,440
because most of the Growers I know are

925
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:58,598
trying to make a very ferti living soil

926
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:01,800
to help the turps uh develop why is it

927
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:04,920
true that a decreased soil fertility

928
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:07,680
will increase terpenoids sure well first

929
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,480
off um the rich soil at the beginning is

930
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:12,279
great but um depletion of the soil

931
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,599
towards the end seems to help the

932
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:18,720
turboid and this shouldn't be a big

933
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:22,760
surprise if we consider that our herbs

934
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:25,879
uh or lavender uh grow best in a sandy

935
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:29,000
soil uh where environmental conditions

936
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,920
are a little rough uh keep in mind that

937
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
the terpenoids are plant defense

938
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,159
compounds and uh so if the environment

939
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,440
is a little more difficult uh your

940
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:44,440
teranoid production is going to increase

941
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:48,440
um for uh people growing cannabis um

942
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:50,400
having a little uh less water uh and a

943
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,679
lot less nutrients towards the end of

944
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,000
the flowering cycle are going to uh

945
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:57,679
produce the same kind of effect uh it's

946
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,480
specifically you know that we've got all

947
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:02,519
the Growers attention um when would you

948
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,358
decrease the nutrients and water to get

949
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:07,480
that effect how many weeks in oh I I

950
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:10,799
can't tell you that exactly I'm sure

951
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,679
there people who know but um I'm I'm not

952
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,039
sure off the top right on that's fair

953
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:15,759
enough so we're going to take another

954
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:17,639
short break and be right back you are

955
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,680
listening to shaping fire and my guest

cannabis oil ensuring a product is whole

980

983

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,960

host Shango Los my guest this week is

1020
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:53,879
world-renowned cannabis researcher and

1021
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:56,359
neurologist Dr Ethan Russo so before the

1022
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,200
break we kind of set up the terpenoids

1023
00:45:56,358 --> 00:45:59,838
and talked about about what they are as

1024
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:01,759
a group and and kind of what their

1025
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:04,000
attributes are so for this section we're

1026
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,480
going to go through the very specific

1027
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,838
terpenoids that you talk about in your

1028
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,719
uh groundbreaking paper uh taming THC so

1029
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:14,239
let's start with D

1030
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:16,239
limonene yes my

1031
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:17,558
favorite I guess it's good to have a

1032
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:20,558
favorite I

1033
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:22,400
guess yeah U Lyon is a really

1034
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,760
fascinating compound and it's pretty

1035
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,200
ubiquitous and unfortunately the place

1036
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:30,079
you're most likely to run into it is

1037
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:32,679
walking down the detergent aisle at the

1038
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:38,599
supermarket

1039
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:42,399
um two our senses um the scent of lemon

1040
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:45,000
or Citrus uh denotes cleanliness or

1041
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,318
healthiness uh so there's a reason it's

1042
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,679
it's there that way it not only makes an

1043
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:53,960
efficient cleaning agent uh but it has a

1044
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:57,799
strong psychological effect um one of

1045
00:46:53,960 --> 00:47:00,838
brightness cleanliness and improve mood

1046
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:03,800
and that's exactly what lying uh will

1047
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:07,279
produce when it's there in a significant

1048
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,480
amount along uh with the

1049
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,200
cannabinoids I tell people who are

1050
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,719
unfamiliar with tpin that if they if

1051
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:16,318
they want to have the experience of

1052
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:18,919
lioning to just you know simply cut a

1053
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:21,318
piece of citrus fruit like a lemon and

1054
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:24,838
you smell it and suddenly you feel uh

1055
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:27,318
motivated and happy and um and you know

1056
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:29,639
full of sunshine and joy and that is

1057
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:33,358
that that is the tpin having a direct

1058
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:35,558
effect on you um when you when you cut a

1059
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:38,880
lemon is that lioning and then when you

1060
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:40,359
cut an orange that citrine uh no they're

1061
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,480
both primarily

1062
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:45,639
lanine uh the difference between the

1063
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,960
various citrus fruits uh almost all of

1064
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:51,400
them have very high percentage of

1065
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:54,559
lemoning in the Rind uh you know if you

1066
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:58,480
take your thumbnail across the Rind of a

1067
00:47:54,559 --> 00:48:01,000
citrus you're releasing uh Tri ioms and

1068
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:06,159
lyine uh the differences in the smells

1069
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:09,280
and tastes come from uh much uh lower

1070
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:11,519
concentration uh factors other uh other

1071
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,119
terpenoids that are distinct from one

1072
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:17,838
another in the various kinds of citrus

1073
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:21,079
that certainly uh kind of explains why

1074
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:23,318
so many cocktails are served with a uh

1075
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:25,680
with a Twist right because as you're

1076
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:27,838
bringing the cocktail up to your nose uh

1077
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:30,159
you're getting this hit loning that's

1078
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:32,000
making you feel joyous as you're

1079
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:35,078
enjoying the cocktail and and no wonder

1080
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,920
we like it sure so the the next one that

1081
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:43,839
you cover in the P paper is uh beta

1082
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:47,599
Meine right um Meine uh is the most

1083
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:50,440
prevalent uh turpenoid in most available

1084
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,640
Kars of cannabis uh to me that's

1085
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,519
unfortunate certainly there people that

1086
00:48:52,639 --> 00:49:00,838
prefer it uh but it has a strongly

1087
00:48:55,519 --> 00:49:03,679
sedating Nar otic like effect um and so

1088
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:06,480
if there's a kind of cannabis that uh

1089
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:09,440
makes people unable to move what's

1090
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,960
commonly termed couch lock uh it's

1091
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:15,679
likely that uh it's due to a high Ming

1092
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,318
content um so that's not always an

1093
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:22,480
advantage if someone needs to sleep or

1094
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:25,558
needs to relax uh certainly it can be um

1095
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,599
on the plus side mercine does have

1096
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:30,480
analgesic pink killing properties on a

1097
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:33,960
variety of other properties that can be

1098
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,679
beneficial but in general there's a lot

1099
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:40,079
of it out there and maybe more than is

1100
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:42,879
needed for optimal effect uh certainly

1101
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:45,480
for people after work or study uh it's

1102
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,680
usually not an advantage to have a high

1103
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,280
concentration of

1104
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:51,919
merine so it would be remiss if we

1105
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,240
didn't touch on mangoes here for a

1106
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,318
moment because a lot of people say that

1107
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:59,199
you know if you if you want to enjoy

1108
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:01,239
your cannabis especially well go ahead

1109
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:04,399
and eat a mango before it because the

1110
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:06,679
mirene uh improves the experience of the

1111
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,838
Cannabis how much of that is myth and

1112
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:11,598
how much of that is real Mostly myth um

1113
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:14,358
there's actually a paper that was done

1114
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,599
on the uh the turpenoid content of

1115
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:19,679
mangoes and it varies from being a fair

1116
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:20,400
amount to some where there's almost none

1117
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:22,598
uh

1118
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:27,000
additionally a lot of people will say

1119
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:29,640
that mercing helps uh to get THC across

1120
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,920
the bloodb brain barrier uh well

1121
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:35,400
normally THC has no problem getting

1122
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,400
across the bloodb brain barrier uh both

1123
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,519
of these compounds are what we call

1124
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,559
lipophilic Fat loving and they all go

1125
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:45,960
right into the brain without any

1126
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,599
difficulty um so uh I think mangoes are

1127
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,838
really healthy and people should eat

1128
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,160
them because they want to or enjoy it

1129
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:54,798
but um I think the likelihood that

1130
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:57,480
that's going to have a material effect

1131
00:50:54,798 --> 00:51:00,519
uh on their um exper erience is is

1132
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:02,199
pretty low right on well said well let's

1133
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:04,239
talk about one of my favorites Alpha

1134
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:06,919
pining you know uh when I one of the

1135
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:09,519
first times that I I heard you speak it

1136
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:11,639
really impressed me that you know I love

1137
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:13,639
walking in the forest I love that Nordic

1138
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:17,358
term to take a maybe it's a Japanese

1139
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:20,159
term anyway to take a forest bath to go

1140
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:21,639
I I love that idea and uh and and you

1141
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:23,199
were explaining how you know when you go

1142
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:24,838
into the forest and you're around these

1143
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:27,039
pine trees and it's get they're it's

1144
00:51:24,838 --> 00:51:28,838
they're giving off pining and you know

1145
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:31,440
you take a big breath and you fill your

1146
00:51:28,838 --> 00:51:32,599
lung sacks and you're like H the forest

1147
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,599
and actually what you're getting is a

1148
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:40,798
big hit of pining right yes it is yeah

1149
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:44,680
so uh shinrin Yoku or Forest bathing is

1150
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:49,079
uh just the act of walking in a a forest

1151
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:51,039
uh in Japan um and you know a lot of

1152
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:52,920
people if they've had a difficult work

1153
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,679
day they want to clear their head that's

1154
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,838
exactly what they'll do particularly in

1155
00:51:54,679 --> 00:52:01,159
the Pacific Northwest is take a a walk

1156
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:03,599
in a Pine Forest or in our instance it's

1157
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:06,239
going to be other conifers but they're

1158
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:10,838
all rich in pining so the effect on

1159
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:14,039
one's mood is going to be the same um

1160
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:17,719
but uh it goes further than that uh

1161
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:20,279
unfortunately pining is less common in

1162
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:24,318
modern choar of cannabis it's sort of

1163
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:28,760
been shoved aside by mercing if you will

1164
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:31,039
um but in kovar that have it uh the end

1165
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,559
result is an experience that's much

1166
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:36,318
clearer without the confusion and the

1167
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:38,480
short-term memory that people often

1168
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:42,000
equate uh with

1169
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:45,599
THC um clearly THC does produce

1170
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,519
impairment of short-term memory uh but

1171
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:51,400
pining is what's called a colon esterase

1172
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:54,119
inhibitor uh it inhibits the breakdown

1173
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:57,680
of acetycholine which is the main memory

1174
00:52:54,119 --> 00:53:01,240
molecule on the brain um it reverses

1175
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:04,480
this effect that THC has and uh

1176
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:06,598
particularly for a patient uh who needs

1177
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,240
canabus having

1178
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:12,798
pinene uh in the kovar that they're

1179
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:15,479
using is much more likely

1180
00:53:12,798 --> 00:53:17,159
uh if they use it it' be much more

1181
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:20,199
likely that they'll be able to work or

1182
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:23,598
study without uh the impairment that can

1183
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:26,159
come in uh if there's too much THC or if

1184
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:29,119
there's too much sedation from merine

1185
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:31,639
for example I see so something with a

1186
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,798
lot of pining would be really good for

1187
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:36,078
for daytime because you can be more

1188
00:53:33,798 --> 00:53:38,519
productive and a little more focused and

1189
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:41,839
and have more likelihood to stay on task

1190
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:45,480
right and again um I I'd emphasize that

1191
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:47,679
a lot of this is subject to uh people's

1192
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,159
preferences um there's some people that

1193
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:54,358
love the mercing couch lock lock effect

1194
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:58,078
and others really dislike it um so taste

1195
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:59,318
does taste comes into this and a big way

1196
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,720
yeah I'm I'm actually one of those

1197
00:53:59,318 --> 00:54:05,199
people that loves Mir SC uh you know I

1198
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:07,279
can I can enjoy the the most couch loia

1199
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,759
strains and still have a good time of it

1200
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,240
because I tend to run really hot and

1201
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,079
fast anyway I generally stay away from

1202
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:17,039
sativas just because they they tend to

1203
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,079
over amp me um and and that's you know

1204
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:20,318
one of the important parts of

1205
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:23,200
individualized medicine right where

1206
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:25,880
where not one one size does not fit all

1207
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:27,358
and and and when people are originally

1208
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,720
getting in cannabis they should take

1209
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:31,920
some time to sample a wide variety of

1210
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:33,959
strains so that they can taste a lot of

1211
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,280
these different terpenoids and find out

1212
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,480
the one that their human enjoys the most

1213
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,519
ah sure and again I'd extend that to

1214
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,599
therapeutic applications the one that's

1215
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:47,280
going to give them the best uh benefits

1216
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:50,640
on their symptoms and produce the fewest

1217
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,200
side effects am I correct that linol the

1218
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:54,440
next turpenoid we're going to talk about

1219
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:56,759
is pretty heavy in lavender and is one

1220
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,960
of the aspects that makes us feel so Cal

1221
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,960
when we smell it or use a lavender eye

1222
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,639
pillow yeah that's exactly right uh

1223
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:07,599
pretty remarkable compound in addition

1224
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:10,639
to having those anti-anxiety effects uh

1225
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:13,400
can Aid sleep uh it's a very strong

1226
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:16,239
local anesthetic uh one of the things I

1227
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,039
always like to talk about is uh people

1228
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:20,838
should keep a bottle of lavender

1229
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:22,480
essential oil uh in the fridge in the

1230
00:55:20,838 --> 00:55:25,960
kitchen because if you get a kitchen

1231
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:29,280
burn and put the lavender oil on neat

1232
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:31,798
and cover it with a an ice cube uh the

1233
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,839
pain will generally go away in a few

1234
00:55:31,798 --> 00:55:39,119
minutes and uh almost never blister is

1235
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:40,798
it too um is it too intense straight

1236
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,358
would you need to thin it out with

1237
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:44,440
something you know how some some

1238
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:47,038
essential oils will burn the skin right

1239
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:49,920
now it's a good point but lavender uh

1240
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:54,079
oil is safe to use neat undiluted on the

1241
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:56,119
skin right on so um our next One beta uh

1242
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:59,440
kopine I had a really cool experience

1243
00:55:56,119 --> 00:56:02,358
with a couple weeks ago uh I was down in

1244
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:04,440
Soma County for Emerald cup and uh I was

1245
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:06,838
staying at a house with a with a whole

1246
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,079
bunch of uh cannabis business owners we

1247
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:11,078
kind of just split this this this Wine

1248
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:14,880
Country Villa it was pretty great and I

1249
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:17,160
met uh Ben cassaday from true tping and

1250
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,079
and he he was going around the house and

1251
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:22,239
and giving people some beta cophine in

1252
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:24,480
their hands and then and then he was

1253
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:27,279
encouraging us to cup our hands to our

1254
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,079
face and it had a faint smell of of

1255
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,119
black pepper but the thing that was

1256
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:34,519
remarkable was how incredibly calming it

1257
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:37,079
was and I had never really considered

1258
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:39,400
dosing myself with Tarpin in such a

1259
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:41,640
simple and elegant way as to just put a

1260
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,880
little bit in in my palm and then cup it

1261
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:47,598
to my nose sure well you know it's a

1262
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,599
direct Pathway to the brain it's

1263
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,798
interesting um this is something we need

1264
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:55,160
to explore more um because generally

1265
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:58,599
kopling is considered quote non-

1266
00:56:55,159 --> 00:57:02,000
psychoactive un quote but um certainly

1267
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:05,480
it has uh powerful anti-inflammatory

1268
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,358
effects and in a situation where someone

1269
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,480
had inflammation for any reason uh

1270
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:13,038
particularly in the brain it's uh very

1271
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:16,199
likely going to be therapeutic and that

1272
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:19,559
could manifest itself in a change of

1273
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:23,038
mood certainly um but it's really

1274
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:25,798
remarkable because uh kopine which is a

1275
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:29,119
sesquiterpenoid in other words 15 carbon

1276
00:57:25,798 --> 00:57:34,280
mole Ule it's not just a turpenoid it's

1277
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:38,358
a canabo too uh it is a strong Agonist

1278
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:40,680
uh stimulator at the CB2 receptor that

1279
00:57:38,358 --> 00:57:43,960
is the cannabinoid receptor that's non

1280
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:47,399
psychoactive and uh is important out in

1281
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:49,199
the body and potentially in the brain um

1282
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,760
for pain and

1283
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:54,118
inflammation uh so this is a fascinating

1284
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,359
agent and it's it's common in our diets

1285
00:57:54,119 --> 00:58:00,440
you mentioned black pepper that's the

1286
00:57:56,358 --> 00:58:03,798
most accessible Source but um there are

1287
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:06,639
other uh good examples like Copa Balsam

1288
00:58:03,798 --> 00:58:10,798
which has been used in South America uh

1289
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:14,279
to treat uh inflammation sprains and uh

1290
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:17,159
skin conditions uh for Generations by

1291
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:19,400
indigenous people long before we knew

1292
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:23,358
anything about the chemicals in

1293
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:25,318
it which is primarily carry off Lan you

1294
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:27,880
know um I I kind of think that we need

1295
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:30,239
an expanded vocabulary because that idea

1296
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,000
of being psychoactive or not you know a

1297
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:34,838
lot of people are talking about THC

1298
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,039
being psychoactive and CBD being non-

1299
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:39,358
psychoactive and but and then you know

1300
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:42,640
beta kopine not being psychoactive but I

1301
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:44,880
know that when I smelled it in my Palms

1302
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:48,239
it clearly had a calming effect which

1303
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:50,838
tells me that it is active

1304
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:54,038
psychologically right and so for me it

1305
00:58:50,838 --> 00:58:56,358
was psychoactive but it did not have

1306
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:59,200
that that getting high or Stony effect

1307
00:58:56,358 --> 00:59:01,279
that THC does it feels to me like like

1308
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:04,358
you know over time we need to develop a

1309
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:07,319
a and widen our vocabulary for for these

1310
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:09,798
experiences I'd endorse that

1311
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:11,558
approach um do you know anybody who's

1312
00:59:09,798 --> 00:59:13,079
you know is is there a paper written

1313
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:15,280
about that or or anything that you'd

1314
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:16,760
recommend that I and others read about

1315
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,720
about that delineation or has that work

1316
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:22,960
not really taken place yet uh probably

1317
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:27,598
more the latter um there are some

1318
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:30,079
extensive reviews on kry offline um

1319
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:34,400
really looking at the effects that it

1320
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:38,200
has uh on the brain or on mood of Just

1321
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:41,599
Begun um unfortunately a lot of the real

1322
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:43,598
emphasis isn't on kopling but uh trying

1323
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:46,640
to make synthetic drugs that would be

1324
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:49,559
like it that might be more marketable

1325
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:53,480
from an intellectual property standpoint

1326
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:56,400
I uh think that such effort is misguided

1327
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:59,280
when we have a readily available natural

1328
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:02,480
agent uh that's not only effective but

1329
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:05,599
quite safe there's this great term uh

1330
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:08,119
that that we got from Dr Dominic Cora of

1331
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:10,640
Casp when he was on the show uh a couple

1332
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:13,519
months ago uh he talks about whole plant

1333
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:15,118
politics people like myself in this show

1334
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,480
and and from what I understand you as

1335
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,358
well we believe in the whole plant so

1336
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,079
let's let's use the plant let's

1337
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:24,199
emphasize the Entourage effect and let's

1338
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:27,079
not focus as much our research on

1339
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:29,919
finding uh synthetic placements let's

1340
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:33,240
work on the plant even though uh it may

1341
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:36,280
be not possible to patent it and uh as

1342
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:39,439
intellectual property well sure no I I

1343
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:42,599
do believe in that approach um until

1344
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,000
about the last 70 years um medicine was

1345
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:47,318
synonymous with plants and it's still

1346
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,519
that way for many people in the third

1347
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:53,838
world and Indigenous peoples around the

1348
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:56,199
world so the ne the next um the next

1349
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:58,000
turpenoid I actually have never heard

1350
01:00:56,199 --> 01:01:00,759
pronounced so I'm I'm going to butcher

1351
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:05,440
Butcher it and then you can uh uh fix it

1352
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:07,599
for me is it nural nidol neurod dool yes

1353
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,559
nurad dool uh please I I have never

1354
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:13,680
learned anything about that um what's

1355
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:17,200
probably not uh that common in most

1356
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:21,279
North American uh cannabis choar it is a

1357
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:24,798
minor component of citrus um it has some

1358
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,680
interesting antifungal effects uh it

1359
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:29,400
penetrates the skin really well and can

1360
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:33,239
tend to drag other things in along with

1361
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:35,480
it um but uh it's probably not one that

1362
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:39,159
a lot of people are going to encounter

1363
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:41,639
um in in North America at least in

1364
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:44,719
cannabis is is the reason for that

1365
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:46,558
because it's not popular in you know the

1366
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:50,159
commercial cannabis world or is it

1367
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:52,798
because those cultivars are from you

1368
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:53,798
know uh you know really exotic foreign

1369
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:55,119
countries that we just don't have the

1370
01:01:53,798 --> 01:01:56,358
genetics here I mean what's the reason

1371
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,400
we don't come across it

1372
01:01:56,358 --> 01:02:01,038
I'm not sure if we knew more about the

1373
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,519
ecological role that it had I I could

1374
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:06,640
probably give a better answer uh so

1375
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:10,358
you've stump me on that one all right um

1376
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:13,278
so that let's move on to uh kopine oxide

1377
01:02:10,358 --> 01:02:15,400
right well uh you know as you can tell

1378
01:02:13,278 --> 01:02:18,000
from the name this just has an extra

1379
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:22,039
oxygen uh on it as compared to

1380
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,480
kopine um again uh very powerful

1381
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:29,920
antifungal uh this could be the solution

1382
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:32,318
um nail fungus um additionally uh its

1383
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,000
real distinction is it seems to be the

1384
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:39,079
chemical and cannabis uh that sniffer

1385
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:41,199
dogs key in on uh to identify uh

1386
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:44,079
cannabis uh at least that's what they

1387
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:47,598
thought when it was examined in uh

1388
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:50,519
auster about 35 years ago uh nobody's

1389
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:52,480
really done any work on it since uh so

1390
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:55,038
there's a research project for somebody

1391
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:57,079
who'd like to look into that yeah we're

1392
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:59,039
actually this is kind of a laundry list

1393
01:02:57,079 --> 01:03:01,640
of upand cominging research scientists

1394
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,319
about all the all the cool areas of

1395
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:05,960
cannabis that are still just like

1396
01:03:03,318 --> 01:03:08,759
waiting for people to dive into um well

1397
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:10,679
yeah the article is uh almost six years

1398
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,920
old now and I've made a bunch of

1399
01:03:10,679 --> 01:03:15,519
suggestions and a lot of them haven't

1400
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:17,838
had followup so here's your

1401
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:21,239
chance so the so the last one in this

1402
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:24,558
section is spall right well FAL is

1403
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:27,798
pretty Universal um any dried uh herb is

1404
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:31,359
going to have some in it because uh it's

1405
01:03:27,798 --> 01:03:33,599
basically a breakdown product of

1406
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:35,798
chlorophyll now what's interesting about

1407
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,039
it is it's probably responsible for the

1408
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:43,199
calming effect of green tea even though

1409
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:45,799
green tea has caffeine in it um uh but

1410
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:49,239
uh yeah I mean that that's the main

1411
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:51,400
thing there um so if uh cannabis is

1412
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:54,278
purely flour not a lot of leaf there

1413
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:57,920
won't be much of it and it is a a d

1414
01:03:54,278 --> 01:04:01,440
turpenoid the only 20 uh carbon U

1415
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,920
molecule that's uh common in herbal

1416
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,720
cannabis so before we wrap up the

1417
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,159
section I'd like to Circle back around

1418
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:11,038
to uh your suggestion that you're not a

1419
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:13,639
big fan of spiking uh cannabis and

1420
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:16,640
cannabis products with uh terpenoids or

1421
01:04:13,639 --> 01:04:18,798
probably any phyto canabo you know uh

1422
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:21,920
folks are now taking products you know

1423
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:23,400
from Edibles to tinctures and and and

1424
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,519
they're starting with whole plant which

1425
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,760
is great but then they want to they want

1426
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:28,838
to turn up some aspect of it say they

1427
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,119
want to make it a little more

1428
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:33,278
stimulating and so they'll drop some

1429
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:36,079
loning in there or they want to say it's

1430
01:04:33,278 --> 01:04:39,199
more for for pain uh and so they'll drop

1431
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:44,359
some mcing in there um so long as you

1432
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:47,759
start with a whole plant base so you do

1433
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:49,679
have all the minor canono in there um

1434
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,240
what is the reason why you're not so

1435
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:54,038
much of a fan of of spiking just a

1436
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:56,519
little bit of one or the other for its

1437
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:59,559
therapeutic effect well it's it's

1438
01:04:56,519 --> 01:05:01,079
multiple reasons first um we don't

1439
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:02,559
necessarily know the source of the

1440
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:04,720
terpenoids whether they've been

1441
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:09,240
organically produced is it the right

1442
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:11,239
stereo isomer um if somebody goes online

1443
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:13,639
uh to a chemical supply house and looks

1444
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:15,919
up lioning it isn't going to be one

1445
01:05:13,639 --> 01:05:19,558
they're going to be several um so it's

1446
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:22,920
not a simple thing uh for a person to

1447
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:26,519
pick the right one again most of these

1448
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:30,559
aren't 100% pure um and they're not

1449
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:32,719
designed for internal use um now let's

1450
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:35,839
compare that to organically grown

1451
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:38,759
cannabis uh we know that uh we know what

1452
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:43,679
its side effects are

1453
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:46,278
um but it's very different using a a

1454
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:49,239
synthesized chemical and adding that to

1455
01:05:46,278 --> 01:05:50,519
material but beyond that I'd reemphasize

1456
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:53,679
what I said

1457
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:56,159
previously this plant is capable of

1458
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:58,118
doing almost anything you wish

1459
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,358
uh given the time and attention to

1460
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:04,318
selective breeding for the desired

1461
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:07,440
components um to me there's no

1462
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:10,400
substitute uh for someone taking the

1463
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:14,200
time and effort uh to get the plant that

1464
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:16,278
they want um sure uh a lot of the things

1465
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:19,519
you mentioned in terms of spiking can be

1466
01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:23,239
Illuminating for people to understand uh

1467
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:25,719
the different effects but um as a a

1468
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:28,278
practice uh it's not something i' really

1469
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:31,838
encourage finally there's uh another

1470
01:06:28,278 --> 01:06:34,239
important reason and that is a lot of

1471
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:36,719
these are in commercial development of

1472
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:39,679
one kind or another I know that a lot of

1473
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:44,399
companies are pursuing this um you

1474
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:48,598
cannot spike a natural plant and develop

1475
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:51,798
a uh drug out of it um through the Food

1476
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:53,880
and Drug Administration approval process

1477
01:06:51,798 --> 01:06:57,838
um that's considered a combination

1478
01:06:53,880 --> 01:07:02,680
product um and so you have to do the uh

1479
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:05,519
safety efficacy and toxicity on um the

1480
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:07,639
original material the added material and

1481
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:10,639
the two together so it triples the

1482
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:14,159
amount of Investigation that's necessary

1483
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:15,598
and uh from a financial standpoint it

1484
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:17,920
makes it an

1485
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:21,680
impossibility uh because developing a

1486
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,960
drug for FDA approval can be upwards of

1487
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:26,798
a billion dollars at this point from

1488
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,760
start to finish one of the things that

1489
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:30,599
you mentioned about spiking is that you

1490
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:33,760
weren't sure if it was from an organic

1491
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:35,559
source and the way I'm taking that is

1492
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,559
that that you're suggesting there are

1493
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:39,519
synthetic terpenoids I actually thought

1494
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:42,839
that all the turps that we came across

1495
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:44,719
were either cannabis or food based are

1496
01:07:42,838 --> 01:07:46,920
you saying that that that there are such

1497
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:49,078
thing as synthetically produced

1498
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,358
terpenoids the vast majority are

1499
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:55,599
synthetically produced a lot of these

1500
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:58,480
are byproducts of uh petroleum products

1501
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:01,318
um so you know the chemical company will

1502
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:04,838
make one thing out of another thing and

1503
01:08:01,318 --> 01:08:08,480
again let's say it's 95% pure and you've

1504
01:08:04,838 --> 01:08:11,679
got the right um molecule what about the

1505
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,920
other 5% you don't know what that is uh

1506
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:18,399
we'll say right on the bottle uh that

1507
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:20,798
it's not designed um uh to be used as a

1508
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:23,759
medicine or taken internally or anything

1509
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:27,039
else um there's a real potential danger

1510
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:29,679
there and I don't want to exag at uh

1511
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:31,560
there is a potential danger there right

1512
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:33,319
on so we're going to take our last

1513
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,798
commercial break and when we come back

1514
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:37,400
we're going to be talking about the

1515
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:39,479
psycho pharmacological impacts of these

1516
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:41,318
different cannabinoids you are listening

1517
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:42,718
to shaping fire and my guest this week

1518
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:45,520

01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:47,920
Russo if you like podcasts like shaping

fire chances are that you will like Audi

1521
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:52,838
books too pretty much audiobooks are

1522
01:08:50,679 --> 01:08:55,039
like podcasts except with less

1523
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:58,238
stuttering better production quality and

1524
01:08:55,039 --> 01:09:00,880
more targeted topics yeah I know I make

1525
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:03,158
audiobooks sound better than a podcast

1526
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,560
and you know maybe they are but I get

1527
01:09:03,158 --> 01:09:07,158
you I like podcast too I like to learn

1528
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,679

1549
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,840
I listened recently to smoke signals by

01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,760
Martin Lee from projectcbd.org

1551

Martin's book is a classic of cannabis

1552
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:09,600
advocacy he explains the history of

1553
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,039
cannabis in America uh THC and CBD

1554
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:14,760
cannabis science and why cannabis policy

1555

person this book really is a must

1558

1559
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,119
just cuz we're talking about weed but if

1560
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:28,520

1561
01:10:26,119 --> 01:10:30,640
cannabis suddenly you become smart and

1562
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,199

01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,280
welcome back you are listening to

1579
01:11:09,158 --> 01:11:13,479
shaping fire and I am your host Shango

1580
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:15,800
Los my guest this week is world-renowned

1581
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:18,879
cannabis researcher and neurologist Dr

1582
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:21,920
Ethan Russo so in the last section of

1583
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:24,159
your paper taming THC you talk about

1584
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:27,440
some of the psycho pharmacological

1585
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:29,759
impacts that these phyto canavs have and

1586
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:31,599
so we'll touch on the the same three

1587
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,640
that you talk about in your paper so

1588
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,480
let's start with their impact on

1589
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:38,119
depression and

1590
01:11:35,479 --> 01:11:41,759
anxiety right well you know there is

1591
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:44,359
benefit to THC and certainly to CBD in

1592
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:47,960
some of these mood disorders but they

1593
01:11:44,359 --> 01:11:50,079
can really strongly be enhanced uh by

1594
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:53,119
the addition of the right turpenoid and

1595
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:56,800
particularly the pining and loning uh

1596
01:11:53,119 --> 01:12:01,079
respectively for cl ity uh from the

1597
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:03,880
pining and uh an anti-depressant effect

1598
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:06,639
uh from the loning um there's a real

1599
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:10,000
Synergy or boosting of effect there

1600
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:12,480
where you get a much much more dramatic

1601
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:17,158
effect in the combination than you would

1602
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:20,000
be with any single uh molecule

1603
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:22,039
alone so so when when they're working

1604
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,800
together like this for the Entourage

1605
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:26,719
effect um you're finding that uh they

1606
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,440
kind of uh groups these together you

1607
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:31,239
know depression anxiety these are these

1608
01:12:28,439 --> 01:12:33,678
are all your endoc

1609
01:12:31,238 --> 01:12:36,000
canabidol and so they're working

1610
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:38,199
together to rebalance is is that what

1611
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,719
you're suggesting ah yeah that's that's

1612
01:12:38,198 --> 01:12:44,559
certainly part of it um another actually

1613
01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:47,760
people have this misconception I I'm

1614
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:50,639
afraid it's been uh spread around Al

1615
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:54,440
also by the medical community that uh

1616
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:56,560
depression is a a serotonin deficiency

1617
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:59,119
uh so you need need a Selective

1618
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,320
serotonin reuptake inhibitor to treat it

1619
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:06,479
well they can help um but actually that

1620
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:10,000
isn't a good science we should think of

1621
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:12,799
um depression as being a disorder of

1622
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,920
plasticity of the brain uh in other

1623
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:19,079
words you've got a loss of the ability

1624
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:20,800
to roll with a proverbial punches um

1625
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:26,359
things aren't working

1626
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:28,440
efficiently um you've lost U uh lost uh

1627
01:13:26,359 --> 01:13:32,839
the ability to react uh to the

1628
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:34,879
environment in an optimal fashion um in

1629
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:37,039
fact one of the effects of the canabo

1630
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:40,319
seems to be increase to increase

1631
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:42,840
plasticity of the brain and uh again

1632
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:45,079
with uh mood enhancement from lyine

1633
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:48,319
that's a powerful

1634
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:51,920
combination So when you say plasticity

1635
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:54,158
um is is that a part of the the removal

1636
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,880
of plaque that we talk about when using

1637
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:59,599
phyto canab

1638
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:02,159
to to help the brain remove plaque thus

1639
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:04,840
fighting things like Alzheimer's and

1640
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:06,479
causing neurogenesis and acting as a

1641
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:09,360
neuroprotectant yeah it's the

1642
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:13,879
neurogenesis uh the Regeneration of of

1643
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:18,479
nerve cells the uh there are benefits of

1644
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:22,800
both T THC and CBD potentially in uh

1645
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:24,599
dementia like uh Alzheimer disease um

1646
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,639
and uh yeah there there is the

1647
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:28,079
possibility

1648
01:14:25,639 --> 01:14:30,679
that uh we could help prevent plaque

1649
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:33,679
formation that is one of the Hallmarks

1650
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:35,840
of that disorder you know very often

1651
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:37,800
when I'm talking with patients they're

1652
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:40,079
they're asking me about insomnia it's

1653
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:43,520
like oh my gosh I need help um getting

1654
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:45,039
the sleep and you know it it always um

1655
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:47,120
you know as part as a as part of the

1656
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:49,479
suggestion I always try to find out if

1657
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:51,679
it's if it's you know anxiety and and

1658
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:53,359
they can't seow their brain down or

1659
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:55,039
whether or not sometimes with patients

1660
01:14:53,359 --> 01:14:56,359
it's pain and every time they roll over

1661
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:58,600
over it's pain and then you have to deal

1662
01:14:56,359 --> 01:15:00,920
with the pain first and then you can go

1663
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:03,079
back and and work with the insomnia but

1664
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:05,600
let's say for example that it's not pain

1665
01:15:03,079 --> 01:15:07,960
related and it's you know racing brain

1666
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,639
related and we're trying to help people

1667
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:13,279
you know settle down and slip into good

1668
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:15,279
Slumber and you know most of the

1669
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:17,840
professionals that I talk to we all kind

1670
01:15:15,279 --> 01:15:20,158
of agree that the that the heavy purple

1671
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:22,480
Indica flowers you know that are packed

1672
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:23,960
with mirene are a good way to go but one

1673
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:27,319
thing I've never heard anybody explain

1674
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:29,439
is that why that why it works well uh

1675
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:31,639
it's uh

1676
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:34,079
multifactorial as we like to say in

1677
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:36,719
medicine part of it is just the

1678
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:39,519
sleepiness the hypnotic effect of some

1679
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:43,039
cannabis components including THC and

1680
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:46,120
merine but uh both of those are also

1681
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:49,359
painkillers um I wrote about this about

1682
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:52,920
10 years ago a review of effects of

1683
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:55,079
cannabis on sleep um in the clinical

1684
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:57,880
trials that have been done on cannabis

1685
01:15:55,079 --> 01:16:02,359
based medicine the symptom that is

1686
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:05,079
almost always alleviated is um insomnia

1687
01:16:02,359 --> 01:16:07,119
and again it's a combination of factors

1688
01:16:05,079 --> 01:16:12,119
number one being that there may be a

1689
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:15,399
hypnotic effect uh from the particular

1690
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:20,639
uh preparation but beyond that and more

1691
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:23,960
dramatic is the reduction of symptoms

1692
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:26,560
allowing sleep in other words if the

1693
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:29,039
person has pain reducing the pain allows

1694
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,159
them to sleep if they have restless legs

1695
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:34,439
and those are calmed that allows them to

1696
01:16:31,158 --> 01:16:37,479
sleep uh same thing with spasticity uh

1697
01:16:34,439 --> 01:16:39,799
increased muscle tone uh definitely the

1698
01:16:37,479 --> 01:16:43,198
same thing with lower urinary tract

1699
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:46,480
symptoms um with cannabis it's been

1700
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:49,519
shown that there are fewer uh episodes

1701
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:52,079
of needing to get up at night to urinate

1702
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:55,760
um so clearly that can lead to better

1703
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:59,119
sleep um so it is the uction and

1704
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:02,760
symptomatology that's the most um

1705
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:05,960
Salient reason that cannabis is a sleep

1706
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:07,840
aid that makes a lot of sense um so the

1707
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:10,079
last one that you review in your paper

1708
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:13,719
is addiction and it's become pretty

1709
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:16,920
common for people to use cannabis to uh

1710
01:17:13,719 --> 01:17:20,119
to move off narcotics most common

1711
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:23,639
recently um but also alcoholism how how

1712
01:17:20,119 --> 01:17:26,599
does that work well it's uh complicated

1713
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:29,239
but a lot of this Works um through

1714
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:32,239
reward Pathways in the brain that are uh

1715
01:17:29,238 --> 01:17:37,439
mediated by a neurotransmitter called

1716
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:40,238
dopamine um but um basically they're

1717
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:42,678
different mechanisms operative uh with

1718
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:45,678
THC it's a little bit more mysterious

1719
01:17:42,679 --> 01:17:48,760
but it would pertain to modulation of

1720
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:53,840
the reward Pathways uh with

1721
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:55,679
canaba um what has been noted is that a

1722
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:58,760
lot of addiction is is related to

1723
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:01,679
craving that comes about as a withdrawal

1724
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:03,520
effect um and that seems to be mediated

1725
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:09,079
by an area in the brain called the

1726
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:12,280
insula uh canaba has the uh ability to

1727
01:18:09,079 --> 01:18:15,119
um chemically turn down the activity in

1728
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:18,158
the insula and eliminate craving uh

1729
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:21,079
potentially so between the two uh there

1730
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:24,079
can be a very generous effect on

1731
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:25,840
addiction issues particularly withdrawal

1732
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:27,920
that makes a lot of sense and and

1733
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,520
actually that's a way more elegant

1734
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,560
explanation than I've been giving people

1735
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:35,840
the idea that that CBD will decrease the

1736
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:37,679
craving instead of replacing whatever

1737
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:39,960
the person is addicted to makes a lot of

1738
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:42,840
sense so the the last thing that you

1739
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:45,560
cover uh in the paper is that that

1740
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:48,520
sometimes you have more THC than your

1741
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:50,600
body is prepared for and you start to

1742
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:52,960
feel uncomfortable and and I think that

1743
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:55,239
pretty much anybody who has uh

1744
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:58,359
experimented with cannabis or has been a

1745
01:18:55,238 --> 01:19:01,479
patient and and you know tried to self

1746
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:03,679
tirate their usage to learn how much to

1747
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:06,519
use I think that most of us have had at

1748
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:08,440
some point an overmedicated experience

1749
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:10,360
which is you know has got the range

1750
01:19:08,439 --> 01:19:12,079
somewhere between feeling a little

1751
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:16,119
uncomfortable and you just want to go be

1752
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:18,158
alone all the way to um you know uh uh

1753
01:19:16,119 --> 01:19:19,719
your your heart rate increases your

1754
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:21,279
blood pressure drops and you're

1755
01:19:19,719 --> 01:19:23,119
wondering if you you should call the

1756
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:25,639
paramedics which is never a fun

1757
01:19:23,119 --> 01:19:28,319
experience and so what I what I'm doing

1758
01:19:25,639 --> 01:19:30,119
is I want to set up uh for you and I

1759
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:32,359
wish we had the wonderful slide you use

1760
01:19:30,119 --> 01:19:34,559
in your presentations but I I would like

1761
01:19:32,359 --> 01:19:38,679
you to tell the story that you tell

1762
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:40,239
about uh the perfect had too much THC

1763
01:19:38,679 --> 01:19:43,800
meal

1764
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:46,119
okay well this leads us off on a

1765
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:49,199
historical tangent but when I was

1766
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:53,000
writing the paper I was interested in

1767
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:57,000
historical antidotes to cannabis um they

1768
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:00,319
go back uh well almost uh well over

1769
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:06,600
2,000 years uh there have been Illusions

1770
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:09,079
to Citrus um uh as being um an antidote

1771
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:11,960
uh to cannabis and it's been repeated in

1772
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:13,719
different cultures around the world uh

1773
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:16,719
that didn't necessarily have knowledge

1774
01:20:13,719 --> 01:20:20,439
of one another uh so lying is certainly

1775
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:24,480
one but we also have evidence for pining

1776
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:28,599
from pine nuts and so um I developed

1777
01:20:24,479 --> 01:20:32,919
what I call uh THC overdose Meal which

1778
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:37,800
would be um uh pesto uh with the pine

1779
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:40,440
nuts and uh some basil uh along with

1780
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:44,639
um uh a drink called

1781
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:48,119
lemonada uh or uh AGA lion which is uh

1782
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:51,319
like lemonade but uh in this instance

1783
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:56,319
spiked with a whole bunch of extra uh

1784
01:20:51,319 --> 01:21:00,119
lemon rind uh for that uh necessary

1785
01:20:56,319 --> 01:21:02,319
lyine uh but uh certainly if someone's

1786
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:05,880
had an overdose of cannabis they're not

1787
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:08,479
in a position uh to make this meal um it

1788
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:10,239
it'd be best to have on hand or someone

1789
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:13,119
else applying

1790
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:17,119
it have somebody there to to make you a

1791
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:18,920
meal to help you come down um great so

1792
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:20,800
let's let's I've got a couple questions

1793
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:23,158
that are kind of just generally related

1794
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:26,039
to phyto canabo that I I'd like to wrap

1795
01:21:23,158 --> 01:21:29,599
up with so so one of them is that you

1796
01:21:26,039 --> 01:21:33,000
know uh since the tricomes are the home

1797
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:36,000
of the of the oils and the tur

1798
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:40,039
terpenoids um it makes me think that

1799
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:43,719
potentially a product that is just the

1800
01:21:40,039 --> 01:21:45,960
tricomes say for example a hash or

1801
01:21:43,719 --> 01:21:48,279
something um would be able to be

1802
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:50,198
considered whole plant medicine because

1803
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:52,479
it's all there in the tricomes but at

1804
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:54,158
the same time I I doubt that

1805
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:57,079
interpretation because there aren't

1806
01:21:54,158 --> 01:22:00,519
things like chlorophyll in there so so

1807
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:01,920
would you see a you know a dry hash or

1808
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:04,080
and I don't mean extracted I don't mean

1809
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,399
like butane I'm talking about a dry sift

1810
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:08,279
hash or an ice water hash would you

1811
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:10,319
consider those to be whole plant

1812
01:22:08,279 --> 01:22:16,279
medicine I

1813
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:19,238
do right you know the chlorophyll is uh

1814
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:22,719
an agent on its own is is mainly good as

1815
01:22:19,238 --> 01:22:26,198
a laxative um really in terms of

1816
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:30,198
cannabis flowers the real medicinal part

1817
01:22:26,198 --> 01:22:33,960
is the glandular triome and its purest

1818
01:22:30,198 --> 01:22:37,399
manifestation uh would be hashish uh

1819
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:38,880
again what uh Potter called an enriched

1820
01:22:37,399 --> 01:22:42,359
uh triome

1821
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:46,239
preparation um so that is going to have

1822
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:48,880
the full complement of the canabo and

1823
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:52,319
terpenoids uh it might not have some

1824
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:55,359
other elements uh that one would get uh

1825
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:58,198
from other parts of the plants like can

1826
01:22:55,359 --> 01:23:01,158
flaven but again those can be had on

1827
01:22:58,198 --> 01:23:03,000
their own right on thank you so you know

1828
01:23:01,158 --> 01:23:05,039
there was some discussion and even some

1829
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,719
experiments in the mid 2000s that

1830
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:09,639
questioned the Entourage effect and in

1831
01:23:07,719 --> 01:23:12,039
the end it was generally agreed that the

1832
01:23:09,639 --> 01:23:14,480
levels of CBD and other cannabinoids and

1833
01:23:12,039 --> 01:23:17,560
the doses that they were using were too

1834
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:20,638
low to actually moderate the THC um kind

1835
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:23,840
of debunking those studies what do you

1836
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:25,000
see as the required milligram dosage of

1837
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,199
CBD

1838
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,800
to successfully play a role in the

1839
01:23:27,198 --> 01:23:30,960
patient's experience well it should be

1840
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:34,679
based on

1841
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:36,800
proportions um uh in the past so some

1842
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:38,800
dispensaries have gotten excited about

1843
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:42,079
very low levels of

1844
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:46,719
CBD uh despite it's being so versatile

1845
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:48,639
and so uh Health promoting um CBD is not

1846
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:51,000
what you call really potent there's got

1847
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:53,880
to be a good amount there generally

1848
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,880
speaking you want uh for a preparation

1849
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:59,440
where there's going going to be CBD you

1850
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:01,679
want it at least as much as the THC and

1851
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:04,439
in some instances it's better to have a

1852
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:06,920
lot more CBD then

1853
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:10,638
THC right on that makes the sense so so

1854
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:12,920
at least a one to one and up exactly and

1855
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:16,719
so is there a is there a threshold for

1856
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:18,880
that where um the amount of CBD that

1857
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:20,840
you're intaking is too low to really

1858
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,039
have any effect at all on you uh

1859
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:26,159
certainly but it would depend also on

1860
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:29,238
the absolute amount of DHC generally

1861
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:31,799
speaking uh because it's so overwhelming

1862
01:24:29,238 --> 01:24:35,079
in its effects one would base the

1863
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:39,880
overall dose on that um

1864
01:24:35,079 --> 01:24:43,039
so put it in this these terms um 2

1865
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:45,199
milligrams of THC is a threshold dose or

1866
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:48,118
a good place to start for someone who's

1867
01:24:45,198 --> 01:24:50,839
not accustomed to cannabis 5 milligrams

1868
01:24:48,118 --> 01:24:53,279
is going to affect most people 10

1869
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:56,199
milligrams is a pretty large dose and

1870
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:57,639
certainly Maybe too much uh for someone

1871
01:24:56,198 --> 01:25:01,479
who's cannabis

1872
01:24:57,639 --> 01:25:04,800
naive um but uh it would be that amount

1873
01:25:01,479 --> 01:25:07,039
of THC with whatever amount of CBD is

1874
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:11,400
available and it could be as much of 30

1875
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:12,479
times as much as THC um with some of the

1876
01:25:11,399 --> 01:25:16,079
modern

1877
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:17,638
choar um but say to treat a condition

1878
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:21,800
like rheumatoid

1879
01:25:17,639 --> 01:25:25,039
arthritis um or schizophrenia or uh

1880
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:26,760
epilepsy you need uh much much higher

1881
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:29,359
dose of

1882
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:31,199
canaba so so what would that number be

1883
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:33,839
where would you you know much much are

1884
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:36,799
you talking about 10 milligrams of CBD a

1885
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:41,000
day or are you talking about 50 no it

1886
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:43,440
could be a few hundred milligrams of CBD

1887
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,760
um and that you know that uh becomes

1888
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:48,919
difficult to obtain and can be quite

1889
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:51,880
expensive um but a lot of these problems

1890
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:54,440
are byproducts of prohibition and

1891
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:57,760
hopefully would be circumvented at some

1892
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:59,879
point in the future so so let's say 100

1893
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,880
milligrams of CBD in a day is what's

1894
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,800
going to be called for uh is that

1895
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:05,960
something that you'd be able to take all

1896
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:09,039
at once or would that just totally

1897
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:10,359
overwhelm your your your intake and you

1898
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:12,639
actually would need to break that down

1899
01:26:10,359 --> 01:26:15,839
into three doses over the day how much

1900
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:18,480
can your body take well it can take uh

1901
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:21,960
in the recent clinical trials of EP

1902
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:23,759
dialects which is almost pure CBD for

1903
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:27,399
seizure disorders they've used as much

1904
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:29,239
as 20 500 milligrams of CBD a day but

1905
01:26:27,399 --> 01:26:32,479
that's without any

1906
01:26:29,238 --> 01:26:35,519
THC um to answer your question generally

1907
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:39,799
speaking most types of cannabis and CBD

1908
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:43,119
should be dosed two or three times a day

1909
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:45,000
uh if we're talking about orally um and

1910
01:26:43,118 --> 01:26:48,639
so it's not just a matter of the total

1911
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:53,520
overall daily dose but how it is a

1912
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:54,880
portioned out um but um 2500 milligrams

1913
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,480
is a lot

1914
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:59,719
um at that high dose there can be some

1915
01:26:57,479 --> 01:27:03,919
drug drug interactions but at lower

1916
01:26:59,719 --> 01:27:06,840
doses those are quite rare with CBD um

1917
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:10,440
as a practical measure though um people

1918
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:13,159
are not using pure CBD and almost

1919
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:15,118
invariably there's going to be some

1920
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:17,638
amount of THC that becomes the rate

1921
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:21,519
limiting factor in what people can

1922
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:24,679
manage uh to take without having

1923
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:26,159
issues so that brings us to the hot

1924
01:27:24,679 --> 01:27:27,960
question right because we're talking

1925
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:31,519
about how the market is working and and

1926
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:33,760
being able to afford CBD because CBD

1927
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:36,280
from medical cannabis remains expensive

1928
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:38,199
because of prohibition so I want to set

1929
01:27:36,279 --> 01:27:40,960
up this question where I'm asking your

1930
01:27:38,198 --> 01:27:43,519
thoughts on CBD derived from hemp

1931
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:45,760
because you know as uh whole plant

1932
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,679
people um you know we understand that

1933
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:50,119
without the constituents of the medical

1934
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:53,719
cannabis plants the minor cannabinoids

1935
01:27:50,118 --> 01:27:56,319
to create the Entourage effect using CBD

1936
01:27:53,719 --> 01:27:59,279
uh in isolate really does not get to

1937
01:27:56,319 --> 01:28:00,960
claim the benefits um of all this CBD

1938
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:04,920
Research you know when you read these

1939
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:07,840
papers they they're invariably CBD as

1940
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:11,239
the primary component in the presence of

1941
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:16,279
THC and minor cannabinoids and yet the

1942
01:28:11,238 --> 01:28:17,559
CBD from hemp Market is claiming that uh

1943
01:28:16,279 --> 01:28:19,599
the stud you know they're claiming the

1944
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:23,639
advantages of these studies for their

1945
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:25,400
CBD in isolate plant from hemp so so

1946
01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:27,719
what are your your thoughts about CBD

1947
01:28:25,399 --> 01:28:30,359
dve from hemp well I have to be very

1948
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:32,399
critical um that's not a good source and

1949
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:35,000
we're not just talking about hemp we're

1950
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:37,719
talking about hemp refuse uh in other

1951
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,719
words the hemp has been processed for

1952
01:28:37,719 --> 01:28:43,039
another uh reason and they've done a

1953
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:45,560
chemical extraction to concentrate the

1954
01:28:43,039 --> 01:28:48,399
CBD but at the same time they're

1955
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:51,360
concentrating pesticides or any other

1956
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:55,399
contaminants um they're really not using

1957
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:58,039
uh dedicated uh flour uh to produce the

1958
01:28:55,399 --> 01:29:02,000
medicine and that's the richest source

1959
01:28:58,039 --> 01:29:05,198
and the purest Source um additionally uh

1960
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,118
because of prohibition there is not the

1961
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:09,118
quality control in the industry that

1962
01:29:07,118 --> 01:29:12,519
would tell you whether this is a good

1963
01:29:09,118 --> 01:29:14,880
product or not um so I have to be quite

1964
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:16,719
critical okay so I'm going to take that

1965
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:20,279
another another step and press a little

1966
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:22,039
bit more so so I agree how that position

1967
01:29:20,279 --> 01:29:25,719
uh suggests okay we should not be buying

1968
01:29:22,039 --> 01:29:28,479
CBD isolate from China because you know

1969
01:29:25,719 --> 01:29:30,920
uh hemp is a wonderful Toxin and heavy

1970
01:29:28,479 --> 01:29:32,879
metals aggregator and you don't know

1971
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:34,520
what's going to be um what what you're

1972
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:37,000
going to be buying but you know there's

1973
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:39,800
some companies in Colorado now that are

1974
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:43,840
growing uh you know uh environment

1975
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:46,400
controlled hemp uh for extraction for

1976
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,079
medical products and and you know

1977
01:29:46,399 --> 01:29:50,638
they're they're claiming that the the

1978
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:51,920
ground is clean and such so so if we set

1979
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:54,719
aside the

1980
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:56,920
contamination factor for a moment

1981
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:58,719
um do you think that it is reasonable at

1982
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:01,520
all to and I know this kind of goes back

1983
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:04,480
to the spiking idea but let's say that

1984
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:06,360
you're you're taking some amount of of

1985
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:10,919
medical cannabis so you're getting kind

1986
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:13,118
of like this bed of of THC phyto canabo

1987
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,600
including all the minor ones but you

1988
01:30:13,118 --> 01:30:16,920
also because let's say you're a

1989
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:21,039
rheumatoid arthritis patient you need a

1990
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:24,039
whole lot of CBD as part of that mix um

1991
01:30:21,039 --> 01:30:26,560
do you think there's any efficacy to to

1992
01:30:24,039 --> 01:30:29,880
have that base from a a whole whole

1993
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:34,719
plant medicine but then spike it with

1994
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:37,960
say 100 Mig of CBD from hemp uh again

1995
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:42,079
that's really suboptimal uh to me you

1996
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:45,000
know uh proper medicine would uh be

1997
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:47,559
stand on its own merits uh and not need

1998
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,840
spiking from anything else and and you

1999
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:54,000
know the capability is there uh the

2000
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:57,719
proper chovar are there they're not AA

2001
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:02,158
aailable everywhere uh at this time but

2002
01:30:57,719 --> 01:31:05,639
again um I would hope for uh better

2003
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:08,279
future on which there are good quality

2004
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:11,520
Controlled Products available uh that

2005
01:31:08,279 --> 01:31:14,039
are backed by uh solid

2006
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:16,800
analyses uh so that consumer and

2007
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:19,399
physician alike and know uh what people

2008
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:21,760
are getting yeah you know from a from a

2009
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:24,719
business point of view it it sounds like

2010
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:27,960
CBD from hemp is a short short-term

2011
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:30,319
product from a transitionary market from

2012
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:32,039
prohibition I mean the the reason why it

2013
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:34,639
makes sense for so many business to try

2014
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:36,960
to sell it is because you know whole

2015
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:39,719
plant medicine is still so expensive

2016
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,039
because it's being controlled um so so

2017
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:43,960
Ethan is it true that you're working on

2018
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:45,079
a follow-up to this paper yes absolutely

2019
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:47,639
as we

2020
01:31:45,079 --> 01:31:50,158
speak so so when when when can we look

2021
01:31:47,639 --> 01:31:54,079
forward to that um you know I'm not sure

2022
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:56,439
it's uh going to be in um a hybrid situ

2023
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:59,118
ation advances in Pharmacology so it

2024
01:31:56,439 --> 01:32:02,678
comes out initially as a book um but

2025
01:31:59,118 --> 01:32:05,799
it'll also be available as an article um

2026
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:09,560
and it'll be pretty extensive um cover

2027
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:12,639
some of the same ground as taming THC

2028
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:16,520
with the cannabinoids the terpenoids the

2029
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:18,880
the Cannabis flavenoids uh but the we'll

2030
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:22,440
have a generous number of terpenoids

2031
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:26,239
that were not uh treated uh in the prior

2032
01:32:22,439 --> 01:32:29,439
paper um and the uh benefit of an

2033
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:31,919
additional five or six years of research

2034
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:35,279
on some of the agents that we did uh

2035
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:37,880
discussed previously uh so I'm excited

2036
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:41,559
about it I'm doing that uh in

2037
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:44,079
collaboration with Jan Maru and uh I

2038
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:46,880
think it'll be nice entry I'm hoping

2039
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:49,359
it'll be available later uh in

2040
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:51,359
2017 well hopefully you'll accept my

2041
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:53,960
invitation when your paper comes out to
