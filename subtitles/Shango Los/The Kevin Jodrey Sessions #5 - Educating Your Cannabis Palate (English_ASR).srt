1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,919
so with more more people coming to

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,769
cannabis to try for the first time and

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,719
now so many of us are able to expand our

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,618
palates because we've got more than the

5
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:18,469
one thing that our plug had for us what

6
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:21,570
do you recommend Kevin as to how that

7
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:24,419
newcomers can can maybe like build a

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,429
flight or or try a wide range of

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,349
cannabis so that they can find out what

10
00:00:26,428 --> 00:00:29,820
they like in a pretty efficient way

11
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,500
because you know it's expensive to

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,689
experiment with the anibus and then

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,519
similarly those of us who have been in

14
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:38,189
cannabis for years and years we're

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,930
getting access to new things so so how

16
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:42,329
would you recommend somebody who's new

17
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:44,789
to it or wants to expand their palate to

18
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,489
do so in a way where they can reach and

19
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,760
be efficient that's a good question

20
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:52,709
because there's so many choices that it

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,329
becomes almost overwhelming for the

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,609
average individual to really determine

23
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,460
where to begin where they like - like it

24
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:02,269
and what are what I did is I tried to

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,230
neck down 42,000 terpene so there's a

26
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:06,030
42,000 different settings we basically

27
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,030
had to create the smell components and

28
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,019
so no no one alive could remember all of

29
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,210
this and no one would be able to

30
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:15,179
differentiate and so I said from all the

31
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,589
years of distributing cannabis that

32
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,600
really it breaks down into four

33
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,700
fundamental groups earth fuel floral and

34
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:25,679
fruit and those basically are very

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,259
simple terms but it allows you to see

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,040
the different Terk profiles and I was

37
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,049
challenged on this by some researchers

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,880
about where did you come up with this

39
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,460
and I said I it's just intuition for me

40
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:40,019
and they challenged it scientifically

41
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,569
and really it was accurate but it

42
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:45,629
basically broke down into you have a

43
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,639
fruit and a fuel and underneath fuel is

44
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:50,489
earth and underneath fruitless floral so

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,200
you can basically break down 42,000

46
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,769
terpenes into two major groups and

47
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,079
cannabis fruit and fuel and then below

48
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:00,420
fuel is earth and below fruit is floral

49
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,069
so it was really accurate scientifically

50
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,170
which was interesting because for me it

51
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:04,529
was intuition but for the scientists

52
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,299
they

53
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,729
to see if his hypothesis was correct

54
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,920
than it was and what the importance of

55
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,650
it is that it allows you to be able to

56
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,419
break it up into four groups and they

57
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,360
each have some very specific type of

58
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:20,759
facts fruits basically uplifting floral

59
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,300
some more introspective earth is more

60
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:27,649
sedative gas is very aggressive and so

61
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,239
those type of sensations you experience

62
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,980
really are pretty dominant even if the

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,840
treatment of the cannabinoid levels

64
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,000
fluctuate and some of the ratios

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,670
fluctuate so that the turf doesn't

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,680
determine the entire effect and high but

67
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:43,109
it definitely is a predicator of it and

68
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,450
what it does is it allows individuals to

69
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,640
say okay I want to try things that are

70
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:50,099
introspective and you would go then

71
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:53,729
through floral categories things that

72
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,199
had floral smells exotics and then you

73
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:56,939
would look through those for the things

74
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,068
that worked for you and if you wanted

75
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:02,579
uplifting then we would go into citrus

76
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:04,139
tones lemons limes grapefruits things

77
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,519
that really spark up your eyes and open

78
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:07,559
you up and if we wanted to have a

79
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,110
radical change in effect of what we're

80
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,849
doing we would go into gas and that's

81
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,459
basically what's trendy now up to all

82
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,650
the oh Jesus hours where you have a very

83
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,090
heavy mayor scene pining base that just

84
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,459
and there's other subtleties that make

85
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,170
this gaseous effect but it's very

86
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,909
powerful for people who want that

87
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,518
that's individuals we need pain relief

88
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:28,560
primarily and a radical change its own

89
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,530
and then earth is stuff that was old

90
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,420
school bubble cush the Hindu Kush is

91
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,219
where the policies were around really 11

92
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,738
to 13 they're really run high potency

93
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,759
but you felt it really well because it

94
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,310
allowed you to have a very beautiful

95
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,949
relaxing body high but without too much

96
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,930
mental race eNOS and so you're able as a

97
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:49,469
consumer if you can take a look at this

98
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,090
it says hey what am i seeking and I want

99
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:52,379
to have what kind of effects and for

100
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,870
most people they would like to have a

101
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,729
couple different choices and so what we

102
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,129
say is then you get into the four

103
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:01,289
different categories of fuel and earth

104
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:03,870
the floral and a fruit and then you go

105
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:06,780
and consume them throughout the day in

106
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,550
the right sequence where you would

107
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,770
the things that had the most heavy

108
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,600
impacts when you had the least amount of

109
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,060
mental effort and you weren't driving

110
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,040
and you were using stuff that was very

111
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,199
open and light while you were using your

112
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,769
creativity so typically fruits in the

113
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,589
morning

114
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,840
floral after that so that your your

115
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:26,519
introspective as you move through you

116
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,500
can get into earth in the in the later

117
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,029
afternoon because it's relaxing but it's

118
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,680
not devastating and then you can get

119
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:33,739
into heavy fuels in the evening where

120
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,759
they just basically sit you down and

121
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,759
really let you change your tone

122
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,589
completely and in those four categories

123
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,899
you'll be able to start I took you to

124
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:44,879
get a notebook and you just take a look

125
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:46,199
and if you can take a look at some of

126
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,699
the ones that you really like and you

127
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,469
can look at the chemo type profiles

128
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,909
which is really the overall cannabinoids

129
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,680
and the ratios you'll start to find

130
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,290
certain ones that let you know hey I

131
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,900
like a a lot of THC because I want that

132
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:00,150
euphoria but I want enough CBD to make

133
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,859
it to where it's not edgy and you'll

134
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:04,139
start to see those ratios and you'll

135
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,300
start to see these relationships and

136
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,649
it'll start to let you take a look at

137
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,639
because it's all documented now when

138
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:10,560
you're selling cannabis all this

139
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,349
information is present so you could go

140
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,180
into a modern store and if they data

141
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,950
based it correctly you'd be able to say

142
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,009
what I'm looking for is something in

143
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:22,259
this type of basic profile with with

144
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,360
ratios like this and you'd be able to

145
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,949
get into a little subset of things that

146
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,340
would be within that and then you would

147
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:31,228
try those because no lab report is you

148
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,149
it doesn't make a difference you're your

149
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:34,529
own lab report and it every single

150
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:36,629
number could line up across the board

151
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:39,059
and still not the one you like but it

152
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,889
lets you exit off the list and it starts

153
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,449
to to make it a little simpler folks

154
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,649
otherwise you're looking at 400 samples

155
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,449
not four and you want

156
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:48,668
to make this easier and more affordable

157
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:51,610
and so for me the way I recommend it is

158
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:54,849
to break it up in this fashion and just

159
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,189
journal it and try to use a repeatable

160
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,009
process meaning the way you consume it

161
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:04,389
so you have to basically set the same

162
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:06,250
smoking situation to evaluate so if you

163
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:07,538
want to evaluate your morning smoke you

164
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,620
need to basically smoke it at your house

165
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:10,240
while you're drinking coffee in the

166
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,340
morning like that every day the same

167
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,930
otherwise they're comparing apples to

168
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:18,459
oranges not the other way around

169
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:21,788
and that changes how you affect the high

170
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:23,379
so if I'm in a bad mood and I consume it

171
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:25,810
and I'm in a good mood and I consume it

172
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:27,788
then it's really you're putting a huge

173
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,560
influence on the effect itself and so

174
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:31,959
when you're trying to find out what

175
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,538
works for you and and really what are

176
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,759
the varieties that really satisfy once

177
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:39,819
you can really put it into a clearer

178
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,978
context now what you have is the ability

179
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:44,110
to say that's what I like I don't need

180
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:46,478
to look anymore yes I can try new things

181
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,160
when it's convenient but I want to buy

182
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:49,810
an ounce of that I want to buy an ounce

183
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,060
of that and that'll last me the next

184
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,319
three weeks and hopefully when you're

185
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,449
talking to the people you're buying it

186
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,759
from you're asking them are these farms

187
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:00,129
solvent do you think they're gonna be in

188
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,779
business in three weeks and that way

189
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:03,848
what it does is it lets you get a

190
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:07,299
repeatability otherwise you have to keep

191
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:08,949
repeating this process but it you can

192
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,840
make it very simple and you don't have

193
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:12,430
to know the complexities you don't have

194
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,899
to be able to memorize the cannabinoids

195
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,120
it's not important that you know every

196
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:17,888
terpene by heart and what they do that's

197
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,788
wonderful but that's for fishing Otto's

198
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:25,150
on a very introspective scientific type

199
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:26,259
vision users just need to say I like it

200
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:28,810
or I don't like it

201
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,579
it's that simple and did it work or did

202
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,530
it not work was it affordable was it not

203
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:34,478
affordable and then you can get into the

204
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:36,219
emotional components of did the farm

205
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,959
produce it in a manner that I can agree

206
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,810
with meaning you know are they really

207
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:42,279
environmentally conscious do they have a

208
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,339
real concern for the product and all

209
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:47,349
those factors weave in but first make it

210
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:50,049
simple on what kind of effect

211
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,460
seeking then then log to find out what

212
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,920
cannabinoid levels seemed to be

213
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,750
comfortable for you and what ratios and

214
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,580
pretty soon you have a good guy booked

215
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,240
on what to do right on great thank you

216
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:00,240
much welcome
