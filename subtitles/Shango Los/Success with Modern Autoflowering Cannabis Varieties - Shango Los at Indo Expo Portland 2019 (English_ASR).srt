upcoming presentation is titled success

19
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,768
with modern autoflowering cannabis from

20
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:57,478
Shango lows oh that's me so it looks

21
00:00:55,768 --> 00:01:00,689
like since I'm moderating the room today

22
00:00:57,478 --> 00:01:02,939
I'm also introducing myself so here we

23
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,140
go a summary of the points that were to

24
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,849
be talking about today is number one

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,040
we're gonna talk about who is likely to

26
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:09,868
benefit most from autoflowering cannabis

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,790
we're going to talk about where autos

28
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:14,189
come from we're going to talk about the

29
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,570
most common objections to Auto flowers

30
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,459
and we will point you in the direction

31
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,309
of some quality breeders and where to

32
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,599
find more information so the important

33
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,840
thing to start out at the beginning is

34
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,509
to realize that even though Auto flowers

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,700
have become awesome there's still a lot

36
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:32,719
of variability and so a lot of things

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,049
I'm going to say float somewhere between

38
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:39,829
best-case scenario and the better seeds

39
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:43,590
that are on the market a lot of people

40
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:45,900
righteously hate Auto flowers and and

41
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,090
those folks generally come into three

42
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,400
categories either they were growing

43
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,978
autos back in the day of the lowrider

44
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,810
days when it was a cool idea but the

45
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,539
yields and the terpene profiles were

46
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,490
atrocious and it just it wasn't very

47
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,700
rewarding and so they got a bad

48
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:05,579
reputation as we all know reputations

49
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,500
are hard to change the second challenge

50
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,319
can also be that

51
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,169
people just like to grow fricken trees

52
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,900
and Otto flowers have not really hit

53
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:18,689
that that point yet and then third some

54
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,689
people are just using seeds that are not

55
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:23,430
as well developed as other seeds so the

56
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:25,530
vast majority of what I'm going to tell

57
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,110
you today is kind of based on the

58
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,240
cutting edge of where Otto flower seeds

59
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,940
are but does not is not representative

60
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,379
of every seed in the market so it's

61
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,120
really important to do your own research

62
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:38,729
this is not one of those situations

63
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,489
where you're all gonna be like this pack

64
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:44,039
of seeds says Otto flowers and I want an

65
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:47,330
auto flower and so I'm gonna buy a whole

66
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:49,679
bunch of this one seed and and and

67
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,719
devote my entire crop to it I don't

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,909
recommend that I recommend you getting a

69
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,909
lot of variety of seeds from different

70
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:59,549
folks and do a trial and then decide

71
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:00,810
okay these are clearly the ones that

72
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,750
meet the needs that I'm looking for

73
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,189
myself ruderalis crosses are not

74
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,919
something that's new they've been around

75
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:10,590
for a while what's new and why everybody

76
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:13,199
is talking about it today is because the

77
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,780
latest seeds that come out by some of

78
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,500
the top companies are just smoking and

79
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:22,769
if you are part of a very particular

80
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,060
audience they could be well very

81
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,390
literally life-saving if you're a

82
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,039
patient so we're going to first start

83
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,919
with by talking about cultivators who

84
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,859
are most likely to benefit from the

85
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,599
autumn flowers first and foremost my

86
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,549
heart is always with home growers right

87
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,439
I do business consulting and I help

88
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,599
commercial folks as well but I really

89
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,039
have my heart I am patient in home

90
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,859
grower centric so we're going to start

91
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:50,280
there but the number one reason why home

92
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:55,890
growers adore auto Flowers is because

93
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:59,060
their speed from germination to to

94
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:01,949
harvest there are a handful of different

95
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,810
lengths of time depending on that chemo

96
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:05,729
bar at this point but generally they

97
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,979
followed us sixteen ninety or

98
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:10,139
hundred and twenty days and for those of

99
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,798
you who are here for Jess presentation

100
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,079
earlier

101
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,850
you've got to see his pictures of you

102
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:21,329
know how fast a 60-day plan goes from

103
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,790
termination to being prepared to harvest

104
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,139
and it is really astonishing and it's

105
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,110
it's crazy to when people talk about a

106
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:32,460
60 date or 60 day auto flower you know

107
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:34,080
since we're used to regs flowering for

108
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:35,489
eight weeks you're like oh yeah well

109
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,859
that's just like a writer claims like no

110
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,918
I don't mean 60 days for the entire plan

111
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:44,788
to took it to flower I'm talking about

112
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:46,500
60 days from germination to harvest and

113
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:47,819
then that's run on that point is where

114
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,589
people start you kind of start to see

115
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:51,839
the mind get blown a little bit they're

116
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,310
like wow how many how many rounds can I

117
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,739
do in my tent how many rounds could I do

118
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,689
outside this summer for example I did

119
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,660
two rounds I did one round that I popped

120
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:02,819
in April and harvested the end of June

121
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,410
and then I put some more in the middle

122
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,240
of June and they're gonna be hardest at

123
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,330
the end of September so getting two

124
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,759
cycles in one summer with no

125
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:13,859
pain-in-the-ass light down the second

126
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,348
thing is that of course where the

127
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,379
flowers get their name they get their

128
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:22,469
name from because they do not flower

129
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:24,750
based on photo sensitivity right most

130
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:28,169
cannabis plants they will start to

131
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,538
flower sometime mid-august when the

132
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:33,180
light cycle gets down towards you know

133
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:35,129
nearish 12 12 where we live in the

134
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,220
Pacific Northwest it never gets to 12 12

135
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:41,819
right so so most of our plants kind of

136
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,820
like get crawl into flowering and about

137
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,139
you know 13 and a half hours or so which

138
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:47,550
is one of the challenges of growing in

139
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,379
the Northwest and another reason why

140
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,009
these Auto flowers are great what

141
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:56,339
triggers Auto flowers to a tube flower

142
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:57,538
is is more maturity right you know in

143
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,978
the early days people were telling me

144
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:00,899
how you know it's when then it's when

145
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:03,089
the roots hit the bottom of the pot and

146
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:05,489
it causes them stress and I even

147
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:08,219
repeated that a few times and then I'm

148
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,288
toward a worried in CBD seeds farm in

149
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,650
Albany OR in and they've been you know

150
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:15,019
all these fields full of beautiful

151
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:17,629
Otto flowers that I'm label how are

152
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:19,189
their deep roots need to go down in

153
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:20,389
order to hit the bottom of the pie and

154
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:23,029
this so this can't be right information

155
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:24,978
so I stopped saying that and got further

156
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:26,839
educated and found out that actually no

157
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:28,939
it's it's when the plants hit their

158
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,439
maturity level they just automatically

159
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:32,750
go into bloom and that makes a lot more

160
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,839
sense both scientifically and

161
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,060
observational II another reason why home

162
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:41,109
growers really like Otto flowers is that

163
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,639
you know home growers have got a lot of

164
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,639
unexpected things in short opportunities

165
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:49,400
for example let's say that you're moving

166
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,168
and and you know I hate it when you know

167
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,698
I want to move up when I have my grow

168
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:55,069
but we're gonna create a plan on moving

169
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:57,410
September 1 right so we'll get all my

170
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:59,930
veg in but before the plant even

171
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,250
finishes flower somehow I've got to go

172
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,500
so that means that you're gonna you know

173
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,788
rent a u-haul and move all your plans

174
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,990
and hopefully you don't break off all

175
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:08,269
the branches and go through all that

176
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,910
malarkey or you just don't grow at all

177
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:12,409
so for people who are home growers the

178
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,000
idea that you can say okay I'm gonna

179
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,450
move September 1 so I'm just going to

180
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,149
make sure that I plant June 1 or May

181
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,918
mid-may and be like hey now we harvest

182
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:24,439
it and move into my new place instead of

183
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,909
my new 10 and start there also there's

184
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,500
other opportunities like let's say that

185
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,000
your roommate doesn't like you know

186
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,769
cannabis around maybe they're concerned

187
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,029
about it and you know you rightly want

188
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,529
to respect their interests at the house

189
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:35,239
too well fine

190
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:36,500
they're gonna take off on vacation for

191
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,819
two months with their family and

192
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,978
something you're like buying here going

193
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:41,569
I'm gonna grow a sixty-day and you're

194
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:43,609
getting like totally wheat up while

195
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:45,139
they're gone these are the kinds of

196
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,660
things that you know you have to be

197
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:50,269
aware of when you're a home grower also

198
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:53,470
another thing is that the plants are

199
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:56,180
very naturally resistant to pests and

200
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,490
deficiencies due to their short cycle

201
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,720
and I've experienced this last year last

202
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,990
summer and was the first year that I

203
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:06,169
really lagged into Otto flowers and I

204
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:08,000
realized that the cycle was so short it

205
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:10,430
didn't give me a lot of time to eff it

206
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,379
up and you know it's you know I'm a

207
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,120
novice grower nope no question about it

208
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:16,668
I am NOT a pro grower and I'm not a

209
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,930
breeder but what I am is a student and I

210
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:21,168
care about it and so I do my research

211
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:23,509
and so what I realized after I grew it

212
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:27,019
is like wow about the time that it's

213
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:28,519
it's flowering it's done and so you know

214
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:30,259
we all know that when you're using rags

215
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:32,929
one of the things all right you don't

216
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:35,350
want to spray during your flower right

217
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,899
so that means that you have to be very

218
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:42,229
proactive for pests and botrytis and

219
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:44,299
p.m. during your veg so that you can

220
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,129
kind of hopefully coast and maybe even

221
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:47,959
upgrade to beneficial insects during the

222
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:49,669
flower to get to the end

223
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,340
well if that's going to be eight to ten

224
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:55,339
weeks that's a long time hoping to keep

225
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:58,490
you know the plant in good shape whereas

226
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:01,340
if the entire life cycle of the plant is

227
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,460
going to be 60 or 90 days you have a

228
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:07,220
much smaller window that you have to not

229
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,110
screw up and for home growers you know

230
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,399
that that's that's a real benefit we've

231
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,259
got lots of home growers that they're

232
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,179
new to growing its new in their states

233
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:15,710
new to them they're just learning about

234
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,439
cannabis medicine you know for whatever

235
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:22,009
the reason is just because you want to

236
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,170
grow does not mean that you need to have

237
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:27,080
you know that you've given yourself an

238
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:28,990
epic amount of education on it auto

239
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,050
haulers are just that easy

240
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,700
also you know because they're the plants

241
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:36,740
are crossed with the ruderalis plant

242
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,990
which we'll talk of in detail well in

243
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,419
more detail about where it came from

244
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,610
it's a hardy plant right so it's it's

245
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:45,860
from the nether regions of Russia it's

246
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:49,220
got small stomata on the bottom of the

247
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:53,990
leaf that makes it less less likely to

248
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:56,210
get molds and and pests which is just

249
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:00,350
helpful to any home grower especially a

250
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:01,820
new grower any any extra you know points

251
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,000
to your advantage you're going to take

252
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,100
because sometimes the plants just feel

253
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,889
like they take forever and you've got so

254
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,480
much invested in it as a home grower I

255
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:12,949
mean so I'm sure you've got you know the

256
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,300
things that you purchased and you're

257
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,050
using the room in your house or in your

258
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:19,609
yard but also home growers are very

259
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:22,039
emotionally involved with the plants and

260
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,289
I know it myself firsthand and they're

261
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,789
like adding extra kids into your house

262
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:26,649
we're like your you know the unzipped

263
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:29,919
attending

264
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:31,480
morning everybody no this is not a

265
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,599
comment and you groan at home you know

266
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,759
you've done this and so when we have

267
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,740
that kind of an emotional connection

268
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:42,100
with the plan because we're only growing

269
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,808
four or eight plants using Auto flowers

270
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,920
are helpful because it makes the entire

271
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:50,588
process more manageable and lastly

272
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,748
they're easier to fit in a tent so you

273
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,279
know growing in tents are fine and you

274
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:59,139
know we can top our plants to keep them

275
00:10:54,278 --> 00:11:01,299
short but there is something really nice

276
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:03,970
about being able to choose you know

277
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:06,039
between two and four Auto flowers and a

278
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,499
four by four ten can grow those all at

279
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,748
the same time instead of committing to

280
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:12,550
one or maybe a second plant that are

281
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:14,678
going to become monsters in a four by

282
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:16,479
four tent because you've got less

283
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:18,519
Shimabara choice it's got less strain

284
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,558
choice when when the stuff comes out of

285
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,619
the jars you won't have as much variety

286
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:27,519
to smoke so for me I find that I'm

287
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:30,670
really enjoying growing for autos in

288
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:35,289
soil in a 4x4 tent instead of one plant

289
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:37,419
that's going to be really large also

290
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:39,549
they're easier to hide in your yard and

291
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:41,049
that's important right because look for

292
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:42,609
those of us who live in neighborhoods we

293
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:45,039
want to be respectful for our neighbors

294
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,289
and more importantly if we are growing

295
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:50,438
in a state where cannabis is not allowed

296
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:53,438
or if you know we've got picky neighbors

297
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:55,568
or we've got neighbors who will want to

298
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:57,879
smoke all of our weed we just don't want

299
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:59,438
them to know right and so one of the

300
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,778
beauties is these plants are you know

301
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:03,789
generally shorter there is a lot of

302
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:06,278
variety as I said at the beginning about

303
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:08,558
you know between the seeds so I have

304
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:10,899
seen plans that top out at two feet

305
00:12:08,558 --> 00:12:13,659
consistently but I've also got other

306
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:15,938
plants that top out at four four and a

307
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:17,649
half feet consistently and the crazy

308
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:20,169
thing is is I've used some folk seeds

309
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:21,818
and and within the same pack some will

310
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:23,740
top out at two feet and some will top

311
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:25,240
out at 4 feet so that's some of the

312
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,339
variability that you've got to look for

313
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,318
when you're buying seeds and and before

314
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:32,170
you commit to a lot of any particular

315
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:34,899
seed make sure you do are you know

316
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:37,479
ten or whatever - before you go ahead

317
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:40,240
and do a whole field of it

318
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,100
they're also smaller size meaning that

319
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,480
they're going to produce less smell for

320
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,490
your neighbors if that's a concern for

321
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,899
you especially if you're an apartment

322
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,480
building or you're living in these like

323
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:52,240
you know tall thin townhouses where

324
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,090
everybody is in really odiferous ly

325
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,850
close let's say and so you know it's a

326
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,129
smaller plant but because it grows so

327
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:04,060
swiftly you can do two rounds of small

328
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:06,279
plants to replace what you may have done

329
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:08,409
before trying to do one large plant

330
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:09,939
during during the season but the great

331
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:11,559
thing is is that even though they are

332
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,870
smaller plans and you're going to get

333
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,689
less overall turf stupid the neighbors

334
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:19,299
the terms on the plants can be very

335
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,760
excellent and again this is a variable

336
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:24,039
thing that not all breeders are at the

337
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,169
same place with the lines that they are

338
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:29,589
working they're certainly standout

339
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:30,969
breeders in the scene right now and so

340
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,350
it's important to know though that even

341
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,700
though I'm saying you're your neighbors

342
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,080
won't complain as much about their

343
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,520
terpenes it doesn't mean that the

344
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,639
turbines are poor it just means if a

345
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,710
plant is smaller next they're easier to

346
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,169
hang to dry now you know some people

347
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,910
like to take their their large monster

348
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:48,250
trees maybe cut them in half and just

349
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,750
you know hang them in long rows but most

350
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:54,279
home growers don't have that kind of

351
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:56,289
space and certainly you can take a tree

352
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:58,959
and hack it down to individual branches

353
00:13:56,289 --> 00:14:00,879
and hang all of those but when push

354
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:04,090
comes to shove a home growers are almost

355
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,740
always short on space the picture that

356
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:09,940
you see here is actually my own bedroom

357
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:12,730
last summer and and so I pull my my my

358
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,560
stock and hung them above my bedroom

359
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,450
because I live in a one-bedroom house

360
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,329
right and that's that's what I had and

361
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:21,940
and the only space of my house that was

362
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:24,730
not being used actively was the airspace

363
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,700
above my bed and so that's what you get

364
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,759
note to self I'm not doing that this

365
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,759
year

366
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:36,210
because I realized that this is totally

367
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,389
a JV error but I realized that when you

368
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:43,230
cut plans and you hang them during the

369
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:46,259
first week all of the inhabitants come

370
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,149
down so I was getting crab spiders and

371
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:50,399
other spiders and who knows what and

372
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:52,409
they were all repelling down into my bed

373
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,699
has a plant was dying as it was supposed

374
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:58,259
to and that's so sketch and and if you

375
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,990
wanna you don't want it like really

376
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:02,549
repress or significant other you know

377
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,500
explain to them that there's gonna be

378
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:06,659
repelling spiders coming down into the

379
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,899
bed it's just 10 days baby so gonna be

380
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:12,089
okay

381
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:14,429
so it's also great because you know a

382
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:16,530
lot of us who are home growing you know

383
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:17,699
we're working a lot of hours and there's

384
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:21,000
just no question that the otter

385
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,640
flowering plants take less work that the

386
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,950
cycle is shorter they're not as big I

387
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,470
mean they're you can you can easily call

388
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,940
them cute right and because of that they

389
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,279
really just take a lot less maintenance

390
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,960
and you know growing regs you know I

391
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:36,480
have been in the situation where I'm

392
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,310
working my day job and then maybe I meet

393
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,629
a friend after work for a moment and

394
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:41,339
then I go home and the rest of my

395
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:44,519
evening could be in the garden just

396
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:46,620
making sure that this this reg plan of

397
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,059
mine that which is which I'm all in on

398
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,259
right so I'm only going to get one round

399
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:54,119
you know it's going to be in good shape

400
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:55,950
but with the auto flowers I find that

401
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,929
I'm spending a lot more time just

402
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:01,259
sitting around with them looking at them

403
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:03,209
enjoying being a cultivator and being

404
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:05,490
able to interact with for me as my

405
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:08,160
medicine and a brain injury in 2011 and

406
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:11,009
so I think that there is something very

407
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:14,309
heartfelt about growing your own plants

408
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:18,299
and and Auto flowers give you more of

409
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:21,379
the enjoyment and less of a hassle so um

410
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:21,379
let's see here

411
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,120
alright so that is it for home growers

412
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,919
let's move on to a subset of home

413
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,350
growers which is going to be patients

414
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,719
and this is actually where I spend most

415
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,129
of my time working with patients on

416
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,560
Ashland Island where I live and

417
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:42,570
traveling the country to talk to doctors

418
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:46,019
and naturopaths about how to use can

419
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:48,660
have an empathic medicine so so patients

420
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:50,579
of course really enjoy all of the stuff

421
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:52,139
that we've already mentioned about home

422
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,639
growers all that stuff easily cross

423
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:55,850
applies to patients who are growing at

424
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:59,129
home but the reason why I was originally

425
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:02,879
attracted to Auto Flowers is because the

426
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:06,000
compactness and the lack of deficiency

427
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,559
just makes their less work for a patient

428
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,420
to do which is important because a

429
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,849
patient is mostly trying to cultivate

430
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,440
themselves right they are spending their

431
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:15,659
time going to the doctor or making sure

432
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,549
they're taking their meds or sleeping a

433
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,220
lot or whatever they have to do for

434
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:22,409
whatever they need relief from which

435
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,480
leaves them less time for the plants and

436
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:27,390
the fact that they are so easy to take

437
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,680
care of is is a wonderful thing also a

438
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,870
lot of patients that I work with have

439
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,810
got decreased mobility right so how is

440
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:36,629
the patient gonna like harvest an 8 9 10

441
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:38,909
foot plan it's very difficult to do and

442
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,170
it creates a challenge that just doesn't

443
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,790
need to be overcome

444
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,310
same with trying to hang these types of

445
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:47,269
plants the compactness of an auto flower

446
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:52,169
plant really makes it just perfect for

447
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:54,509
for a patient grower so we will just hit

448
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,970
on that and move on so let's talk about

449
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:59,279
commercial scale growers so the first

450
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,350
time I saw a commercial scale grow was

451
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,910
last summer when I visited I actually

452
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:05,519
had been two years ago now when I

453
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,980
visited of Oregon's CBD seeds in Albany

454
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,529
and you know I've seen pictures of

455
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,390
fields of cannabis from you know you

456
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:15,899
know Pakistan or Afghanistan and you

457
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:18,330
look at and you know as a enthusiastic

458
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,640
STONER I'm all like I would love to

459
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:22,379
smell that field right you know you know

460
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,600
they say that in the old days in India

461
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,730
they would they would get naked and run

462
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:29,599
through the plants and collect the

463
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:32,870
Shara's on their nude skin and

464
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:34,490
love it off their skin and then and then

465
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:38,959
start that with the hash and I'm all

466
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:40,700
signed me up you know and so it's not an

467
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,009
opportunity that we've had but when I

468
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:47,660
went to visit the Crawford brothers down

469
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:49,160
at their farm I was all like you know I

470
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,200
really the fields right there nobody's

471
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,490
out here we've got seven acres I could

472
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,370
probably get covered with something or

473
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,200
other you know and so I'm but but you

474
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:59,329
know joking aside it was it was powerful

475
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,420
emotionally I was there two weeks before

476
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:04,789
harvest and the entire aroma of their

477
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:07,130
their RNA the really nice Otto strain

478
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:09,190
that they do that's high in CBD it was

479
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:12,170
powerful right we all know that the Terp

480
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,539
profiles of cannabis are there to put us

481
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,670
in a good mood to stimulate us to to

482
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:18,970
soothe our endocannabinoid system and

483
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:21,500
when you're when you're standing in

484
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,140
fields of it and having that experience

485
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,269
it's it's pretty fantastic so there are

486
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,460
definitely advantages for commercial

487
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:31,190
growers so number one is their compact

488
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,950
size now there is no question that there

489
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:37,670
are certain commercial growers who are

490
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:39,740
going for monster plants and honestly

491
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:41,509
that we're getting to be the time where

492
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,789
that's going to be more about prestige

493
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:47,779
and marketing and Instagram photos than

494
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:51,139
it is more about getting the most out of

495
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:53,480
your acreage because if you can do two

496
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:58,040
rounds in the same location and have the

497
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,960
plants be compact and easier to work

498
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:02,930
with it just increases your efficiency

499
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,910
and I'm one of the first people to go

500
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:07,519
that efficiency because I'm all about

501
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,890
artists and growers right but I also

502
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,440
know it's unrealistic to think that that

503
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,990
the the industry is going to be only be

504
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,900
artists and growers especially with the

505
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:20,000
like wicked fast onset of hemp grown

506
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,340
right and so if people are going to be

507
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,069
doing acres and acres and acres of him

508
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:27,439
if you were to try to do that with all

509
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:29,419
10-foot plants it would be a real pain

510
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,490
in the ass at the end of the season but

511
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:34,039
if you are instead harvesting a whole

512
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,569
bunch of three footers suddenly if

513
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,730
you've left enough room between the rows

514
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,859
you can just pull down

515
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:41,500
sled and chop and drop the chop and drop

516
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:44,649
and it makes it very efficient and you

517
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,419
have repeatable results now there's

518
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,780
certainly smaller and larger Kingdom

519
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:52,809
ours right if you like the idea of the

520
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:55,178
uniformity of the uniformity of the

521
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:57,639
plant but you really feel kind of

522
00:20:55,179 --> 00:21:00,870
disgusted philosophically by three-foot

523
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,490
plants so go find yourself a bunch of

524
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:05,619
seeds that will grown between four and

525
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,390
five so that you feel like they look

526
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:09,459
more like the plants that you're used to

527
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,650
and you'll be getting more yield off

528
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,798
those plants generally speaking anyways

529
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:18,130
just because they're larger size one big

530
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:20,168
advantage to using autos for for

531
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:24,130
commercial is that there is almost never

532
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:26,290
a need to cage or steak for two reasons

533
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,780
number one they don't get as monstrous

534
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:33,279
as some of the trees do from regular

535
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:35,950
plants but also because they're crossed

536
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,678
with ruderalis and genetics these are

537
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,830
like strong like balloonist Siberian

538
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,540
Russian genetics and and all the autumn

539
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:45,490
flowers that I've had even the ones that

540
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:49,298
were kind of crappy you know from from

541
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:52,329
from folks they all had uniformly thick

542
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:55,929
stalks and and so with the thick stalk

543
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:57,970
and they're a bit shorter and just

544
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:59,650
because they lit they think they exist

545
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,360
in the world a shorter period of time

546
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:05,470
you're not going to get the same yield

547
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:09,668
you it's really nice not to have to cage

548
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:15,490
them and then uncage them as as steps in

549
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:17,770
your commercial cultivation it's also

550
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,298
nice that that plants treated the same

551
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,829
will likely grow in the same you know

552
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:23,230
there aren't a lot of red seeds that you

553
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:25,449
can get that while the genetics

554
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,039
themselves may be stable where whereas

555
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:30,880
they're gonna smell and look the same

556
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:34,298
they a lot of them still act differently

557
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,620
when you actually pop the seed and I

558
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:37,900
know at the beginning I said you know

559
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:41,769
there's a lot of there can be a lot of

560
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:44,048
variability within one seed pack that's

561
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:44,720
why this is still an evolving part of

562
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:46,970
the industry

563
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,250
I'm not here to tell you that that this

564
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,630
is a complete system and this is down

565
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,210
and you can just walk away from your

566
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:55,850
regs what I'm saying is is depending on

567
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,740
what your needs are especially if you're

568
00:22:55,849 --> 00:23:00,079
a hemp cultivator you should really

569
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,759
consider Auto flours and get yourself

570
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,490
some trial seeds and start educating

571
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:07,490
yourself because you know there are very

572
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:09,230
good you know there's a very good case

573
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,929
to be made that auto flours are the

574
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,000
future of commercial cannabis and the

575
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:16,340
large monster plants are going to become

576
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,579
things that we grow for

577
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:21,709
artisanal reasons and just for vanity

578
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:27,019
because it's still cool to show off

579
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:28,460
pictures of like a 10-foot plant so it's

580
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:33,339
also really great if you're going to be

581
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:39,500
doing something indoors and outdoors so

582
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:42,500
we all know how fast how fickle the

583
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,599
buying the buyers are right if they

584
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,980
won't it just they'll come to the store

585
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:47,298
and they'll say I would like you know

586
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,710
this and they get something and they

587
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:49,908
come back and the bunch under says you

588
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,400
want that again they're like no it was

589
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:53,630
great give me something else well you

590
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,059
already said you like the first thing

591
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,650
yeah but I'm expanding my palate one of

592
00:23:56,058 --> 00:24:00,558
the great things about Auto flours is

593
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:04,220
that they cycle so quickly you can be

594
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:07,490
bringing new flavors onto the market in

595
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,860
half the time and that really means

596
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:13,460
something especially if you're working

597
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:17,298
with retailers who want the new new and

598
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:19,279
if you know we've all run into the

599
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:22,759
situation where the retailer says listen

600
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,798
you can't keep product on my shelf 365

601
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:26,450
and because you can't I'm going to give

602
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,788
it to somebody else who can keep product

603
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:31,700
on my shelf all the time well if that's

604
00:24:28,788 --> 00:24:35,808
the case instead of you're doing one big

605
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:39,288
run of rags and then your harvest date

606
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:40,819
just gets older and older and older what

607
00:24:39,288 --> 00:24:43,220
you're doing what you can do instead is

608
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:46,119
run Auto flowers and the harvesting

609
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,430
these things every 60 or 90 days and

610
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:52,029
continually be pushing new

611
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:55,090
new flavors into the market and and

612
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:56,799
you're more dedicated buyers are gonna

613
00:24:55,089 --> 00:25:00,639
love that because they can stay brand

614
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:03,250
loyal to you and also they can be

615
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:13,480
exciting their palate and continuing and

616
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:16,119
changing ways oh yeah and one other

617
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,950
thing commercial growers you know I know

618
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:20,189
a lot of the speakers in this room today

619
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:23,069
have talked a lot of trash about

620
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:25,480
defoliating you know removing leaves and

621
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:28,029
and you know there that's I think that's

622
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,240
a worthwhile debate to have but people

623
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:32,980
are still doing it right and because

624
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,000
auto flowers tend to be a little more

625
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:38,289
open and give you a little more access

626
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,269
you know not all of them a lot of them

627
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:41,500
are will still be tight but generally

628
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:43,210
speaking they're a little more open

629
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,039
there's a lot less need to do foliate

630
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:50,579
four four get to get air in and to allow

631
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:53,920
light to get to get to the lowers and

632
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:56,079
the big thing is is that no doubt one of

633
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,310
the most attractive attributes of Auto

634
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:01,720
flowers are that most of the big

635
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:03,970
providers of seeds are also feminizing

636
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,620
them and you know whether or not you

637
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:07,900
like feminized seeds that can be a whole

638
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:09,909
secondary debate and also another seed

639
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,160
that is coming back from a from a

640
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,230
difficult reputation but if we're

641
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,710
talking about the people we have so far

642
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:19,809
home growers patient growers and

643
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:22,809
commercial scale acreage growers all of

644
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:24,879
them love feminized seeds the only folks

645
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:27,879
who would really be pushing against this

646
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,650
our folks who are attracted to the old

647
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,540
ways and the old school and they and

648
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:34,750
they want these these these taller seeds

649
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:36,490
or maybe they just love cloning so so

650
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,750
let's talk about where Auto flowers came

651
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,940
from because we're starting to get an

652
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:44,589
idea that they might be very useful in

653
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:47,110
some situations so here is a map of

654
00:26:44,589 --> 00:26:49,899
Russia and you can see up towards the

655
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:53,769
top of Russia there that's the Arctic

656
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,450
Ocean and it's cold there and it gets

657
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:58,179
they get snow there

658
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:59,919
and so what we found was that rules was

659
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:02,769
first identified and described in the

660
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,500
early 1900s and it was found along the

661
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:08,528
whole river system in Russia and many

662
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,329
say that the it is its own species but

663
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:12,609
that is also something that's up for

664
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:15,369
debate it certainly acts a lot different

665
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:17,138
than cannabis sativa but really the

666
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:20,859
jury's still out on that

667
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:23,528
the original plant was it had no little

668
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:25,240
an insignificant amount of THC it was

669
00:27:23,528 --> 00:27:26,919
there but but he would smoke it and

670
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,339
nothing would happen and the terpene

671
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,750
profile was like kind of a kinder dirt

672
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:33,548
but what they found was that it was

673
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:36,250
super Hardy and that there was the

674
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:39,579
important part they're growing it or it

675
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:43,359
was growing feral in like really bad

676
00:27:39,579 --> 00:27:48,519
rocky soil and and because of where it's

677
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:52,418
located of in northern Russia it was it

678
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:54,519
had adapted to a wicked short potential

679
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:58,600
growing season because it's winter most

680
00:27:54,519 --> 00:28:00,509
of the time there and also during the

681
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:02,740
time that the plant would be growing

682
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:04,990
depending exactly where you are in

683
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,630
Russia you're very likely to have 24

684
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:09,308
hours of daylight then and so scientists

685
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:11,740
are saying that you know chances are

686
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:14,138
that between the short opportunity for

687
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:17,829
growth during the summer and also the

688
00:28:14,138 --> 00:28:20,379
inclement weather and the the poor soil

689
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:23,579
quality low nutrients that this kind of

690
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,870
combination pact these auto flower

691
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:29,199
characteristics into a plant that was

692
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:33,278
just waiting to become raw material for

693
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,778
for breeders nowadays one of the other

694
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,740
things that I thought was interesting oh

695
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:37,089
I guess I already gave you the

696
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,849
information the slide will go through a

697
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:42,490
real quick short summers it was great

698
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:44,500
for Rome it didn't have THC and life

699
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:45,909
cycles are 60 90 and 120 but they

700
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,849
actually the reason why I put this slide

701
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:54,490
in here is for that photo so so that is

702
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:57,879
a huge feel of cannabis it's not autos

703
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,380
but it's in Pakistan and since we were

704
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,820
talking about Siberia in winter I just

705
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:04,539
wanted to point out that what

706
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:09,069
this picture is is the first heavy snow

707
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:11,919
in Pakistan on this small community and

708
00:29:09,069 --> 00:29:15,638
they let the first snow lay on their

709
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:18,639
plants to make them cold and then they

710
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:21,308
will cut them this day and go make a

711
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:23,678
shop so think about how we all are

712
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:28,599
making with ice water hash right they're

713
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:31,720
making snow hash so so anyway it's on

714
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:33,849
topic but whatever it's cool so let's

715
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,589
talk about objections to Auto flowers I

716
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:38,079
feel like this is pretty much what I

717
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:40,388
have done for the last year since I like

718
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:43,808
came out of the closet as an auto flower

719
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:46,359
lover because you know everybody has

720
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:48,278
their thing they hate about Auto powers

721
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:51,250
and you know a lot of them live it's

722
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:53,109
pretty legit most of it though is just

723
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:56,500
precious so let's say numbers number one

724
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:58,928
it's not a large size this is my friend

725
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,480
Matt storm and emerald feingold organics

726
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:05,288
and humbled standing next to one of his

727
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:08,950
typical plants right absolute monster

728
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:12,960
people love this right I would say

729
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:16,778
anybody loves this who's into cannabis

730
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,879
but dudes really love this this kind of

731
00:30:16,778 --> 00:30:20,470
like monstrous bowel thing that they

732
00:30:18,878 --> 00:30:24,069
created and then will then get them

733
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:27,659
stone right a lot of dudes push back

734
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:31,898
against Auto flowers as being cute

735
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:33,519
elegant dismissible and and they just

736
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:35,619
need to kind of get over that if they're

737
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,538
going to interact with Auto flowers you

738
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:38,709
know do they have to no but it is a

739
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:41,888
common objection

740
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:44,319
but it's only me it only matters if you

741
00:30:41,888 --> 00:30:46,569
are really kind of emotionally connected

742
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,970
with growing a monster plant I mean

743
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:51,128
everybody likes bragging rights right

744
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:53,048
but for me after after meeting Auto

745
00:30:51,128 --> 00:30:55,959
flowers I realized that I would much

746
00:30:53,048 --> 00:30:59,558
rather be bragging about the killer

747
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:02,019
terpene profile and then then the size

748
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:03,638
of the plant especially when you bring

749
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:07,000
it back to the fact that I work so much

750
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:09,939
with patients also it limits horizontal

751
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,029
space so you need to go up right let's

752
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,830
say that you have

753
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:17,720
a canapé limitations in whatever state

754
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:20,169
you're in and so you can only get so

755
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:24,350
wide well if you can only get so wide

756
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:26,450
growing double the auto flower plans may

757
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,869
not be a workable business decision for

758
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,880
you

759
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:31,009
even with two cycles you're gonna have

760
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,380
to work that out for yourself but if you

761
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:34,700
can go up well then there's gonna be a

762
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,130
really good case for you to stick with

763
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,049
regular seeds that are going to be extra

764
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:41,150
fall because not only do you get the

765
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:42,950
with space you get the vertical space as

766
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,990
well you know Auto flowers don't have an

767
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:47,150
answer to that but I got to tell you the

768
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:51,529
people that that applies to is very

769
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:53,390
small and and may not include you also

770
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:56,839
some people are all like all right oddly

771
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:58,310
shaped flowers and it's true you know it

772
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:02,319
really depends on whose seeds that you

773
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:05,509
buy and there's a lot of people breeding

774
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:07,369
OTO seeds right now and I've seen a

775
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:08,809
handful of different types of flowers

776
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:11,329
you know I would say most of them look

777
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:14,329
just like you would think a regular

778
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:17,419
flower look but some of them show more

779
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:19,879
of the ruderalis in them and a lot of

780
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,769
them will look like kinda like fox

781
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,690
Cailin for those of you who know that is

782
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:27,019
there's kind of like comb out and he's

783
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:31,190
kind of like jagged foxtails

784
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:32,690
and so and people look at that and like

785
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:34,490
what what plant is this as a matter

786
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:38,269
going to give a patient on Vashon Island

787
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:41,150
who won some Auto flower seeds from I

788
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:43,670
guess I won't say who and and they grew

789
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:46,880
them this summer and she sent me a

790
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:49,370
picture and she said is this is this

791
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,780
okay is this smokeable and I said well

792
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:52,819
how does it smell if she says smells

793
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:53,180
fantastic I said I think you're in good

794
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:55,970
shape

795
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:58,310
you know like dry it and go for it and

796
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,799
and so it was just that that that one

797
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:03,859
moment of like is this the same cannabis

798
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,259
that I grew up with and so as the seeds

799
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:08,779
develop a little bit more in their looks

800
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:10,879
and and you know as these lines get more

801
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:13,129
stable you know so occasionally you

802
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,290
might run into oddly shaped flowers a

803
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,560
lot of people say I can't breed with

804
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:19,680
them yeah that's

805
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,720
true right certainly you're gonna run

806
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,210
into more challenges trying to breed

807
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,890
from a feminized Auto flower but I'll

808
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,900
tell you man I am you know when I when

809
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:30,270
I've had events now people hand me rag

810
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,620
seeds of autos all the time now and if

811
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:34,230
you've got boys and girls and you're a

812
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:36,179
willing to up your research game there

813
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:39,269
is a lot of fun then you can have

814
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,769
greeting Auto flowers and and your you

815
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:42,660
can even be doing this just as a home

816
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:44,730
grower you know and so there's there's a

817
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,860
lot of fun to fun to have they're so so

818
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:49,410
people are saying yeah you can't breed

819
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:51,629
with them what it means more is that you

820
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:53,400
just need to up your game on how to

821
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,940
breed it's not it's not quite as simple

822
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,940
as rent

823
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,800
so we've hit on this one server already

824
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:03,989
but um low-yield is still an issue as

825
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:06,000
well and again it's really about the

826
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:08,639
seeds that you choose and so do your

827
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,869
research in advance but you know over

828
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,329
the you know when you when you add

829
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:14,489
together the the two cycles and that

830
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:17,069
they're so much more convenient and if

831
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:20,879
you find the right seeds for you you'll

832
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:23,730
maybe a non-issue for you but it is

833
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:26,190
legit that the plants are smaller and on

834
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:30,030
some of the plants the spacing between

835
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:32,190
the flowers are a little wider you don't

836
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:34,800
know your genetics it's not just they

837
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:37,760
buy and go it's about educating yourself

838
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,860
about your purchase before you move full

839
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,899
forward and then also there's there is

840
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,579
still some variability from seed to seed

841
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:47,309
that we talked about about and you know

842
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:49,319
this is this legitimate concern but it's

843
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:51,809
not like these people are saying you

844
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,320
know Otto flowers suck they've got low

845
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:54,029
yield

846
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,269
you can't breed with them they're small

847
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:59,940
and they taste like crap well those

848
00:34:57,269 --> 00:35:02,789
attributes might be true about some

849
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:06,450
small subset of the seeds in each

850
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:08,429
category but anything that is got all of

851
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:09,659
those is not being sold on the market

852
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:11,940
anymore because that's not what the

853
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:14,579
market demands there are plenty of

854
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,769
really good readers you know even right

855
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,630
here in Oregon that are selling premium

856
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:19,199
seeds that will you know cause you to be

857
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,470
overjoyed

858
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:27,089
whether you are a home grower a patient

859
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:29,549
or cultivating at mass size so

860
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:31,680
next steps let's say that you are now

861
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:34,640
elated by Otto flowers and you want to

862
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:37,559
know more these are some of the

863
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:39,690
companies that I have personally ground

864
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:41,789
their gear and had great success with

865
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:44,550
Oregon CVD right here in Oregon

866
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:47,400
Mephisto is is regarded by most to be

867
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:49,500
you know top tier zero zero seed bank

868
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,960
out of Spain just started shipping into

869
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,940
the United States and they've got US

870
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,380
distributors now a new upstart that is

871
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,440
great Sebring seeds

872
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:01,440
this guy is a rather radical Pro patient

873
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,050
grower he makes his seeds and he sends

874
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,720
them to patients across the country for

875
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:08,430
the cost of shipping just badass right

876
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,849
and that's one of the things that I like

877
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:15,419
about working with Auto flour people the

878
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:18,360
green rush has not hit the auto flour

879
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:20,789
scene as much as it hit the rag scene

880
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:24,570
and there's still a lot of people who

881
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:26,639
are really doing they're growing from

882
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,230
their front end and growing and trading

883
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:29,699
from their art not saying that's not

884
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,590
true stolen right I got lots of great

885
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:33,809
friends who are eggs but but but there's

886
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:36,660
so many red seats being bought when you

887
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:39,750
see what it feels like an emerald cup in

888
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:41,909
the seed tent you can feel that it has

889
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,289
changed a little bit and and that's you

890
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:46,859
don't really get that from the auto

891
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:49,469
flower folks as much unless I wasn't

892
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:51,900
able to get his logo up but you could be

893
00:36:49,469 --> 00:36:54,059
sure that when this video goes on the on

894
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,050
the You Tube channel the logo will be

895
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:57,269
there

896
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:59,400
mandalorian genetics you can find him on

897
00:36:57,269 --> 00:37:00,809
Instagram too I called him and I told

898
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,079
him I said dude I got to give you some

899
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:06,509
kind of award for termination rates he

900
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,670
sent a bunch of seeds for us to spread

901
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:10,680
around all of the patients on Vashon on

902
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:13,230
where I live and our termination rates

903
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:15,809
were a hundred four hundred and nobody

904
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,340
else that sent seeds was a hundred four

905
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:20,940
hundred and didn't think about it -

906
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:22,890
these are patients who barely know what

907
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:26,059
they're doing in many cases and they're

908
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:28,909
still popping and so we're big fans

909
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:30,710
of mandalorian so if you want to get

910
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:34,309
educated I am going to repeat the same

911
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:37,400
forum that Jeff suggested earlier today

912
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:39,799
which is Auto flower Network net this is

913
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,110
the home of Auto flowers and it's a

914
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:45,320
really cute story too because you know

915
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:48,980
Auto flower people wanted to participate

916
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:52,400
in the regular cannabis growing forums

917
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:54,949
and they were ridiculed and made fun of

918
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,320
and like as you can imagine in that kind

919
00:37:54,949 --> 00:37:59,179
of environment and so a few years back

920
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,400
they said alright forget it we're gonna

921
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:02,899
take you no we're gonna take our Auto

922
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,590
flowers we're gonna go set up our own

923
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:08,960
sandbox and so they did an auto flower

924
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:13,190
dotnet was born and that is a great

925
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,920
place to get reviews of seeds and seed

926
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,990
companies learn some tricks that people

927
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,480
have learned about growing Auto flowers

928
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:22,369
and you know if you really want to get

929
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,949
steeped into it if you are a cannabis

930
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:27,380
you know enthusiast to the nerd level

931
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:30,859
this is where you want to go for the for

932
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:32,780
the premium premium info and finally it

933
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,849
would not be an auto flower presentation

934
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:38,150
without plugin Jeff's new book that

935
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:39,739
comes out on October 22nd I am very

936
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:42,139
grateful to have gotten an advance copy

937
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:45,109
and read it and it's a it's a good book

938
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:46,460
one thing to know about this book would

939
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,829
be besides the fact that you should buy

940
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:51,349
it is that if you're already a

941
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:53,960
professional grower this this book is

942
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:58,730
going to be much below your knowledge

943
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:01,519
set but if you have got family and they

944
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:03,230
are sick and you've encouraged them to

945
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,900
grow their cannabis so that they can

946
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:07,639
feel better or if they're just like bad

947
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,349
ass gardeners and they love working

948
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:11,239
their garden and they'd like to expand

949
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:14,029
their garden to something new and cool

950
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:16,219
and easy this book is just really great

951
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:18,980
it will bring anybody even people who

952
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:21,469
are resistant to cannabis along from the

953
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:23,389
very basics of cannabis and why you want

954
00:39:21,469 --> 00:39:26,509
to try Auto flowers and how to actually

955
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:28,699
do it so it's a great book comes out

956
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:32,720
October 22nd and if you want an easy

957
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:33,789
link to the pre-sale on Amazon you can

958
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,579
go to my Instagram

959
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:40,779
at shaking fire and there's a link to it

960
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:41,349
if you follow my profile link to it

961
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,869
today

962
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:46,839
alright so with that I've got four

963
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:49,570
minutes left and I'll take a couple

964
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,210
questions and since you know I'm

965
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:54,850
moderating the room and I'm the one who

966
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:58,179
was running the mic I guess I'm just

967
00:39:54,849 --> 00:40:00,299
gonna have you yellow it out so so yes

968
00:39:58,179 --> 00:40:00,299
sir

969
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:53,289
Amelie you try that again with different

970
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:56,769
words the only way to do it is to trial

971
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:58,539
right there there I would never suggest

972
00:40:56,769 --> 00:41:00,429
that you commit to a big purchase

973
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,349
without running a couple packs you know

974
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:03,368
yourself and for a lot of people who

975
00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:05,889
Auto followers are going to be

976
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:08,320
appropriate for they're growing for fun

977
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:10,269
and for smoke anyway and so for those

978
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,740
people to see some variation in the

979
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:13,179
plants that might actually be kind of

980
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:15,009
cool because you're comparing and

981
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:17,079
contrasting and that's pretty cool but

982
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:18,970
if you are growing either at the

983
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:21,579
commercial level either in the license

984
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:24,519
or the unlicensed market I would not

985
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:27,279
just jump into these I would say do a

986
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:29,889
run that's R&amp;D buy a bunch of different

987
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,830
packs and then just run them and then

988
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:34,569
after that use those data points to

989
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:36,549
either say this gives me the bud

990
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:39,400
structure I want so that I've got good

991
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:41,920
bag appeal and then there's other stuff

992
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,000
it may smell good and smoke good but

993
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
maybe that's going to go to my head

994
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:54,210
stash

995
00:41:43,920 --> 00:42:00,510
to move the other stuff is already gone

996
00:41:54,210 --> 00:42:02,010
into flowering stage so quick sure so

997
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:04,890
I'm gonna give you a better give you in

998
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:07,530
the the usual answer and then I'll tell

999
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:09,299
you that I'm probably wrong so so the

1000
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:10,769
youth the usual answer is that autumn

1001
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,390
flowers cannot be cloned because the

1002
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:15,000
stress immediately causes them to flower

1003
00:42:12,389 --> 00:42:16,710
in my experience that has happened every

1004
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,230
single time because even though I got

1005
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:22,380
the warning on the researcher I'm going

1006
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:24,389
to try it anyway right but when when I

1007
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:27,660
talk to like my heart or greeting

1008
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:29,069
friends right they'll say oh no you can

1009
00:42:27,659 --> 00:42:32,309
do that you know and we're trying this

1010
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:35,280
and so I'm thinking that the state of

1011
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:38,460
the art right now is that you may be

1012
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,310
able to clone and do some breeding magic

1013
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,960
with some of the lines right just

1014
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:46,679
but I'm only really basing that on

1015
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,720
second hand information but but you're

1016
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:50,609
right the rule of thumb though is that

1017
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,139
auto flowers are I can't be cloned

1018
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:55,710
because that stress causes of the flower

1019
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:57,539
so I might be like on photo period

1020
00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:00,599
defense but because I want to try Auto

1021
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:03,090
flowers for sure human Jeff abaut said

1022
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,659
you know six nine months this long

1023
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:09,300
period as well as for what for the

1024
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:13,230
period for photo period oh god plans to

1025
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:15,180
finish in giant plants and then also the

1026
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:16,590
the time the light needs to be on I

1027
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:20,519
think Jeff that reference is when I was

1028
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:22,170
20 22 even 24 hours on so if I don't

1029
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:25,170
have planet count I can select the right

1030
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:28,079
photo straight plant coming and so I'm

1031
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:28,829
going to plans eighty five six inch

1032
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,360
cubes or

1033
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:31,829
something right right straining being

1034
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,599
like sixty days or less

1035
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:35,610
I just want to emphasize like photos

1036
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,869
don't have to go or they don't have to

1037
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:39,000
be Giants there is a learning curve

1038
00:43:36,869 --> 00:43:40,679
there or like the Dutch table method I

1039
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,650
think it's called work you can grow a

1040
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:46,109
whole bunch of photos really squat and

1041
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:47,970
still have some attributes and there's a

1042
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:49,440
learning curve there too but I guess

1043
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:50,909
it's just because we're both preaching

1044
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,590
pretty hard on the photos don't have to

1045
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:54,599
be huge outdoors they get huge it's

1046
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:56,700
almost impossible but fully control must

1047
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:58,019
really know what you're doing well you

1048
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:01,769
said a lot of flowers you don't mean you

1049
00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:03,269
mean rags yeah yeah so alright so I get

1050
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:04,679
you I get way again what you're saying

1051
00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:06,239
and you're right

1052
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:08,159
rags are great too they shouldn't go

1053
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,539
away but it also isn't a question and

1054
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,799
since I'm making the case for Otto

1055
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:13,289
flowers I'm gonna use the worst case

1056
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,519
available wherever the ranks right so so

1057
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:16,529
you know there there are certainly

1058
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:19,349
having hell you mean you could if you

1059
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:21,120
wanted to keep your reg small you can do

1060
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:23,069
what I have to do in my my small or

1061
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,599
outdoor hoops was just like top though

1062
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,309
several times during the air so that

1063
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:28,710
your flowers don't end up you know

1064
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:29,909
getting wet from condensation so yeah I

1065
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:33,059
mean there's ways that you can manage

1066
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:34,259
your regs so that some of the downsides

1067
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:36,900
that Jeff and I were both talking about

1068
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,990
don't happen but but you know in general

1069
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:41,849
this was less a comparison of regs to

1070
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:47,219
auto flower in every situation and more

1071
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:49,739
like frickin try Auto flowers alright so

1072
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:52,949
so I've run out of time and I've got one

1073
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:56,279
more thing to say so so not for

1074
00:44:52,949 --> 00:45:00,389
commercial folks in the room but if you

1075
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:02,940
are a patient if you identify as a

1076
00:45:00,389 --> 00:45:05,940
patient and you grow for yourself for

1077
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:11,119
your own health stop by and see me

1078
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:13,800
because Mandalorian Sebring seeds and

1079
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,210
mountain rock farm from California I'll

1080
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,760
give you some packs to give away to

1081
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:19,769
authentic patients so if you've got a

1082
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,940
company go buy your seeds but if you're

1083
00:45:19,769 --> 00:45:22,980
a patient I've got something to give

1084
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,750
away so that's it if you want to show

1085
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:27,659
your friends this you can find it on the

1086
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:30,920
shaping fire youtube channel next week

1087
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:30,920
thank you very much I'm tangled

1088
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,820
you
