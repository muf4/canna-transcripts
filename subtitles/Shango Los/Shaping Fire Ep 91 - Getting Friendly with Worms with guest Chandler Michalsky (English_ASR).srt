00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,759
when i was growing up my dad often

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,638
repeated to me the famous adage by zig

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,199
zigler that you can get what you want by

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,278
helping enough people get what they want

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,439
the idea of course is that by helping

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:24,399
others reach their goals you create

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,839
value and the creation of value attracts

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,439
value for yourself from other sources

10
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,039
i was having the same thought about

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,840
worms the other day

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,160
much like humans worms want to eat well

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,840
have a safe place to live make out and

14
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:42,718
procreate and then repeat that process

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,079
for me to reach my goals in the garden i

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,640
also want my worms to be safe fed and

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,558
procreate so i prepare a place for them

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,039
in my garden that is responsive to their

19
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,519
biological needs and creates a living

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,439
environment for them to thrive

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,960
in turn they keep my living soil

22
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,519
thriving and fully functioning to

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,400
support my cannabis plants

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,118
in the end humans get what we want by

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,320
helping the worms get what they want and

26
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,680
that is a great relationship

27
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,199

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,598
project today we're going to talk about

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,280
worms during the first set we're going

62
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,280
to talk about worm physiology and

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,199
activity during the second set we will

64
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,439
describe a variety of applications and

65
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,719
preparations for worm castings and in

66
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,239
the last set we will get a better

67
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,400
understanding of how to set up worm bins

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,719
and worm piles to create your own

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
inexhaustible supply of worms

70
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,759
welcome to the show chandler

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,519
hey shango thanks for having me

72
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,239
excellent well let's get right into it

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,000
so

74
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,159
you know let's start by identifying the

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,719
attributes of worms that we find so

76
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,120
beneficial and you know i'll be first to

77
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,280
say that i'm a novice when it comes to

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,159
worm i haven't had a worm bin i just

79
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,919
know that worms are good for my soil and

80
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,639
so you know whenever i find them in the

81
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,799
yard i i put them in my pots right so so

82
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,919
i'm only really aware of what i think

83
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,879
are the two main advantages of worms and

84
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,518
that is

85
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:10,079
they're wiggling around aerates the soil

86
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,200
and then their poop which you know more

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,120
properly are known as castings but

88
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,119
but you know this entire episode is

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,879
pretty much about worm poop so let's

90
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:25,519
start there um why are the worm castings

91
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:28,399
themselves so nutritive for the soil

92
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,400
yeah so worms are absolutely amazing and

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,439
uh the castings from earthworms

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,158
contained from 5 to 11 times the amount

95
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,878
of available npk as the soil that the

96
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,039
worms ate to produce those castings and

97
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,039
so uh they'll eat this organic matter

98
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,120
either the mineral soil or the organic

99
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,439
matter all the leaf litter up on top and

100
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,519
they will just absolutely increase the

101
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,158
amount of available nutrients

102
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,519
for the plants and they do that by

103
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,639
grinding it up

104
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,959
and uh

105
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,598
there's a whole

106
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,039
thing the the anatomy of the worm but

107
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,959
basically they have like this gizzard

108
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:06,239
that's full of sand and little rock

109
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,400
particles and uh that they use that and

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,640
this long muscle um

111
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,120
to kind of grind up all the food scraps

112
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,279
that they're eating and uh get it into

113
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,358
small enough particles

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,079
that all of the microbes all the

115
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:22,399
bacteria and their intestine

116
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,800
can further break down those nutrients

117
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,719
and deliver available nutrients to the

118
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,319
worm and then everything else is just

119
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,400
excreted

120
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,879
in the castings and so it's a waste

121
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,719
product for the worm but it's absolutely

122
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,319
black gold for us

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,759
and uh vermicompost or worm castings are

124
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:44,159
50 higher in organic matter than soil

125
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,400
that has not been warmed whether has not

126
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,479
been worked through the worms and so

127
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:52,239
basically just that higher increase in

128
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:54,639
organic matter is going to increase

129
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,240
all the charge holding surfaces there

130
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,720
that's going to increase the cation

131
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,720
exchange capacity and so basically other

132
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,680
nutrients that are there in the soil can

133
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,919
then attach to the worm castings and be

134
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,079
right there available for the plant it's

135
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,839
it's interesting that you know we're all

136
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,478
in in in cannabis cultivation we're

137
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,519
always talking about you know adding or

138
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:18,159
improving the nutrients so that they are

139
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,478
plant available right and and there's a

140
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,680
lot of both discussion and straight up

141
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,199
arguments online about people you know

142
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,840
talking about whether or not this

143
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,080
additive or that additive is plant

144
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,478
available and it sounds like these worms

145
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,639
are just like a plant like available

146
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,879
nutrition machine like listen to you

147
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,199
describe it i'm like wow i would like to

148
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,719
take like you know like my everything

149
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,360
that's in my container garden and just

150
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,440
like run it through worms because it

151
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,000
sounds like whatever goes through them

152
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,918
comes out as an upgrade exactly it's a

153
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,519
huge upgrade so you got to think of like

154
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:52,879
the microbiome of everything so like

155
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,478
it's really easy to just see a worm and

156
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,759
think about it oh it's just a worm or

157
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,918
see a tree and think about it oh it's

158
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,960
just a tree but inside of that tree

159
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,279
there could be a hundred different

160
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,038
strains of fungi living in it you know

161
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,239
performing their various roles and like

162
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,240
that just goes

163
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,680
unthought of to most people but same

164
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,160
thing with the worm is they have their

165
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,680
own microbiome and so they're

166
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,960
inoculating everything that passes

167
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,600
through it and so

168
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,599
they are biology factors they are uh

169
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,639
like you know wiggling

170
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,400
communities of microbes and so that's

171
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,160
how we create these plant available

172
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,758
nutrients is by cycling them through

173
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
biology and so

174
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,038
it's uh like same as fermentation same

175
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,639
as composting it's uh returning

176
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,399
these fully grown

177
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,400
like proteins back to their peptides

178
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,638
back to their amino acids and creating

179
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,279
like the building blocks you know that

180
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,120
you can use to you know apply to any of

181
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,198
these other plants and it's an

182
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,560
incredible process for sure that's what

183
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,160
i was imagining when you when you

184
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,280
described it i'm like oh they're kind of

185
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,319
like doing

186
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,959
natural farming preps inside of

187
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,598
themselves 100 so so all of us who are

188
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,839
into you know natural farming and knf

189
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:02,560
like you know

190
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,000
worms are a clear win for us because

191
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,560
they are doing

192
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,120
a similar kind of work that we do when

193
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,199
we're making these preps um but they're

194
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,319
doing it 24 7. right

195
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,000
right and

196
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,879
free

197
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,519
so

198
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,839
so let's talk about what they're eating

199
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,719
because um

200
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,359
i believe that they eat some of the food

201
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,319
scraps but i also believe that they

202
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,038
eat perhaps microbes and like pathogens

203
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,479
so

204
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,598
they're they're

205
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,000
they're also cleaning the soil yeah yep

206
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,839
and so okay so there are like 7 000

207
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,360
known species of earthworms around the

208
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,598
world and so

209
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,479
uh that being said there's only about 16

210
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,719
or so that are well studied and deemed

211
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,478
like good for composting good for for

212
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,520
gardening and whatnot

213
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,519
that are

214
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,198
highly understood but uh

215
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,439
the rest of them there's so many worms

216
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,280
out there but yeah it's very true they

217
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,399
do eat the organic matter but mainly

218
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,159
they are eating

219
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,318
the microbes that are breaking down that

220
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,240
organic matter so they're eating mainly

221
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,960
the bacteria but also the fungi the

222
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,000
nematodes uh the protozoa

223
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,359
um

224
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,519
everything that's breaking down these

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,479
food scraps and that organic matter and

226
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,719
then

227
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:14,719
uh

228
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,079
yeah they uh they add the calcium

229
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,560
carbonate um in their gut and

230
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,478
all of that uh

231
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,319
all those microbes that are you know

232
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,478
doing their thing and so their castings

233
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,080
are full of that calcium but full of all

234
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,080
the the nutrients that the

235
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,320
the feedstock contained but now in a

236
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,640
plant-available form that's been cycled

237
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,599
through the the biology and so like

238
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,718
it's a popular comparison and um

239
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,440
what is it

240
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,360
the teeming with microbes

241
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,399
they compare

242
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,919
um

243
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,919
like bacteria

244
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,759
to bags of fertilizer

245
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,919
basically you have these microbes that

246
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,519
are mining minerals out of the soil and

247
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,278
then they become

248
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,440
bags of fertilizer they have all those

249
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:04,559
nutrients within themselves and then you

250
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,480
have these plants that are attracting

251
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,399
that bacteria and those microbes up to

252
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,000
the root zone so they can

253
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,720
drink the exudates that the plant is

254
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,399
producing for those microbes and so the

255
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,480
plant attracts the certain microbes that

256
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,120
it needs that you know contains the

257
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,159
certain nutrients that it needs and then

258
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,560
a larger

259
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,639
trophic level organism will come in it's

260
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,119
like protists and nematodes will come in

261
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,360
and they will eat that bacteria and they

262
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,959
will take what they need and you know

263
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,959
leave the rest and so they rip open that

264
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,359
bag of fertilizer right there in the

265
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,879
root zone and so

266
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,720
that's how it's plant available is

267
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,838
because the bacteria worked through it

268
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,000
and so like

269
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,080
the mineral itself before the bacteria

270
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,278
worked through it and then was you know

271
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,519
ripped apart

272
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,360
is not plants available so you need that

273
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,039
biology and so that's how nutrient

274
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,720
cycling works and so

275
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,799
when we feed um

276
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,399
our plants with synthetic salt-based

277
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,199
fertilizers

278
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,799
uh it disrupts that natural cycle that

279
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,959
you know is billions of years old and so

280
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,399
you get these plants that no longer need

281
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,639
to you know take some of their

282
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,159
photosynthetic energy and put it down

283
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,600
specifically to feed the microbes

284
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,679
because they say oh that's a whole lot

285
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,600
of work why would i do that when you

286
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,879
know the farmer can just give me

287
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,879
the synthetic

288
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,039
fertilizer that i can just uptake right

289
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,600
away and so

290
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:26,639
you might see some results by feeding

291
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,839
with synthetics for a while

292
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,078
but

293
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,959
that does not last long term and you're

294
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,199
actually going to dumb down your plants

295
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,639
you're going to dumb down your microbes

296
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,560
you're going to make your plants

297
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,879
literally like

298
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,319
reliant on that chemical fertilizer

299
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,480
every time because they no longer know

300
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,800
what they need to do

301
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
sounds like you make lazy soil that way

302
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,559
and

303
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,879
by you know involving the worms

304
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,109
choosing to not use salts

305
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,600
and to

306
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,278
[Music]

307
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,600
encourage the soil food web that is you

308
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,278
know pretty much at the at the base of

309
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,120
regenerative farming

310
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,360
um we are

311
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,240
maximizing our

312
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,440
um substrate's ability to do all of the

313
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,278
things that we wanted to do so it's in

314
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,680
very active communication between the

315
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,720
plant and the rhizosphere and all the

316
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,799
life there

317
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,399
absolutely yeah right on

318
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,479
so um

319
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,919
so i'm sure that we will get back more

320
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,079
to the nutritive quality of the castings

321
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,559
at a further point in the show

322
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:35,359
but the the second thing i'm aware of is

323
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,439
like just the worms existence and the

324
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,600
soil is good because

325
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,800
as we all know especially when using

326
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,639
containers

327
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:47,679
your soil can become compacted over time

328
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,439
and the squiggling around of the worms

329
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,638
aerates it so will you break that out a

330
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,480
little bit

331
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,839
yeah absolutely so like i said there are

332
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,440
a bunch of different species of worms

333
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,240
and then they're like four main

334
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,079
categories of worms and so like they'll

335
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,839
uh tunnel and burrow and different

336
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,078
methods it's like the red wigglers that

337
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,639
were common with uh super common

338
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,319
composting worms they'll hardly burrow

339
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,240
into the soil at all they want to stay

340
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,079
in like that top six to eight inches

341
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,000
they'll eat a lot of the organic matter

342
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,479
and they'll reproduce really quickly

343
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,480
produce a lot of cocoons but uh like

344
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,800
your night crawlers are going to tunnel

345
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,720
more like straight down and create these

346
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,120
air columns that are going to stay and

347
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,278
so like different worms will tunnel and

348
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,879
different uh methods and some of them

349
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,399
are going to go you know more straight

350
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,200
up and down like i said some are going

351
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,919
to go horizontally and so like both of

352
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,240
those are creating these channels and uh

353
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,719
they fill in those channels with organic

354
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,759
matter that continues to decompose and

355
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,519
so like

356
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,278
um some of these

357
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,440
air channels that these tunnels that

358
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,838
they make um will eventually fill in

359
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,079
with the organic matter and

360
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,000
and water and everything but then um it

361
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,759
creates the perfect little channel for

362
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,679
roots to find and so like the roots are

363
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,319
always looking for the path of least

364
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,199
resistance and so now they can find this

365
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,959
old

366
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,959
mine shaft basically you know and so

367
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,359
like that's this old tunnel that's

368
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:09,439
totally full of worm poop and still

369
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,440
breaking down organic matter and all

370
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,440
those microbes that are associated with

371
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,240
that and it's literally everything that

372
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,160
the root needs and the perfect little

373
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,680
channel for it and uh

374
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,519
yeah they uh

375
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,519
their their burrows are incredibly

376
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,639
important and so

377
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,200
and i've never heard a worm tunnel sound

378
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,039
so attractive dude

379
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,560
if i was a plant root i'd be all like

380
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,319
hell yeah it's like it's like a

381
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,838
nutritive slip and slide all the way to

382
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,519
the bottom

383
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,199
perfect way of playing it

384
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,120
i interrupted you go ahead

385
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:45,120
no so like uh and a healthy acre of like

386
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,198
food production soil so that your farm

387
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,360
field your garden um

388
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,838
you're gonna find two to three million

389
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,639
worms in there so that comes down to

390
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,839
like 50 or between 10 and 50 worms per

391
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,759
square foot

392
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,839
and so that's a lot of worms and some

393
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,600
healthy soil and they are absolutely

394
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,680
capable of

395
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,639
moving about 18 tons of soil every year

396
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,838
so

397
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,120
while they're looking for their food

398
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,120
while they're creating their their

399
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,799
tunnels they're taking some of those

400
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,320
minerals from down and like these night

401
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,799
crawlers are taking it from up to like

402
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,560
12 feet down below the surface and

403
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,359
they're taking a lot of those minerals

404
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,198
and depositing up up on the top and then

405
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,278
they're taking some of this leaf litter

406
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,679
and bringing it back down and so like

407
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,519
they're absolutely changing

408
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,120
both the physical structure as well as

409
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,198
like the chemical composition of the

410
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,959
soil and so a nice comparison is like

411
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,479
worms are the beavers

412
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,719
of the soil because they're the

413
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,600
ecological engineers you know they

414
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,639
absolutely will change

415
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,120
ecosystems and

416
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,959
in the garden that's a wonderful thing

417
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,440
they can take leaf litter that would

418
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:54,159
have taken one or two years to decompose

419
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,240
and they'll turn it over into available

420
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,439
nutrients in just three months but that

421
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,079
being said

422
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,320
out in the forest that might be not what

423
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,919
you want you know out in these native um

424
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,040
growth forests

425
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,719
uh

426
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,559
if you introduce a lot of earthworms

427
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,000
which this happens a lot in the fishing

428
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,518
industry people have

429
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,078
you know their leftover bait and they'll

430
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,320
just dump that out in the woods and

431
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,399
especially up in north america um in the

432
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,079
northern states and up in canada where

433
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,399
there used to be

434
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,879
glaciers um there's a lot of areas that

435
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,120
are still earthworm free and so a lot of

436
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,120
people don't consider this but after the

437
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,278
last ice age um

438
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,799
there were no earthworms up in canada in

439
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:34,720
the northern united states up in the

440
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,159
great lakes region where i'm at

441
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,040
they're totally wiped out from the

442
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:41,519
glacial ice sheets and so for thousands

443
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:44,000
of years after that

444
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,240
there's remained areas that were totally

445
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,559
uh earthworm free and so they weren't

446
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,198
reintroduced until european settlers

447
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,278
came and brought with them in their food

448
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,519
crops and their ornamental crops but

449
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,519
also just the ballasts of their ship

450
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,480
they'd used to fill up the bottom of

451
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,839
their ship with stones and soil

452
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,120
to keep it from

453
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,800
you know popping out of the water they

454
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,480
need to weigh it down and so once they

455
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,159
got to the new world they'd take all

456
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,759
that soil that was down on the bottom

457
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,600
and dump it out and so like they brought

458
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,079
a lot of worms and a lot of worm cocoons

459
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,040
with them and totally re-inoculated this

460
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:16,719
area

461
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,919
so much so that now like you can go out

462
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,519
into a field

463
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,278
and you can dig and you'd find worms

464
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,120
there that you didn't introduce and so

465
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,360
it's it's very common to think okay

466
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,120
these are native but they were actually

467
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,720
reintroduced up here

468
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,480
but uh

469
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,160
yeah i know those that's a huge tangent

470
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,800
there yeah but no like i want to go down

471
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,559
that tangent a little bit more um so

472
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:40,639
this is interesting because if the

473
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:42,799
glaciers got rid of the worms in the in

474
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,879
the northern part of the continent and

475
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,479
they were gone for thousands of years

476
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,759
that means when

477
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,839
um settlers came and brought them back

478
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,159
that they were actually kind of invasive

479
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,720
species at that point because the

480
00:16:54,159 --> 00:17:01,439
natural local plants had grown up the

481
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,720
the local bioregion had developed

482
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,078
without worms and like you said they're

483
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,000
they're aggressive processors of like um

484
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,720
you know forest duff and things like

485
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,838
that um i don't know about this but i

486
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,360
can imagine

487
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,879
that there might be certain species

488
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,639
in the northern parts of the country

489
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,280
that are suffering because of

490
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,120
these worms that we all see as an ally

491
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,798
exactly and that's a tough pill to

492
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,319
swallow you know

493
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,319
everybody thinks all worms are

494
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,720
absolutely incredible and they are in a

495
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,798
food production system in a non-natural

496
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,038
environment you know but out in the

497
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,960
native growth forest they can actually

498
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:44,240
really be invasive and detrimental to a

499
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,519
lot of native species like i said um

500
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,880
you know if

501
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,319
you didn't have worms it would take

502
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,320
multiple years for all the leaves to

503
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,119
break down and so like that's how you

504
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:55,678
get that beautiful layer of soil duff or

505
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,279
that the forest stuff out out there is

506
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,320
you have multiple layers of that really

507
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,798
spongy

508
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,720
rich fertile humus um that's constantly

509
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:05,440
breaking down and there's so much

510
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,240
life that lives in there and so much of

511
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,720
the forest ecology depends on that thick

512
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,640
mulch layer and if you have worms come

513
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,640
in they'll totally clean that out and

514
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,559
bare soil is not good

515
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,320
and uh so it's definitely something to

516
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,678
consider you know if you're living in

517
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,000
the middle of the woods

518
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,798
uh maybe keep your worm bin in a bin

519
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,240
instead of a pile there and uh

520
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,200
the big thing is the fishing though

521
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,519
that's

522
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,000
responsible for a lot of the spread but

523
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,240
um if humans don't spread them

524
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,319
worms will only travel about a half a

525
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,120
mile in a hundred years

526
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,319
and so their populations generally stay

527
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,038
where they are

528
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,119
but they can travel very very easily uh

529
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,599
with the help of humans so

530
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,079
the um the the fishermen idea where

531
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:52,558
where we're taking worms to exotic

532
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,639
locations where they may not be and then

533
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,359
and then depositing them when we leave

534
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,520
that reminds me a lot of uh of what they

535
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,519
tell us about firewood right don't

536
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,480
transport firewood because it's it's

537
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,798
filled with all these localized bugs and

538
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,960
if and if you take these insects and and

539
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,440
other species that live in firewood and

540
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,679
and move them you could actually be

541
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,360
destroying ecosystems and when i first

542
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,280
heard that that kind of blew me away

543
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,359
because it it's it does it's not very

544
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,519
intuitive at first to me

545
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,839
and and neither is this bit about worms

546
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,038
because in my head worms are everywhere

547
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,879
right but

548
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,200
clearly i'm wrong

549
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,080
for sure and so like there's still areas

550
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,720
um like we're saying up here that are

551
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:37,119
earthworm free but down in the southern

552
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,519
uh half of the continent there are still

553
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,279
some native worms and uh like i said

554
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,679
you'll find two to three million worms

555
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,678
in a healthy acre of uh like food

556
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,080
production soil but out in the woods you

557
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,320
might only find like fifty thousand uh

558
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,079
in an acre and so there's definitely

559
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,839
still worms out there but nothing like

560
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,079
you'd find in a garden

561
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,319
right on so so let's talk a little bit

562
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:01,199
about species and we don't need to go

563
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:03,359
through like a lot of species but um you

564
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,679
know you've mentioned two already you've

565
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,879
mentioned earthworms and then the red

566
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,360
wigglers

567
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,400
and um you know we're gonna talk more

568
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:15,038
about setting up worm bins in in set

569
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,960
three but for right now um

570
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,720
i wanna like kind of focus to this

571
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,880
question where

572
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:27,759
if we are talking about adding

573
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,000
worms to our containers and beds

574
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,798
do we want to go for a particular

575
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,319
species or maybe two species like

576
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,599
because i'm sure that after this there's

577
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,960
going to be a lot of people who are

578
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,079
going to want to like you know put a

579
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,798
handful in their pots or whatever um now

580
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,119
what what should we would what should we

581
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:48,240
be getting for sure and i just wanted to

582
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,399
touch on this um this is super common

583
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,079
misunderstanding people think earthworms

584
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,000
are like a kind of species and red

585
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,480
wigglers are a different thing but like

586
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,720
earthworms are the broad category red

587
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,880
wigglers are one of the worms that are

588
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,960
earthworms and so like you have red

589
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,080
wigglers you have night crawlers leaf

590
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
worms

591
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,599
uh

592
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,279
brown litter worms all sorts of jumpers

593
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,279
you got super reds

594
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,240
african night crawlers european night

595
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:16,798
crawlers indian blue worms um dude they

596
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,960
sound like cannabis um

597
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:23,519
for real man got the strain name yeah um

598
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,038
but yeah absolutely uh but the most

599
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,038
common um

600
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,879
around here are absolutely the red

601
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,960
wigglers which will stay on the top six

602
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,640
to eight inches like we said as well as

603
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,558
like the european night crawlers which

604
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,880
will dive down a little bit deeper and

605
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,038
create those oxygen channels and allow

606
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,320
the aeration and all that good stuff

607
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,079
but uh those are the ones that we

608
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,279
personally use at wormies

609
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,839
but uh

610
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,399
there are a ton of

611
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,279
uh other species that are quote-unquote

612
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,440
quote

613
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,599
native there you know that they're not

614
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,840
truly native but they've been there for

615
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,599
who knows how long uh they were there

616
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:58,399
well before we moved to the property and

617
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,279
so

618
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,519
um

619
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,839
that's the benefit of us having

620
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,918
our compost piles directly on the ground

621
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,439
instead of up in these raised systems is

622
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,960
like you let

623
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,159
everybody come and go as they please and

624
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,720
like that's how you get maximum

625
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,640
diversity instead of up in an isolated

626
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,600
you know stainless steel table or

627
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
whatever

628
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,079
but um

629
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,038
yeah

630
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,038
for the

631
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,798
common gardener you're going to want to

632
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,798
look for some

633
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,279
red wigglers and

634
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:29,038
probably some european nightcrawlers

635
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,279
um since we don't really want to

636
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,879
transport worms around

637
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:36,079
um

638
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,480
should we be trying to buy from other

639
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,798
folks locally i mean like supporting

640
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,519
your local economy is great and and

641
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,519
and and that is my intention but also at

642
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,319
the same time i know they sell a lot of

643
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:50,720
different varieties on amazon right and

644
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,879
you know or and other online places not

645
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,880
to like pick out amazon but the point is

646
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,919
that you can order them online right

647
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,600
should we be avoiding buying them online

648
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,759
at all costs or you know are are we

649
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,439
probably generally safe to buy them

650
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,720
online because the ones that are sold

651
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,919
online

652
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,000
are so common that if you're on a farm

653
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,080
they're probably there already

654
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,038
right and so i don't know it kind of

655
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,359
goes

656
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,279
a couple ways um

657
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,918
yeah you want to support local as much

658
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,720
as possible but a lot of this stuff um

659
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,440
when we're talking about composting and

660
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,200
you know imo indigenous microorganisms

661
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,600
it makes all the sense in the world you

662
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,360
know to buy your worms one from a local

663
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,038
business to support local and all that

664
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,319
stuff but two you know to get those

665
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:41,119
imo's and so the warm pile that's in

666
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,798
direct contact with the with the soil

667
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,158
like we do at wormies

668
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,679
it's so much more than just worm

669
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,840
castings and all the biology and the

670
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,159
worms got it's literally the indigenous

671
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,480
microorganisms culturing in that pile

672
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,799
too and like uh it makes so much more

673
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,640
sense for your garden to have

674
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,240
because like you're not just getting a

675
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,840
handful of worms when you order worms

676
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,679
there's gonna be some substrate mixed in

677
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,759
and so like all the microbes that are

678
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,840
still in that substrate are really going

679
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:07,679
to add some benefit to your garden

680
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,599
but um

681
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,519
it depends on where you're putting them

682
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,079
to if this is only going to stay in your

683
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,639
indoor grow bin um

684
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,879
in your indoor worm bin uh

685
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,919
it probably doesn't matter as much

686
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,278
but

687
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,120
you always want to be cautious about the

688
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,599
invasive species thing and like i said

689
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,519
the main issue is doing this out in

690
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,278
native like old growth forests and stuff

691
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,158
like that but if you're in your city if

692
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,759
you're in your garden plot um

693
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,278
they're they're not going to be terribly

694
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,839
invasive they're going to do a lot of

695
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:40,400
good work for you that will benefit you

696
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,959
you know that whole idea of um

697
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,240
you know localized imo kind of brought

698
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,319
this idea into my head about like

699
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,440
potentially wild crafting worms i

700
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:51,678
remember

701
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:55,519
um right before um the pandemic i was at

702
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:58,640
uh indo expo in denver and uh

703
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,720
i saw uh brian waxman speak and he's got

704
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,320
this great video that he shows on his

705
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,519
living soil talks

706
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:07,359
where he takes um half of an avocado uh

707
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,519
i think everybody calls it avocado tech

708
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:12,000
now yeah but he'll take half of an

709
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,200
avocado and he puts it at the top of his

710
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,839
container

711
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,679
and then he lifts off the avocado after

712
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,000
you know some amount of time and there's

713
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,159
like a gazillion worms like all the

714
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,519
worms in the container seem to have

715
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,960
sensed the avocado fat and they all come

716
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:30,720
to it and and his his argument about is

717
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,558
that it's really good for feeding your

718
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,519
worms but also it brings them all in

719
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:39,359
proximity so that they can mate yeah and

720
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:42,720
um so so that is kind of like a that's

721
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:45,359
an attractant for worms um is there any

722
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,759
kind of you know application of that or

723
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,079
something else that folks might do to

724
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:53,038
wildcraft your local worms that are

725
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,558
gonna have the local imo in their gut

726
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,960
because like you know where i live on

727
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,359
vacheron island i could totally see

728
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,720
going to the edge of my property where

729
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,599
you know it's not all trampled and

730
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,159
everything and and you know take two

731
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,480
avocados and cut them in half and put

732
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,720
put four halves in a circle maybe maybe

733
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,880
dig away the top layer a little bit and

734
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,960
like collect a bunch

735
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,720
and start my

736
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,159
either either start my bin or just

737
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,759
collect them and put them in my

738
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:24,080
containers um like a is is that an

739
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,640
environmentally sound practice if as

740
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,798
long as i'm on my own farm and b

741
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,480
does that work and see what attractant

742
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,079
would you use

743
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,558
yeah so uh

744
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,798
try to remember all those things sorry

745
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,720
all good um

746
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,879
yeah avocado tucks great it'll

747
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,360
definitely attract a bunch of worms that

748
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,278
being said um it's a great use for like

749
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,839
old avocados that

750
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,200
you know are past prime eating but i

751
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,678
don't really like the idea of you know

752
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,038
buying an avocado from mexico or

753
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,400
whatever and like having that huge

754
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,038
carbon footprint

755
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,720
just to to feed to the worm and like all

756
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,798
that stuff on that there's a ton of

757
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,400
other stuff that we can use uh that's

758
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,960
gonna have actually

759
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,440
already your local imo that you can use

760
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,278
to bait those worms instead of

761
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,519
microbes from mexico or whatever can you

762
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,359
give me two examples yeah for sure so up

763
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,558
here it's super super easy to grow

764
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:19,278
melons and squash all sorts of gourds

765
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,960
and so like that's huge you get one

766
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:21,919
squash plant and there's you know 20

767
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,159
plus

768
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,679
gourds on there and they store super

769
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,919
well so you can

770
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,840
you know have feedstock for eight months

771
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,960
plus if you store it right

772
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:33,359
um

773
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,840
but also that huge surface area and so

774
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,558
like you you slice up a pumpkin and you

775
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,639
put it on top of the soil and all these

776
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,798
these worms are going to come up there

777
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,360
very similar to the avocado but also you

778
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:47,038
can just use like wet cardboard and like

779
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,278
any leaves from your property toss some

780
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,519
leaves under some wet cardboard set that

781
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,200
flat and after a couple days if there's

782
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,879
worms in your yard they're going to be

783
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,278
there and they love that corrugated

784
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,200
board um all those little perforations

785
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,798
oh wait they're eating they're eating it

786
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,960
they love like hanging out in the the

787
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:04,319
ridges it's crazy like you can peel back

788
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,079
one of the layers and like it's just

789
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,960
full of worms and cocoons and stuff they

790
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,599
really like cardboard it's weird but um

791
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,120
so yeah anything that's gonna be

792
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,959
moist and

793
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,639
flat and they like some pressure against

794
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,640
the soil and so like they like to come

795
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,480
up to the top but you got to remember

796
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,759
worms don't like the sun they're

797
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,480
incredibly photo sensitive and so

798
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:28,720
if you can you know cover your soil

799
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,159
with something firm like that that

800
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,319
allows them to come up to the top and

801
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,600
not be exposed to the elements

802
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:35,519
they're they're really going to like

803
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,759
that but um

804
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,038
yeah the idea with the avocado tech is

805
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,599
is wonderful

806
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:43,839
you could use pumpkins cardboard melons

807
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,519
anything like that but you're basically

808
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,519
attracting them and worms are

809
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,480
hermaphroditic and so they contain both

810
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,879
the sperm and the eggs and that little

811
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,558
slimy stuff that's on them and so

812
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,000
basically when you have them in a huge

813
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:57,678
worm pile

814
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,159
all eating that avocado they're also

815
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,840
having like a giant origi and so

816
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,039
they're going to leave behind a ton of

817
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,278
cocoons

818
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:08,240
and and each one of those cocoons are

819
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:10,000
anywhere from like 1 to 20 worms and so

820
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,359
you have like these huge population

821
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,880
booms huge baby booms after you have um

822
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,278
after you do something like the avocado

823
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,720
tucker you attract them all up to

824
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,398
a common area and you feed them but also

825
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,679
it's popular to kind of amend that

826
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,839
avocado

827
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,360
lightly with some amendments and uh so

828
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,558
then they're taking those amendments as

829
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,719
well as all the fat and all the good

830
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,720
stuff in the avocado and then when they

831
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,720
go back and they disperse throughout the

832
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,640
soil then they're pooping out all that

833
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,759
good stuff all throughout the risosphere

834
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
and so like

835
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:40,480
it's

836
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,720
a great way to amend your soil without

837
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,038
tilling it in you know yeah for sure you

838
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,159
know when when you talked about their

839
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:50,000
the worms ability to transport nutrients

840
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,799
i was thinking oh in my head it was

841
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,599
always just the mycelial networks right

842
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:58,398
but but no this is an entirely different

843
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,199
and i would probably say more mechanical

844
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,278
way

845
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,360
um when they are when they're eating the

846
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,200
food scraps and then they grab some of

847
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,558
the amendment and then they you know

848
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,880
they bust out and go to another

849
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:10,798
neighborhood in the in the container

850
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,919
they're they're taking all of that with

851
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:13,440
them

852
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,440
um

853
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,200
any idea how much like like i'm

854
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,200
imagining taking like a melon or a

855
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,440
squash like you example like you

856
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,319
suggested and adding a little bit

857
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,159
amendment to it do we want to just add

858
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,480
the like the amount like as if we were

859
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,200
adding salt to eat it you know just a

860
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,558
little bit or or can we actually add it

861
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,319
pretty heavily

862
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,119
so i definitely go light on any

863
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,960
amendments and honestly if your soil is

864
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:39,918
thriving you might not even need it it's

865
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,519
like it

866
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,880
it's always kind of tough blindly

867
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,720
amending things without looking at the

868
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,080
soil test but uh

869
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,319
if you just add a little bit of

870
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,918
something um

871
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,599
a lot of times just some trace minerals

872
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,320
or something like that is all you need

873
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,839
but yeah i usually go light on any dry

874
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,398
amendments

875
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,240
um are there any oh go ahead sorry

876
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,319
mainly just rely on heavy mulching and

877
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,240
that's uh gonna

878
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,359
supply the fertility that i need in the

879
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,120
soil

880
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,719
for folks like me who are not going to

881
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,439
be able to not do this because it's such

882
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,360
a cool idea are there any amendments

883
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,919
like specifically dry amendments that we

884
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:18,918
should not use because worms do not like

885
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,919
them

886
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:25,839
certainly nothing significant or else

887
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,360
yeah

888
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,558
nothing straight comes to mind but yeah

889
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,879
that's something to consider you don't

890
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,639
want something incredibly

891
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,880
abrasive uh they don't like rubbing

892
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,640
against you know diatomaceous earth

893
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,720
which i mean right

894
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,360
like even like uh

895
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,558
insect frass might you know have that

896
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,599
harsh

897
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:45,599
um

898
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,398
tiny little pieces that can cut them up

899
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:48,639
so

900
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,558
if you do add some dry amendments just

901
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,640
you know go ahead and make a guacamole

902
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:55,038
out of it mix it in don't just have

903
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,960
the dry amendments there but uh yeah i

904
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,359
won't worry too much about that right on

905
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,278
that yeah that guacamole idea is good

906
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,439
even even if you're using melon or

907
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:05,599
squash you know you would like to make

908
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,000
that make that slurry for sure and i

909
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,678
also want to say if you're using a melon

910
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,398
don't use you know the whole entire

911
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,159
fleshy part of it use mainly the rind

912
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:15,599
if you had too much of that fruitiness

913
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,320
you're gonna attract some fruit flies

914
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:18,319
and

915
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:20,398
excess juice and stuff like that so you

916
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,240
mainly you can use some of the the red

917
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:25,038
melon part but mainly stick to using the

918
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,038
rind that's a perfect use for

919
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,398
your your leftover melon rinds right on

920
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,919
that's a good example

921
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:33,119
all right so let's talk more about um

922
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,038
like the

923
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:40,719
putting them in the container um so

924
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:42,640
so when i am in the garden and i see a

925
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,960
worm that's at the surface just kind of

926
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,120
cruising around the garden i generally

927
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,240
pick them up and i toss them in one of

928
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,439
the pots

929
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,919
and

930
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,880
and so if i'm doing that

931
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,759
i recognize that over time

932
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,679
they will um procreate and there'll be

933
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,599
more of them and that's great but for

934
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,200
when a lot of people are first starting

935
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,959
their pots

936
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,000
we all know how aggressive people want

937
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,159
to be

938
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,880
with their first year pots trying to

939
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,640
make them be wildly biol biologically

940
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,480
active in the short

941
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,278
summer run right like it's it's

942
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,278
unreasonable like i found that my pots

943
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,240
really got good like after three years

944
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:22,319
you know

945
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,120
but but that first year everybody's

946
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:27,839
trying to turn their their often bagged

947
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:31,918
soil into like you know this super

948
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,278
living soil in one run and so i'm sure

949
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,000
that there are other people who have

950
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:39,038
been tempted like i have to

951
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,440
to either you know get worms from a

952
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:43,038
friend or buy them online or or

953
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,960
wildcraft them which i actually hadn't

954
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,599
considered until today but the point is

955
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,360
to get a bunch and put like a whole

956
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:54,319
handful in one container can there be

957
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,240
too many worms per pot

958
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,079
yeah so they're really good at uh

959
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,679
controlling their population and they're

960
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,519
not going to you know continue to

961
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,600
reproduce if there's not enough food for

962
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,319
them but that being said if we're trying

963
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,558
to

964
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,719
you know do no-till in a

965
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,559
30-gallon pot or a smallish pot like

966
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,838
that um

967
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:13,759
you don't want to

968
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:15,039
yeah toss in handfuls of worms you want

969
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,919
to stick to maybe

970
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:20,000
5-10 worms at first and they'll uh

971
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,918
they'll absolutely aerate it and you

972
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,280
know start to reproduce and

973
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,358
control their numbers there but the

974
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,879
problem is with no-till

975
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:28,639
long-term is

976
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:29,759
it just turns into a bed full of

977
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,039
castings

978
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,399
and so uh

979
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,519
if you don't have enough long-term

980
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:37,118
aeration sources uh it's everything in

981
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,280
there is just going to turn into worm

982
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,960
castings and so you don't really want to

983
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,800
go over are you saying that's good or

984
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,440
are we saying that's bad that's that's

985
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,240
not uh super beneficial

986
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,960
it makes the soil out of balance exactly

987
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,319
okay and uh it'll lead to compaction

988
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,159
over time and stuff like that like you

989
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,639
really need that aeration long term and

990
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,599
these uh these raised beds

991
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,079
um and so something that i do is i add

992
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,160
some some aeration sources in between

993
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,359
and just kind of let it settle in and so

994
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:09,838
uh we sell what we call vermi mulch at

995
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:12,239
wormies and it's our thicker um

996
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:14,159
grade of the compost and so there's a

997
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,319
ton of tiny little wood chips

998
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,639
and uh like your eggshells

999
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,720
and there's a ton of cocoons in there

1000
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,719
and worms and so many rove beetles

1001
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,879
beneficial mites and

1002
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,799
and predators and shredders shredders of

1003
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,960
all sorts but um

1004
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,720
that uh all those wood chips are gonna

1005
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,920
settle down into the soil and then i'll

1006
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,399
add some

1007
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,079
crushed lava rock or pumice every now

1008
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,039
and then and just let that continue to

1009
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,039
settle in instead of it only being

1010
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:43,119
worm castings and then only feeding it

1011
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,920
organic matter on top that's going to

1012
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,000
turn into worm castings as well and so

1013
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,280
uh something to consider yeah it sounds

1014
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,679
like it's very important to consider

1015
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,320
especially if you are a long-term

1016
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:57,118
you know food or cannabis cultivator and

1017
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,359
you're doing you know no-till-minded

1018
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,800
stuff like the idea of there being

1019
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,440
potentially

1020
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,760
too much density of worm castings never

1021
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,559
occurred to me and so in addition to my

1022
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,920
regular like soil amendments the idea of

1023
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,960
of adding

1024
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,639
um you know small wood fragmentations

1025
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,320
and things like that to the top and just

1026
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,838
letting it settle in sounds like a great

1027
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,200
idea certainly that's going to be

1028
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,199
awesome for

1029
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,399
your lower levels of the food web as

1030
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,199
well because there's going to be all

1031
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,599
these like little surface areas for

1032
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:32,159
um for those little those little microbe

1033
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:33,760
guys oh yeah yeah all right so um so

1034
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,239
so we're only gonna be adding you know

1035
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,680
five or ten for a 30 gallon pot and then

1036
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,039
let's let them like do their thing um is

1037
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:44,078
there

1038
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,159
do i need to also feed them in that like

1039
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,599
can they like i understand that they

1040
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,279
might um

1041
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,039
you know they won't have

1042
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,960
more

1043
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:57,279
babies if there's not enough food

1044
00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:01,199
sources but can could the could the ten

1045
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,599
eat everything in the pot and then crash

1046
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:07,039
in it where i should be thinking about

1047
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,838
putting food scraps on the surface of

1048
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,599
the container as well i mean maybe it's

1049
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,199
putting in some scraps and then covering

1050
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,519
it with compost so it's not open to the

1051
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,759
air but the the general idea of the

1052
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,400
question is should i be thinking about

1053
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,520
feeding them in my container at all

1054
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,480
yeah so i don't know if you're a fan of

1055
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:26,719
of cover cropping or uh mulching adding

1056
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,400
yeah for sure yeah so that's that's all

1057
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,000
i do i don't add any food scraps

1058
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,760
necessarily but uh

1059
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,400
always chopping and dropping a ton of

1060
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,480
cover crops and uh you know pruning any

1061
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,720
of that ganja leaves tossing them in the

1062
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,119
soil and they're taken care of you know

1063
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:42,559
within a week they're usually gone

1064
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,800
and so it's a

1065
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,799
there's a lot of hungry

1066
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,480
things in there for sure the pill bugs

1067
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,640
will take care of some

1068
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,480
some leaves for sure

1069
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,239
um so yeah

1070
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,000
always feeding the soil with that mulch

1071
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,679
layer keeping it protected and letting

1072
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,679
the worms come up to the top to eat that

1073
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:01,279
stuff and so like like we talked about

1074
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,679
earlier we don't want a whole lot of

1075
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,760
exposed soil we don't want

1076
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:08,000
the worms to ever see or grow late

1077
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,599
necessarily they like to stay in the

1078
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,760
moist dark environment with the rest of

1079
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,119
the microbes

1080
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,000
so um

1081
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,519
let's say that i fill a container with

1082
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,358
um sifted soil and i know there's no

1083
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:23,759
worms in it because i just sifted every

1084
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:26,639
square centimeter of the soil

1085
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,520
then mid-season i see worms in the pot

1086
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:32,239
um you know i understand intellectually

1087
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,639
that that happened because there were

1088
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:36,639
worm cocoons uh in

1089
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,838
the soil

1090
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:39,039
but um

1091
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:40,960
is there

1092
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:44,880
is there any way to know

1093
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,679
how how dense soil is with cocoons

1094
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,200
already when you use it or

1095
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:50,480
or do you just

1096
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,759
you just have to like let it ride

1097
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,280
because there's no real real i don't

1098
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,200
think i've ever even seen one i don't

1099
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,320
even know what one looks like yeah so

1100
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,159
once you know what they look like

1101
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,119
they're a lot easier to spot i like

1102
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:03,118
their little

1103
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:06,000
orange goldish like little orbs probably

1104
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,838
a millimeter or so but like

1105
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,920
you can take up a scoop of pretty much

1106
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:11,679
any handful of our compost piles at

1107
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,760
wormies and you're gonna find

1108
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,838
at least one cocoon in there and uh so

1109
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,359
once you get the eye for it uh

1110
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,679
you'll be able to see them but that

1111
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:22,319
being said it's still way easier to let

1112
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,000
that go through your sifter unnoticed

1113
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,680
but um i honestly

1114
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,679
i don't know i don't

1115
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,199
worry too much about the population of

1116
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:30,879
worms in the soil i just know that

1117
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,919
there's some in there and i keep them

1118
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,838
fed with the organic matter and i

1119
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,800
add that aeration source to prevent it

1120
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:39,199
from all

1121
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,160
turning into worm castings over time but

1122
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:42,639
uh

1123
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,000
yeah i try not to to worry about it too

1124
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:47,519
much all right

1125
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,079
so um we spoke earlier about how we

1126
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,800
don't want our worm bins to get too hot

1127
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,240
which we'll address again in third set

1128
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,880
but but but thinking about the

1129
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:59,439
containers you know i intentionally am

1130
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,480
trying to have my

1131
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,000
plants and the containers warm right the

1132
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,599
container warm

1133
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,239
so that um

1134
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,800
you know the microbes are happy and

1135
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,199
aggressively living shall i say and then

1136
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,960
the plants of course i want them to be

1137
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:18,399
transpiring and aggressively living as

1138
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:23,199
well but then there's worms right so um

1139
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:25,838
uh how much risk am i looking at having

1140
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:26,799
my containers out in full

1141
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,078
you know

1142
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:34,000
full summer sunshine

1143
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:35,680
will the pot naturally keep the worms

1144
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,960
cool enough that they won't you know

1145
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:40,078
like melt

1146
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,280
um or do i need to be aware of that

1147
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,280
no it's a very important thing to

1148
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,000
consider and uh

1149
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,359
i don't like using black pots outside

1150
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,760
i like the tan

1151
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:52,318
fabric pots

1152
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,400
keeps the soil a lot cooler but really

1153
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:56,480
really focusing on that thick mulch

1154
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,039
layer is going to do a lot to protect

1155
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,358
all your microbes and all uh your macro

1156
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,599
invertebrates and and worms and whatnot

1157
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,440
but um

1158
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,359
yeah you definitely don't want them to

1159
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,358
to cook in there and so if you have that

1160
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:12,960
pot right on the ground or if there's

1161
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:15,039
any holes in there or whatever like

1162
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,679
worms are really smart and so like

1163
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:20,079
you'll see if you were to put worms in a

1164
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:22,000
like a thermophilic hot compost pile

1165
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,119
they're not gonna go right to the core

1166
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,400
they're not gonna go to the hot part

1167
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,358
they're gonna get the hell out of the

1168
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,960
way they

1169
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,960
they know how to get away from the heat

1170
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,720
and so if there's another option for

1171
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,639
them to get out

1172
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,399
and that might just be them going up to

1173
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,118
the top and hanging out underneath that

1174
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,720
moist mulch or all the way down to the

1175
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,640
bottom where it's still

1176
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:42,799
moist and you know like they're gonna

1177
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:44,639
find something around it but yeah you

1178
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,880
definitely don't just want a black pot

1179
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,639
out in the open sun with no mulch no

1180
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,160
shade or anything like that

1181
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,679
um

1182
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,679
yeah so we don't we don't want them to

1183
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,000
melt yeah right now you always got to be

1184
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:58,879
mindful of what the soil wants you know

1185
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,119
and think what how are they going to

1186
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,720
prefer this and so that was a big thing

1187
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,519
uh realizing that i was more like a

1188
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:07,598
microbe farmer than a worm farmer i'm

1189
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,159
i'm creating the perfect environments

1190
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,079
for these microbes to thrive and

1191
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,559
from that the worms follow and all the

1192
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,160
good stuff follows but like you need the

1193
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:18,078
the environment that's conducive for the

1194
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:20,480
microbes and that's what starts at all

1195
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,400
you know all right um so so let's finish

1196
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,559
this set with um

1197
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,960
you know what what i'm guessing is a

1198
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:29,279
myth but i've been told this since

1199
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,920
childhood and i and i'm probably not the

1200
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,720
only one so we might as well address it

1201
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,039
if we have a worm

1202
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:39,838
and we cut it in half

1203
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:43,119
do we then have two worms and is there

1204
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:46,000
any reason we should be doing that

1205
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,119
no definitely do not do that um

1206
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,039
worms

1207
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,800
are living they're sentient they can

1208
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,639
feel that

1209
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,640
um

1210
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,639
and no they don't regenerate into two

1211
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:59,838
completely different worms um it is true

1212
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,440
that if you cut it at um a certain point

1213
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:03,199
and somebody's actually figured this out

1214
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,440
there's like a number of segments that

1215
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:08,239
you can go to or whatever and then that

1216
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,159
tail will regenerate and one worm will

1217
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:12,318
be fine but the other part will will die

1218
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:15,039
off or whatever but no you're not gonna

1219
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:17,199
regenerate two worms but uh if one does

1220
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:19,199
get cut there is a good chance that

1221
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:21,519
it'll be fine it'll regenerate right on

1222
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,838
so if one gets cut toss it back in the

1223
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:26,000
in the soil but don't be doing it of

1224
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:28,719
your own accord we are dispelling that

1225
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,318
myth right here and now so for sure

1226
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,759
that's one of the biggest predators of

1227
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:35,039
worms is

1228
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,160
humans or uh maybe not predators but you

1229
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,000
know

1230
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:39,920
with rototilling and stuff and we come

1231
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,679
in and we just slice these worms up and

1232
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,599
then if you're using salts you're

1233
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,838
literally tossing salt on the wound oh

1234
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,760
jeez and like yeah it's terrible what

1235
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:50,960
we're doing uh

1236
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,720
so yeah yeah don't do that don't do that

1237
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,240
all right so we're gonna take a short

1238
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:56,318
break and be right back you are

1239
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,039
listening to shaping fire and my guest

1240

today is regenerative farming educator

1241

chandler michelski now without these

1242
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,440
advertisers shaping fire would not

1243
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:09,838
happen so please support them and let

1244
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,838
them know you heard them on shaping fire

1245
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,159
a fully functioning greenhouse grows

1246
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,719

but as we have discussed many times on

1250
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,640
shaping fire a greenhouse is only as

1251
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,879
good as the environment you create for

1252
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:31,118

for years organic cultivators have been

1345
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:03,519
looking for a peat moss replacement peat

1346
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:05,199
moss has long been the go-to soil

1347
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:07,519
amendment for water retention and

1348
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:10,078
container growing but organic growers

1349
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:12,639
are recognizing now that peat moss is an

1350
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,519
unsustainable resource and the mining of

1351
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:18,318
peat bogs destroys wetland habitats and

1352
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:20,318
releases sequestered carbon but peat

1353
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:22,079
moss works so well that many have

1354
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:24,480
continued to use it

1355
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,800
now there is finally a revolutionary

1356
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,559
replacement for peat moss that provides

1357
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,480
better benefits while being a

1358
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,839
sustainable choice

1359
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,000
pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss

1360
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:38,239
but instead of being mined from fragile

1361
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,639
ecosystems is actually made from

1362
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:42,558
upcycled organic paper and cardboard

1363
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:45,039
headed for landfills

1364
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,960
pit moss is excellent at retaining water

1365
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,960
in your substrate and creating air

carefully and locally sourced pit moss

1371
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:04,318
is the result of decades-long research

into the use of recycled paper fibers

1373
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,719
pit moss is lightweight and easy to use

1374
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,318

and my guest today is regenerative

1395
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,440
farming educator chandler micholsky so

1396
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,880
before the break you know we were

1397
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,800
talking all about worms the good they do

1398
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,838
and why we love them

1399
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,000
and

1400
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:07,279
no doubt while they're just very

1401
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,000
existence in our garden is good for

1402
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,400
pretty much everybody involved um

1403
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,800
we do tend to focus on their castings

1404
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,200
because of the nutrition value but once

1405
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,920
you have castings um like what's the

1406
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:21,039
best thing to do with them because um

1407
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,639
you know they kind of seem like a

1408
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:24,400
panacea they you can use them for

1409
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:27,440
everything and and i'm here to tell you

1410
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,119
the answer is yes so um we're gonna go

1411
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,240
through um

1412
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:35,519
uh some of the ways that uh chandler

1413
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:37,598
uses them in his garden and uh maybe

1414
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:39,119
some of them uh will be attractive to

1415
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,559
you dear listener all right so let's

1416
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,760
start with the basics

1417
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,720
so um

1418
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,520
the the

1419
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:48,399
the first way that many people get into

1420
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:50,800
worm castings is simply by adding it to

1421
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,800
their soil recipe whatever they're going

1422
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,760
to start out their pots with they will

1423
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:59,440
have you know some variable amount of it

1424
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:02,240
that is locally purchased um or gifted

1425
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,519
worm castings so will you speak to that

1426
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:07,519
give us an idea of of um you know maybe

1427
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:10,079
how we should choose our castings and

1428
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,679
then how much to put in the soil

1429
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,839
yeah so that's what got me into this

1430
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:17,039
whole world is uh me starting to try to

1431
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:19,519
mix my own soil i found sub

1432
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,639
sub cools super soil recipe

1433
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:22,159
and uh

1434
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:24,159
you know reading the forums realized

1435
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:25,838
that the compost was the most important

1436
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:27,838
part and that's why you know you can

1437
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:29,440
have the same recipe all over the

1438
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:30,799
country but everybody's gonna have

1439
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,039
different results because they're all

1440
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,760
using different compost and so

1441
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:38,639
sent me down you know the rabbit hole of

1442
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,119
okay well what's the best compost and

1443
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:42,960
i quickly found out that worms produce

1444
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,160
the best compost or some of the best

1445
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,159
compost and

1446
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,399
uh it's pretty easy to do it at home and

1447
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:50,558
a home worm bin so

1448
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,160
i started doing that and i realized

1449
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,000
pretty quickly that i was eating like

1450
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:56,480
garbage and i couldn't put anything

1451
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,480
beneficial into my worm bin you you

1452
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,318
yourself were eating like garbage yeah i

1453
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,920
was a busy college student so you

1454
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:03,599
couldn't put your food scraps in because

1455
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,880
the worms are like screw you this i

1456
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,960
don't want chips

1457
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,960
yeah i mean just not enough fruits and

1458
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,480
veggies not enough cooking for myself

1459
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,240
and so like that was a big red flag it's

1460
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,240
like holy [ __ ] like

1461
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:16,239
that's not how we should be doing things

1462
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:18,719
um i need to start taking better care of

1463
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:21,598
myself and cooking at home more and so

1464
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,959
quickly started to accumulate more fruit

1465
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,599
and veggie scraps

1466
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,318
and feeding my worms really really good

1467
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:31,440
stuff um and getting you know the best

1468
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:32,880
compost possible and so that was

1469
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,039
really fast like i said i was just

1470
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,440
starting to learn how to mix my own soil

1471
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:39,519
how to grow my own ganja and

1472
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,760
came into this world of worm castings

1473
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:43,440
and everything and then um hold on

1474
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,680
before you move on i think we need to

1475
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,039
recognize for a second there how kind of

1476
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:49,679
like

1477
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:53,199
naturally romantic that is that you get

1478
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:56,000
into building soil to grow cannabis and

1479
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:58,000
then the worms support you in eating a

1480
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,679
healthier diet because you want to feed

1481
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,079
them a better diet

1482
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:04,159
like that's that's better nutri that's

1483
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,559
better support for eating healthy than

1484
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:09,440
like even my friends give me because

1485
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,880
because i'm motivated to help the worms

1486
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,838
because i want them to help me with the

1487
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:16,559
ganja i just think that that is a

1488
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:21,119
beautiful example about how regenerative

1489
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:24,480
farming really closes circles and and um

1490
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,838
uh offers unexpected positive results oh

1491
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,599
absolutely man

1492
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:29,599
absolutely it's uh

1493
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,280
it's a lifestyle for sure yeah super

1494
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,440
grateful to have found it so how much

1495
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,160
how much should we put into our our soil

1496
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,559
recipes yeah so we shoot for 20 percent

1497
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:40,558
uh you want like 15 to 20 percent uh

1498
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,440
there's been studies on it that show

1499
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,440
that that amount greatly uh

1500
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,039
improves yield and all that good stuff

1501
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,599
uh decreases

1502
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:51,679
pest and um

1503
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,720
pathogen pressure

1504
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:57,118
but uh anything over 20 and it might be

1505
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:59,118
kind of a waste of money and so

1506
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,960
and if you really overdo it then you can

1507
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,640
run into the compaction problems and all

1508
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,119
that stuff like we were talking about

1509
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:07,759
and so yeah 15 to 20 if you're mixing

1510
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,599
your own soil but then i

1511
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,200
also really like top dressing it

1512
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,119
throughout the cycle and so i'll just

1513
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,639
literally take a handful i'm not big on

1514
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,318
measuring or anything

1515
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:18,558
and uh you know spread that around the

1516
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,480
base of each plant and water it in and

1517
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,319
simple as that maybe

1518
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,599
every other week or so if you ever

1519
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:25,920
notice you know plants could use a

1520
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:28,240
little boost or something maybe give

1521
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,240
them it that but i really don't stick to

1522
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:32,000
any strict cycles or anything like that

1523
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,078
but i know uh

1524
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,838
pretty much if i ever see a problem i'll

1525
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,400
just top dress some some castings and

1526
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:40,558
then brew a compost tea and

1527
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,760
the problems are resolved pretty quickly

1528
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:46,000
when you are top dressing worm castings

1529
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,000
do you normally put down the worm

1530
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,599
castings and then

1531
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,079
um either

1532
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:57,599
add an extra layer of soil or compost or

1533
00:54:54,079 --> 00:55:01,280
scratch the surface and and work it in

1534
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:03,359
so many of the top dressed amendments

1535
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,359
you kind of need to keep them moist for

1536
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:07,119
them to break down and do their job is

1537
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:09,679
that also true with worm castings i

1538
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,680
can't imagine that a dry worm casting is

1539
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,919
as effective as a moist one

1540
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,759
yeah great point so yeah i'll scratch it

1541
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,079
in a little bit but then the watering in

1542
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,720
after you you spread it pretty thin

1543
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,960
will take a lot of that and uh bring it

1544
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:26,239
pull it down into the soil

1545
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,240
so do you do you top dress addition all

1546
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:31,439
right so let's assume you have a new pot

1547
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:35,279
right and you are using your 20

1548
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:38,240
um castings um will that

1549
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,200
would you expect that to last the entire

1550
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,558
cycle

1551
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:45,199
or would you still perhaps start top

1552
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:47,040
dressing more like maybe when you start

1553
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:49,759
flower cycle or something

1554
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:51,679
yeah so i i usually at least do another

1555
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,160
top dress right as i flip

1556
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:56,159
and so uh and it also depends on how

1557
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:58,639
much you have and whatnot but uh

1558
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:00,399
i'll yeah generally like i said i don't

1559
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:03,759
stick to schedules but i'll do at least

1560
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:06,160
one top dress during veg and then a nice

1561
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,799
big top dress and chop and drop

1562
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:10,879
um when i flower and so that chop and

1563
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:13,119
drop is kind of what i use to cover up

1564
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,680
the castings instead of additional soil

1565
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:18,000
or compost i'll lay down the castings

1566
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:20,078
kind of scratch it in water it in and

1567
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,920
then chop and drop all my cover crop and

1568
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,920
prune some leaves and then cover that up

1569
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,960
and keep it moist and protected

1570
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,318
right on

1571
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,240
so um

1572
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:30,318
the other time that

1573
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:32,719
it's very popular to topdress is

1574
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:35,279
actually between cycles you know

1575
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:38,318
whether you're indoors or if it's the

1576
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:41,280
off season um you know we're all

1577
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:42,798
generally adding amendments to the soil

1578
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,640
preparing

1579
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:45,440
for the next cycle

1580
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:46,318
um

1581
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,838
uh

1582
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:53,039
if you are outdoors it's a little less

1583
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:56,639
obvious as it is with indoors when to

1584
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:59,920
amend between cycles so let's say that

1585
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:01,440
it is you know october and everything is

1586
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:05,200
cut and hung

1587
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:08,079
and um i'm looking at my um you know all

1588
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:10,239
the the stocks that are coming out of my

1589
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,680
um containers

1590
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:16,159
would you

1591
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:17,598
be more likely to amend then and let it

1592
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:20,558
sit over

1593
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:24,400
the winter season that way or would you

1594
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:27,119
actually wait and amend in april or may

1595
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,960
in the spring after the winter

1596
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,358
i do it in the fall you always want to

1597
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,679
be building up that fertility and it's

1598
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:35,920
super important especially for getting

1599
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:38,000
snow in the winter to really

1600
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,920
build a thick thick mulch layer to

1601
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,239
protect everything and stow some cover

1602
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,240
crop seeds underneath it and uh

1603
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:45,838
you'll actually have and some cold

1604
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:47,679
tolerant plants you'll have living

1605
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,679
plants underneath that

1606
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:51,440
thick mulch layer and they're still you

1607
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:53,759
know pumping exudates into the soil and

1608
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,599
keeping everything alive

1609
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,680
all winter long and if you don't have

1610
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,280
that if you have bare soil it's all

1611
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:01,679
going to freeze everything's going to

1612
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,200
suffer and then

1613
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:05,519
you're going to have to re-inoculate and

1614
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:07,679
kind of start over in the springtime

1615
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,759
so it's super important uh we got to be

1616
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,838
mulching all year round but uh putting

1617
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,319
our beds to sleep properly

1618
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:15,679
um in the winter time is very important

1619
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:17,358
right on that's never come up on the

1620
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,199
show before you know i always just

1621
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:21,759
considered that during the winter the

1622
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:25,598
containers got so cold that all the

1623
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:27,920
micro microphones all the microbes

1624
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:31,680
cysted up and essentially went into

1625
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,400
hibernation but um this idea that you

1626
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:33,679
know

1627
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,200
there's still

1628
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:38,558
life happening in the container and so

1629
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:40,879
we want to make sure we have a good

1630
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:43,599
mulch layer to kind of give it a winter

1631
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:45,760
blanket and then um

1632
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,000
you know castings and and other

1633
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,720
nutritive amendments just to you know

1634
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,880
help keep the logs burning over the

1635
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:54,639
winter that's a really interesting idea

1636
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,318
that i hadn't really engaged with before

1637
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:57,920
no i used to definitely subscribe to

1638
00:58:56,318 --> 00:58:59,759
that too i figured that everything

1639
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,318
assisted up went dormant for the winter

1640
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,280
yeah and a lot of it would come back but

1641
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:07,519
putting cover crop um in my pot and a

1642
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,599
thick mulch flare um i've got a post on

1643
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:12,000
my instagram actually some hairy vetch

1644
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,160
just thriving in in early february it's

1645
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,239
like that made me realize you know okay

1646
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:17,480
so there is still some sunlight getting

1647
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:19,838
through that mulch it's still

1648
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,519
photosynthesizing it's got to still be

1649
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:23,838
pumping you know some carbon into the

1650
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:25,759
soil some exudates and so like

1651
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:27,838
i don't know it's i think for the most

1652
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,760
part things are quite slowed down and

1653
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:31,679
dormant but uh

1654
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,079
really protecting it and doing all that

1655
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:36,078
stuff will just make everything thrive

1656
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,079
in the spring when when it does fall and

1657
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,920
come back to life and uh that hairy

1658
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,359
vetch that was you know doing its thing

1659
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,760
all winter long

1660
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:46,239
um it was the second um

1661
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,799
okay so it started going to flower like

1662
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:51,118
as soon as spring came and it attracted

1663
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:52,960
so many pollinators and uh your

1664
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:54,000
beneficial predators and all that stuff

1665
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,599
and so

1666
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,679
it's a

1667
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,838
beautiful thing why not all right so

1668
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:02,558
cool let's go to our next application so

1669
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:04,880
we've already talked about um as a soil

1670
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,000
amendment in your initial container

1671
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,640
recipe

1672
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,838
and then we talked about um you know top

1673
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:12,879
amending

1674
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:15,759
both during the cycle and um during the

1675
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:18,880
off season let's talk about adding it to

1676
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,319
compost tea so so like let's just look

1677
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,838
there's a lot of different compost teas

1678
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:24,880
but let's let's assume for the moment

1679
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:27,440
we're talking about an aerated tea

1680
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:31,760
um made in you know one of the popular

1681
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:34,240
ways let's if we want to incorporate um

1682
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:37,040
uh castings

1683
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:38,798
do we want to add it to the brewer or is

1684
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:41,358
it something we add to the

1685
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:42,880
add to it after we've pulled from the

1686
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:46,480
brewer

1687
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:48,559
yep so i like to use a compost tea bag

1688
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,960
and it's like put all the compost inside

1689
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,798
of that mesh bag and then i'll put that

1690
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,880
inside of the brewer and you know

1691
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:56,480
agitate it really massage it get all

1692
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,358
those microbes suspended and in the

1693
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,280
water

1694
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:01,679
and then uh i'll brew it

1695
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,680
depending on

1696
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:04,639
the recipe and whatnot and i'm

1697
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:06,480
definitely

1698
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:09,039
still experimenting with compost teas

1699
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,039
and it's kind of tough to know

1700
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:12,558
without looking under the scope but

1701
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:16,079
basically

1702
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:18,480
um i've never brewed a compost tea using

1703
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,720
good compost that has had detrimental

1704
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,798
results you know and so like i think the

1705
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:24,399
microscope stuff is really important and

1706
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:27,119
if you have it and you have time to get

1707
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,798
into it there's a lot to learn from that

1708
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,880
but i think you know brewing a compost

1709
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:34,079
tea sticking to the rules sticking to

1710
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,079
your your intuition

1711
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:38,798
you're gonna have really good stuff if

1712
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:39,838
you're using good compost um

1713
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:41,440
kind of got

1714
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:43,119
distracted from the question there yeah

1715
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,240
right on it but i'll take it to the next

1716
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,400
to the next part of the question then

1717
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:49,118
which is so we were talking about

1718
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,960
aerated compost teas and and you said

1719
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:53,680
okay we're going to put it in a bag so

1720
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:56,798
that the compost is not actually in the

1721
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:58,798
brewer causing a mess i'm guessing then

1722
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:02,559
that the next you know

1723
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:05,920
if you're using a compost extract right

1724
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:08,000
so so we're not talking about an aerated

1725
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,480
preparation we're just talking about

1726
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,559
like like we make tea right we're like

1727
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,559
like tea to drink you've got water and

1728
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,280
then you put a bag of stuff in it and it

1729
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:19,760
just soaks the tea out right steep it

1730
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:22,960
right like i'm pretty new to that kind

1731
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:24,559
of a compost extract um but i'm finding

1732
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,639
that i really like it because it's so

1733
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,079
easy and and so

1734
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:31,598
yeah and so

1735
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:35,440
would would it be simply you've got your

1736
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:37,440
um your bag of compost in the bucket and

1737
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,440
then next to it you're going to have a

1738
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,960
bag of castings or if you've got a big

1739
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,119
enough bag you can both

1740
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,720
put them both in the same thing

1741
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,119
the moral of the story is is that it

1742
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:49,439
works the same

1743
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:52,798
yeah so i i only use castings in a

1744
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:54,960
compost tea pretty much um

1745
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:56,159
yeah i don't use a separate compost

1746
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,920
source necessarily i don't know

1747
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:58,798
sometimes i'll like add in some leaf

1748
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,358
litter

1749
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:03,119
from the forest but when i say compost

1750
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:06,558
tea i'm pretty much talking just a

1751
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:08,079
casting tea do you think it's complete

1752
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:10,400
like do you not do you really think that

1753
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:13,119
there's not really anything added

1754
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,960
by adding compost from your compost pile

1755
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:16,880
that it's that it's all there with the

1756
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,880
worms or i mean you've gotta i mean

1757
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,920
you're clearly like think way too much

1758
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,920
about this stuff there's gotta be a

1759
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,400
reason why you don't bother

1760
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,119
so i i use the vermi mulch more than the

1761
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,880
castings and so this is you know it's a

1762
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:30,720
something

1763
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,000
local to wormies and a lot of people

1764
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:32,959
aren't familiar with it but it's just

1765
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,119
the

1766
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,720
the coarser sifting and so it's still

1767
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,160
got all the worm castings but it's got

1768
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:40,318
all the the wood chips and everything

1769
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:41,279
that we're talking about and so like our

1770
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:44,480
worm

1771
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:46,160
our worm rose um are fed thermophilic

1772
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,400
compost and so like it's already gone

1773
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:49,358
through the hot composting process

1774
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,039
and then

1775
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,400
so you have all that diversity and then

1776
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,640
the worms are working through it and

1777
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:57,280
then we add all these mushroom blocks

1778
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:59,679
and bokashi compost and

1779
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:02,400
fermented tea and fruit from kombucha

1780
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:04,719
places and so like we re-inoculate the

1781
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,559
hot compost with as much diversity as

1782
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:08,399
possible and let the worms work through

1783
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:10,839
it for like 10 months and so

1784
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:14,559
yeah so you're not using just like

1785
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:17,038
regular pedestrian um castings you're

1786
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:19,440
using like olympic level castings that's

1787
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:21,680
a great thing to consider and that's uh

1788
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,960
something that is easy to forget when

1789
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:24,558
we're talking about this stuff is like

1790
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,079
not everybody has

1791
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,920
access to wormies or whatever and we're

1792
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,240
talking about maybe just using worm

1793
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,838
castings from your worm bin and so like

1794
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:33,759
yeah if that's the case you might want

1795
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:35,599
to go ahead and add some compost from

1796
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,240
your outdoor source as well and just

1797
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:39,440
maximize that diversity and uh

1798
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:42,798
but uh

1799
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:44,960
yeah the the vermi mulch from wormy's is

1800
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:47,038
complete for sure right on you know a

1801
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,880
lot of people you know more more people

1802
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:51,599
than than we probably even think about

1803
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,440
who are growing in urban situations like

1804
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,680
the castings they're using they're just

1805
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,599
like straight up buying online so it's

1806
01:04:55,679 --> 01:05:00,480
they're stripped down

1807
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:02,240
like nutritive but kind of like boring

1808
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,639
and maybe not well clearly not as

1809
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:07,279
complex as what you're using

1810
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:10,719
and uh for those people i think that it

1811
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:14,960
would make sense to back up their

1812
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:17,439
um their castings with a a biologically

1813
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,440
active mulch as well or absolutely

1814
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,679
that's a great point all right thank you

1815
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,720
all right cool so um

1816
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:27,838
so let's talk about the ways to uh apply

1817
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:29,038
this so like like most nutrition i would

1818
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:31,838
think that

1819
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,960
um it's beneficial to both

1820
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:36,078
pour

1821
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:38,079
the compost tea directly into the

1822
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:41,119
container or bed

1823
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:43,680
um but then also there is a foliar

1824
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:45,200
option is is it true that really we can

1825
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:47,118
we can do both

1826
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:48,639
yeah for sure and so uh

1827
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:50,798
the difference between the tea and the

1828
01:05:48,639 --> 01:05:52,159
extract is you're aerating the tea and

1829
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:55,280
you're adding a food source for those

1830
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:56,639
microbes to proliferate and expand

1831
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,240
but in the extract you're just

1832
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:00,558
extracting what's available in the

1833
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:02,318
compost and putting it into a solution

1834
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,400
so you're not actually giving it an air

1835
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:05,920
source and a food source to increase its

1836
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,280
populations

1837
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,960
but uh you're just you know taking the

1838
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,640
microbes that are there putting it in

1839
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,240
this a solution and then you can water

1840
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:14,239
your plants with that or you can spray

1841
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:17,279
your pants with that but uh one of the

1842
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:20,399
benefits of a compost tea

1843
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,519
is the foliar application and so like

1844
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,599
um

1845
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:26,318
the glomulin the glue-like substance

1846
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:28,640
that a lot of these bacteria produce um

1847
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:30,880
is going to make it a whole lot stickier

1848
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:32,960
and so like when you spray an actively

1849
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,720
aerated compost tea it's going to have

1850
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,720
more of that glomulin more of that

1851
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:38,399
stickiness to it and so like that's

1852
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:41,679
going to stick to your leaves longer

1853
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,599
than a compost extract would but uh if

1854
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:44,719
you only have time for a compost extract

1855
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:48,079
if you don't want to clean your brewer

1856
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:49,598
or whatever it's so much easier it's uh

1857
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,680
but

1858
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:53,039
uh so you want to use maybe a couple

1859
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:56,000
cups

1860
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:57,920
for a couple gallons and your

1861
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,519
compost tea but in your extract you're

1862
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,880
going to want to use a whole lot more

1863
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:02,880
compost

1864
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,039
than you would in a tea and so like you

1865
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:07,119
want to really fill up your mesh bag or

1866
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:09,839
whatever

1867
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:12,880
and massage that around use more compost

1868
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:15,838
and an extract than you would in a tea

1869
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:18,000
so when using foliar

1870
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:20,318
um

1871
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,559
i gotta admit that i've never

1872
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:27,759
done an um castings foliar

1873
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:30,000
because i'm hesitant because i know that

1874
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,880
it's air quotes poop

1875
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
and and you know we normally want to

1876
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,280
keep

1877
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,838
manure

1878
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:40,160
off of the tops of the plants because of

1879
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:42,480
things like e coli and stuff

1880
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:44,639
do we need to be concerned

1881
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:48,719
about spraying

1882
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:50,318
worm waste on the tops of the plants

1883
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:52,000
yeah so let's

1884
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:54,400
you get into this tough area of like

1885
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,639
generalizing all castings and we know

1886
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,079
that's not true like they uh

1887
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,159
are totally different from different

1888
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,839
sources and different parts of the

1889
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,358
country different feedstocks different

1890
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:05,679
environments and stuff

1891
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:07,519
uh it's not the same it's it could be

1892
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:10,639
comparing like apples and oranges

1893
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:12,559
honestly and so if you have uh a compost

1894
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:14,719
that isn't complete and they were using

1895
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,719
some animal manure and stuff like that

1896
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,399
uh you're gonna maybe run into more

1897
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:21,759
problems than

1898
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:24,960
um compost that you fully trust but

1899
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:27,198
i have never run into any issues

1900
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,279
with using a good compost and spraying

1901
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:31,439
it directly on the leaves but that being

1902
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:34,319
said i don't spray any

1903
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:37,519
compost teas or manures or anything

1904
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:39,120
in flour at all it's all during veg

1905
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,359
so it sounds like they're if you're

1906
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:44,158
going to foliar you don't want to take

1907
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:46,560
your castings right out of your bin and

1908
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:48,798
use them you want to make sure you take

1909
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,080
them out of the bin and then compost

1910
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:54,000
them so they become a finished balanced

1911
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:56,798
compost product

1912
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,359
yeah that's not a bad idea um

1913
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:01,759
and also like the aging process is

1914
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:03,279
really important so like we think okay

1915
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:05,279
all the food scraps are gone this

1916
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,359
compost is done let's use it but if you

1917
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,159
were to actually let that compost sit

1918
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,600
there

1919
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:11,838
for like six months and just keep it

1920
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,480
moist you let it cure up and you let all

1921
01:09:11,838 --> 01:09:16,719
those mesophilic microbes work through

1922
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:19,119
it and even though you can't necessarily

1923
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:20,798
see a whole lot of change

1924
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:22,479
they're doing their thing and they're

1925
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:25,359
continuing to

1926
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:28,479
cure it up into a better product

1927
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:30,719
like like ah this is vintage worm

1928
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:33,599
compost

1929
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:35,279
this is age age you know from free range

1930
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,279
worms

1931
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:40,719
that's awesome

1932
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:43,600
uh so another issue with foliar with

1933
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:46,560
amendments is uh sometimes the nozzles

1934
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:51,039
get clogged up so if we are

1935
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,920
going to run a uh casting um

1936
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:54,399
t

1937
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,440
um should we probably should run it

1938
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:58,719
through

1939
01:09:55,439 --> 01:10:00,639
um some filters to get out any loose

1940
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:03,119
bits right so it doesn't

1941
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,560
clog up the sprayer yep definitely what

1942
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:06,319
do you recommend to put it through more

1943
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,400
than cheesecloth or is that like you

1944
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:09,279
know eight thick cheesecloth going to do

1945
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:11,679
it

1946
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:13,519
yeah it got some cheesecloth folded over

1947
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:15,440
itself is is pretty good but honestly

1948
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,080
the compost tea bags that you brew right

1949
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:17,919
in

1950
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:20,158
are usually good enough

1951
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,840
but it's really important to clean out

1952
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:23,439
both your brewer and your sprayer and

1953
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,520
everything right after

1954
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:27,279
to prevent biofilm from

1955
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,280
accumulating and dry in there because

1956
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:30,479
it's a whole lot harder to clean once

1957
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:32,238
it's dry and all those nooks and

1958
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:34,319
crannies then uh if you were to just you

1959
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:35,678
know pump some water and maybe some dr

1960
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:37,039
bronner's through it right away or

1961
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:40,480
whatnot

1962
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:42,479
um are there any um are the are the

1963
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:44,479
organism the target organisms that we're

1964
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:47,039
looking to get out of

1965
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:50,639
the castings tea

1966
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:53,279
are are they going to be susceptible to

1967
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,440
damage from high pressure

1968
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:56,639
um foliar sprayers i'm just learning

1969
01:10:55,439 --> 01:10:58,719
about this so i don't know a ton about

1970
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:03,039
it but but there's certainly a you know

1971
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:05,359
a higher end foliar sprayer that um can

1972
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:07,279
really wreak havoc on microbes if it's

1973
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:08,799
used and so i think you probably know

1974
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:11,439
what i'm talking about more than i do

1975
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:14,159
yeah exactly um

1976
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:17,919
definitely something to look into uh if

1977
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:20,799
you ever buy like a pack of nematodes um

1978
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:22,000
they'll say it's like don't exceed 72

1979
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,600
psi

1980
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,238
and make sure that your nozzles over

1981
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:28,000
like 0.8 millimeters in diameter or

1982
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:30,079
something like that but uh

1983
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,640
i don't know i talked to the bug lady

1984
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:34,158
suzanne yeah wainwright evans she's like

1985
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,920
oh yeah it's it's definitely not that

1986
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:38,960
strict you have some more leeway there

1987
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,960
but you definitely don't want um crazy

1988
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:43,439
high pressurization you don't want like

1989
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,279
micronization or whatever because it'll

1990
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:46,479
just shred up like the nematodes and

1991
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:48,479
some of like the larger stuff the

1992
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:52,718
bacteria will still get through but

1993
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:54,238
uh it lowers the efficacy of like

1994
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:56,000
what's going to be surviving once it

1995
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:57,119
hits the leaf you know

1996
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,840
but

1997
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:01,439
yeah um we use grow king a garden

1998
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,800
sprayer and

1999
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:04,079
i know there's other options out there

2000
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,320
i'm not trying to

2001
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:10,000
give advertisement or whatnot but there

2002
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:11,198
was this gun that uh luis the the owner

2003
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,600
of wormy's

2004
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:15,519
um was recommended through um the soil

2005
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,440
food web academy and dr elaine and stuff

2006
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,040
i forget the name of the gun but

2007
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:19,919
there's definitely some stuff out there

2008
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:21,760
um

2009
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,480
that has proven to work for sure right

2010
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,079
on

2011
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:25,759
um

2012
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:27,519
i want to go back to a question that i

2013
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,520
missed um you know

2014
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:32,000
a lot of folks who

2015
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:34,800
do not live rurally they are buying

2016
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,319
their inputs um you know at stores and

2017
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,760
stuff because they're not able to

2018
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:40,000
wildcraft it

2019
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:42,640
and you know we learn over time that for

2020
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,920
example you don't want to be buying

2021
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:48,239
um compost in bags that um smells like

2022
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,520
bleach right there's just different

2023
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:52,479
there's different

2024
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:54,080
you want fresh fresh amendments

2025
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:56,319
um is there anything that we should be

2026
01:12:54,079 --> 01:13:00,000
looking for when buying

2027
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:02,238
bagged um castings that we want to avoid

2028
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,479
um are there any clear signs of like

2029
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:06,718
spoiled castings

2030
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:08,718
so yeah i definitely don't recommend

2031
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:10,560
buying castings that have been sitting

2032
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:13,439
on the shelf i know sometimes that's

2033
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,560
your only option but at that point it's

2034
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:16,799
i don't know it's more like a place

2035
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,719
filler than anything you know like

2036
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,079
compost should really be a microbial

2037
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:21,520
inoculation

2038
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:24,000
more than anything it's like yes it's

2039
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,719
going to provide some nutrients but it's

2040
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,960
really providing the microbes that your

2041
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:30,480
soil needs to take care of itself you

2042
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,239
know and so like

2043
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:34,079
that's what's great about wormies is you

2044
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:36,639
can come you know get it straight from

2045
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:38,880
the farm never put it into a bag or when

2046
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:41,760
we do bag it it's usually gone within

2047
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,520
that week and so like nothing dries out

2048
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,679
it doesn't go dormant uh it's in

2049
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,920
breathable bags and so like

2050
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:49,840
highly highly recommend you know finding

2051
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,760
somebody that's composting around you or

2052
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,800
doing it yourself um

2053
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,719
because

2054
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,039
the stuff that you get on from the groce

2055
01:13:54,719 --> 01:14:00,079
store that's sitting in a bag

2056
01:13:57,039 --> 01:14:02,319
who knows how long it's been there

2057
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:03,840
who knows the feedstock that they fed

2058
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:06,960
that stuff with it could have just been

2059
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:08,960
you know newspaper and cardboard and

2060
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,640
yeah you get a homogeneous product it

2061
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,319
looks the same every time some growers

2062
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,400
are used to it but like what benefit is

2063
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:16,238
that actually adding and so like

2064
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:18,799
it's really nothing compared to

2065
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:21,359
living breathing microbes from fresh

2066
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,360
compost you know yeah yeah i follow that

2067
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:25,279
um for those of you who aren't sure

2068
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:27,359
where you would get it because you live

2069
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:29,359
in the city um i would recommend also

2070
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:31,839
checking your farmer's market

2071
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:33,519
i was very happy to find that um this

2072
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,079
year our farmer's markets just started

2073
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,679
back up here on vashon and one of my

2074
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:40,000
favorite um

2075
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:43,520
uh organic food

2076
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,198
purveyors um they've got um

2077
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:48,239
castings there at the end of their table

2078
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:51,039
now and i get five pounds for 10 bucks

2079
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:52,718
and that's double great because they're

2080
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:56,560
local right so they're they're all

2081
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:58,079
imbued with our local island imo so um i

2082
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,760
will i will probably buy them out for

2083
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:01,760
the season so for real man it sounds

2084
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,119
like you got the hook up there yeah so

2085
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:05,360
yeah that's the thing too is like a lot

2086
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:07,359
of people don't necessarily advertise

2087
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:09,198
this they don't have a vermicomposting

2088
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:11,039
business but there are some heady people

2089
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:13,359
out there for sure that you know might

2090
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:15,600
have enough to share and that's just the

2091
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:17,198
power of community and you know getting

2092
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,560
out there and

2093
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:20,000
connecting with these cool people

2094
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,159
because there are really really cool

2095
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,920
people like-minded cool like-minded

2096
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:26,479
people out there but a lot of times

2097
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,480
we're just spread pretty far um

2098
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:30,718
but bringing us together in the

2099
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:31,678
community and stuff is super important

2100
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:33,119
and uh

2101
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,199
yeah we'll talk about the compost cup

2102
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:36,719
later but it's so important to to

2103
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:38,639
network and find these cool people out

2104
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:40,319
there yeah right on all right so let's

2105
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,280
finish up this uh

2106
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:45,519
this set with talking about um

2107
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:47,519
natural farming ferments so

2108
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,000
pretty much everybody who is going to be

2109
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:52,640
using the castings from the show is has

2110
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,319
got you know going to be using natural

2111
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:57,360
farming preps or

2112
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:59,679
you know knf preps specifically

2113
01:15:57,359 --> 01:16:01,279
and um you know

2114
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:03,840
i'm sure that there are some people who

2115
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:06,960
are thinking to themselves you know will

2116
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:10,640
any of my preparations

2117
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:12,880
um hurt the worms or not play nice with

2118
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,880
the castings and i'm assuming since

2119
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,640
they're all in the same food web we're

2120
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,840
good but we should really address that

2121
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:22,480
so will you will you speak a little to

2122
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:24,000
it yeah um so you don't want to overdo

2123
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:24,959
anything like we're talking about it's

2124
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,198
like

2125
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:30,000
i don't know i use some k f preps i use

2126
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:31,519
some jadom use you know a little bit of

2127
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,359
of everything that

2128
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:36,000
resonates with me but

2129
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:37,599
i mainly just focus on you know mulching

2130
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,600
heavily

2131
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,199
inoculating with as much diversity as

2132
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,719
possible and just like taking care of

2133
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:44,479
the soil and letting the soil and the

2134
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:47,198
plants figure it out

2135
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:50,479
so like strategically you don't use as

2136
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:54,000
many inoculants as others would but

2137
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:57,519
specifically to the question um these

2138
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,760
these natural ferments so long as you

2139
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:02,800
you know use as directed like you know

2140
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,719
1 500 1 000 you know as long as you're

2141
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,920
using them at the proper strength

2142
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:08,399
they're they're not going to they're not

2143
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:10,239
going to mess with the worms right no no

2144
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:12,399
at that level it's like homeopathic

2145
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:13,359
almost and like i really like that just

2146
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:16,158
like

2147
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:18,960
less is more and um in a lot of the the

2148
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:20,399
situations but um a lot of people get

2149
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,399
into this k f stuff and they're like

2150
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:24,479
okay this says one to a thousand you

2151
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:27,198
know let's do one to five hundred like

2152
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:29,359
let's double it up and uh because that's

2153
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:31,759
a very american way of thinking you know

2154
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:34,639
i i dude i can i have to cop to that

2155
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:36,719
that's that's me i have to constantly

2156
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:39,520
not add more of stuff

2157
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:42,399
i'm like oh if if 1 000 is great one to

2158
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:44,800
200 must be five times as good for real

2159
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:47,039
it's totally not true that's working

2160
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,840
against nature yeah or like just

2161
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:51,760
spraying fpj or fermented fruit juice or

2162
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,640
something without balancing it out first

2163
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,679
and like

2164
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,039
there's a

2165
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:56,960
whole lot to

2166
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:59,279
these schools of thoughts that you kind

2167
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:01,439
of got to know pretty much all of it

2168
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:02,719
to understand why it works it's like

2169
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:05,519
when you just

2170
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:07,439
hear one thing and yeah you go for that

2171
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,560
it might not necessarily be

2172
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:12,479
the whole picture and you could uh

2173
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,000
mess something up and then say oh well k

2174
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:16,319
enough doesn't work or something like

2175
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,158
that but yeah that's classic bro science

2176
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,759
right there

2177
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:22,319
absolutely this is one of the reasons

2178
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,480
why i'm not that great of a baker like

2179
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:27,840
i'm a killer cook i do magic in the

2180
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:30,079
kitchen but but with baking

2181
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,079
it's not about iron chefing until you're

2182
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:34,399
already like really good at baking right

2183
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:36,640
when you first start baking you have to

2184
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:39,519
follow the recipe yeah and like i seem

2185
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:42,560
to have like a total inability to follow

2186
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:45,199
the recipe and so like i generally buy

2187
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,239
or trade for my breads because

2188
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:47,919
um

2189
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:50,399
you know actually i kind of wish that it

2190
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,640
was like um you know in the matrix when

2191
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:54,960
uh when it when he plugs in the program

2192
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:58,000
he's like i know kung fu you know i just

2193
01:18:54,960 --> 01:19:00,880
i wish i could plug in baking right

2194
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,719
because because a good baker it takes

2195
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,560
some dedication and development of

2196
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:07,039
skills before

2197
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,560
you can kind of iron chef it like you

2198
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:10,560
know and like

2199
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,679
i'm at such a novice level with baking

2200
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,920
that it demands that i

2201
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:18,158
uh measure everything

2202
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,800
because i i have not earned my right to

2203
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:22,639
eyeball things for sure and i see a lot

2204
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,560
of similarity with that and and

2205
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,560
composting or growing or whatever it's

2206
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,560
like when you first start off yeah you

2207
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,480
can find there's some pretty strict

2208
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,400
guidelines out there and you might want

2209
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:34,079
to stick to them at first until like you

2210
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:36,158
have a baseline

2211
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:37,359
of understanding you know and then once

2212
01:19:36,158 --> 01:19:39,359
you understand

2213
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:41,039
you know why everything's doing what

2214
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:43,679
it's doing like then you can start to

2215
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:44,800
experiment a little bit more but uh like

2216
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:46,960
for example

2217
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,880
a lot of home worm

2218
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,640
bin owners will like look up directions

2219
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,960
and stuff and say oh i absolutely can't

2220
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:55,039
put any citrus in there no onions

2221
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,039
you know no

2222
01:19:55,039 --> 01:19:58,960
you know there's there's all sorts of of

2223
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:00,960
rules out there but like once you

2224
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:03,679
understand your worms and your bin and

2225
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,359
everything like yes you can put maybe

2226
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:06,560
a little bit of something like that in

2227
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:08,158
there but like you don't want to fill up

2228
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,080
the whole entire thing with any of those

2229
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:12,079
and like you want to

2230
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:13,920
understand like the basic principles of

2231
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:15,519
uh like covering up your scraps and

2232
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,440
stuff like that to avoid

2233
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:20,080
getting fruit fries but

2234
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:21,839
um yeah once once you uh

2235
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:24,000
stick to the baselines for a little bit

2236
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,520
and then get some understanding then you

2237
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,198
can go off on your own and start to

2238
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,960
experiment a little bit and

2239
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:30,879
do some cool stuff right on that's an

2240
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:33,600
awesome summary all right so

2241
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:35,440
let's go ahead and take our second short

2242
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,840
break and be right back you are

2243
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:40,158
listening to shaping fire and my guest

2244
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:43,279
today is regenerative farming educator

2245
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:43,279
chandler michelski

2246
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:47,439
one of the challenges with buying

2247
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:49,679
autoflower seeds is that often you'll

2248
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:51,599
have as many different phenos as you

2249
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:53,760
will have seeds in a pack

2250
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:56,079
that can be fun sure but so many

2251
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,840
varieties in one pack is a sign of an

2252
01:20:56,079 --> 01:20:59,198
immature seedline that hasn't been

2253
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,279
worked enough

2254
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:02,960
i prefer my autoflowers to be worked

2255
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:04,960
enough that each pheno in the pack

2256
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:07,359
really captures the aspects that the

2257
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:10,239
breeder was intending

2258
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:12,079
this is why i recommend gnome automatics

2259
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:14,879
to my friends and listeners who grow

2260
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:16,639
automatic flowering cannabis seeds

2261
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,480
gnome automatic seeds are not just

2262
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:21,199
crossed and released they are

2263
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:23,759
painstakingly sifted again and again

2264
01:21:21,198 --> 01:21:26,000
tested in a wide range of conditions and

2265
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:29,199
taken to a level of maturity that each

2266
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,359
plant will be recognizable by its traits

2267
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:34,559
traits that were hard earned so that you

2268
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:36,639
can have your best growth cycle ever

2269
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:39,199
gnome automatics became a trusted and

2270
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:41,520
loved brand in cannabis over the last 10

2271
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:43,359
years as mandalorian genetics and

2272
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,880
recently changed their name to gnome

automatics

2274
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:49,760
the only thing that has changed is the

[Music]

2295
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:39,039
there are a lot of good people launching

2296
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:40,880
new businesses in cannabis psilocybin

2297
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:43,279
and other psychedelics and it's very

2298
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,359
strange time for us in the same moment

2299
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:47,279
that psilocybin mushrooms are illegal at

2300
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:49,279
the federal level they are becoming

2301
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:50,319
increasingly legal in states across the

2302
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:52,158
country

2303
01:22:50,319 --> 01:22:54,399
these businesses leading the way into

2304
01:22:52,158 --> 01:22:56,719
the future of plant medicines require

2305
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:58,638

farming educator chandler michalski

01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:25,760
so during the first set we talked about

2405
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:28,158
the greatness and epic nature of the

2406
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:30,719
worm and how we can work well together

2407
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:34,158
during the second set we talked about

2408
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:36,719
how to use the castings and various

2409
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:38,238
applications in our garden so that we

2410
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:40,800
can get that

2411
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:44,479
nutrition into the soil

2412
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:46,719
and you know many people will just stop

2413
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:50,079
there and be thrilled

2414
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:51,840
because they will have a source for um

2415
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:54,800
you know the castings either from a

2416
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:56,480
local organic farmer or you know

2417
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,079
they'll find some like crazy hippie

2418
01:26:56,479 --> 01:27:00,319
selling them online that they'll become

2419
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:02,238
friends with or whatever um or or you

2420
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:05,519
know you can you can get them as a gift

2421
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:08,399
from somebody locally but for many of us

2422
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:11,040
especially if you have got a large

2423
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:12,960
cultivation situation going on

2424
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:14,639
um you're probably already thinking

2425
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:17,520
about setting up a worm bin you're all

2426
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:19,279
like i need to produce this black gold

2427
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,920
on my own property

2428
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:23,920
and then you know inoculate it with your

2429
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:28,000
own imo that you produced on your

2430
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:30,719
property and um set three is for you so

2431
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,560
there is no doubt that you know an

2432
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:37,039
entire show could easily be done just on

2433
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:39,039
best practices for making a worm bin and

2434
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:40,319
that is not what we're doing today

2435
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:43,519
the goal

2436
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:44,880
is for people who are considering making

2437
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,920
a worm bin

2438
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,679
to

2439
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,760
at the end of this set you will have a

2440
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:50,960
better understanding of what it will

2441
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,199
require

2442
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:55,198
and you'll probably have enough um you

2443
01:27:53,198 --> 01:27:56,638
know basic information to go for it but

2444
01:27:55,198 --> 01:27:57,839
really we just kind of want to give you

2445
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,239
a taste

2446
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:03,119
of of what the complex the level of

2447
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:04,718
complexity of it so you can like either

2448
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:06,719
a decide if or

2449
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:08,319
if you want to do it or not

2450
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:10,000
and but then also

2451
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:11,519
you know people like us when we get

2452
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,600
around for dinner parties this is the

2453
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:16,000
kind of stuff we talk about and like

2454
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,360
your next your next like you know farmer

2455
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,639

2456
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:20,719
worm bins you'll know what the hell is

2457
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:22,880
going on so so you know take this

2458
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:25,039
information as you will but um but we

2459
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:27,520
understand it's not gonna be like a

2460
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:28,479
complete set of information so

2461
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,679
with that

2462
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:31,599
um

2463
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:35,199
chandler um

2464
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:37,920
back to the worm species discussion so

2465
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:40,799
well if we're talking about the worms in

2466
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:43,199
the soil um just like cruising around

2467
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:45,679
being worms there seems to be a lot of

2468
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:50,079
variety of the kinds of worms that we

2469
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:52,960
can just toss into the container um

2470
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:56,238
is that the same when setting up a bin

2471
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:58,158
or is the bin more related to using one

2472
01:28:56,238 --> 01:29:00,799
particular species

2473
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:02,238
yeah so you can use night crawlers in

2474
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,719
these bins but

2475
01:29:02,238 --> 01:29:06,959
i i don't really like doing that they

2476
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:09,039
like to go down deep like up to like 12

2477
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,439
15 feet deep and they obviously can't do

2478
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:13,679
that into a bin and so like i'd much

2479
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:15,439
rather use the red wigglers who only

2480
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:16,719
stick to that top six to eight inches

2481
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:19,119
which is pretty much all that you're

2482
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:20,399
going for and a worm bin anyways and so

2483
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:22,319
for like

2484
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:24,399
enclosed worm bins i think red wigglers

2485
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:26,559
are probably the way to go

2486
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:28,158
um is there a particular place that one

2487
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,000
sources those i mean if they're if you

2488
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:31,839
know somebody with a worm bin

2489
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,679
um you know

2490
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:35,279
what if they if they give you a couple

2491
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:36,960
cupped hands full is that going to be

2492
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:38,639
enough to start your own or do you need

2493
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,960
like a bunch where you need to like

2494
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:43,679
order them from a worm bin starter

2495
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:46,800
company kind of thing no a

2496
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:49,600
popular uh weight to salomon is in half

2497
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:51,600
pounds or pounds and so pound is usually

2498
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,600
considered like a thousand worms

2499
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:56,639
and so that's a great way to start a

2500
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:58,239
worm bin and uh they will regulate their

2501
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:00,719
their population and stuff based off of

2502
01:29:58,238 --> 01:30:02,959
what you're putting into it but a pound

2503
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,399
of worms is usually uh

2504
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,719
the ideal start

2505
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:09,279
all right so if if we want to have a

2506
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:10,960
worm bin and we want to be producing

2507
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:13,759
enough castings

2508
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:16,158
um for our own cultivation needs for the

2509
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:18,719
season now if somebody is thinking about

2510
01:30:16,158 --> 01:30:20,799
selling these um there are whole

2511
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,000
different sources about scaling up and

2512
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,800
that's not what we're talking about

2513
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,719
today

2514
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,480
um but but

2515
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:28,158
how big

2516
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:31,839
of a bin

2517
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:35,359
am i likely to want if i am a

2518
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:37,199
like just a home grower um let's say

2519
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:39,279
yeah i know this is not a legal number

2520
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:40,559
but let's just say under 20 plants right

2521
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:42,479
yeah if you let's say you're a home

2522
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,760
grower under 20 plants

2523
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:46,959
versus

2524
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:49,039
um somebody who's more commercial scaled

2525
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:51,520
where you're talking like a hundred and

2526
01:30:49,039 --> 01:30:53,519
above right yeah so so what what are the

2527
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,280
differences in sizes so that we can wrap

2528
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,199
our heads around that so it's gonna be

2529
01:30:55,279 --> 01:30:59,439
tough to uh

2530
01:30:57,198 --> 01:31:01,919
supply a hundred plants you know all

2531
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:04,479
year if you're doing indoor and whatnot

2532
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:05,920
um unless you have a pretty big scale

2533
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:07,279
and so like

2534
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:09,440
that's one of the biggest things with

2535
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:11,439
worm bins is a lot of people get one to

2536
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:13,839
try to compost all their food scraps or

2537
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:15,359
all their garden waste and like

2538
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,440
it's pretty limited you don't want to

2539
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:19,359
pack it full you don't want to over feed

2540
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:21,198
your worms and so like

2541
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:22,880
ideally most people should have a

2542
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:25,119
regular compost pile out in their

2543
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:26,639
backyard as well as a worm bin and so

2544
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:27,599
like then they can take you know just

2545
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:29,679
the best

2546
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,600
organic food that they have or whatever

2547
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:33,600
just the highest quality stuff put that

2548
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,840
in the worm bin and then they can put

2549
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,639
the rest out into the actual compost and

2550
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,319
then

2551
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:39,760
you can mix the final products or

2552
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:42,238
whatever and that's going to be a lot

2553
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:43,280
better for these large scale

2554
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:45,119
to uh

2555
01:31:43,279 --> 01:31:47,599
have enough compost without you know

2556
01:31:45,119 --> 01:31:48,880
being full-time worm farmers

2557
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,600
uh

2558
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,520
how

2559
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,280
what's the physical size of a worm bin

2560
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,440
like two by three

2561
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:56,960
yeah it's a good size uh pretty common

2562
01:31:55,439 --> 01:31:59,439
to use um

2563
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:01,920
your your rubbermaid totes or whatever a

2564
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:03,439
great diy solution

2565
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,960
sorry about that

2566
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:07,279
um

2567
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:09,679
so yeah you can use a little two by

2568
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:12,158
three tote anything similar to that size

2569
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:14,239
but um some popular like worm towers are

2570
01:32:12,158 --> 01:32:15,359
out there and those are only maybe two

2571
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:16,479
by two

2572
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:18,238
and uh

2573
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:20,559
i personally like the

2574
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:23,039
continual like flow-through systems like

2575
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:25,520
the urban worm bag is a good one and you

2576
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:27,119
just constantly put your scraps on top

2577
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,800
and all the castings are on the bottom

2578
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:31,920
and then you can actually harvest from

2579
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:33,920
the bottom there um separate your worms

2580
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,760
that sounds super convenient

2581
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:39,520
um there's pros and cons to different

2582
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:39,520
at-home methods but i think

2583
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,039
understanding that you're probably not

2584
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:44,799
going to be able to compost all of your

2585
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:46,479
waste through your worm bin as an

2586
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,320
important realization

2587
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:51,119
it sounds like you you can't really go

2588
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:52,799
wrong either too or you know just a cold

2589
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:54,880
compost pile outside

2590
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:56,239
as well as a dedicated worm bin it

2591
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,920
doesn't sound like you can really go

2592
01:32:56,238 --> 01:33:00,718
wrong either like whether or not you use

2593
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:04,319
the bag or you build like a fancy wooden

2594
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:08,560
box or you use like a plastic tub

2595
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:11,840
your um your setup costs are really low

2596
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:14,239
and um so just like get something and

2597
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:17,039
start with something and then

2598
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:18,319
as you get more sophisticated you'll

2599
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:21,119
learn more

2600
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:23,599
what you want for your next one yep i i

2601
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:25,359
love that and just getting like don't be

2602
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,719
intimidated with any of this stuff you

2603
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:27,839
know just start somewhere start with

2604
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:29,439
what you have

2605
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,840
and make the best out of it and then

2606
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:33,599
over time you can you can upgrade and

2607
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,600
stuff like that a lot of people think oh

2608
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,120
i just gotta wait until you know i have

2609
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,719
everything i need

2610
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:40,238
which is true about some stuff but

2611
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:41,439
there's a lot of things in this

2612
01:33:40,238 --> 01:33:44,079
gardening and

2613
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:45,279
composting that you really can just

2614
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:46,880
you know

2615
01:33:45,279 --> 01:33:48,719
connect some food with the the ground

2616
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,880
outside or whatever and start stuff

2617
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:53,198
starts to happen most of us probably

2618
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:54,319
have those black and yellow bins on the

2619
01:33:53,198 --> 01:33:56,079
property

2620
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:59,198
that's what i'm going to use so

2621
01:33:56,079 --> 01:34:02,559
perfect right on so um i i know that the

2622
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:05,119
location of the um

2623
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,639
of the bin on the property is important

2624
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:09,920
because we don't want to cook it kind of

2625
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:11,440
like when you um inoculate uh wood chips

2626
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,679
and you're gonna grow mushrooms on your

2627
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:15,359
property you're kind of looking like at

2628
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:16,840
the edge of the property near the trees

2629
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:19,439
where it's gonna be a little

2630
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:20,880
cooler where is that the same kind of

2631
01:34:19,439 --> 01:34:23,439
place where we're going to want to put

2632
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:24,719
the worm bin um because i we're probably

2633
01:34:23,439 --> 01:34:26,399
all going to want to put it like on our

2634
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:28,480
deck right next to the kitchen and i can

2635
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:30,960
imagine that might not be the best place

2636
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:32,399
yeah it might be convenient um

2637
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,880
but yeah you definitely want to keep it

2638
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:37,119
out of direct sunlight and um

2639
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:39,760
keep it in the the moisture in the shade

2640
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:41,359
if you got a tree line you know keep it

2641
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,119
just to the north of the the trees on

2642
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:44,399
the south side of your property keep it

2643
01:34:43,118 --> 01:34:45,359
nice in the shade

2644
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:46,638
um

2645
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:48,719
that's just gonna help out everything

2646
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:50,560
you're not gonna have to add water it's

2647
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,719
not really beneficial to

2648
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,600
you know pour water over your worm bin

2649
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:55,520
um

2650
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,719
you never want like excess water i don't

2651
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:58,480
know how

2652
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:00,639
this became such like a common thing but

2653
01:34:58,479 --> 01:35:02,718
people think that a healthy worm bin

2654
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:04,800
should have like leachate it should have

2655
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:06,800
excess water coming out of the bottom

2656
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:08,560
but that's really not the case if you

2657
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,400
have a lot of excess water coming out

2658
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,239
you're probably doing something wrong

2659
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:14,399
but uh that being said

2660
01:35:12,238 --> 01:35:15,839
moisture is absolutely vital you got to

2661
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:17,679
remember like you're creating the

2662
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:19,679
environment for the microbes and they

2663
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,440
need that bit of biofilm to you know

2664
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:23,199
swim around and they

2665
01:35:21,439 --> 01:35:24,799
move around a whole lot faster and they

2666
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:26,238
can set up their their colonies and

2667
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,719
everything if there's a little bit of

2668
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:30,319
moisture to it and so uh you really want

2669
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:33,279
to maintain the moisture of your worm

2670
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:34,719
bin if it dries out at all uh the

2671
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:36,639
microbes are going to assist up and then

2672
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:38,158
when the conditions are right again

2673
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:39,679
they're not all going to come back and

2674
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:40,479
so you're going to lose some diversity

2675
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:41,760
and

2676
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:43,359
it's uh

2677
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:45,280
like we said it

2678
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:46,799
it's a time-consuming process and you

2679
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:48,639
can't put all your scraps in there

2680
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,560
already and so you really want to be you

2681
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:51,600
know speeding up the process as much as

2682
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:53,600
possible

2683
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,600
and so you can uh you know feed your

2684
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:58,239
worms as much as possible and so a great

2685
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:00,320
way to do that is by reducing the

2686
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:02,799
the particle size of

2687
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:05,039
your feedstock and so the more surface

2688
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:06,880
area you have

2689
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:09,198
the more inoculation points for all your

2690
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:11,440
microbes and so it's going to be a lot

2691
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:13,439
easier for your microbes to get in and

2692
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:15,279
soften things up break things down and

2693
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:17,118
then your worms to come in and eat those

2694
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:20,079
microbes um

2695
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:22,799
so blending your food scraps is huge

2696
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:24,639
it'll save so much time

2697
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,159
but again this is like

2698
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:28,800
for that next level

2699
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:30,799
soil nerd who's like okay i'm gonna put

2700
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:32,800
all my vegetable scraps into the food

2701
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:34,960
processor before i put them in my worm

2702
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:37,039
bin it's like i don't know just a whole

2703
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:39,600
other intentional thing but

2704
01:36:37,039 --> 01:36:41,198
uh you'll really decrease the amount of

2705
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,440
time it takes yeah that sounds like a

2706
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:45,678
best practice that you might not have to

2707
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:49,279
start with at day one but

2708
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:52,800
um you'll find a huge increase in

2709
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:54,880
benefit from that that small action

2710
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:57,199
for sure and uh freezing them too is

2711
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:58,880
another popular thing uh

2712
01:36:57,198 --> 01:37:01,118
you know if you're only one person or a

2713
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,520
small family you can accumulate your

2714
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:06,238
food scraps um if you have any extra

2715
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:08,159
freezer space put them in the freezer

2716
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:09,599
and then that freeing or that freezing

2717
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:12,000
and thawing will actually like break

2718
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:14,079
down the cell wall and let those

2719
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,399
microbes get in there a whole lot faster

2720
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:18,479
and speed everything up and so that's a

2721
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:20,238
common question you know for winter time

2722
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:22,559
up here in michigan and in these cold

2723
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:25,279
areas it's like oh can i still compost

2724
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:27,119
it's like yes you should still you know

2725
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:28,639
accumulate your scraps know they're not

2726
01:37:27,118 --> 01:37:29,519
going to break down

2727
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:30,719
um

2728
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,239
yes they're going to freeze but then

2729
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:34,319
they're just sitting there and waiting

2730
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:36,079
for the spring and it'll all be good

2731
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:39,920
yeah and it's a great location to store

2732
01:37:36,079 --> 01:37:43,600
them yep yeah so um so when you first

2733
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:46,079
get your bin um what do you want to put

2734
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:48,480
in there like you know generally food

2735
01:37:46,079 --> 01:37:50,960
scraps okay but but like i've just

2736
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:52,638
started my bin right so are you you know

2737
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:55,359
do you suggest that we

2738
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:58,480
save our food scraps for a week or two

2739
01:37:55,359 --> 01:38:00,479
before we get our hands on the worms and

2740
01:37:58,479 --> 01:38:02,319
i also see a lot of people that have got

2741
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:04,879
newspaper in their bins is that like

2742
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:06,960
training wheels for a worm bin like

2743
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:10,000
break this down for us yeah so newspaper

2744
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:12,319
is good if you don't have um compost but

2745
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,880
i'd much rather my worms just being in

2746
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:16,639
compost and eating all those microbes

2747
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,239
then newspaper

2748
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:19,760
you know shredded paper or anything like

2749
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:22,238
that um

2750
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,679
if you have you know access to a ton of

2751
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:25,839
newspaper which

2752
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:26,880
i don't even know who does anymore like

2753
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,840
i don't know where they're printing

2754
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:30,480
papers still but

2755
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:32,239
um

2756
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:33,839
yeah that'd be great you shred that up

2757
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:36,718
and the worms love that as a bedding

2758
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,800
honestly but uh i highly recommend using

2759
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:40,239
some compost in your bin and then adding

2760
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:41,840
your food scraps and just like any

2761
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:42,559
compost

2762
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,360
or

2763
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,440
any

2764
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:47,839
organic matter there's a

2765
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:49,759
carbon to nitrogen ratio to consider and

2766
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:52,079
so you don't want you know all your

2767
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:53,840
nitrogen-rich food scraps you know just

2768
01:38:52,079 --> 01:38:56,158
sitting on your bin and becoming a

2769
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:57,520
sloppy wet mess

2770
01:38:56,158 --> 01:38:59,439
you really want to balance that out with

2771
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:02,239
the dry carbon rich

2772
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:05,118
brown material and so

2773
01:39:02,238 --> 01:39:06,238
like shredded up cardboard is wonderful

2774
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:09,118
uh

2775
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:11,599
shredded paper is a part of the

2776
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:12,960
the solution but i think using compost

2777
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,719
that has you know wood chips and all

2778
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,840
your twigs and stuff like that

2779
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:17,198
uh you're gonna get so much more

2780
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,639
diversity

2781
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:20,799
and also

2782
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:23,039
um a lot of people think okay i got this

2783
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:25,840
worm bin it should just be a monoculture

2784
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:28,319
of worms but like that's really not the

2785
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:30,639
most healthy worm bin either you should

2786
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:32,399
have all sorts of soil mites in there

2787
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:34,960
predators and shredders

2788
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:37,439
and quality stuff you'll get some

2789
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:41,198
rove beetles coming and and pill bugs

2790
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:42,319
and all sorts of diversity that you know

2791
01:39:41,198 --> 01:39:43,839
a lot of people

2792
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:45,679
if you're just beginning

2793
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,840
uh might freak them out because they're

2794
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:50,239
just expecting to see worms but all

2795
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:51,840
those other guys are very very helpful

2796
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:54,238
very beneficial

2797
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:55,119
if we're looking to start or inoculate a

2798
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:57,039
bin

2799
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:59,359
would it be reasonable just to take like

2800
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:01,118
one of our containers from last year and

2801
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:02,158
dump that in the bin we already know

2802
01:40:01,118 --> 01:40:04,238
that it's

2803
01:40:02,158 --> 01:40:06,479
living soil that's super biologically

2804
01:40:04,238 --> 01:40:08,718
active yep yeah yeah so that would be a

2805
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:10,718
great way to go yeah absolutely how how

2806
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:13,359
high on the on the

2807
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:16,239
bin or container do we want to put

2808
01:40:13,359 --> 01:40:18,319
compost like i've seen many people's

2809
01:40:16,238 --> 01:40:19,839
bins that look kind of sad and they

2810
01:40:18,319 --> 01:40:23,039
there's only like this

2811
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:25,600
you know one or two inches of like paper

2812
01:40:23,039 --> 01:40:27,920
and old melons and stuff in it and i'm

2813
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:31,280
like that does not that looks kind of

2814
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:33,199
sketch but in my head i picture like a

2815
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:34,960
plastic bin that's like a third or

2816
01:40:33,198 --> 01:40:37,678
halfway full

2817
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:41,039
and then when i get the melon rind or

2818
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:43,679
whatever i'll you know pull pull some of

2819
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:45,760
the soil to the side put the melon and

2820
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:47,279
then cover it back up like but i'm

2821
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,760
making this up i don't even know if this

2822
01:40:47,279 --> 01:40:51,920
is true so does that make sense yeah for

2823
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:54,000
sure so like i said if you're using

2824
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:55,679
these red wigglers they're not gonna

2825
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,840
really like anything deeper than eight

2826
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:59,760
inches and so that's gonna be

2827
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,119
probably about as high as you wanna go

2828
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,960
um until

2829
01:41:01,118 --> 01:41:04,799
and so it depends on how often you need

2830
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:06,000
to harvest your castings or whatnot like

2831
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,560
you could just let it all turn to

2832
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,399
castings on the bottom and continue to

2833
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,800
feed on top and fill up the whole entire

2834
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:14,319
bin you know and harvest it way down the

2835
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:16,000
road but uh

2836
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:18,000
if you need those castings right away

2837
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,880
then you might not want to continue to

2838
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,840
uh

2839
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:24,560
to add fresh stuff on top

2840
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:28,000
um so my next part is the harvest so so

2841
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:31,039
how do we like in my head the worms are

2842
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,679
cruising around in the compost and

2843
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:37,118
they're leaving castings but the

2844
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:40,639
castings are mixed in with the compost

2845
01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:43,599
so am i going to harvest the entire

2846
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:46,960
bin and then like start it again like i

2847
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:49,760
would do with like a compost brewer

2848
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:52,560
yeah so um this is where multiple bins

2849
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:55,280
comes into play and so like over time

2850
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:57,039
you'd stop feeding uh your one bin fresh

2851
01:41:55,279 --> 01:41:59,679
scraps or if you have like the

2852
01:41:57,039 --> 01:42:01,359
vertically integrated system you'd uh

2853
01:41:59,679 --> 01:42:03,679
start feeding that top one the fresh

2854
01:42:01,359 --> 01:42:05,359
scraps and so like all the worms on the

2855
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:07,440
bottom bin would go up through those

2856
01:42:05,359 --> 01:42:09,599
holes in that top bin and they'd find

2857
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:11,118
the fresh scraps and then in theory all

2858
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:13,600
the

2859
01:42:11,118 --> 01:42:15,118
the bottom bin would be void of worms or

2860
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,000
most of them would would be on the top

2861
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:17,839
end

2862
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,600
but uh

2863
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:21,679
yeah different ways to do it for sure

2864
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:24,719
that's really cool and novel man i i

2865
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:26,319
like um i'm realizing that there is a

2866
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:28,319
whole

2867
01:42:26,319 --> 01:42:30,158
there's a whole new world that i'm about

2868
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:32,319
to be pushed into i mean the fact that

2869
01:42:30,158 --> 01:42:34,000
people are stacking bins and putting

2870
01:42:32,319 --> 01:42:35,840
holes in one so

2871
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,359
the worms naturally migrate i mean

2872
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:40,639
that's just cool

2873
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:42,238
yeah for sure and uh you'll find

2874
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:45,600
a couple different models like that i

2875
01:42:42,238 --> 01:42:47,118
have the worm tower or worm factory 360

2876
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:49,440
or something like that but it's just

2877
01:42:47,118 --> 01:42:51,679
basically a worm tower and really you

2878
01:42:49,439 --> 01:42:53,519
only need you know two bins that stack

2879
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:56,079
on top of each other you'll find some

2880
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:58,080
models that have like five and it's like

2881
01:42:56,079 --> 01:43:00,639
yeah there's i don't know it gives you

2882
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:02,559
more options i guess but i really only

2883
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:04,560
need two one to kind of let it cure up

2884
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:06,800
and then one to start feeding and all

2885
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:08,800
those those worms would migrate up but

2886
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,440
uh if you're just gonna sift them you

2887
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:13,119
can peel them out by hand but also like

2888
01:43:11,439 --> 01:43:16,000
we're talking about earlier the avocado

2889
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:19,039
tech or any method to lure those worms

2890
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,600
up you know you put a fresh

2891
01:43:19,039 --> 01:43:23,118
piece of pumpkin on there and damn near

2892
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,239
all the worms in your bin are gonna be

2893
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:26,158
up there and then you could just scoop

2894
01:43:24,238 --> 01:43:27,919
them out in a handful or two and move

2895
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:29,679
them where they need to go so that's a

2896
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,800
great harvesting method

2897
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:32,239
right on

2898
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:33,440
so um

2899
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:37,279
uh

2900
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:40,000
is there a particular like website um or

2901
01:43:37,279 --> 01:43:43,198
a forum for people who like me are now

2902
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:45,679
all jazzed about this is there like like

2903
01:43:43,198 --> 01:43:48,079
like i searched before we talked and

2904
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:50,840
there is lots of information all over

2905
01:43:48,079 --> 01:43:52,880
the place and and and like we know about

2906
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:55,039
cannabis um

2907
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:57,600
your mileage may vary on the quality

2908
01:43:55,039 --> 01:44:00,479
right um is there a place that that you

2909
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:02,880
recommend that people go to learn more

2910
01:44:00,479 --> 01:44:05,519
um if if they've gotten all jazzed by

2911
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:08,159
this worm bin idea yeah for sure um

2912
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:10,960
rhonda sherman is one of the leaders in

2913
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:15,759
vermicomposting she's a a true worm

2914
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:17,920
expert vermicomposting expert and she uh

2915
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:19,679
has this website here it's a bunch of

2916
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:23,319
random letters it's an educational one

2917
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:23,319
but composting.ces.ncsu.edu

2918
01:44:27,039 --> 01:44:32,560
and there's a whole page on both home

2919
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:35,360
and backyard composting which are

2920
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:37,920
i mean home and backyard uh as well as

2921
01:44:35,359 --> 01:44:41,279
large scale composting and so a ton of

2922
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:43,039
information there and a lot of times um

2923
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:44,559
it's hard to differentiate you know if

2924
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:46,079
this knowledge is for

2925
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,520
larger scale or if this is really

2926
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:50,960
intended for

2927
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:52,800
uh your backyard small scale and so like

2928
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:54,399
this page has all that information there

2929
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:56,400
easy to break down and navigate through

2930
01:44:54,399 --> 01:44:58,879
it so highly recommend looking up

that link is going to be on the episode

2935
01:45:06,479 --> 01:45:10,879
page at shapingfire.com so you can just

2936
01:45:09,359 --> 01:45:14,238
go over there and click on it

2937
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:15,600
perfect so um so in wrapping up chandler

2938
01:45:14,238 --> 01:45:17,359
you know

2939
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:19,119
one of the first things that i learned

2940
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:20,799
about this

2941
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:22,319
well actually the funny thing is is like

2942
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,400
you told me that actually we we knew

2943
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:25,920
about each other before i realized that

2944
01:45:24,399 --> 01:45:27,679
we knew about each other because i i

2945
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:30,480
thought i found out about you first when

2946
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:32,719
i saw advertisements for last year's

2947
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:34,718
michigan compost cup but then when i

2948
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:35,840
went to email you to invite you to be on

2949
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:37,439
the show

2950
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:40,079
your email was and you're like oh no man

2951
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:42,158
like i won a shaping fire contest

2952
01:45:40,079 --> 01:45:44,238
and so like i i hadn't remembered that

2953
01:45:42,158 --> 01:45:46,079
we interacted and and you got something

2954
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:49,439
from shaping fire which was cool

2955
01:45:46,079 --> 01:45:51,198
absolutely but for me like ice last year

2956
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:53,599
when you guys did the compost cup in

2957
01:45:51,198 --> 01:45:55,759
michigan as many people know i'm from
