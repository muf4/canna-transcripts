00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,000
when we like something it becomes a part

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,559
of us

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,039
when we like something we tend to defend

5
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,439
it and say it's a good thing

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:20,719
because it's us

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,960
anytime we identify with something as us

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,598
and start to defend it though it can

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,760
lead us down a bad path

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,879
it is important to stay philosophically

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,960
detached from ideas and people so we can

12
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,879
keep our minds flexible and willing to

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,880
say that we are wrong and adapt

really appreciate it you know it's kind

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,598
of funny that we're doing this

67
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,359
particular topic since you and i are

68
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,318
both known as

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,000
evangelists for autoflowers you know

70
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,399
we're both you know talking up

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,400
autoflowers all the time and here we are

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,280
gonna do a show where we're essentially

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,760
talking trash about autoflowers

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,878
exactly you know the uh the aspects of

75
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,639
what we

76
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,318
absolutely don't like about them you

77
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,878
know we have like you said we're both

78
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:54,000
evangelists for the autofire plant we've

79
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,518
seen a massive you know wave come across

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,120
the industry as they're progressing

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,400
forward but there's also a lot of things

82
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,959
about them that just get rather

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,480
frustrating yeah no doubt you know um

84
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,239
i've grown over

85
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,598
over 150 varieties like 158 varieties of

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,519
autoflower

87
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,119
and uh and i and i tell people they

88
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,920
should try them and i highly recommend

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,158
them for patients and for people with

90
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,919
space constraints um but my gosh um i

91
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,000
get frustrated just like everybody else

92
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,318
with some of the characteristics

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,199
so thank you for joining me today so we

94
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,399
can talk about all the things we hate

95
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,079
absolutely dude i think it's going to be

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,280
a great conversation for people to

97
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,280
realize you know that even though we

98
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,878
love them so much that you know like you

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,199
said we get frustrated we run into

100
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,719
problems and i think it's good to kind

101
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,798
of see both sides of that you know kind

102
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,400
of bring it both to light right on so

103
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,360
with that let's start on this list and

104
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
that's how we're going to handle this

105
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,080
show today we're just going to go

106
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,000
through

107
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,680
all of these different categories of

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,759
things that we find frustrating about

109
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,239
autoflowers and what's funny is that as

110
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,280
dan and i were getting ready for this

111
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,000
show and we were putting up a list

112
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,080
it was really shocking that the list was

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,519
so long you know like just just looking

114
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,319
at it really quick you know i can i

115
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,599
think there's like 15 or so here and

116
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,479
it's it's amazing that something that

117
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:13,280
has got so many downsides or challenges

118
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,399
would actually be something that we like

119
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,319
so much

120
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,040
so uh so let's let's start right at the

121
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:22,000
top dan so um since you're the breeder

122
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,360
um i will i'll let you start um with our

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,360
first one here about seed inconsistency

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,960
and um we're gonna talk about both about

125
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,520
the seating inconsistency in one pack

126
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,519
and also inconsistent seeds from breeder

127
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,198
to breeders so so why don't you go ahead

128
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,959
and get us started

129
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,040
sure thank you i appreciate you letting

130
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,519
me take off with this so let's just dive

131
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,800
right into it um the inconsistent seeds

132
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,879
in one pack

133
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,720
i remember coming over to

134
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,959
avimia events

135
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,199
back before we become so close friends

136
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,120
and you had made a comment that like you

137
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,680
know one of the things with autoflowers

138
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,600
is when you open up a tent pack of maybe

139
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,759
feminized or regular it's literally like

140
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,240
opening up a pack of pokemon cards you

141
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,120
have no idea what you're gonna get

142
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,680
and

143
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,639
that was a frustration point for me very

144
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,120
early on and i think it's partly why i

145
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,400
went down the rabbit hole so far was

146
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,918
because you know we're getting these

147
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,279
seeds in from europe they're being mass

148
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,038
produced in warehouses because the

149
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,799
majority like we've talked about in the

150
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,959
history of autoflowers so a lot of this

151
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,759
really started off in spain

152
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:28,239
and when you have such big crops being

153
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,160
produced into seed there's multiple

154
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,918
multiple parents from both sides whether

155
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,400
they're being reversed and making

156
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,799
feminized seed or they're being you know

157
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,959
traditionally bred male female there's

158
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,919
more than one pollen donor usually in a

159
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,680
room

160
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,439
and i think that's one of the biggest

161
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,959
things that leads to and i know it is

162
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,120
from experimentation myself the

163
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,279
inconsistency that we see in

164
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,519
a three pack to a 10 pack

165
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,159
you know yeah and you know it's it's

166
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,120
it's frustrating for most of us who have

167
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,039
spent

168
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,160
most of our growing time with photo

169
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:59,918
periods

170
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,840
you know you you might have a line of

171
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,719
something and there might be three or

172
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,318
four or five phenos within the line and

173
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,440
so if you're going to get your 8 or 10

174
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,600
or 12 pack you may see you know two or

175
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,918
three or four or all of these different

176
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,879
phenos but um

177
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,560
you know

178
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:22,319
a well-made seed run will will have

179
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,399
fewer phenos in it so that um

180
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,199
most everybody who's growing it is

181
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:31,599
getting an example plant that is closer

182
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:35,840
to the intention of the of the breeder

183
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,680
but my gosh when you get phenos in um in

184
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,279
autoflower packs

185
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,360
you know sometimes you're lucky to see

186
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,679
two of the same pheno in a pack just

187
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,919
because they've got so much variety and

188
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,319
that can be uh incredibly frustrating as

189
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:53,439
as a grower especially if you're growing

190
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,840
in small volume right if you are growing

191
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,038
uh you know just your five or six legal

192
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:01,519
plants in most states and and you and

193
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,759
your and you really like a particular

194
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,959
variety and you're growing it hoping to

195
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,919
get a few of that same plant

196
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,879
and

197
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,519
you

198
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,360
either you either don't get the target

199
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,359
fino that you wanted the one that's you

200
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,520
know you know on instagram the one that

201
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,800
looks incredible or like in your case

202
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:23,359
right um uh this year i grew a lot of

203
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,079
your stuff and and you know

204
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,400
most of your popular stuff is purple

205
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,240
but then there's like the purple on

206
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:34,959
purple which takes the great photos

207
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,918
right and so i grew wanting what i saw

208
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:40,239
in your photographs and and i was lucky

209
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,639
because i got that purple

210
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,639
and um and i'm assuming that that you

211
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,319
know that's because

212
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,120
i was running f4s of yours so so these

213
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,000
were

214
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,959
um

215
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,360
uh

216
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,198
these were seed this was a seed line

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,439
that was worked to a degree so there was

218
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,680
less variety of phenos

219
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,000
and that's why you know if if we find

220
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,759
somebody who's putting out unworked

221
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,560
lines of autoflowers sometimes they're

222
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,639
fun to see all the phenos but they're

223
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,598
you're just gonna get more variety

224
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,400
versus a more mature line that like you

225
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:16,878
tend to put out where your plants are

226
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,478
are are more the same i understand that

227
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,560
right is that right

228
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,240
yeah i mean that's that's the best way i

229
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,839
could have you know described it myself

230
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,840
you know i put the work in you know

231
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,679
we'll use anvil for example i would say

232
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,439
it's my most consistent cultivar that

233
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,879
i've ever put out

234
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,719
it's been

235
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,360
inbred to f8

236
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,959
the first feminization of that line was

237
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,360
f7 to f7 that was its first reversal and

238
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,918
even in the offspring of the first

239
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,680
reversal all the femme seeds

240
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,958
pretty much came out the same and and by

241
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,439
pretty much i'm not gonna say it was a

242
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,879
completely uniform grow or excuse me

243
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,279
uniform expression across every one of

244
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,200
the seeds that were sold but it was very

245
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,200
it was very close and that comes from

246
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
that consistent working

247
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,320
and developing that

248
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,039
narrowing down

249
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,879
your phenotypic you know your phenotypes

250
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,559
to pollinate

251
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,200
the pollen receivers in the room so if

252
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,278
that's either a feminization or a

253
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,480
regular you know male female pollination

254
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,480
run the idea is matching parents

255
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,000
and those matching parents that math and

256
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,159
i use that in air quotes has worked out

257
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,519
to me to produce something so stable

258
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,360
across any seed that cracks from anvil

259
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,600
and i i guess it's only fair to point

260
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,600
out that um you know even though we used

261
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,680
your you as an example and i've grown

262
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,600
your seeds and we're friends um that

263
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,199
there are plenty of breeders out there

264
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,200
that are working their lines you know

265
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,040
this is this is not a commercial for

266
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,080
gnome automatics right even though i

267
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:45,199
like growing your stuff um the point is

268
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,399
is that if you want to have less variety

269
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,480
in your seeds make sure that you buy

270
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,559
from a um from a seed producer who cares

271
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,320
about decreasing the phenos because

272
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,559
there are certainly people who

273
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,720
intentionally put out packs that are you

274
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,119
know great for hunting you know do your

275
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,278
own sift lots of variety um you know

276
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,278
these these these type of breeder packs

277
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,799
are great for their purpose but you know

278
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,958
if you're a home grower and you want to

279
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,359
grow the plant that's on that's on the

280
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,559
instagram that looks like the picture um

281
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,879
you're definitely going to want to get

282
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,518
something um that has been worked a lot

283
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,958
more it just depends on the kinds of

284
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,000
the kind of experience you're looking

285
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,639
for

286
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,159
100 you know there are several other

287
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,159
wonderful breeders out here in the in

288
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,120
the autoflower realm that put the work

289
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,679
in and actually do the testing and

290
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,679
produce these generational lines whether

291
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,759
it's just consistently feminizing them

292
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,359
for each generation or traditional you

293
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,439
know selection male female and then

294
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,879
feminizing them once they find a nice

295
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,640
you know group of seeds that are coming

296
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,480
out and expressing the same there are

297
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,159
several guys out there with that focus

298
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,079
and one other thing i'd like to touch on

299
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,679
about you mentioned just

300
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,078
slightly about like the home grower with

301
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,759
the inconsistency and you know a lot of

302
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,679
these states that are legal now they

303
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,838
have a very tight plant count some

304
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,000
people don't want to invest a lot of

305
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,839
money into a big setup you know they're

306
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,240
not going out and buying your 4x4 tents

307
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,959
and you're six and 750 or up to a

308
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,959
thousand watt leds or hids they're

309
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,039
dealing with a very small space

310
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,479
and if you've got inconsistencies in the

311
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,000
pack sure some of those might stay

312
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,240
within a height of a

313
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,600
you know say a two by two by four

314
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,360
size ten that they're growing in their

315
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,800
closet but then there could be a rogue

316
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,720
phenom in that pack that literally

317
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,319
pushes the light to the top of the tent

318
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,600
and they're gonna have a bad experience

319
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,720
with that you know it's going to turn

320
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,159
them off to

321
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,759
seeing all that's like well there's too

322
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,879
much variety how do i control this to

323
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,639
keep it

324
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,439
you know yielding successfully in my

325
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,879
environment yeah very true and also i

326
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
think it's important to point out too

327
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,759
that because

328
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,920
the um

329
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:48,078
the lineage of ruderalis in our scene i

330
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:51,120
mean while while it goes back you know

331
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:54,479
well over a decade it doesn't it the

332
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,639
ruderalis lines have not been bred

333
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,879
nearly as much as photo periods right

334
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,480
and so not only are you going to get a

335
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,759
lot of variety within a pack generally

336
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,839
speaking

337
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,278
if we look at the entire pool of seeds

338
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,399
but you're also going to get a lot of

339
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:15,120
variety from breeder to breeder

340
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,120
because

341
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:21,599
with photo periods

342
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,000
a newish breeder is generally going to

343
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,639
take something that is already popular

344
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,679
or reliable or hype

345
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,680
and they will you know they will they

346
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,239
will make that cross and so they're

347
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,838
starting with really reliable seeds that

348
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,399
have got a lot of breeding history and a

349
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,399
lot of stability in them to begin with

350
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,000
and then you know it's it's it's like

351
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,440
you know what they say

352
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,559
shoot in the side of a barn right it's

353
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,079
like really hard to miss when you are

354
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,559
when you're breeding things that are

355
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,479
already stable in and of themselves and

356
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,439
people have been you know

357
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,079
breeding them for years whereas there's

358
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,920
a whole bunch of wild still in these

359
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,799
root oralist lines

360
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,679
and

361
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,799
somebody who is a is a new new to

362
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,439
breeding

363
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:11,199
they very well may not uh have the

364
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,000
experience or the time um to get those

365
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,399
seeds up to snuff and so

366
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,078
you know you might you might find seeds

367
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,639
cheaper or they might be given to you by

368
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,719
a friend who's just starting out at you

369
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,560
know growing autoflowers or breeding

370
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,519
autoflowers

371
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:30,559
but uh you know most of the new stuff

372
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,560
the the wild isn't um bred out of it

373
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,239
like it is with with many of the photo

374
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,559
periods for most of the photo periods

375
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,639
that we have access to and so that means

376
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,518
that um

377
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,680
novice growers are really making novice

378
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,399
seeds whereas

379
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,399
with photos a novice breeder can make

380
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,159
really good seeds on accident right out

381
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,000
of the gate

382
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,159
and i agree with you 100 and we're

383
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,559
starting to see that

384
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,480
with the autoflower community too there

385
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,078
are a lot of you know people out there

386
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,839
who have done the work who've put in the

387
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,319
structure who have helped build up this

388
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,760
cultivar and sang its praises for years

389
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,000
and they're finally starting to make

390
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,759
their way in to being respected as an

391
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,519
autoflower breeder because

392
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,799
for a long time i mean we we and we've

393
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,639
talked about this you know autoflower

394
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,479
was a lot of times a joke of the you

395
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,560
know the cannabis industry

396
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,159
and we're seeing

397
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,679
some of these newer breeders coming up

398
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,719
and using stuff that's already been

399
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,159
built upon all the work and

400
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,680
brings me to the point that even though

401
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,120
they're doing that they're still getting

402
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,399
inconsistencies because they're not

403
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,919
taking like

404
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,679
two seeds from

405
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,078
one brand you know two cultivars from

406
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,439
one brand and using those

407
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,759
to the for their breeding project

408
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,079
they're usually taking something from

409
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,919
you know we'll say mephisto for example

410
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,879
or and then night out i'm just using

411
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,719
names just as placeholders here um and

412
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,240
then they throw them together and

413
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,320
they're not getting the result that they

414
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,399
look for because of that wild nature of

415
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,519
the root oralis everybody's breeding

416
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,198
style is still very relatively new the

417
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,560
angle of attack is very different and

418
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,719
structural wise of what people are

419
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,879
looking for and i think people still

420
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,720
don't quite understand the mechanics of

421
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,958
the auto flowering plant i think all of

422
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,120
that comes into the inconsistency that

423
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,359
we're seeing from breeders to breeders

424
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,560
um you see the quality stuff come out

425
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,639
from guys who have been working them

426
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,319
generationally and you start to see some

427
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,759
sketch stuff from somebody who's coming

428
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,600
up and they're trying to just force it

429
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,198
on the community and take hold of the

430
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,879
autoflower wave

431
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,359
yeah and i actually it's interesting

432
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,919
that you would mention mephisto and

433
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,639
night owl because i would say that those

434
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:33,679
two brands are at the top of

435
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,639
um

436
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,599
people

437
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,000
starting with those who are just

438
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,320
starting out wanting to make autoflower

439
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,559
seeds because they'll you know they'll

440
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,480
take they'll take a couple of mephistos

441
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,799
and and run them against each other or

442
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,639
they'll take a mephisto and and you know

443
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:54,639
pollinate it with something from daz or

444
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,639
you know something like that and um and

445
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,278
you'll see these crosses just because

446
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,519
they've got such great reputations and

447
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,679
the only reason i wasn't mentioning uh

448
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,560
your brand gnome automatics is because

449
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,559
honestly your stuff is sold out so fast

450
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,119
um until just recently you know you've

451
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,198
been making uh you know larger numbers

452
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,278
of packs now and so now they're more

453
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:17,519
available to people who want them but

454
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,039
you know your your your first runs like

455
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,399
sold out so quickly you're like oh yeah

456
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,039
those are already sold out and like oh

457
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,000
damn but um but yeah i think there's

458
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,000
i've seen so many crosses that are one

459
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,720
mephisto against another mephisto and

460
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,879
the person is trying to get um their

461
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,320
favorite qualities out of both and it

462
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,958
just seems to be a pretty common place

463
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,079
for people to start it does and and

464
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,518
again those like i said those were

465
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:40,958
complete placeholders i mean those are

466
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,879
two you know mephista has been around

467
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,119
forever dads and i have a fantastic

468
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,799
relationship i love that guy to death um

469
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,480
and it's you know it's no tack on either

470
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,359
one of them it's just an example because

471
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,800
like

472
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,639
you know then there are people out there

473
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,278
that are trying to build from the ground

474
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,198
up and and so you've got like a

475
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,639
multitude of angles of which we do see

476
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,399
the inconsistency from breeder to

477
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,320
breeder and you are correct you know i'm

478
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,759
trying i don't want this to be about a

479
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,679
commercial about gnome automatics even

480
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,919
though it would be amazing but you know

481
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,000
it's like i do i have been fortunate now

482
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,880
to figure out a few more things with

483
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,359
inside my plant counts to make more seed

484
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,839
for people because i've

485
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,519
you know adjusted my process and adapted

486
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,958
over the last couple years since things

487
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,119
started taking off it's like it was

488
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,360
pretty much i had to if i wanted to stay

489
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,798
with what i'm doing right now right on

490
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,959
so i think we've hit the seed

491
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,400
inconsistency part pretty uh pretty

492
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,679
sufficiently anything else you want to

493
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,559
say there before we move on to the next

494
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,160
topic

495
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,079
no i think that flowed very well dude

496
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,840
like you know we got some some depth in

497
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,439
there and give people a good uh i would

498
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,279
say a little closer than 10 000 foot of

499
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,558
view on why they see what they're seeing

500
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,879
all right let's talk about light

501
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,798
intensity so you know

502
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,679
we're all pretty much aware that when

503
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,519
you're germinating a uh seed you you

504
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,640
generally want to bring uh you know do

505
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,599
so

506
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,160
under a little weaker light than a you

507
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,599
know a high caliber 800 or 1000 watt

508
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,160
light you just want to give it that kind

509
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,719
of nursery experience but one of the

510
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,640
things that's really odd about

511
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,919
autoflowers is

512
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,679
they really don't like the intensity of

513
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,520
light until they are a bit older and

514
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,798
i have um

515
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:22,480
i have stunted my plants a variety of

516
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:24,400
times um because i i

517
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,079
germinated the seed

518
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,600
and and i put it into the tent with a

519
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:33,119
high intensity uh bios led light

520
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,439
and um

521
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,199
and it just didn't want to go it was

522
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,240
almost like um

523
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,200
uh the the bright light was too harsh

524
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,759
for the youthful nature of the plant and

525
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,640
instead of it sucking up the light and

526
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:52,000
you know growing swiftly it actually

527
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,280
seems to have slowed it and and i

528
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,038
suspect that that has been your

529
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,918
experience too

530
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:00,640
100 um i have seen high intensity

531
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,880
artists have a a love hate relationship

532
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,240
with light intensity and duration

533
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,880
at the early stages as you were

534
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,120
mentioning like they want a

535
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,880
weaker less intense light to allow them

536
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,399
to come up put their first set of leaves

537
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,919
up and start kind of moving along and

538
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,240
some people may jump the gun if they're

539
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,840
running new age led and dial it up a

540
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,440
little bit more or

541
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,159
bring it a little bit closer to the

542
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,798
plant and one thing i always suggest is

543
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,320
like let the plant to avoid this

544
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,558
stunting that's very frustrating because

545
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,519
i actually just did it this past run

546
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:33,200
again like two or two in a row um i'm

547
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,798
learning some you know i'm playing with

548
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,038
things but like

549
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,558
let that plant grow to the light because

550
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,480
when it first comes out and it starts

551
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:41,839
germinating if it needs more light it's

552
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,200
going to tell you it needs more light

553
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,119
it's going to do what i call the ninth

554
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,360
inning stretch it's going to give itself

555
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,879
that first set of leaves and then that

556
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,319
main stem is just going to get longer

557
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,559
and longer and longer and longer and if

558
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,279
you notice that elongation then you can

559
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,918
dial up that light intensity by you know

560
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,000
small increments so you don't inevitably

561
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,159
stunt that plant from trying to push

562
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,839
push push and the double-edged sword of

563
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,080
that is once they get to that more

564
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,000
mature state if you want to help which

565
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,199
is going to be our next topic yield you

566
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,119
need to make sure that intensity and

567
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,759
light our time is there

568
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,719
it's one of the reasons why i um i put

569
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:19,038
in the extra effort to buy a light that

570
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,440
actually has got an integrated dimmer i

571
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,319
love that dimmers have evolved for grow

572
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,759
lights

573
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,918
and so you know when i'm when i'm

574
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,158
starting my autoflowers out i mean i i

575
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,799
had to do it the wrong way first right i

576
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,760
i ruined two rounds of seeds before i

577
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:36,720
realized that my full power bios light

578
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,558
was just like kicking these these um

579
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,480
these seedlings asses they just couldn't

580
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,200
handle it and so

581
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,759
i um i turned down the dimmer

582
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,640
so it was um um you know to about half

583
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,480
power

584
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:54,640
and that that helped a lot and and so

585
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,400
i turned it up once the the the the

586
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,240
gosh i don't know the botany botanical

587
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,440
name but the the the young leaves you

588
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,038
know when they when they grow up tall

589
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,440
enough they're low and then they kind of

590
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,119
like shrivel up and go away and and we

591
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,519
we tend to talk about them at that point

592
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:10,798
as being like teenagers right that's

593
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:13,839
when i turn it up to full blast um

594
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,918
because if i turn it up too fast on

595
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,439
these small plants they're like nope

596
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,759
we're just gonna stay here at three

597
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,200
inches forever

598
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:22,640
yeah and that's one of the big things

599
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,759
that i've noticed too is like if you

600
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,320
turn that thing up too quick your

601
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,480
internal spacing becomes so stacked that

602
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,399
like it's putting all that energy there

603
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,679
it'll impact your side shoot growth so

604
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,200
any kind of side branching that could

605
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,320
have been there is going to be impacted

606
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
because like the nodes sit so closely

607
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:39,359
and

608
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
you have to you have to maintain

609
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,038
that balance between giving it enough to

610
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,679
get it started and then that that

611
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,679
preteen or teenager stage when okay the

612
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,840
plant sex we're starting like under a

613
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,679
jeweler's loop you can start to see

614
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,839
the the sex organs come out i mean we

615
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,640
could touch on the botanical terms of

616
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,319
that too but for for the conversation

617
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,480
like when you see start to see that

618
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,240
underneath a jeweler's loop

619
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,679
and that's when you can start to bring

620
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,679
up that intensity because if you bring

621
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,440
it up too soon like you said that

622
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,519
plant's gonna stay like three maybe four

623
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,720
inches tall and pretty much be pissed

624
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,240
off at you it's entire life and you're

625
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,960
gonna get frustrated you're going to you

626
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,480
know

627
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,840
think that you failed but we're here

628
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,960
trying to tell you that like this

629
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,959
frustration

630
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,200
hurts us all we all do it we've all done

631
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,200
it and i still do it to this day

632
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,960
and you know even with all this

633
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,798
all these complaints we've got we're

634
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,000
still both in love with autoflowers so

635
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:29,839
it's it's really

636
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,640
yeah totally it's it's really just about

637
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,558
um uh finding you know getting into

638
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,640
relationship with this new plant that

639
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:41,200
has got different characteristics than

640
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:43,679
we're used to with with photos so so so

641
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,159
our next topic is is probably the number

642
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,080
one thing that people uh complain about

643
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,039
when it comes to autoflower and and

644
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:54,000
that's yield and um it's funny you know

645
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:56,960
before uh before pandemic when i was

646
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,480
traveling to conventions and um

647
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,480
you know you know teaching about

648
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,279
autoflowers and kind of banging the

649
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,240
autoflower drum then you know the number

650
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,798
one

651
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,759
um you know question i got or from

652
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:12,000
people was you know yeah but can they

653
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:15,038
grow big because we love growing these

654
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,599
monster plants and and i love growing

655
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:20,240
monster plants too the whole monster

656
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:22,719
plant thing though really did take off

657
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,159
with um california's

658
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,960
99

659
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,240
medical plant count where suddenly every

660
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,960
single plant had to be a beast and that

661
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,599
really strengthened that large plant

662
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,159
culture and and they're beautiful and

663
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:41,359
i'm in no way dissing on large plants

664
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,320
but really large plants are not really

665
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:47,119
the end all when it comes to choosing a

666
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:50,158
plant because there are a lot of reasons

667
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:53,439
why the size per plant you may actually

668
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:56,080
want it to be smaller say for example

669
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,000
you are doing it in a tent or you're

670
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,720
doing it in a small closet kind of a

671
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,640
shoe box grow or if

672
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,558
you need to keep your plants short so

673
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,360
that your neighbors can't see them over

674
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,200
the fence or if you are a

675
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,678
a patient with poor mobility they're

676
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,319
like how the heck are you gonna harvest

677
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,880
a 10 12 foot plant when you know your

678
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,359
arthritis is so bad you can barely lift

679
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,640
your arms above your shoulders right and

680
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,879
so right

681
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,559
so so i guess i guess clearly i went

682
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,320
right into defensive nature about the

683
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,000
yield but yeah the problem is is that

684
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,558
the plants are small

685
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,400
and sometimes you you may only pull an

686
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,879
ounce off of a plant which you know if

687
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,679
you're used to pulling pounds pulling

688
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,840
off an ounce is going to be

689
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,880
it's going to feel very lackluster to

690
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,119
you

691
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,400
yeah it'll feel very unsatisfactory you

692
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,319
know i think

693
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,159
i agree with you big beautiful trees

694
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,158
like monster plants

695
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,760
are amazing you know what i mean like

696
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,080
i'll get on that train i've grown quite

697
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,558
a few big ones myself and it's fun to

698
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:59,119
watch but it is like you said it's a ton

699
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,639
of work um a lot of the people that you

700
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,959
and i deal with or medical patients i

701
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,200
try to you know ooze that

702
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,278
energy out when i'm you know talking to

703
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,200
other podcasts and i'm talking to other

704
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:12,558
people or behind the scenes and dms that

705
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,919
like you know patient-minded here um

706
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,359
you know it's hard for somebody to climb

707
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,960
up a ladder or hang trellis or trim all

708
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,719
that by themselves i mean i'm

709
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,720
fortunately still physically very you

710
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,480
know capable but like when i've got a

711
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,319
greenhouse that's got six

712
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,278
gigantic plants it takes me weeks to

713
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:31,200
harvest that alone and you know

714
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,759
i could see the deterrent of with

715
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,679
autoflowers being smaller and the yields

716
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,200
being less than that because that's what

717
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,360
we have seen for so long now that it

718
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,880
could turn people off to it but at the

719
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,918
same time in the mind you're still

720
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,320
getting an ounce at a minimum for most

721
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,799
of your autoflowers these days of your

722
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,960
own homegrown flower that you you

723
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:55,359
started from the seed you germinated and

724
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,519
you grew it um i would say you know more

725
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,839
or not traditional but more modern era

726
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,278
autoflowers aren't you know you can have

727
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,199
a few mistakes with them and still get

728
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,200
more than an ounce but i could see more

729
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,519
yield and discrepancy especially from

730
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,960
the big farm compared to like a home

731
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,960
grower you know homegrown is not going

732
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,200
to have the opportunity to grow seven to

733
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,720
eight to ten foot tall plants

734
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,919
yeah that's going to be pretty rare but

735
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,000
you know

736
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,720
even though we're talking about yield

737
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,759
and how it relates to size

738
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,640
um in my experience uh

739
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,319
the

740
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,240
the yield per inch of the plant is

741
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,798
actually quite good

742
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,038
um you know you might get a small plant

743
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,759
but the amount of flowers you get off

744
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:40,960
that small plant is going to be on par

745
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,879
with a photo period plant of that side

746
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,079
and has that beneath your experience as

747
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,278
well

748
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,439
yeah i mean i've noticed with

749
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,679
autoflowers the bud structure is indoor

750
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,600
let me caveat that first indoor a lot

751
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,600
tighter because a majority of people are

752
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:57,278
just really starting to grow autoflowers

753
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,879
indoors um and

754
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,240
with the you know the intense light

755
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,159
hours um you know 18 or more i always

756
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,079
recommend don't go anything lower than

757
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,880
16 or you're gonna impact your yield you

758
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:08,720
know

759
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,640
i have conversations on the regular in

760
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,240
different forms about like

761
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,159
what if we just 12 12 them was like it's

762
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,798
going to impact the yield

763
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,480
and even though this plant may be a foot

764
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,319
tall or something like that

765
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,640
the the flower is basically the entire

766
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:24,720
plant like the entire plant puts off

767
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,399
flowers in every direction uh especially

768
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,278
with side branching and things of that

769
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:28,239
nature

770
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,159
so

771
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,558
indoor my experience has been better

772
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,960
structure better yield yes

773
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:38,798
i think that also um

774
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,200
the autoflowers tend to grow their

775
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,359
individual flowers together

776
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,880
into what many people will describe as

777
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:50,079
either like a baseball bat stock or a or

778
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,640
a you know cola the size of your arm you

779
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:56,000
know people will talk about um it's it's

780
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,880
very common for a a you know

781
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,079
a

782
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,120
a petite autoflower plant that's going

783
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:06,639
to be under three feet to be also be

784
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:09,038
stocky you know it's it's fat it's got a

785
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,840
huge primary cola

786
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:15,919
and and so your your weight for space is

787
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:19,038
exactly where you would want it to be

788
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:22,240
and so when we when we talk you know and

789
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:25,119
complain about yield we're really not

790
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,440
talking about how much flour per inch

791
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:28,639
we're really only talking about the size

792
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,919
of the plant

793
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,960
and you know if you if you have got the

794
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,759
you know if you're in the kind of

795
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,240
situation um you know so instead of

796
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,240
growing one big plant grow three

797
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,319
auto flowers and you're going to get the

798
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,759
same yield but you know you're growing

799
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:48,158
three plants instead of one and so there

800
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,599
are ways around that um

801
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,440
you know if you're if you've got strict

802
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,558
plant counts and that is something that

803
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,720
you are

804
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,359
concerned with well then that's not the

805
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,360
best solution but a lot of people i know

806
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,199
who are growing for themselves and

807
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,759
growing autoflowers they're just growing

808
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,240
them on their deck and whether or not

809
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,558
there are five plants on their deck or

810
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,200
ten plants on their deck um doesn't

811
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,960
really matter to a lot of folks

812
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,640
yeah it doesn't you know and i mean i

813
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,640
see that up

814
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,399
a lot up here and i also agree with you

815
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,240
too like it's it comes back to that

816
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,359
space like it if you got three of them

817
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,079
in that tent

818
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,918
and you've given them an indoor 16 to 18

819
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,158
hours light or more during the day a lot

820
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,320
of people run 24 hours across those

821
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,720
three plants if you grew

822
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,879
you're going to get a great yield if you

823
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,000
compared to growing one large plant

824
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,159
inside

825
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,440
that single space area you know it's

826
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,559
kind of going to balance its way out i

827
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,000
mean sure you got a little bit more

828
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:43,918
plant care to take care of rather than

829
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,440
just focusing your energy on one plant

830
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,480
but i think it's kind of a wash between

831
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,360
the two

832
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,759
yeah

833
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,678
so so now that we've kind of established

834
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,599
that yeah the plants are smaller but the

835
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,798
yield for the smaller plant is on par

836
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,599
with a photo

837
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:57,759
um

838
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:00,398
let's uh finish off this set by talking

839
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,599
about terpene profiles so

840
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,759
oh boy

841
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,918
there's so much there's so much to say

842
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,519
why don't you get us started on this one

843
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,960
so i mean i'll come right out and say

844
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:13,038
like i there's it's very hard to find

845
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,720
the terpene profiles that people would

846
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,158
consider hype but

847
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,759
people consider hype two different

848
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,278
things it may be either like some kind

849
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,839
of cookies or it could be some kind of

850
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:24,558
unique uh specific terpene profile

851
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:26,319
whichever it is but like with rudder

852
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,639
alice this is one of those nasty things

853
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,879
that's we're still trying to find out

854
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,840
is the fact that we got a lot of earth

855
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,679
we get a lot of spice we get a lot of

856
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,879
um pining

857
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,278
pining there's a lot of um like incense

858
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,200
like nagchampa smell to them like

859
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,880
traditional early on terpenes before we

860
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,038
really started you know advancing the

861
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,640
way photoperiods are and we talked about

862
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,240
earlier that like the photopeering

863
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,799
breeding game has been going on way

864
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,640
longer than when the autoflower the

865
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,359
autoflower scene has really come forward

866
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,000
and we're working diligently on trying

867
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,240
to improve that i have expanded my realm

868
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,839
into

869
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,679
photo periods that are that have been

870
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,158
grown and selected into this area to try

871
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,080
to source in some of those new terpene

872
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,640
profiles so i can get the sweeter candy

873
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:15,278
smells and so i can get the the stuff

874
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,960
that appeals or the gas you know i i

875
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:20,480
gave you a tester this this summer

876
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,798
called methane and i finally found two

877
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,120
outliers that actually had a traditional

878
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,879
fuel smell i'm not gonna say like you

879
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:29,119
know straight up gasoline but there was

880
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,200
a fuel like diesely

881
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:34,639
like petrol smell to these plants and it

882
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,840
was shocking to me um and i worked with

883
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,000
those two

884
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:38,959
but the terpenes they do need a lot of

885
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,640
work

886
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,000
and i'll be the first to admit like i

887
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,080
there's some of the plants that i have

888
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,839
that they don't smell that great but the

889
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,759
smoke is fantastic so it's trying to

890
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,678
bridge all those gaps

891
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,640
so there's some serious work i believe

892
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,360
that needs to be done and it's

893
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,960
frustrating because it's it takes time

894
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:57,678
yeah

895
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,600
especially on that gas smell gas fuel

896
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,159
you know it's very popular right now but

897
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,558
also it's my favorite right i still go

898
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,519
for that i mean i i have yet to find

899
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,359
actually that's not true i was going to

900
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,200
say i i have yet to find a terpene i

901
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,759
don't like but that's actually not true

902
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,919
i'm not really a big fan of the burnt

903
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,720
rubber aspect that comes out in some

904
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,960
skunk lineages um

905
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,960
it was startling the first time i tasted

906
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,319
burnt rubber out of a plant i really

907
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,399
thought that i had done something

908
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,079
drastically wrong with this plant and

909
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,879
then i looked it up i'm like oh this is

910
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:31,278
this is actually a profile that's common

911
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,080
but anyway um other than that uh the gas

912
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:36,720
ones are are still pretty rare in auto

913
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:39,918
flowers uh so rare that you know after

914
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,278
about 150 some um varieties i've really

915
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,200
only found it in one plant and

916
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,200
and i must say that i haven't grown your

917
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,120
methane yet your methane is actually one

918
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,840
of them that i stunted with too bright

919
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,359
of lights already so i need to i need to

920
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,240
take another approach

921
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:58,398
with the methane um with my dimmer now

922
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,440
installed

923
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,239
but the

924
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,798
the humboldt seed company sour apple

925
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,640
that just came out this year

926
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,960
they were kind enough to send some seeds

927
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,080
my way and

928
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,759
that one has got an authentic uh gas in

929
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:15,359
it and it's actually paired with a green

930
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:17,278
apple so it actually makes for a pretty

931
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,678
interesting plant this kind of green

932
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:23,519
granny smith apple with um

933
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,720
with um with a fuel taste to it but

934
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,278
you know it

935
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,558
if you are

936
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:32,558
if you're going to autoflowers to

937
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:34,720
replicate the same

938
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:37,359
profiles that you're getting on your

939
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,399
photo period plants

940
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,038
the

941
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:43,918
lines are just not mature enough that

942
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,679
you are going to be satisfied when you

943
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,038
approach autoflowers

944
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,840
you it really will serve you to find out

945
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:55,200
what autoflowers have to say and how do

946
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:57,599
auto flowers like to express themselves

947
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,000
and then be happy with that and i'm not

948
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,480
saying that everything in auto flowers

949
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,880
is watered down but there are definitely

950
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,880
some terpene profiles that are more

951
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,639
successful in autoflowers than others

952
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,398
like we've already said

953
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:15,599
fuel is pretty hard um but um if if you

954
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:18,398
like like the the the um

955
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,800
you know grape uh jolly rancher kind of

956
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,559
sweetness of candy smells oh my gosh

957
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,919
you're going to you're going to love the

958
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:28,320
candies of possibilities in autoflowers

959
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,519
there's also good bubble gum in auto

960
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,159
flowers

961
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,960
certainly there is great you know pining

962
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,398
earthy incense kind of stuff that you've

963
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,800
already hit on

964
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:43,199
but when i first started experimenting

965
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:46,639
with autoflowers i wanted my autoflower

966
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:49,279
to taste like the similar parent in

967
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,519
photo periods and it's just not really

968
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,760
how it works out because

969
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:56,878
not only are you adding this

970
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,640
you know the ruderalis genetics which

971
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,598
you know naturally pretty much just

972
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:03,759
tastes like grass or hay it's not it's

973
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,039
not a wonderfully taste tasting plant on

974
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,000
its own

975
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:10,719
um but it is the relationship with the

976
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,679
terpenes that the breeder brings into

977
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:17,118
the storyline and then has to refine

978
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:20,559
over generations to get them out and it

979
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:23,920
doesn't mean it is it's a lesser plant

980
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:26,480
than going only photo it just means that

981
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,039
the breeding history of it is so young

982
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,119
that they've got a while to go and there

983
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,838
are a lot of really great tasting

984
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,720
autoflowers um

985
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,039
but

986
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:37,919
you know like like every summer i'll

987
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:42,079
grow

988
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,800
my my photo periods and my autos

989
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,320
and it's usually the autos that you know

990
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,480
have got better

991
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,640
terpene profiles because they're more

992
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,880
mature lines but here's the thing where

993
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,879
i live in the pacific northwest

994
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,640
none of those photoperiod plants can

995
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,320
really finish outdoors you know it's

996
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:02,719
pretty rare um for for those plants to

997
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,880
to get all of their you know eight to

998
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,719
nine and a half weeks to finish and so

999
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,720
the question is you know if if we're

1000
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,838
going to grow it outdoors

1001
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:13,679
are we more interested in in growing

1002
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,838
photo periods that are not going to

1003
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:19,039
fully mature and finish

1004
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:22,320
or do i want to grow an autoflower that

1005
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:24,320
will totally mature and finish and do so

1006
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,640
conveniently in the beginning of

1007
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,680
september instead of waiting for october

1008
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:34,480
not finishing and dealing with mold of

1009
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:36,879
the photo periods and you know that's

1010
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,400
that's a pretty complex answer that most

1011
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,160
people who just say

1012
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,240
you know autoflowers suck compared to

1013
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:43,519
photos it's like well you know there's a

1014
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,319
lot of truth to what you're saying

1015
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,239
friend but but like where do you live

1016
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,240
what are your needs what's your health

1017
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,838
what's your growing situation you really

1018
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:53,679
have to weigh all these different

1019
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,039
attributes

1020
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,159
before

1021
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:01,279
disposing of the idea of autoflowers

1022
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:03,440
i just finished a great purple lemonade

1023
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,000
and um you know it's it's one of the

1024
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,480
best smelling most delightful to smoke

1025
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,119
plants that that i've ever grown

1026
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,480
and it's an autoflower and it it just

1027
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,559
wails on so many of the mediocre photo

1028
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,920
periods that i've grown

1029
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:19,519
but you know it was still only three

1030
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,440
foot

1031
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:22,639
well right you know and i think i think

1032
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,240
you hit the nail on the head right there

1033
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,000
man you know with the with the growth

1034
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,559
season that we have and the location

1035
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,679
that we're at i struggled i've struggled

1036
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:34,159
for three four years outdoor now to

1037
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,519
finish some of these photo periods that

1038
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,199
they look great they smell great but

1039
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,039
there's just not enough time for that

1040
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,279
maturity you know i've grown like

1041
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:44,400
wedding cake and i've grown runts all

1042
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,240
this from cuts and cherry uh cheerio g

1043
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,079
and i've had you know the benefit of

1044
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:49,439
being shared with

1045
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,760
of all these different wonderful

1046
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,519
smelling photo periods the problem is

1047
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,240
they don't get to fully mature so i

1048
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,480
don't get to enjoy that full mature

1049
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:01,358
profile of that plant whereas with my

1050
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,199
autos i've already got them down

1051
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:04,719
dried and in jars while i'm still

1052
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:06,719
struggling to fight the reigns and the

1053
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:10,559
molds in the mildews so

1054
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,559
so true you just described my life man

1055
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:16,319
that is so satisfying to have the

1056
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:18,239
autoflowers harvested dried and in jars

1057
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,599
curing and already like sneaking buds

1058
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,078
out to smoke

1059
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,559
while the photoperiods are still outside

1060
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,240
in the greenhouse dealing with the sub

1061
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:27,838
50 degree knights wondering if they're

1062
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,838
ever going to finish at all

1063
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:33,279
well right once in yawns once we break

1064
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:35,199
below 55 degrees you know photosynthesis

1065
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,040
really likes to slow down so you're not

1066
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,000
only adding in

1067
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,279
the the combating of the mold and mildew

1068
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,880
you're com you know you're dealing with

1069
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,960
a long running strain to begin with that

1070
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,400
runs in eight nine ten weeks maybe and

1071
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,240
then you deal down with the actual

1072
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,559
slowing of the metabolism of the plant

1073
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,559
so you've you've compounded issues

1074
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,400
whereas you know

1075
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:55,679
autos are done you know it's done it's

1076
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,559
ready to go you can smoke them while

1077
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,519
you're trying to figure out how to

1078
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:01,279
finish out your photo period crop

1079
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,960
so let's see i've got something else i

1080
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,599
want to suggest with the terpene

1081
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,639
profiles of autos um

1082
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,480
um

1083
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:11,118
and and i can't say i know this to be

1084
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,320
true but i but i have seen a lot of

1085
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,400
circumstantial evidence on my side and i

1086
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,440
would be curious or i would i would

1087
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,440
hasten to say that

1088
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:25,279
autoflowers may have a

1089
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,839
difficult time holding

1090
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,480
the same smell that they have while

1091
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:33,679
they're flowering i would say that just

1092
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,559
about all the autoflowers i have grown

1093
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:40,078
you know we all expect the the flavors

1094
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,440
of the terpenes to uh evolve in cure for

1095
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,480
sure that's part of what we're trying to

1096
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,039
do but with most autoflowers what i end

1097
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,838
up taking out of the jar smells very

1098
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:52,480
little like the plant did when it was

1099
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,920
alive and that can be startling what do

1100
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,358
you think

1101
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,800
it's funny you know

1102
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:58,159
i expected you to ask me if there was

1103
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,680
going to be one more thing before we

1104
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,078
moved on to another subject or something

1105
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,199
and you literally stole the the thought

1106
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,760
from my head

1107
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,559
i have seen a lot of what i call loss of

1108
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,520
translation it will be it'll grow great

1109
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:14,559
i'll get a nice chemically smell or i'll

1110
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:17,199
get a nice very pronounced um

1111
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:19,039
like cotton candy smell you know or even

1112
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:20,960
a very pronounced fuel smell and be like

1113
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,960
oh man here it is finally

1114
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,679
and then you do the slow dry you know i

1115
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,679
do a 60 60 dry cure enviro

1116
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:30,559
dry environment where it's 60 degrees

1117
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:33,838
and 60 rh and try to let those things go

1118
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:36,799
as low and slow as possible to maintain

1119
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:38,559
the these terpene profiles and i don't

1120
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,160
know if it is

1121
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,400
the fact that the plant can't translate

1122
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,559
it well enough or if they're still so

1123
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,160
volatile in

1124
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,880
the genetics since the early of the

1125
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,480
breeding that they just they're gone by

1126
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,160
the time they go through the the trying

1127
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,519
process so is this could this open up

1128
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:55,118
another way that we dry our autos

1129
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,280
slightly different than the practices

1130
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,240
we've been using our photo periods in i

1131
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,000
don't know

1132
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:01,838
but i have noticed that loss in

1133
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,358
translation myself multiple times so i'm

1134
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:05,119
like i'm so excited about what it's

1135
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:06,480
outside and i've got three or four

1136
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,039
females that are in a breeding program

1137
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,039
like finally i've got a uh multiple that

1138
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,440
are bringing this out and like

1139
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,199
one out of the six may hold on to a

1140
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,880
tenth of that smell

1141
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:18,480
that i smelled on the plant and it's

1142
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,480
frustrating

1143
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,039
yeah this is very true i i share that

1144
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,679
experience and and for me that's one of

1145
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:30,000
the reasons why i don't hold on to

1146
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:32,719
autoflowers as long as i would um my

1147
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,400
photo periods i will either you know you

1148
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,399
know as soon as they're ready to go i

1149
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,240
will start to smoking them right away

1150
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,119
start giving them to friends things like

1151
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:43,279
that um or what i what i generally do

1152
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,200
with most my autos is make hash because

1153
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,680
that's that seems to stabilize it pretty

1154
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:49,598
effectively but i don't know what's

1155
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:52,719
going into the plant i i don't know if

1156
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,359
it's um you know a volatile monoterpenes

1157
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:57,519
that we're losing right away or maybe

1158
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:59,358
there's something going on with the you

1159
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:02,079
know the sugars in the plants that it

1160
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:04,960
actually cures differently than a photo

1161
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,200
period does and you know we have i don't

1162
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,000
think there's any science on any of this

1163
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,919
yet which just again speaks to the fact

1164
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,400
that even though autoflowers have been

1165
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:19,280
around you know 15 20 years that um

1166
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,280
that with the modern autoflowers we're

1167
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,720
still just getting to know them

1168
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,920
right you know i think we're still

1169
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,000
getting to know them i think it's still

1170
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,519
a learning avenue and i think there's a

1171
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,880
lot more that

1172
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:30,559
you know comes across with throughout

1173
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,760
with the root oralist genetics than what

1174
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:33,679
we think

1175
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,440
yeah yeah i agree with that

1176
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:37,358
so um you want to you have anything else

1177
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,159
to say about tripping profiles before we

1178
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:41,519
uh before we wrap up this set

1179
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:43,039
uh i think i'm good

1180
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:44,719
you definitely grabbed that last thought

1181
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:46,719
right out of the brain so i appreciate

1182
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:48,239
you bringing that up right um so we're

1183
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:49,838
going to go ahead and take a short break

1184
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,679

1188
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,159
there are so many seed banks nowadays

1189
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,480
that you really have options in who to

1190
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:04,239
choose not only that if you pick the

1191
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,719
wrong seed bank you could be in for a

1192
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,959
really sketchy ride and that's only one

1193
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,639

i invited hembra to advertise on shaping

1216
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,920

1217

about them from my friends

1218
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,960

[Music]

1240
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:58,879
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

1241
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:00,799
growing is so valued by farmers is

1242
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,880
because the mycelium networks in the

1243
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,440
soil remain established from year to

1244
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,119
year and we know these fungal networks

1245
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,519
are essential because they are the

1246
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,680
nutrient super highways that extend far

1247
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:12,719
and wide in the substrate to feed your

1248
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:14,799
plants

1249
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:17,279
the trouble with growing in new living

1250
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,599
soils or blended cocoa substrates is

1251
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,960
that it takes most of the plant's life

1252
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:25,920
just to create these mycelium highways

1253
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,079
dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

1254
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,039
reduces that time and gets your plant

1255
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,039
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

1256
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,440
and it's three times the concentration

1257
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:38,318
of the other popular brand in the u.s at

1258
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,400
900 propagules per gram of two fungal

1260

reach people through advertising we all

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,359
know though that trying to reach a

cannabis audience with a quality message

1297
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:08,799
is pretty difficult

that's why many people choose to

advertise on the shaping fire podcast

1300

to talk about your product service or

know what sets your company apart from

getting into relationship with their

and mirrors

1315

1316
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:51,759
to be spoken to calmly accurately and

00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,440
if you want to make your own commercial

1319
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:57,920
spot well you can do that too

1320
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,000
during these pandemic days conventions

1321
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,480
and cannabis events are pretty poorly

1322
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,159
attended but podcast listening is

1323
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,159
skyrocketing

1324
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:08,078
with a commercial on shaping fire you'll

1325
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:10,318
reach your customers in the privacy of

1326
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,640
their headphones right now and will

1327
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,880
continue to reach new listeners as they

1328
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:18,480
explore the shaping fire back catalog of

1329
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:21,760
episodes again and again for years

1330
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,159
a spot on shaping fire costs less than a

1331
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,720
printed postcard per person and the

1332
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:29,679
shaping fire audience is full of smart

1333
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:32,000
cannabis enthusiasts cultivators and

1334
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:33,358
entrepreneurs who are always curious to

1335

welcome back you are listening to

1342
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:50,078
shaping fire i'm your host shango los

1343
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,439
and my guest today is cannabis breeder

1344
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,599
dan jimmy

1345
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,519
so before the break we

1346
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,680
hit the first uh

1347
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:59,358
big challenges that we find with

1348
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,118
autoflowers

1349
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:03,119
seed inconsistency

1350
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,079
light intensity

1351
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,920
yield and terpene profiles and we're

1352
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,079
going to start off second set with

1353
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,358
probably the most

1354
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:16,000
disappointing and argued about aspect of

1355
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:17,759
autoflowers which is transplanting

1356
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,679
and so um

1357
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,119
i'll go ahead and get this one started

1358
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:26,719
for a stand so um

1359
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:30,079
autoflowers are very sensitive to shock

1360
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:33,598
they do not like to have their roots

1361
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:35,519
messed with um unlike other plants uh

1362
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,838
where we can you know a photo period

1363
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,800
specifically where we can you know pop

1364
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:44,159
them up as we go from um you know the

1365
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,240
germination tray into a one gallon or a

1366
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:47,759
or a you know a party cup or something

1367
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,279
and then up to a five and if you're

1368
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,920
going to continue up you know you can do

1369
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,760
that quite easily and

1370
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,639
some folks will even say that it helps

1371
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,319
the roots to um to mess with the bottoms

1372
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:00,239
of them a little bit while while that is

1373
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:01,920
a debatable thing you know some people

1374
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:05,358
encourage people to actually touch the

1375
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:08,159
roots which is just not something

1376
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:10,400
that would be um recommended

1377
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:14,719
with an autoflower because

1378
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,639
when you touch the roots of autoflowers

1379
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:19,598
it absolutely

1380
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:22,159
causes them shock and

1381
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,880
retards their growth and

1382
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:27,598
you know you might change a plant that

1383
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,240
would have been a three-foot plant into

1384
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,359
not getting any more than you know 10

1385
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,719
inches

1386
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:36,000
because their their life cycle is so

1387
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:38,799
short

1388
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,119
that amount of

1389
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,519
shock to the root system

1390
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,880
will never really allow them to fully

1391
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:47,679
recover

1392
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,400
fast enough in time for them to really

1393
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,440
express themselves through the flower

1394
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,280
um

1395
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,000
well what do you tell people about trans

1396
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,040
um transplanting jim dan

1397
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
i typically recommend not doing it um

1398
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:04,079
can it be done yes does it

1399
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,159
does transplanting

1400
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,359
encourage and promote rapid root growth

1401
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:11,759
into the new medium yes but again with

1402
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,759
the mechanics of the autoflower like

1403
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,960
grow that thing in the final pot and

1404
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,640
i've seen

1405
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,400
you know people

1406
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:19,838
who can successfully transplant they've

1407
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,680
done a good job at it they don't mess

1408
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:22,558
with the roots much

1409
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:25,919
but

1410
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,760
my my primary recommendation is

1411
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,480
don't transplant it you know started off

1412
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,240
in a two a three gallon pot cloth pots

1413
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,159
work the best they seem to help develop

1414
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:36,479
the root system in a manner to where the

1415
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:38,399
plant feeds better more frequently and

1416
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,000
it'll fill those pots

1417
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,680
um you know

1418
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,039
there's a lot of controversy on it and

1419
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:46,639
and i understand that and even in the

1420
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,639
and that goes either if you're organic

1421
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:51,358
or you're in fertigation or you're using

1422
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,879
salts like any of the methods like the

1423
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,799
only time that i think that you can

1424
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,599
safely transplant

1425
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,359
and not really do massive stress

1426
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,119
translating to

1427
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:03,358
the early triggering of flour on an

1428
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,119
autoflower is deep or a culture you

1429
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:07,039
start it in a smaller basket until the

1430
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,280
tap root drops below the bar and a

1431
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:11,119
smaller bucket until the tap root drops

1432
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,760
into the water and then put it into the

1433
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:15,519
final reservoir because typically those

1434
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,079
people are starting them in rock

1435
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:20,719
you know rockwool or rapid rooters and

1436
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,240
it's surrounded by all the hydrotron and

1437
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:23,598
stuff so you're really not shocking it

1438
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,199
because those roots haven't really had

1439
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,838
the you don't have the opportunity to

1440
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:28,799
touch them like you do say in cocoa or

1441
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:31,358
soil

1442
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,960
or soilless medium i think the safest

1443
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:34,639
transplant method i have ever seen with

1444
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,720
autos is definitely going to be deep

1445
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:39,118
water culture but i'll bring it back

1446
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:41,598
just like if you do shock that root

1447
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,880
system there it translates to lacquer

1448
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,960
recovery for the

1449
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,720
end result plant it's not going to be

1450
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,358
able to be as vigorous as it was if

1451
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:51,118
you're in there gorilla handing

1452
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:52,558
that root ball like don't break up the

1453
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,920
roots don't sit there and try to you

1454
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,359
know make the roots a little bit looser

1455
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,240
because chances are you're going to

1456
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:57,759
cause

1457
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,358
unwanted and unneeded stress to that

1458
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,599
plant

1459
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:02,400
so the only solution that i have found

1460
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,240
for

1461
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,920
i will use the term transplanting

1462
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:09,439
loosely but a solution to not germinate

1463
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,639
in the pot that i'm going to leave the

1464
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,119
plant in

1465
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:16,000
is actually by using

1466
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,440
some sort of vessel

1467
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,800
um to

1468
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:23,200
germinate the seed in and then move that

1469
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,720
vessel to the final pot and so i'll give

1470
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:26,239
you a couple examples

1471
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:27,598
now you know anybody who's been

1472
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:29,919
listening to my show for any amount of

1473
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,800
time knows that i'm not a fan of using

1474
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,760
peat moss because it is a

1475
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:38,800
um you know unrenewable resource when we

1476
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:42,640
pull it out of the peat bogs that said

1477
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:46,640
um i do still have those little pete

1478
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:49,039
moss um expanding discs that that they

1479
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:50,960
look like a like a half dollar like a

1480
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:53,279
silver dollar kind of thing and then

1481
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,880
when you get them wet um you know they

1482
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,839
grow up to be like an inch and a half

1483
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,920
tall

1484
00:53:55,838 --> 00:54:00,318
well you know back before

1485
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,039
i kind of turned away from pete you know

1486
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:04,558
i bought like a 200 pack of those so

1487
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,279
they still have them floating around so

1488
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:10,960
i use them to experiment with

1489
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,240
and so what i found is i found success

1490
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,358
with um

1491
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:18,479
using one of those pete disks and for

1492
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:20,239
the water i use compost tea

1493
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,480
so it's got you know some living

1494
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:26,318
nutrition that's in there

1495
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:28,719
and then i will germinate my seed in

1496
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:31,039
that peat um

1497
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:32,558
that that that peat disc that it's now

1498
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:34,318
expanded

1499
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:37,599
and

1500
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:40,880
the time by the time the first pair of

1501
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:44,798
cottleden leaves have

1502
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:48,000
shown themselves on the seedling

1503
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:51,599
that is just about how long it takes for

1504
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,358
the taproot to reach the bottom of that

1505
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,240
little plug

1506
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:55,199
and

1507
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,679
and

1508
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,598
i want to be moving it over to its final

1509
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:00,639
pot at that moment

1510
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,280
and so

1511
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:04,159
while you are technically

1512
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,559
um

1513
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:08,798
you know re-potting it or transplanting

1514
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:11,680
it you're never actually touching the

1515
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:12,719
root zone at all you're really just

1516
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:16,879
taking

1517
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:18,399
one pot and then putting that pot into a

1518
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,200
bigger pot

1519
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:24,480
and i have found that to work and when

1520
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:27,838
when these um when these peat discs are

1521
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,639
are all used up the the the new strategy

1522
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:33,119
that i'll be using is um

1523
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:34,400
uh there are a lot of uh

1524
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,000
of these small

1525
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:41,358
hemp uh starter um

1526
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,000
containers um they kind of look like um

1527
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:45,920
like the bottom of an egg crate

1528
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,519
and um what i'll do going into the

1529
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:52,639
future is i will put soil into one of

1530
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:55,759
these like little hemp cups if you will

1531
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:59,118
and and start the seed in that

1532
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:01,599
and use the same timing and let the

1533
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:06,079
let the plant grow through

1534
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:08,480
the the fine hemp bottom on on that cup

1535
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:11,519
and so you you get the advantages that

1536
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,358
you want um

1537
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:16,000
from transplanting meaning that you can

1538
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:18,480
start a whole bunch of seeds together

1539
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,440
in a tray without having to you know

1540
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,358
have that many full-size pots and then

1541
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,079
you can select the plants that you want

1542
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:28,880
to have continue on in their life cycle

1543
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:31,440
but that is one hack that i have found

1544
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,599
to kind of kind of get around

1545
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,760
the inconvenience of not being able to

1546
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,920
transplant what's what solutions have

1547
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,920
you found to work around work around

1548
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,838
this dan

1549
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,000
um in the past what i'd like to do is

1550
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:45,358
double layer if i need feel the need to

1551
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,039
transplant or if i'm looking for you

1552
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:51,759
know uh transplant shock resistance is

1553
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,838
use two solo cups you cut the bottom out

1554
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,079
of one solo cup you place that cup

1555
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:58,318
inside of a solo cup that has its bottom

1556
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:01,039
still intact fill that with your

1557
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:03,519
starting mix or your organic soil or

1558
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:06,159
your cocoa whatever your medium may be

1559
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:07,280
and then germinate that seed in there

1560
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:09,759
and then

1561
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,760
you can allow it to go a little further

1562
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,760
than what you do as far as like you know

1563
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,240
before like the first true set can

1564
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,920
really come out maybe even starting into

1565
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:20,000
seeing the second set starting to

1566
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,079
develop in the center of that plant and

1567
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,480
then what you can do is literally remove

1568
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,039
the outer cup you have an exposed root

1569
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,358
ball already you don't have to pull the

1570
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,239
plant from a cup and you can set that

1571
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,639
cup

1572
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:34,479
right down into your next pot

1573
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:36,078
and you know i

1574
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,159
see it is called a tiered method because

1575
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,798
you know you have this you know slight

1576
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:43,039
raised root ball above your main

1577
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:45,679
domain pot but it's also caused a lot

1578
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:46,719
less transplant shock

1579
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:49,118
that i've

1580
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:51,679
seen like it's been the easiest way to

1581
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,760
move or it's been the easiest vessel to

1582
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:55,838
allow a little bit more growth and move

1583
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,920
that plant to another pot without the

1584
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:00,400
massive transplant shock i like that

1585
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,559
idea that that sleeve idea is a pretty

1586
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,639
good idea you can

1587
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,240
but the time that it will take for the

1588
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:08,798
route to go

1589
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:10,798
down alongside the inside of that first

1590
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:12,798
solo cup gives you a lot more time to

1591
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:14,798
play with whereas these small plugs that

1592
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:17,358
i'm thinking about you know you really

1593
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:18,719
only have a few days so so you need to

1594
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:21,920
be on your game and you need to be

1595
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:24,399
paying attention whereas um you know the

1596
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,680
the height of a solo cup is is what you

1597
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,680
know at least

1598
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:31,519
three times the height

1599
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:32,399
and so gives you a lot more time to um

1600
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:34,239
to

1601
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,400
you know respond like especially like if

1602
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:38,159
you're not a full-time like grower

1603
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,079
and and you've got to like go to work

1604
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,719
and stuff well you know with the with

1605
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,359
the smaller plugs when it's time to move

1606
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,719
them to the big pots like

1607
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:49,199
they're not going to wait for you you

1608
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:51,598
must do it whereas i can imagine with

1609
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:53,759
with your tiered sleeve method you know

1610
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,720
you've got a lot more days to go with so

1611
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:59,440
so the way i'm picturing it dan

1612
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:03,439
your final pot will actually have the

1613
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:05,200
white ring of the plastic party cup like

1614
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,559
like on the surface of the soil

1615
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:08,078
throughout the growing cycle well that

1616
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,839
is that accurate

1617
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,680
actually a little bit higher um because

1618
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,519
what the the nice thing about this is it

1619
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:15,039
allows you to give that taproot a bigger

1620
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:16,798
vertical drop

1621
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:18,000
and with that bigger vertical drop

1622
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:19,599
you've got the soil that's already

1623
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,880
around where the the main plant is

1624
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,318
growing so that's going to have to be

1625
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,798
watered through your watering methods

1626
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:26,400
too but if you leave it a good you know

1627
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:28,798
two and a half three inches above the

1628
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,720
soil enough to where the the bottom cup

1629
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,960
or excuse me the bottom container can

1630
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:34,879
hold the cup stable and then have that

1631
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,000
elevated room you're giving yourself

1632
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,318
that drop

1633
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,159
and so yeah i usually don't go

1634
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:41,119
all the way down in because like in my

1635
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,639
brain

1636
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,480
those roots then have to come down out

1637
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:47,039
of that cup and then you're losing that

1638
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,798
top like potential three to four inches

1639
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:50,159
of soil in that pot so

1640
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:51,519
you kind of want to find the happy

1641
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:53,920
medium between the two so where it can

1642
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:56,719
take advantage of your entire the entire

1643
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,400
soil volume in the destination container

1644
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:00,798
you know dan i can imagine that there's

1645
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,400
some people listening who would um you

1646
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:04,159
know who there who are more visual

1647
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,760
learners who would really like to see

1648
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:10,000
this do you happen to have a photograph

1649
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,319
of your tiered method on your personal

1650
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,039
instagram that people could go hunt up

1651
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:17,440
yeah i think i might and it may be

1652
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:18,880
way back but what i can do is i do know

1653
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,318
where i can go harvest the pictures

1654
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,240
because it was a method that i was using

1655
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:25,119
for a very long time on the autoflower

1656
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:27,439
network to help people avoid transplant

1657
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,200
shock and to grow bigger plants

1658
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,200
six seven eight years ago

1659
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:32,719
you know uh it was there's pictures of

1660
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:34,239
it all on there i know there's gentlemen

1661
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:36,159
that's still on the instagram today i

1662
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:37,919
still see them running this method that

1663
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:39,440
have you know trickled over from afn to

1664
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,440
move you know into the social media

1665
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,639
platform instagram but i definitely can

1666
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,798
find some pictures for it and get it on

1667
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,000
there like to update that in content

1668
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:48,079
right on so if you're if you're

1669
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
interested in seeing a picture of it um

1670
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:52,000
dan will have that on his personal

1671
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,159
instagram by the time this episode comes

1672
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,358
out and so uh that's a full dupla full

1673
01:00:56,159 --> 01:01:00,719
duplex

1674
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:02,880
underscore afn

1675
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,078
all right all right so um

1676
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,519
so that's pretty much the deal with

1677
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:11,359
transplanting and you know um

1678
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:12,880
once you are established in auto flowers

1679
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:16,239
and and

1680
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,838
you want to start developing methods

1681
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:20,318
that you think might work for

1682
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:21,920
transplanting i fully support it like we

1683
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:24,318
like dan and i continue

1684
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:27,519
saying we are still in the early the

1685
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:30,239
very early days of autoflowers and so

1686
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:32,400
developing new techniques are great but

1687
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:34,879
from from dan and i's pretty vast

1688
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,358
experience with autoflowers we have not

1689
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,720
seen successful ways to

1690
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:41,598
um touch the roots and and startle the

1691
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:43,439
plant

1692
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,000
and then and then still have the plant

1693
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,240
going you know turning out nut well

1694
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,079
but so we definitely don't recommend it

1695
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:51,598
to anybody who's new to autoflowers but

1696
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,599
hey you know

1697
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:55,920
i've got an open mind i know dan does so

1698
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:58,000
if you if you actually develop technique

1699
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,480
for uh transplanting

1700
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,400
by all means uh publish that up and and

1701
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,358
share it with all of us eh

1702
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,039
absolutely you know like i said i am

1703
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:09,279
not against the transplant idea i

1704
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:11,839
understand why folks do it if you are

1705
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,920
new to auto flowers would i suggest it

1706
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:15,199
no i wouldn't you know get to know the

1707
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,639
mechanics of the plant and understand

1708
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:19,118
what it could potentially do to your

1709
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:20,159
future yield and harvest but if by all

1710
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:22,480
means i mean if there's something that

1711
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,519
you have found out um may it be cultivar

1712
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,880
specific

1713
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:26,159
or looking over the plant and

1714
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,440
understanding that this method has

1715
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,719
worked for you every single time i'd

1716
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,519
love to hear it

1717
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:32,639
right on which brings us to the topic of

1718
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:34,480
stunting

1719
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,598
and um you know

1720
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:40,480
there are so many things that you can do

1721
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:43,838
to your plant that would end up causing

1722
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:46,159
it to be stunted i mean honestly some of

1723
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:48,318
the varieties of autoflowers i have

1724
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:51,358
worked with it's just like if you look

1725
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:53,519
at it wrong it's gonna stunt and this is

1726
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:56,798
a real pain in the ass because you know

1727
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:58,559
photo periods they really do seem to be

1728
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:00,079
you know quite resilient right out of

1729
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,880
the gates

1730
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:06,079
but autoflowers really do feel like they

1731
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:08,000
are looking for an excuse to stunt

1732
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,480
and and i guess for people who are

1733
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,039
unfamiliar with this idea of stunting um

1734
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,358
that's where the plant will will reach a

1735
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:17,599
point at maybe um you know somewhere

1736
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:19,759
between two and eight inches and it will

1737
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,838
just stall and it'll just it'll it'll

1738
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,799
continue maturing but it's not putting

1739
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:26,558
on any more weight no more leaf mass it

1740
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:29,519
will eventually

1741
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,400
um flower too but you know you'll get

1742
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:33,679
one

1743
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,760
nug on it that is mature and it's it's

1744
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:37,279
really a drag especially when you're

1745
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,200
buying seeds

1746
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,000
and you know most most of the quality

1747
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:44,399
autoflower seeds are you know 15 or 18

1748
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,798
per seed so you want to be damn

1749
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:50,318
sure that you're not doing anything that

1750
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:51,440
um that are causing uh of stun stunting

1751
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:52,880
um

1752
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,159
uh dan why don't you run down a quick

1753
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,318
list of some of the things that you've

1754
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:58,000
seen cause stunting on a plant

1755
01:03:56,318 --> 01:03:59,838
i mean first of all talk about i mean

1756
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,639
real quick transplant right you know

1757
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:05,199
transplanting will definitely cause um

1758
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:06,400
stunting high light power height too far

1759
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:07,759
too much intensity i know that's

1760
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,559
bouncing back to an earlier subject but

1761
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:13,280
the light intensity um will cause that

1762
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,200
over watering if you over water it if

1763
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,359
you're too you know excited about

1764
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:19,279
growing it take your time remember that

1765
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:21,358
you know this is a seedling and it

1766
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,119
doesn't require as much water as you

1767
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,838
think it does

1768
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:27,920
underwatering if these roots run into

1769
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:30,159
dry patches or the bottom of your pots

1770
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,318
dry the sidewalls are dried it's only

1771
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:34,078
got a core center that's maintained

1772
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:35,838
moisture there's like a happy medium

1773
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,920
that'll cause them to stun as well

1774
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:40,239
temperatures cold temperatures can cause

1775
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,079
them to stunt i haven't really seen an

1776
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:43,759
issue with high temp

1777
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:47,039
causing the stunt but i think that

1778
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,400
grouping right there would would be

1779
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:51,599
the biggest set of triggers that i've

1780
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,119
seen regularly that caused stunting yep

1781
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,200
i agree and your temperature is a good

1782
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:57,119
one to point out too because you know

1783
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:59,279
we're all always so excited to get

1784
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:01,358
outdoors during the summer to get our

1785
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,519
photos here our photo period seeds

1786
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:05,199
popped and outside so that we can grow

1787
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:06,719
the biggest plants possible for the

1788
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:09,279
summer that we get

1789
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:10,798
but you know since autoflowers are are

1790
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,400
only going to

1791
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:16,000
you know have a life cycle that's you

1792
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:18,079
know 80 to well let's say 65 to 100 days

1793
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,639
um you really don't have to rush going

1794
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:23,839
outside with my photo periods where i

1795
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,078
live i'm often really tempted to take

1796
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:29,358
them outside in may

1797
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:32,318
but in may you can still easily get

1798
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:35,199
nights that are sub 50 degrees and a

1799
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:36,318
photo period will handle that no sweat

1800
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:39,199
especially if you take a moment to

1801
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:41,519
harden them off but that is not true of

1802
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:44,239
an autoflower if you put an autoflower

1803
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:46,480
out in may where i live and we get a you

1804
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:48,959
know a couple of those cold

1805
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,599
nights without a really warm day after

1806
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:54,639
it um that that's it the the the the

1807
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:57,519
plant will will be startled and it will

1808
01:05:54,639 --> 01:06:00,000
never recover from it and um and i have

1809
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:02,798
done this i did this a few years back to

1810
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,838
30 seeds ouch

1811
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:08,159
and um of of the 30 seeds that i had

1812
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:10,318
outside only two of them continued on

1813
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:11,838
and i ended up having to you know start

1814
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:13,038
all over again

1815
01:06:11,838 --> 01:06:15,279
um

1816
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:18,000
with with new seeds and that's an

1817
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:19,599
expensive error

1818
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,719
it is and it can be an expensive error

1819
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,318
especially if you're buying purchasing

1820
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:24,798
fems i mean you talked about about the

1821
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:26,639
prices of seeds recently um or just a

1822
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:28,079
moment ago and you know it's going to be

1823
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:29,759
frustrating you out there and some

1824
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,039
simple mistake like that of not being

1825
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,480
cautionary

1826
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,160
it could cost you

1827
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,760
to restart everything again reboot the

1828
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:37,679
entire run that you're planning to do so

1829
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,880
just try to be i always suggest people

1830
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:41,199
are like take a look at your hardiness

1831
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,798
zones read an almanac take a look i mean

1832
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:44,000
a lot of your extension offices in the

1833
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:45,838
area are going to give you ground

1834
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,280
temperatures and nighttime temperatures

1835
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:49,440
and just kind of watch that and do your

1836
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,599
planning for your you know your outdoor

1837
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,200
crop based upon those things i mean i've

1838
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:55,519
been using i mean my grandfather taught

1839
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:57,279
me that eons ago it's like you know we

1840
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:59,599
always had a farm farmer's almanac we

1841
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,440
always had a moon phase calendar and you

1842
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,440
know he always checked the university's

1843
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,720
extension offices for ground

1844
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,720
temperatures air temperatures and

1845
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:08,078
everything before planting his his

1846
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:09,519
garden vegetables so i think we should

1847
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:11,440
take the same care and this to avoid

1848
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:14,239
that typical environmental stressor

1849
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:17,358
stressor also the the general rule of

1850
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:20,078
thumb i uh suggest to people who are new

1851
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:21,279
to autoflowers is um to germinate on

1852
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,920
june 1st

1853
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:25,760
because you know for the contiguous u.s

1854
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,480
states there's there's pretty much

1855
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,000
nowhere that is not going to be safe by

1856
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:33,838
june 1st

1857
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:36,239
and if you start a plant june 1st

1858
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:38,960
and let's let's let's say on the on the

1859
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:41,838
low side let's say you've got a 65 day

1860
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:44,559
plant it'll grow all of june all of july

1861
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:47,599
and you are harvesting um you know the

1862
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,519
beginning of august so most of the u.s

1863
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:51,119
has got um

1864
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:53,920
drought then so it's going to be

1865
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:55,039
fantastic for not causing mold in your

1866
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,280
flowers

1867
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:59,200
but like even a hundred day plant right

1868
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,599
you know i talk a lot about the lion

1869
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:02,399
claw cultivar on this show that i really

1870
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,720
like

1871
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:08,240
and so that's a hundred days and so you

1872
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:09,919
know instead of the middle of august

1873
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:11,598
it's going to be the middle of september

1874
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,480
for that but that's still

1875
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:14,798
um

1876
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,039
drought season where i live and it's

1877
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:19,198
still incredibly warm and it's it's

1878
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:23,119
going to be the best warmth of the year

1879
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:25,278
where i am for for finishing a

1880
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:26,640
a plant in heat you know

1881
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:28,480
and so

1882
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,560
so feel free to just you know you can

1883
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:32,798
you by all means you should be aware of

1884
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,400
your almanac just to be more connected

1885
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:37,838
with the world around you and they're

1886
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:39,759
fun to look at but also if if you are a

1887
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:42,318
patient or if you're a home grower who

1888
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:44,158
just like just wants to get the cannabis

1889
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:46,239
and you don't necessarily going to make

1890
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:48,879
this like a full-time mental hobby for

1891
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:51,198
yourself feel free to just germinate on

1892
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:54,079
june 1st because i i can't think of

1893
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:56,639
anywhere um and the continental us that

1894
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:58,238
would have a have a hard time with that

1895
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:01,000
one other thing i want to point out

1896
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:02,079
before we move on from stunting is um

1897
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,838
[Music]

1898
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:06,880
you know we get into relationship with

1899
01:09:03,838 --> 01:09:09,119
these plants they growing things can be

1900
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:12,400
emotional

1901
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:14,719
a lot of us take a lot of pride and ego

1902
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:18,000
out of these plants

1903
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:20,319
do not beat up on yourself if you

1904
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,798
get a plant and it stunts like you're

1905
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:26,239
not a bad person you may not have even

1906
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:28,399
done anything wrong um some plants

1907
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:31,358
some autoflowers even when you treat

1908
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:33,198
them perfectly they still stunt

1909
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:35,199
and this has to do with the seed

1910
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:37,919
inconsistency that we started the show

1911
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:40,559
with some plants just stunt and it's a

1912
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,640
drag but like take it easy on yourself

1913
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,039
like this is this is part of this it

1914
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:48,000
also you know adds some risk when you're

1915
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:50,640
deciding to spend 18 on a seed too

1916
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,798
because um you know out of out of you

1917
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:55,760
know i would say there will be something

1918
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:59,198
that's going to stunt out of most packs

1919
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:01,280
from from that you can buy um

1920
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:03,119
for auto flowers which is one of the

1921
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:06,158
reasons why you know

1922
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:08,640
going with more established breeders or

1923
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:11,198
people who have got more worked lines

1924
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:14,640
will be to your advantage

1925
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:17,198
if if your money is tight and every seed

1926
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:20,000
needs to be a home run um

1927
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:22,399
but but i also really like growing new

1928
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,920
seeds from new breeders so i know that

1929
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:26,158
there's going to be some additional

1930
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,319
stunted plants in there and you just

1931
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:30,559
need to plan for it so so if you get a

1932
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:32,238
plant that's stunted you know figure out

1933
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,320
what you may have done wrong and use it

1934
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:35,919
as a learning experience but don't throw

1935
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:38,079
yourself under the bus about it because

1936
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,840
it happens to all of us

1937
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:41,439
it absolutely doesn't you know you bring

1938
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,760
up something else too i did forget to

1939
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:45,519
touch on something that's new to me and

1940
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,280
we've had a conversation about it and

1941
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,960
i've seen it personally

1942
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:52,479
is if you have a cover crop in your pot

1943
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,560
if you are an organic grower and you're

1944
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:56,000
running a cover crop and say

1945
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,920
you're not growing in like a traditional

1946
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,560
bed you're growing in like 10 maybe 15

1947
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:04,000
gallon pot indoor and you have a very

1948
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:06,560
established root robust cover crop you

1949
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,560
could potentially drown out the roots

1950
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:11,440
development for the auto causing that

1951
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:13,760
stunt whereas that root room that root

1952
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:15,198
that taproot can't develop properly

1953
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,159
because the cover crop has just consumed

1954
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:18,000
the pot

1955
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:19,679
i'm not i'm not too proud to say that's

1956
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,760
me man we're talking about me i'm that

1957
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,359
person um

1958
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,320
so so that's that's what happened when i

1959
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:28,479
grew your methanes right um uh i had i

1960
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:30,079
had a light that was too intense and

1961
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:32,799
then i didn't realize until after the

1962
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:35,760
fact that my pot was totally root bound

1963
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:38,239
not with the plant but with the with my

1964
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,360
green mulch my cover crop if you will

1965
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:43,759
um i i really love using dichondra pens

1966
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:45,920
well the dichondra pens had been in that

1967
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,880
pot since it was it was outdoor this

1968
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,960
summer

1969
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:51,920
and the repens had totally taken over

1970
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:54,158
the pot and when i when it was stunted

1971
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,560
and i took the soil out of the pot to

1972
01:11:54,158 --> 01:11:59,920
see what was going on the thing was like

1973
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:02,159
wall-to-wall roots of the cover crop and

1974
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,000
the plant never had a chance

1975
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:05,599
well and i wasn't just you know we had

1976
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,679
that conversation because i also had

1977
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,039
that experience uh two seasons ago in my

1978
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,560
huge culture bed

1979
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:13,039
anything that i had successfully

1980
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,920
transplanted into my google culture bed

1981
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:18,238
which has a very dense cover crop of

1982
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,000
two to three different species of clover

1983
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:22,238
anything that i direct germinated into

1984
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,079
that hugelkultur bed they didn't thrive

1985
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:26,319
at all and it was across multiple

1986
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:28,158
varieties and not just stuff from myself

1987
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:29,920
but from fellow breeders and friends and

1988
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:31,920
you know seeds that i have traded and

1989
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,600
then anything that got transplanted into

1990
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,039
that bed that already had a more robust

1991
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,760
root ball

1992
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:39,279
survived that stunning phase so we i

1993
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,440
mean both of us it was the thing that we

1994
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:43,039
both kind of had an aha moment about you

1995
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:45,198
know and learning a whole new method of

1996
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:46,158
what could potentially cause an autofire

1997
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:47,198
stunt

1998
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:48,879
right on

1999
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:50,399
so the next topic we're going to talk

2000
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,079
about is topping and i think that you

2001
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:55,439
and i have had different experiences

2002
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:58,719
around this one dan whereas um i d i do

2003
01:12:55,439 --> 01:13:02,000
not top my autoflowers i absolutely top

2004
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:05,039
my photo periods uh when they're indoors

2005
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:08,079
but um outdoors excuse me but but with

2006
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:08,880
autoflowers um i don't top them because

2007
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:10,079
um

2008
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,880
they're

2009
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:16,238
there i see their life um cycle to be

2010
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:18,640
too short for me to mess with like

2011
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:21,439
startling them at all

2012
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,480
and when i have topped them i don't see

2013
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:24,000
them

2014
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:25,599
always

2015
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,359
develop

2016
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:31,520
larger

2017
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:34,559
colas on the next set of of branches

2018
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:37,280
like i do with photo periods and so

2019
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:39,760
since i don't see that work reliably i

2020
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,519
just don't top them at all because i

2021
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,360
don't want to cause them stress in any

2022
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,400
way how about you

2023
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:47,839
i don't talk either uh my my personal my

2024
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:48,559
personal preference is to let that plant

2025
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,480
go

2026
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,000
um the genetics will speak for

2027
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:53,439
themselves your side branches especially

2028
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,600
if you're growing outside you're having

2029
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:56,960
more exposed light you're getting light

2030
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,199
all the way around the plant rather than

2031
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,960
just directly down on the plant

2032
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:03,359
um and

2033
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,640
i've never seen the need to top now i do

2034
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:06,079
know that there are a lot of guys out

2035
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,079
there that are very successful at

2036
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:10,000
topping i've seen

2037
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:12,000
several plants produce colas that are

2038
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,760
just as big as what a main cola would

2039
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,600
have been on you know the secondary and

2040
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,159
third branches you know resulting from

2041
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,239
the hormone shift of the topping

2042
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:23,679
but i think you have to know the

2043
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:25,919
cultivar as far as like is it known

2044
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:27,279
to be able to handle the topping like i

2045
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,960
think that's when it comes back to doing

2046
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:31,359
the research and seeing what

2047
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,439
people have done and successfully done

2048
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:35,439
and repeated successfully rather than

2049
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:37,119
just taking that photo period mentality

2050
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:38,960
to the autoflower and just saying okay

2051
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:40,640
work two nodes deep

2052
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,480
and three nodes deep i'm gonna go ahead

2053
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,320
and top this thing give myself you know

2054
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:45,599
six side branchings or eight side

2055
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:48,000
branches or however many you want

2056
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,840
depending on where you top it um you

2057
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,119
know i think that it's a frustrating

2058
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,039
point because i know a lot of people

2059
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:54,640
that are have grown photo periods and

2060
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:56,640
want to get into autos and they find it

2061
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,400
as a major deterrent because if they top

2062
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,520
it and it's not one that's known to be

2063
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:01,198
able to take top they have your

2064
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,560
experience where it's just like a bunch

2065
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:03,839
of little popcorn all the way around

2066
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,480
this plant

2067
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:10,079
yeah and i would go so far as to say

2068
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:12,799
that the the the number of varieties

2069
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:14,960
that you can top safely in autoflowers

2070
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,199
is very low

2071
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,880
i wouldn't say that oh you know some do

2072
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:21,119
some don't you need to do your research

2073
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,880
i would say that it is rare to find a

2074
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:24,399
plant that can be

2075
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:27,119
topped effectively

2076
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:29,198
um i know that they exist because i see

2077
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:30,640
them on instagram and friends of mine

2078
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:32,879
have done it and i'm all like i'll be

2079
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:35,280
damned like well actually in my head i'm

2080
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,800
like man you got lucky but but

2081
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:38,719
like i also have to be open to the

2082
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,360
possibility that these are also very

2083
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:43,679
skilled growers likely better than me

2084
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:47,759
and they have got a soft touch

2085
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:50,079
and the right variety and and and it

2086
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,600
turned out really well for them so so i

2087
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:54,079
guess this is kind of like the

2088
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,480
transplanting things where um like yeah

2089
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:57,439
sometimes you can get away with it um

2090
01:15:56,479 --> 01:15:59,519
but

2091
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:01,599
if if you don't have seed dilute seeds

2092
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,679
to lose or if you're new

2093
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,840
highly don't recommend it and the reason

2094
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:08,079
why it's in like the dislike category

2095
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,440
for autoflowers is that i i like to top

2096
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:11,840
everything i think that it's a good

2097
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:15,759
strategy overall to control

2098
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:18,800
size and to create more colas and so the

2099
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:21,520
fact that we can't top autoflowers um

2100
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,560
you know at least yet it is annoying to

2101
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,080
me

2102
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:28,480
it would not surprise me though that

2103
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:32,238
over the years as autoflowers get more

2104
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:34,639
um depth of of breeding and the genetics

2105
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:37,039
get stronger towards what we want them

2106
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,800
to do yeah i i it wouldn't surprise me

2107
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:42,479
if that evolves

2108
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,480
out of the genetics in the future

2109
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,719
i would say so too i mean like you said

2110
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:48,880
soft touch i think what it is are the

2111
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,319
guys that have been growing them as long

2112
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,679
as i have been growing them i mean

2113
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:53,119
there's a few new growers out there who

2114
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:55,199
have adapted quickly and everybody has a

2115
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:56,158
different skill set but like

2116
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:57,919
you know

2117
01:16:56,158 --> 01:16:59,439
i really think it's it comes back to a

2118
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,359
soft touch if you're new to the

2119
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:03,599
autoflower game

2120
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:06,479
let it ride you know don't go

2121
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,920
you know don't stress yourself out

2122
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:09,359
by

2123
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,800
trying to figure out how to do all these

2124
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:12,319
new things while trying to grow a new

2125
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,679
variety at the same time and topping is

2126
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,599
one of those things i would definitely

2127
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,960
say don't do it first once you

2128
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,520
understand it

2129
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,520
go for it but inevitably it's one thing

2130
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,840
that i personally again don't do i see

2131
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,880
it in my don't do not do list as well

2132
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,159
right on

2133
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:29,119
so the next topic we're going to talk

2134
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:31,519
about is uh similar uh which is training

2135
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:34,158
and um and and i'm pretty much a

2136
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:36,880
training novice um i actually am only

2137
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:40,399
really learning how to train now as i am

2138
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:42,480
developing my scrogging skills indoors

2139
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:44,879
um because you know pretty much my

2140
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:47,119
entire life i've just grown outdoors

2141
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:50,319
because i really do prefer growing under

2142
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:52,800
the sun but with where i live now

2143
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:55,039
um i i you know i decided i'd better

2144
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,119
learn about growing indoors if i'm going

2145
01:17:55,039 --> 01:18:00,319
to be able to provide my own medicine

2146
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:02,559
reliably and i'm a big fan of being a

2147
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:04,238
self-sufficient cannabis patient

2148
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,000
so so dan i'm just going to hand you the

2149
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:07,439
mic and i'm going to say you know why

2150
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,520
don't you address the training because i

2151
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:11,439
know that you've done quite a bit

2152
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,440
yeah um the training thing i think it's

2153
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:15,039
a soft touch thing uh it's frustrating

2154
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:16,960
too because it can you know lead back to

2155
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,719
stunning you know and this this whole

2156
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,239
set is kind of like

2157
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:22,079
kind of turns back to that it's just

2158
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:24,479
that touch of like

2159
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:26,559
being able to manipulate the plant in a

2160
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:28,238
manner that you can increase your yields

2161
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,120
but at the same time having that gentle

2162
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:32,879
touch

2163
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:33,920
of the training and like manifolding um

2164
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,719
because i don't like the word main

2165
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:40,158
lining it sounds terrible um

2166
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:42,000
manifolding and lst

2167
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:44,319
and you know

2168
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,560
both of those come back to actually

2169
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:48,880
topping the plant to get those results

2170
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,679
if you do feel the need of training i

2171
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:53,199
think lst is going to be your safest bet

2172
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,520
like after it's grown up and you've

2173
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:58,000
actually seen sex or just previous to

2174
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,000
seeing sex on these plants you know kind

2175
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,439
of tie down that main head rather than

2176
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,359
lopping it off

2177
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:06,879
tie down that main head over to the left

2178
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:08,880
gently so you don't break your main stem

2179
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,560
and what that will do is it allows that

2180
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,719
light exposure to come down and those

2181
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,960
those under smaller branches will come

2182
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,560
up and start to chase

2183
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,079
that main top that you have pulled over

2184
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,760
to the side of course just like any kind

2185
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:23,119
of lst or slight train you know low

2186
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,320
stress training um like that that head

2187
01:19:23,119 --> 01:19:25,760
will turn back up towards the light

2188
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:27,920
that's what they do

2189
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:30,239
just like when we do the super cropping

2190
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,000
outside or we do the trellising on our

2191
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:34,079
photo periods outside we bend those

2192
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,158
heads down underneath that trellis to

2193
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:37,760
expose those lower branches and allow

2194
01:19:36,158 --> 01:19:40,079
those lower branches to catch us big

2195
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,920
heads to give us that even canopy so if

2196
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,519
you do feel the need to train your

2197
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:46,079
autoflowers and you want to learn about

2198
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,320
it i i would say the best method you

2199
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:49,359
know methodology to go with is an lst

2200
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:50,479
rather than

2201
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:52,319
straight like

2202
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:53,919
cutting the head off of it pulling you

2203
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:55,599
know splitting the main stem out to the

2204
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,199
left and the right and then you know

2205
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,719
watching it work out from there because

2206
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:00,399
again it comes back to the potential

2207
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,920
stunting and also comes back to

2208
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:04,479
potentially hurting your yields and not

2209
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,920
giving that plan enough recovery time to

2210
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:07,519
actually build structure before it

2211
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,480
flowers

2212
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:12,000
right on

2213
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:14,879
so our last topic for uh this second set

2214
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,760
is nutrient timing and this is something

2215
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,239
that

2216
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:20,800
dan added to the agenda that i had not

2217
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:22,000
really considered because he and i

2218
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,199
approach

2219
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,880
um

2220
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:27,119
feeding the

2221
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,159
autoflower slightly differently

2222
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:29,039
i

2223
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:32,479
i

2224
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:34,399
start the plant in a pot that already

2225
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:37,519
has its full

2226
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:39,679
nutrition amendments um already in the

2227
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:44,159
pot and so

2228
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:47,520
all i add to auto flowers during the run

2229
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:50,079
myself is just compost teas

2230
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:54,159
and uh you know like

2231
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:58,000
k f related sprays um but i do know that

2232
01:20:54,158 --> 01:21:02,158
there are people like dan who um will

2233
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,600
sometimes amend um as you start the the

2234
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:06,479
flower cycle

2235
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:08,719
so so this is kind of your idea dan so

2236
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:10,959
so why don't you explain um how why the

2237
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:13,119
nutrient timing is is a little more

2238
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:16,239
precarious with autoflowers

2239
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:18,158
so and i'll caveat this with container

2240
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:19,759
size now i typically i'm

2241
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:21,359
not typically i am an organic grower in

2242
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,719
the majority of what i do

2243
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:24,799
and

2244
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:26,480
during the breeding cycles i'm looking

2245
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,159
i'm doing fetal hunting i'm sifting

2246
01:21:26,479 --> 01:21:30,799
through a lot of these seeds and i'm

2247
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:33,519
using extremely small pots and i think

2248
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:35,360
this relates a majority to the home

2249
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,040
grower than anybody else

2250
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:39,679
again that's getting into this they may

2251
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:41,359
have one two gallon pots they have seen

2252
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:43,760
some really nice stuff online they see

2253
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:45,039
that they get big and smaller containers

2254
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,880
and they go out they purchase them and

2255
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:48,158
they want to do an organic run and they

2256
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,480
buy

2257
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:53,119
there are several brands out there

2258
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:55,039
that offer pre-made you know soil or

2259
01:21:53,119 --> 01:21:57,439
soilless mediums that have

2260
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:59,519
heavy nutritional value in them

2261
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:00,319
most autoflowers can make it all the way

2262
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,320
through

2263
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:03,840
however i believe that there's also a

2264
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:05,920
timing thing too just like if you're

2265
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,520
using fertigation

2266
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,520
back when i was growing completely with

2267
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,199
salts and pro mix hp

2268
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,520
as the plant would progress i would

2269
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:15,439
alternate between a bloom

2270
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,719
and not alternate excuse me i would meld

2271
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:20,079
a

2272
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:21,920
grow nutrient into a bloom nutrient and

2273
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:23,679
then as that plant progressed into bloom

2274
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,840
i'd phase out

2275
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:28,079
the actual growth out of it to give an

2276
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,760
even transition of like the maturity

2277
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:31,840
stages of the plant going through so as

2278
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,199
she was in veg she got more of a grow

2279
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,119
dealt the nitrogen levels and things of

2280
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:36,319
that nature once she became a teenager

2281
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:38,559
you start giving it a little bit more

2282
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:40,799
bloom food to feed that that that bloom

2283
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,719
cycle that's coming into that plant and

2284
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:45,360
as she's getting more into the sexually

2285
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:46,480
mature side of going into flower it was

2286
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:48,158
it's going to need more of that

2287
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:50,238
phosphorus and potash and things of that

2288
01:22:48,158 --> 01:22:52,399
nature so you focus more on that when it

2289
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:54,959
came back to feeding with salts

2290
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:57,119
and to top talk about the top dressing i

2291
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,800
do the same thing is when i noticed that

2292
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:01,119
plant has

2293
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,279
got out of its fed stage

2294
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:05,679
and it's into it's it's pre-flower stage

2295
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:07,279
where it's showing its pistols i know

2296
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:10,399
that it's two weeks it's going to start

2297
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:12,238
raging into its its sexual maturity of

2298
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:13,920
the bloom cycle so it's going to

2299
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:16,559
potentially need

2300
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:18,480
that extra little boost that may not

2301
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,320
totally be in that soil

2302
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:22,799
so if you're doing a dry amendment top

2303
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:24,399
dress you need time for the microbial

2304
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,239
life to break down some of that some of

2305
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:27,759
it could be you know available ready

2306
01:23:26,238 --> 01:23:29,039
with the top dress but there are a lot

2307
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,360
of other things that need to have a

2308
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:33,039
little bit of a breakdown phase and for

2309
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:35,039
example just like when we make our own

2310
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:37,760
homemade soils we take you know we'll

2311
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:39,920
take a base we add some castings we add

2312
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:41,440
some manures we have the perlite the

2313
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,639
rice halls and we may add there's some

2314
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:44,238
some dry amendments and one of the

2315
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:45,679
things i do is let it sit for like two

2316
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:47,839
weeks before i use it

2317
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:49,840
let all that microbiology get up and

2318
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:52,400
alive and ready to go before i introduce

2319
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,480
my plants to it so if there's a if you

2320
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:56,879
are an organic grower even if you're a

2321
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:58,638
salt-based grower and you're using

2322
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,600
smaller containers i believe that this

2323
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:03,119
nutrient timing thing is huge that way

2324
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,800
when you're in flower you're not

2325
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:07,760
struggling and you then turn around you

2326
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,440
over feed then you burn your plant or

2327
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:12,639
you harm your yield or you come back to

2328
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:14,158
another impactful site of disappointment

2329
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:16,000
and you know i just want to make sure

2330
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:18,719
that people keep it in mind that the

2331
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,679
metabolism of these plants is very quick

2332
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,920
and

2333
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:23,920
those nutrient needs can shift on you

2334
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,960
before you know it and just be mindful

2335
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,800
of that

2336
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,399
you know another thing that to point out

2337
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:31,920
is that um

2338
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:36,000
you know jeff lowenfels has talked a lot

2339
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:40,158
about the low nutrient needs of of the

2340
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:43,119
autoflower plant um unlike like super

2341
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:46,158
hungry photo periods the ruderalis

2342
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:46,960
aspect of the autoflower i really

2343
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:49,839
think

2344
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:52,719
causes it to need less food throughout

2345
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:55,360
the the life cycle in fact i think that

2346
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:57,039
when you over feed them i think that's

2347
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:58,158
another quick way to get to stunting

2348
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:01,760
right

2349
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:04,158
especially if folks are using um

2350
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:06,960
any kind of very

2351
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:08,960
readily available nutrient like like a

2352
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,639
liquid or something bottled you know

2353
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:14,000
whether it's salts or not you know there

2354
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:17,199
are there are very bio-available organic

2355
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:20,319
foods as well that just like you know it

2356
01:25:17,198 --> 01:25:23,198
takes no effort for the for the

2357
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:24,158
microbe life in the soil to

2358
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:27,519
um

2359
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:28,879
you know make it accessible to the plant

2360
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,800
and so

2361
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:35,039
it's it's kind of like force-feeding

2362
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:36,079
food really really quickly and so um

2363
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:38,560
don't

2364
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:41,439
feel like you need to feed your

2365
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:44,480
autoflower plants the same way that you

2366
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:46,799
feed a hungry photo period

2367
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:49,839
if you're if you're just experiencing

2368
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:52,400
autoflowers for the first time

2369
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,480
air on the under feeding instead of the

2370
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:57,039
over feeding side

2371
01:25:54,479 --> 01:25:58,959
and it's also you know it kind of turns

2372
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:01,279
that into an advantage because you you

2373
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:04,319
really doesn't take as much nutrition to

2374
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:07,198
grow an autoflower plant for me

2375
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:10,319
i'm a big fan of the the kiss organics

2376
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:14,158
uh nutrient pack for my autoflowers

2377
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:17,439
and um you know i i will use that mixed

2378
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:19,519
with my my nitrogen of choice which is

2379
01:26:17,439 --> 01:26:21,119
dehydrated pig's blood

2380
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:24,080
and you know i'll make sure that my soil

2381
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:26,238
is amended germinate that seed you know

2382
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:28,559
water and other than composting i'm

2383
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:30,479
pretty much done for its its life cycle

2384
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,080
um but i do tend to be a little more

2385
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:34,959
hands-off than a lot of folks who like

2386
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:36,880
to you know feed and poke at the plant

2387
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:39,279
right and i will second your opinion

2388
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,800
what i use for my top dress is the kiss

2389
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:42,800
organ it's nutrient pack no kidding

2390
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,960
everything oh it's really good yeah yeah

2391
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:47,039
yeah yeah like i keep i've got a big bag

2392
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:49,359
i got a bucket of it in the garage like

2393
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:51,519
it's one of the i mean i use it and then

2394
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:54,000
if i'm outdoor i'll use um

2395
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:55,920
down to earth all purpose and down to

2396
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
earth by alive those are the three

2397
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,840
things that i use for my top dress the

2398
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,880
all-purpose has got a really broad

2399
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,119
spectrum

2400
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:05,279
of bioavail you know like different

2401
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:07,439
biological availabilities and nutrient

2402
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:08,880
aspects and then the biolive has got an

2403
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:10,960
even more increased

2404
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,880
microbiology in it and the combination

2405
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:15,039
of the two seem to do really really well

2406
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:16,719
outdoor for me

2407
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:18,238
right on so anything else that you want

2408
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:19,600
to add on nutrient timing before we go

2409
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:21,119
to commercial here

2410
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,560
no sir no i think

2411
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:24,399
i appreciate you let me run with a mic

2412
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,000
on that right on so we're going to take

2413
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:27,920
a short break and be right back you are

2414
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,639
listening to shaping fire and my guest

2415
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:32,480
today is cannabis breeder dan jimmy and

2416
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:34,400
without these advertisers shaping fire

2417
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:36,479
would not happen so please support them

2418
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:37,639
and let them know that you heard them on

2419
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:39,839
shaping fire

2420

[Music]

2421
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:44,079
for 20 years humboldt seed company has

2422
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:46,000
been family owned and providing reliable

2423
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:48,000
high yielding seeds originating in

2424
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,479
northern california while the current

2425
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,719
trend is to slap one super male into a

2426
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:54,158
line of hyped strains humboldt seed

2427
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:56,719
company continues to breed with

2428
01:27:54,158 --> 01:27:59,119
precision and care by doing large sifts

2429
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:01,279
and back crosses to emphasize the

2430
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:04,000
absolute best traits that a line has to

2431
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:06,158
offer this kind of breeding takes time

2432
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,920
talent and space to work

2433
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:10,079
no matter what kind of aroma you are

2434
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:12,079
particularly into humboldt seed will

2435
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:14,559
likely have something you'll love if you

2436
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:17,519
love fruit you can choose from banana

2437
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:19,679
mango apricot papaya blueberry blood

2438
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:23,040
orange melon and lemons across their

2439
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:25,920
various strains they have all gas glue

2440
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:27,760
and classic sour diesel lines as well of

2441
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,239
course there are the heritage california

2442
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:32,320
strains like og kush jack hair and

2443
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:34,479
headband and their award-winning

2444
01:28:32,319 --> 01:28:36,158
blueberry muffin is one that delights

2445
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:38,559
just about everybody's palette

2446
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:40,879
especially when concentrated

2447
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:42,560
humboldt seed company is proud to bring

2448
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:45,760
to market the infamous freak show

2449
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:48,000
cultivar 2 which has a great thc high

2450
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:50,480
but looks so much like a fern that some

2451
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
folks can't even identify it as cannabis

2452
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:53,839
it's a plant that really needs to be

2453
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,158
seen to be believed

2454
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:58,639
if you're looking for well-balanced cbd

my guest today is canvas breeder dan

2571
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:05,359
jimmy so the big finish set three let us

2572
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:08,320
focus on

2573
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:10,880
starting with fluffiness of flowers and

2574
01:33:08,319 --> 01:33:14,000
you know that's interesting because

2575
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:16,800
autoflowers have got a reputation of

2576
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:19,119
being fluffier but i really think it's

2577
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,199
important to talk about

2578
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:23,039
not only the fact that they are fluffier

2579
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:25,519
but also whether or not you're growing

2580
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:26,560
them indoors or outdoors right

2581
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,800
correct

2582
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:31,679
yeah so so i guess we should handle

2583
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:33,520
these individually so so i'll do the

2584
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:36,480
outdoor part and you do the indoor part

2585
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:39,199
so so when you're growing outdoor plants

2586
01:33:36,479 --> 01:33:40,000
there's something even though the sun

2587
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:44,399
is

2588
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:46,800
more intense than your light in in your

2589
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:47,920
your grow tent or your grow room

2590
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:51,279
um

2591
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:53,440
the relationship between the light and

2592
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:57,439
you know in the plant is different than

2593
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:59,839
the sun and the plant and auto flowers

2594
01:33:57,439 --> 01:34:02,000
just about everywhere will grow

2595
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:04,400
fluffier outdoors

2596
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:07,600
and you know the

2597
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:10,079
the the flowers will look larger

2598
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:13,440
than their actual weight

2599
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:16,960
and you kind of have to choose in to

2600
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:18,879
embrace that because um

2601
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,800
because it's what you're gonna get and

2602
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,600
you know they they smell good they taste

2603
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:27,279
good they look impressive um

2604
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:29,280
but they are going to be fluffier which

2605
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:31,279
where i live in the pacific northwest

2606
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:33,279
where it's especially humid is actually

2607
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:34,238
an advantage because if you've got a fan

2608
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:36,960
going

2609
01:34:34,238 --> 01:34:39,599
uh you're less likely to get any kind of

2610
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:42,719
a a mold rot situation

2611
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:46,079
or a flower rot situation because

2612
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:49,198
they're constantly getting um

2613
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:52,559
um you know dried out in the core of the

2614
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:55,118
flower the downside of it is if somebody

2615
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:58,320
is looking for those tight california

2616
01:34:55,118 --> 01:35:01,439
style photo period nugs

2617
01:34:58,319 --> 01:35:03,599
this will be this will have a different

2618
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:05,439
um

2619
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:08,639
different bag appeal

2620
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:11,039
than uh photoshop or photoshop a photo

2621
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:13,440
period will have

2622
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:14,479
what do you see with them indoors dan

2623
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:15,519
i see

2624
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:17,039
um

2625
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:19,600
them as a

2626
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:21,679
very tighter flower the intensity of the

2627
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,760
light and i believe the length of the

2628
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:25,359
light hours that we're giving them

2629
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,119
causes a different in the more a

2630
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:30,000
difference in the morphology of the

2631
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:31,679
actual flower itself i see tighter buds

2632
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,158
i see better

2633
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:36,880
structural wise presenting that bag

2634
01:35:34,158 --> 01:35:39,679
appeal that we're all so used to

2635
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:42,159
just a complete morphology shift than

2636
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:44,239
being grown outdoors

2637
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:46,879
and you know i really do

2638
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:49,759
prefer my autoflowers how they come out

2639
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:53,039
how they look being grown indoors

2640
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:56,400
i'm a big fan of sun grown and i think

2641
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:59,679
that the terpene profiles outdoors are a

2642
01:35:56,399 --> 01:36:01,599
bit wider because the the spectrum of

2643
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:04,000
light is a lot wider

2644
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:06,880
but now that i have grown autoflowers

2645
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
both outdoors and indoors i really do

2646
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:11,679
prefer

2647
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,760
the indoor finished product more as far

2648
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:15,520
as like bag appeal goes it's they're

2649
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:16,800
they just look sexier

2650
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,639
and um

2651
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,400
and i think i i'm unfamiliar with the

2652
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:23,118
study but i've heard people refer to a

2653
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:26,399
study around cannabis that suggests that

2654
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:27,920
sun grown plants actually produce more

2655
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:30,879
um

2656
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:33,760
more leaf leaf weight and so it's going

2657
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:36,079
to be more challenging to trim one grown

2658
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:37,280
outdoors as well what are your thoughts

2659
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:39,920
i agree

2660
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:41,679
outdoor seems to have like you said that

2661
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,639
that fluffierness to it than it does

2662
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:43,520
indoor

2663
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:44,960
um

2664
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,280
and i think

2665
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:49,920
traditionally root or alice in its its

2666
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:52,000
makeup is leafier anyway but i have seen

2667
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,960
that increase when it's out underneath

2668
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,039
the sun

2669
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:56,480
and that's what and i've seen again like

2670
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:58,800
i've seen it indoor and i've seen it

2671
01:36:56,479 --> 01:36:59,919
outdoor but i see it more so

2672
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,800
outdoor

2673
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:02,079
um

2674
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,679
and it does

2675
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:05,679
make it a little bit more difficult to

2676
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:08,480
give it that um

2677
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:10,480
that mendo style like cut where it's

2678
01:37:08,479 --> 01:37:12,238
like trimmed down and like a brazilian

2679
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:14,559
cut like a better turf you know what i

2680
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:16,238
mean yeah like i prefer a little leafier

2681
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,840
cut i like to have the sugar leaf there

2682
01:37:16,238 --> 01:37:21,359
i think it adds to the flour but

2683
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:22,400
like it does present a little bit more

2684
01:37:21,359 --> 01:37:24,960
of a challenge when it comes down to

2685
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:26,399
streaming when i caught you uh talking

2686
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,840
at the um

2687
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:30,879
the um

2688
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:33,360
camp root oralis autoflower cup event

2689
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,880
you also were talking about the calyx to

2690
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:36,399
leaf ratio why don't you tell us a

2691
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,159
little bit about that

2692
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:39,679
so i think that is a negative side

2693
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:42,079
effect of

2694
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:44,319
the regrouse um not a bad thing you know

2695
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:45,760
what i mean but it is unfortunately part

2696
01:37:44,319 --> 01:37:47,039
of i've touched on it slightly through

2697
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,440
this episode

2698
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:51,439
of something about the genetic marker of

2699
01:37:49,439 --> 01:37:53,759
the day neutral coming across it kind of

2700
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:57,198
like likes to hang out together

2701
01:37:53,760 --> 01:38:00,320
um you know i was growing um

2702
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:02,879
i see it as a brutal a ruderal trait

2703
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:05,039
and my example for that is i've had the

2704
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,480
recent pleasure of talking with nick

2705
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:08,079
from greensource gardens about his

2706
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:09,519
pickleberry and what i saw with

2707
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:12,960
pinkleberry

2708
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:16,080
and pickleberry had that mechanic of

2709
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:17,679
a higher leaf ratio to the flower ratio

2710
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:19,600
on a specific phenotype that i was

2711
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:22,158
looking at it triggered very early into

2712
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:23,280
flower we're talking like at the equinox

2713
01:38:22,158 --> 01:38:25,039
and

2714
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:26,559
i had a hunch that if i added an

2715
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:29,198
heirloom that i could see higher

2716
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:32,639
autoflowering results in the f1

2717
01:38:29,198 --> 01:38:34,960
and that higher leaf ratio you know the

2718
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:37,039
leaf to calyx ratio that higher ratio

2719
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:40,719
just some seems to be there with root or

2720
01:38:37,039 --> 01:38:43,198
alice it's frustrating and

2721
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:44,399
i'm working to try to select that out of

2722
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:45,839
what i'm doing

2723
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:48,799
because i guess seems to be the biggest

2724
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:51,199
complaint from farms to home growers is

2725
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:52,639
like okay so we got a lot of trim

2726
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:53,919
more so than we did bud weight because

2727
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:55,279
of the fluffiness we were talking about

2728
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,719
because most farms traditionally grow

2729
01:38:55,279 --> 01:38:58,800
them outside there's not a lot of farms

2730
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:00,480
that are growing autoflowers in massive

2731
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:02,000
warehouses yet

2732
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:03,839
right

2733
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:07,840
you know that that

2734
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:10,800
the leaf is so intense on some of these

2735
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:13,279
varieties of autoflowers that instead of

2736
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:16,159
using scissors i want to i want to use

2737
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:17,759
like um like the like the razor clippers

2738
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:20,479
like they use on your neck when you get

2739
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:23,199
a haircut you know like absolutely oh my

2740
01:39:20,479 --> 01:39:26,479
gosh it's just so thick with um

2741
01:39:23,198 --> 01:39:29,039
thick with with the leaf rate the leaves

2742
01:39:26,479 --> 01:39:32,559
the other thing that a lot of the um

2743
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:34,880
cultivars will have that um are are

2744
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,800
showing a lot of their root oralis

2745
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:39,520
aspects visually because because you

2746
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:42,560
know it's true some look like rudy's and

2747
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:44,560
some don't and i tend to go towards the

2748
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:46,159
ones that don't look like ruderalis

2749
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,199
because because they've got better bag

2750
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:50,079
appeal

2751
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:50,799
but a lot of them also um

2752
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:54,559
the

2753
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:58,079
the leaves all down the flower

2754
01:39:54,560 --> 01:40:00,880
especially on the main um stem

2755
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:04,079
will look like they're pointed up and

2756
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:06,960
and i don't mean when the leaves are

2757
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:08,479
praying right we all know how on a on a

2758
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,520
bright sunny day

2759
01:40:08,479 --> 01:40:14,000
when the plant is really happy it it it

2760
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:16,480
looks like it's reaching up to the sun

2761
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,399
and the leaves can kind of like get this

2762
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:21,118
gentle cur

2763
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:23,599
crease in them and and you know

2764
01:40:21,118 --> 01:40:26,000
we generally refer to that as as praying

2765
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,719
what i mean is that the

2766
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,920
the

2767
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:30,880
the the leaf and the flower matter will

2768
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:34,158
grow

2769
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:37,279
at an upwards angle

2770
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:39,920
and it's always reminiscent to me of the

2771
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:43,039
throne uh the iron throne on game of

2772
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:45,279
thrones um how how it they look sharp

2773
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:48,319
and they look like they're going up

2774
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:50,399
and um it's very it's very dramatic now

2775
01:40:48,319 --> 01:40:54,158
the smoke is great and the terpene

2776
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:56,638
profile is great but that look

2777
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:59,279
looks like there's something wrong with

2778
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:02,400
the plant to me

2779
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:04,719
having come from photo periods it just

2780
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:06,079
it looks janky right it looks like it

2781
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:07,359
looks like there's something wrong with

2782
01:41:06,079 --> 01:41:09,679
this plant

2783
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:11,519
and it does everything we want it to do

2784
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:15,520
except for

2785
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:17,040
look as expected and so

2786
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,560
you know i've smoked a lot of great

2787
01:41:17,039 --> 01:41:21,039
stuff that does that but it is

2788
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:23,520
definitely not my preference and and

2789
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:25,439
something that i i generally don't grow

2790
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:27,520
a second time

2791
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:29,759
right and like earlier on it like this

2792
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,440
is that's a besides the the straight up

2793
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:33,360
pointing and you know how we were

2794
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:35,039
talking about how like you know you may

2795
01:41:33,359 --> 01:41:37,279
have a few of them indoors and they may

2796
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:39,760
not be like larger plants but they grow

2797
01:41:37,279 --> 01:41:41,759
real super dense inside another issue

2798
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,679
that makes them look real janky is like

2799
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,480
once you get done say you got a nice big

2800
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:48,079
fat baseball bat cola or a couple big

2801
01:41:46,479 --> 01:41:50,079
fat baseball bat colas and you got it

2802
01:41:48,079 --> 01:41:51,359
down it's dried and you're going through

2803
01:41:50,079 --> 01:41:52,719
you're trying to trim it up to get it

2804
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:55,198
into the jars and get it separated and

2805
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:56,480
you start separating that flour from the

2806
01:41:55,198 --> 01:41:58,399
the um

2807
01:41:56,479 --> 01:42:00,799
the main stem you start this when you

2808
01:41:58,399 --> 01:42:02,960
pull that flour out you'll notice like

2809
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:05,119
the part of the bud that was resting

2810
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:06,880
against the actual main stem

2811
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:08,960
is kind of off-colored

2812
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:10,560
and it's a lighter usually a lighter

2813
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:13,118
green like if you're growing a purple

2814
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:15,440
plant you'll see like reds and like like

2815
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:16,880
almost under development deep inside

2816
01:42:15,439 --> 01:42:18,719
there because of the way that everything

2817
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:20,560
with that leaf and the way that that

2818
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:21,920
structure's grown is compacted inside

2819
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:23,600
there that light can't get in there to

2820
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:25,600
mature that part of the

2821
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:27,119
part of the flower and that's another

2822
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:28,800
aspect like the outside looks great

2823
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:30,479
terpenes look fantastic and you start

2824
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:32,639
bucking those things down and

2825
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:34,238
into jars you're like okay this looks

2826
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:35,520
looks a little off but it's completely

2827
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:38,559
fine

2828
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,920
yeah but it makes you suspicious it does

2829
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:41,039
every single time

2830
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,960
every single time it makes you

2831
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:45,519
suspicious you know and um

2832
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:47,679
if you if we had the better

2833
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:49,119
the note spacing that we have like with

2834
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:51,600
photo periods to wear like you have a

2835
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:52,880
bud you have some stretch you have a bud

2836
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,960
you have some stretch once they get into

2837
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:56,639
flower those bud sets tend to alternate

2838
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,719
up the flower and don't typically grow

2839
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:59,600
together most modern day photo periods

2840
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:02,319
anyway

2841
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:04,560
but ruderalis or in autoflowers they

2842
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:06,960
still tend to do that without that

2843
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:08,960
offset to kind of give that flower its

2844
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,560
ability to fully develop in it again it

2845
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:12,960
just kind of looks off it's completely

2846
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:13,760
fine but visually to an untrained eye

2847
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,960
like

2848
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,679
i don't know if i want anything from

2849
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,679
that

2850
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:20,639
yeah it's funny because that is the same

2851
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:22,800
attribute that gives people the big

2852
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:25,440
colas that they refer to as like

2853
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:27,440
baseball bats or your arm right so some

2854
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:29,839
some people are all like oh look it's

2855
01:43:27,439 --> 01:43:32,479
one big bud this is awesome and then and

2856
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:34,639
then other people will be like oh

2857
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:36,000
there's no internal spacing and it's all

2858
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:38,319
grown together

2859
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,639
and and there's janky stuff going on

2860
01:43:38,319 --> 01:43:44,079
along the stem which it's still great

2861
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:45,600
smokeable flower but um it looks like

2862
01:43:44,079 --> 01:43:48,319
it's immature

2863
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,920
exactly it looks immature but it

2864
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:52,559
inevitably is not

2865
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:53,520
the the actual definition of mids

2866
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:55,920
actually

2867
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:57,679
pretty much

2868
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:00,158
i mean you know down to the point yeah

2869
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:02,399
yeah so all right so the next thing that

2870
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:04,399
we're going to talk about is um soil

2871
01:44:02,399 --> 01:44:06,238
germination and

2872
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:08,638
you know one of the challenges with

2873
01:44:06,238 --> 01:44:11,039
autoflowers is the the that we don't

2874
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:14,239
want to transplant them right and so as

2875
01:44:11,039 --> 01:44:17,519
autoflowers have become more popular um

2876
01:44:14,238 --> 01:44:21,198
it is the common suggestion that you

2877
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:22,719
just go ahead and germinate the

2878
01:44:21,198 --> 01:44:26,158
seed

2879
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:29,600
in the in the soil of the pot where it's

2880
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:32,719
going to finish and so um

2881
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:34,880
while we do have you know a fix for this

2882
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:38,560
when i first started growing autoflowers

2883
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:41,679
is it was a super drag because um

2884
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:45,199
it it is more challenging to germinate

2885
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:48,000
in soil than it is in

2886
01:44:45,198 --> 01:44:49,439
paper towel or or you know some people

2887
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,920
hang and put it in paper towel and then

2888
01:44:49,439 --> 01:44:55,439
hang the bag on the wall so it's got a

2889
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:56,719
uh orientation to go up but um

2890
01:44:55,439 --> 01:44:59,198
you know it

2891
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:02,079
it's so easy for the soil to dry out

2892
01:44:59,198 --> 01:45:04,638
it's so easy for if you're outdoors some

2893
01:45:02,079 --> 01:45:07,760
varmint to come and eat that seed

2894
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:10,639
um it's it's a real hassle and and

2895
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,920
unless you've got a good solution for it

2896
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:15,279
um

2897
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:18,239
it can be a real a real drag so but you

2898
01:45:15,279 --> 01:45:20,719
know dan and i and and and probably a

2899
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:22,559
lot of other autoflower people came to

2900
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:24,639
the same solution

2901
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:25,920
separately and we didn't realize that we

2902
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:27,920
did the same thing until we were

2903
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,440
preparing for this show so so dan why

2904
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:32,079
don't you go ahead and explain the the

2905
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:33,439
solution that we like for germinating in

2906
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:35,519
the soil

2907
01:45:33,439 --> 01:45:37,519
so germinating in the soil one of the

2908
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:42,159
things that i really really like to do

2909
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:43,440
is maintain the moisture kept above

2910
01:45:42,158 --> 01:45:44,960
you know

2911
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:47,599
you know maintain the moisture on the

2912
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:49,279
surface level above that seed and i do a

2913
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:51,440
couple things to do that one of them is

2914
01:45:49,279 --> 01:45:55,118
i put a little tiny like nine ounce

2915
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:56,799
party cup dome over the central location

2916
01:45:55,118 --> 01:45:58,559
of where that seed has been planted a

2917
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:01,279
clear one a clear party club not a red

2918
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:02,320
one correct yes thank you yes a clear

2919
01:46:01,279 --> 01:46:03,840
like

2920
01:46:02,319 --> 01:46:05,439
you're at the high school dance punch

2921
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,880
cup that's the best way i could describe

2922
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:09,839
it you put that clear cup over it and

2923
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:11,600
then you still have uh if you're growing

2924
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:13,279
in like a two or three gallon pot and

2925
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:15,600
trying to germinate in that you still

2926
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:18,559
have a large surface area of exposed

2927
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:19,840
soil to wind circulation in your room

2928
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,000
and

2929
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,600
soil wicks so if that soil is dry even

2930
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,639
though you have that party cup over top

2931
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:27,840
of that

2932
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:29,920
that soil will dry out around that cup

2933
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,440
and then tend to leech that moisture

2934
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:33,440
from underneath that cup because you

2935
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:35,118
can't put the cup down to the depth of

2936
01:46:33,439 --> 01:46:37,439
where it's going to protect the seed you

2937
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:40,960
know three to six inches so what i also

2938
01:46:37,439 --> 01:46:42,879
do is i layer rice halls around that cup

2939
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:43,600
so now you've got the seed protected by

2940
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:45,440
a

2941
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,440
micro humidity dome

2942
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:49,678
with the clear cup and then you avoid

2943
01:46:47,439 --> 01:46:51,118
the moisture wicking and maintain a

2944
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:53,840
level

2945
01:46:51,118 --> 01:46:56,000
uh moist soil with the rice halls as a

2946
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:58,800
mulch so the rice halls protect the

2947
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,960
large exposed area the clear cup covers

2948
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,960
your seed and usually within three to

2949
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,800
four days that seed will pop its head

2950
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,319
right up out of there and to touch on

2951
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,239
your you know not only do we have to

2952
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:09,759
deal with varmints and drying out we

2953
01:47:08,238 --> 01:47:11,678
also have to deal with like certain

2954
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:13,039
types of insects and said soil too

2955
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:15,039
especially if you're growing in large

2956
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:16,800
beds or if you're growing outdoors and

2957
01:47:15,039 --> 01:47:18,399
you're growing in a garden you got to

2958
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,000
worry about what i like to call like the

2959
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:22,719
roly-polies you know they will come

2960
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,279
through and they will eat

2961
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:26,800
your seedling slugs if you don't have i

2962
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:28,319
mean especially if you're growing in an

2963
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,279
organic matter

2964
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:33,198
area

2965
01:47:29,279 --> 01:47:35,439
slugs absolutely love dead decaying

2966
01:47:33,198 --> 01:47:37,198
plant matter and those slugs also like

2967
01:47:35,439 --> 01:47:38,238
live plants too and i have come out many

2968
01:47:37,198 --> 01:47:40,000
mornings

2969
01:47:38,238 --> 01:47:41,519
to missing tops off of these new

2970
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,079
seedlings that have come up in like my

2971
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:45,199
hugu culture beds or even in the pots

2972
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:47,920
that i have around there because the

2973
01:47:45,198 --> 01:47:50,319
slugs have found them and had a snack

2974
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:52,639
yeah i have lived that hell myself do

2975
01:47:50,319 --> 01:47:54,799
you do you put uh holes in the top of

2976
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:57,760
your uh plastic dome

2977
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:59,679
i do not um i keep that dome on there

2978
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:02,159
until they break up and they're turning

2979
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:03,840
true to the light once they turn true to

2980
01:48:02,158 --> 01:48:06,238
the light meaning the head is completely

2981
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:08,319
pointed up its catalans are open the

2982
01:48:06,238 --> 01:48:10,079
first set's starting to develop i then

2983
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:11,920
work the rice halls in around the base

2984
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:14,559
of that main stem and then let it

2985
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:16,639
proceed with my my watering schedule

2986
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:19,440
right on so so i guess that's slightly

2987
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:21,118
different with me i i put holes in the

2988
01:48:19,439 --> 01:48:22,879
top of the cup so that there is a little

2989
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:25,279
bit of airflow it's definitely

2990
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:28,079
restricted airflow so that though i

2991
01:48:25,279 --> 01:48:30,158
don't lose my moisture inside

2992
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:31,760
but i

2993
01:48:30,158 --> 01:48:34,638
also just want to make sure that it

2994
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:37,360
doesn't get too hot under the cup and or

2995
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:39,760
the humidity spikes too much so so you

2996
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:43,439
know um you know try it yourself and and

2997
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:45,280
see what you prefer um also um you know

2998
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:47,759
there are lots of things that you can do

2999
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:49,599
to creatively not have to buy more

3000
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,880
plastic right certainly

3001
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:53,840
the clear

3002
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:56,319
party cups work um i'm very lucky

3003
01:48:53,840 --> 01:49:00,239
because of where i live there is a

3004
01:48:56,319 --> 01:49:03,359
walnut tree on the property and um the

3005
01:49:00,238 --> 01:49:06,959
the prior occupants had um

3006
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:09,839
taken all of these one liter clear soda

3007
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:13,039
bottles and cut them in half

3008
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:15,840
and put them on the branches of the

3009
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:17,920
walnut tree to protect the young walnuts

3010
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:19,840
from the squirrels who love them

3011
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:22,960
and so i'm not really

3012
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:25,760
harvesting that walnut tree and so

3013
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:27,439
you know every spring the winter winds

3014
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:30,880
blow these

3015
01:49:27,439 --> 01:49:33,519
these one liter plastic bottles um out

3016
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:36,000
of the tree and so i'll just go and i'll

3017
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:39,119
i will harvest the plastic off the

3018
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:43,039
ground and so what it essentially is is

3019
01:49:39,118 --> 01:49:45,519
a is a one liter clear plastic bottle

3020
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:48,960
and cut in half and so that you can use

3021
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:50,239
the top and you can use the bottom as

3022
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:51,279
domes

3023
01:49:50,238 --> 01:49:54,000
for

3024
01:49:51,279 --> 01:49:55,279
the plant and so

3025
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,800
using the top of the bottle there's

3026
01:49:55,279 --> 01:49:58,238
already an air hole maybe a little

3027
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:59,199
bigger than i would want but it works

3028
01:49:58,238 --> 01:50:01,439
fine

3029
01:49:59,198 --> 01:50:03,839
and then the bottom i poke a few holes

3030
01:50:01,439 --> 01:50:05,359
in as well and so the reason why i'm

3031
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:07,840
telling you this is not that i expect

3032
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:08,719
that you have a walnut tree at your

3033
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,719
house

3034
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:12,800
but that if you look around through your

3035
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:15,520
recycling and other places that you use

3036
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:17,039
plastic in your life um chances are

3037
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:18,800
you're going to be able to find some

3038
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:20,238
plastic at your house or your

3039
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:23,440
neighborhood that

3040
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:25,598
you can upcycle into protecting your

3041
01:50:23,439 --> 01:50:27,279
autoflower seedlings

3042
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:28,960
absolutely upcycling is always a good

3043
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:32,399
thing right on

3044
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:36,239
so uh so yeah soil germination is a pain

3045
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:38,719
in the ass until you get your recipe

3046
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:41,039
down and once you get your recipe down

3047
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:43,359
um the the soil germination just it

3048
01:50:41,039 --> 01:50:45,599
becomes a non-issue but when i was

3049
01:50:43,359 --> 01:50:47,839
starting out you know um it took me it

3050
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:50,400
took me two rounds to realize that i had

3051
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:53,920
a problem and then and then a third

3052
01:50:50,399 --> 01:50:55,839
third round to solve it so there's that

3053
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:59,840
um so so the last thing that we're gonna

3054
01:50:55,840 --> 01:51:02,719
hit on here um is is the making of

3055
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:04,880
autoflowers and i'm mostly gonna let dan

3056
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:08,079
to speak to this since he's the he's the

3057
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:10,319
breeder here today um but i want i want

3058
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:14,079
to point out that you know i am not a

3059
01:51:10,319 --> 01:51:17,039
breeder um at best i am a pollen chucker

3060
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:19,439
but i do enjoy taking pollen off of a

3061
01:51:17,039 --> 01:51:22,399
male plant and putting it on a female

3062
01:51:19,439 --> 01:51:24,479
plant and you know suddenly oh boom

3063
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:26,079
something something that's across of the

3064
01:51:24,479 --> 01:51:28,718
two plants that i like

3065
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:31,279
well when i started getting turned on to

3066
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:33,198
autoflowers i was like oh

3067
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:36,238
well i want to make some of my favorite

3068
01:51:33,198 --> 01:51:37,678
photo periods autoflowers i'll just i'll

3069
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:39,919
just you know

3070
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:41,440
you know put an autoflower and a photo

3071
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:42,480
period together

3072
01:51:41,439 --> 01:51:44,158
and

3073
01:51:42,479 --> 01:51:46,959
and that's when i realized oh they're

3074
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:49,039
not all going to be autoflowers i'm

3075
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:51,198
introducing a new trait

3076
01:51:49,039 --> 01:51:52,800
that is not usually what i'm doing when

3077
01:51:51,198 --> 01:51:55,198
i'm just you know

3078
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:58,800
pollen chucking with photo periods which

3079
01:51:55,198 --> 01:52:01,678
are like so easy to make seeds so dan i

3080
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:05,279
recognize that this is not a an

3081
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:08,639
autoflower breeding episode but if you

3082
01:52:05,279 --> 01:52:10,319
would just give us a nice sketch of what

3083
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:11,279
the steps are

3084
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:13,920
to

3085
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:17,679
breed an autoflower

3086
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:20,079
to a a photo period so folks can kind of

3087
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:22,079
get a picture of what that looks like

3088
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:23,519
and if that is something that tantalizes

3089
01:52:22,079 --> 01:52:27,039
them well then they can start doing

3090
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:28,560
their homework but for most folks um

3091
01:52:27,039 --> 01:52:30,639
they'll just have it in their head and

3092
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:32,159
they'll they'll realize that oh

3093
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:33,920
autoflowers are a different animal so

3094
01:52:32,158 --> 01:52:35,839
take it away

3095
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:38,239
absolutely and thank you and i'll keep

3096
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:39,599
it at like a 10 000 foot level that

3097
01:52:38,238 --> 01:52:41,039
you know like you said people can choose

3098
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:42,800
whether they want to be tantalized by

3099
01:52:41,039 --> 01:52:45,039
this or if they want to just you know

3100
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:46,639
leave it to the rest of us to figure out

3101
01:52:45,039 --> 01:52:48,079
um

3102
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:50,319
like you said and we'll start with that

3103
01:52:48,079 --> 01:52:52,479
photo period to photo period is

3104
01:52:50,319 --> 01:52:53,920
very simple when you put a male to a

3105
01:52:52,479 --> 01:52:55,039
female and i'm going to talk on i'm not

3106
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:55,920
going to go into feminization we're

3107
01:52:55,039 --> 01:52:58,479
going to say

3108
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,639
pollen donor and recipient you take a

3109
01:52:58,479 --> 01:53:02,718
pollen donor for your photo period

3110
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:04,400
you're going to pass it to the female

3111
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:07,118
on your photo period the resulting

3112
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:09,039
children are going to be photoperiod

3113
01:53:07,118 --> 01:53:11,519
now with that said there is going to be

3114
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:13,198
a mix of genetic expression in that

3115
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:15,199
first offspring

3116
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:16,879
that's how the gene code matches up you

3117
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:19,439
may find some nice stuff you may have to

3118
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:22,159
do another generation

3119
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:24,238
autoflower to autoflower if you use a

3120
01:53:22,158 --> 01:53:26,638
pollen donor an autoflower and you cross

3121
01:53:24,238 --> 01:53:29,839
it to a female autoflower a hundred

3122
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:32,000
percent of those offspring will be

3123
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:33,440
autoflower you're gonna get again

3124
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,439
different kinds of phenotypical

3125
01:53:33,439 --> 01:53:37,359
expressions across that first lot but

3126
01:53:35,439 --> 01:53:38,839
you're gonna have true autoflowering day

3127
01:53:37,359 --> 01:53:42,479
neutral

3128
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:44,800
results when it comes to making

3129
01:53:42,479 --> 01:53:47,279
your favorite photo

3130
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:48,960
exhibit autoflowering traits

3131
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:51,439
there's a little bit more work involved

3132
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:52,960
because you're then dealing with those

3133
01:53:51,439 --> 01:53:55,678
varying traits that you're seeing

3134
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:58,639
express in the resultant offspring or

3135
01:53:55,679 --> 01:54:00,399
the f1 of the photoperiod cross auto and

3136
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:04,000
that doesn't matter if it goes male

3137
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:05,519
photo to female auto or male auto to

3138
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,439
female photo

3139
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:10,000
you have to search through that gene

3140
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:12,158
pool looking for genetic markers and

3141
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,319
traits of the ruderalis parent that you

3142
01:54:12,158 --> 01:54:16,638
introduced to the photoperiod

3143
01:54:14,319 --> 01:54:19,359
so that builds upon you having to search

3144
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:21,039
through that set of seeds

3145
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:22,719
and then moving to the next generation

3146
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:25,439
using a male and a female from that

3147
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:27,840
first set of seeds to make the f2

3148
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:30,000
at the f2 your numbers are going to

3149
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:32,079
typically increase in your autoflowering

3150
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,399
expression because the day neutral trait

3151
01:54:32,079 --> 01:54:36,079
is recessive and you have to bring it

3152
01:54:34,399 --> 01:54:38,158
out in dominance and to bring it out in

3153
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:41,840
dominance you have to work the fellow

3154
01:54:38,158 --> 01:54:44,000
generations to bring it out by f3 you've

3155
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:46,079
got a really good autoflowering day

3156
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,840
neutral trait that's going on in there

3157
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:48,800
and then you can kind of pheno hunt a

3158
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:51,279
little bit because you're going to have

3159
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:54,000
a nice mix of like fast flowering photo

3160
01:54:51,279 --> 01:54:56,079
periods you're going to have what

3161
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,359
some people call super autos which is a

3162
01:54:56,079 --> 01:54:59,760
terrible term

3163
01:54:57,359 --> 01:55:02,158
um and it's basically an autoflower or a

3164
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:04,079
photo period that's stuck it has some of

3165
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:07,439
the day neutral trait it can

3166
01:55:04,079 --> 01:55:09,039
it grows up it matures it sexes and then

3167
01:55:07,439 --> 01:55:10,799
it gets to the stage where i call

3168
01:55:09,039 --> 01:55:13,039
optimal pollenization it looks like 80s

3169
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:15,920
hairspray styles like straight sticking

3170
01:55:13,039 --> 01:55:18,479
out and then it needs 12 12 to finish

3171
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:20,800
its life cycle that's still not a proper

3172
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:23,039
true autoflowering

3173
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:24,719
plant that we know them as today

3174
01:55:23,039 --> 01:55:27,279
so that f3 generation you're going to

3175
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:28,880
see a conglomerate of that and by f3 you

3176
01:55:27,279 --> 01:55:30,399
could probably find

3177
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:32,480
you know representations of your

3178
01:55:30,399 --> 01:55:33,920
photoperiod parent

3179
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:36,638
that you want to progress forward with

3180
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:39,039
the autoflowering trait so by f4 you're

3181
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:40,960
kind of honing in a little bit more and

3182
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:43,599
by f5 pretty much everything that you're

3183
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:45,520
spitting out of the inbred line

3184
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:47,760
is autoflowering

3185
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:50,560
right on that's great so this brings up

3186
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:52,320
another aspect that is

3187
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:54,719
not pleasurable when it comes to

3188
01:55:52,319 --> 01:55:58,238
autoflowers which is

3189
01:55:54,719 --> 01:56:02,399
you know so so often during this um

3190
01:55:58,238 --> 01:56:05,519
breeding process we take clones and and

3191
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:07,439
autoflowers do not clone properly

3192
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:10,320
because if you think about it when you

3193
01:56:07,439 --> 01:56:13,519
clone a plant your clones are still

3194
01:56:10,319 --> 01:56:15,519
actually the age of the mother plant

3195
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:18,480
even though they're like these new cute

3196
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:21,840
young looking plants they are actually a

3197
01:56:18,479 --> 01:56:25,839
plant that has the age of the mother

3198
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:27,840
and and since auto flowers um

3199
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:31,760
you know they've got such a short life

3200
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:33,119
cycle if you take a clone it is probably

3201
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:36,480
going to

3202
01:56:33,118 --> 01:56:38,399
um immediately flower

3203
01:56:36,479 --> 01:56:41,198
because it's on the same flowering

3204
01:56:38,399 --> 01:56:42,399
schedule as the mother plant that you

3205
01:56:41,198 --> 01:56:44,238
took it from

3206
01:56:42,399 --> 01:56:46,079
now the reason why i bring this up at

3207
01:56:44,238 --> 01:56:50,079
this point is because

3208
01:56:46,079 --> 01:56:51,679
taking clones is a way to

3209
01:56:50,079 --> 01:56:52,719
intentionally

3210
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:55,599
um

3211
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:57,039
i don't know bank genetics while you are

3212
01:56:55,599 --> 01:56:59,520
going through

3213
01:56:57,039 --> 01:57:02,880
the autoflower bree or the the the

3214
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:06,000
photoperiod breeding process but dan

3215
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:07,920
please tell us about how inconvenient it

3216
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,639
is when you're trying to breed

3217
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:13,679
autoflowers that you can't clone it's a

3218
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:15,520
royal pain in the ass

3219
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:17,440
and i'll give you an example i have been

3220
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:18,639
chasing something for probably nine

3221
01:57:17,439 --> 01:57:21,279
years

3222
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:23,118
and i see it out of one line i never get

3223
01:57:21,279 --> 01:57:26,079
a matching parent

3224
01:57:23,118 --> 01:57:27,679
it's either the male or the female

3225
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:30,399
so

3226
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:33,039
not having that clone i can't hold on to

3227
01:57:30,399 --> 01:57:34,879
it until i either find the matching male

3228
01:57:33,039 --> 01:57:37,118
or i find another female that comes up

3229
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:39,520
and i can do a reversal on to kind of

3230
01:57:37,118 --> 01:57:41,759
lock in this specific trait that i'm

3231
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:43,280
looking for it has been elusive to me

3232
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:44,880
for almost a decade now and it's

3233
01:57:43,279 --> 01:57:46,399
frustrating and

3234
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:48,719
i keep trying for it i'm not going to

3235
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:51,118
give up for it um

3236
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:53,198
but it's it makes the process

3237
01:57:51,118 --> 01:57:56,479
complicated and

3238
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:57,759
not having that clone also keep you know

3239
01:57:56,479 --> 01:57:59,839
the

3240
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:02,400
the seed to seed identical

3241
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:04,639
ability is pretty much gone until you

3242
01:58:02,399 --> 01:58:06,879
work all these generations to get the

3243
01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:08,880
homozygous expression to where pretty

3244
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:10,639
much all the seeds look the same

3245
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:12,719
you know with the clone

3246
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:15,199
okay i can back cross i can forward

3247
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:16,719
cross again i can reverse to that

3248
01:58:15,198 --> 01:58:18,238
you know you have so many different

3249
01:58:16,719 --> 01:58:19,520
options whereas in with the autoflower

3250
01:58:18,238 --> 01:58:20,959
world

3251
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:22,480
you don't have the ability to hold on to

3252
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:23,920
that precious clone that you've been

3253
01:58:22,479 --> 01:58:24,879
hunting through and you sifted for to

3254
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:25,760
find

3255
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:28,560
and

3256
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:30,560
it's frustrating but to me i appreciate

3257
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:32,239
the challenge you know it makes me work

3258
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:33,599
harder to get to the ending result that

3259
01:58:32,238 --> 01:58:35,598
i want

3260
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:37,760
right on i like that you uh gave it that

3261
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:39,279
nice spin at the end there

3262
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:40,560
so it doesn't just seem to be like a

3263
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:41,599
[ __ ] only

3264
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:42,960
no it's not a [ __ ] only it's

3265
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:45,279
frustrating as hell i mean that's that's

3266
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:47,359
the straight and you know narrow of it

3267
01:58:45,279 --> 01:58:48,880
but i also like to turn that into the

3268
01:58:47,359 --> 01:58:50,319
motivation keeps me driving keeps me

3269
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:52,800
doing what i'm doing because i know

3270
01:58:50,319 --> 01:58:54,559
eventually it'll show up but makes you

3271
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:57,199
want to work for it it's probably one of

3272
01:58:54,560 --> 01:59:00,239
the reasons why there's so many phenos

3273
01:58:57,198 --> 01:59:02,879
in autoflower seeds still too because

3274
01:59:00,238 --> 01:59:05,839
isolating these phenos without the

3275
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,960
ability to clone is is so much more

3276
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:09,119
difficult

3277
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:11,039
it is and that's something as simple as

3278
01:59:09,118 --> 01:59:13,359
doing like an s1 what a lot of guys do

3279
01:59:11,039 --> 01:59:15,039
it's like they found this amazing

3280
01:59:13,359 --> 01:59:17,839
female through a sift

3281
01:59:15,039 --> 01:59:19,439
and they clone her out you know they got

3282
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:22,000
a bunch of seeds they take clones at the

3283
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:23,759
mature at a mature state label them all

3284
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,118
and then flower out all these other ones

3285
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:27,280
and then okay we can chuck these other

3286
01:59:25,118 --> 01:59:28,559
five or six but we like these two

3287
01:59:27,279 --> 01:59:31,279
and you know i just don't have the

3288
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:33,440
ability to do that and you know the

3289
01:59:31,279 --> 01:59:35,039
ability to have that sitting

3290
01:59:33,439 --> 01:59:36,399
around and like okay now i really want

3291
01:59:35,039 --> 01:59:38,479
to lock it in and i want to get seeds

3292
01:59:36,399 --> 01:59:40,000
out to the public i could turn around

3293
01:59:38,479 --> 01:59:42,559
take a clone from one of the other

3294
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:45,760
clones flower it out reverse it and then

3295
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:47,520
pollinate that same mother locking in

3296
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:49,280
that trait trying to make those seeds a

3297
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:50,400
prime example of what that clone only

3298
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:51,920
would be

3299
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:54,238
yeah there you go

3300
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:56,639
so anyway so that brings us to the end

3301
01:59:54,238 --> 01:59:59,279
dan of all of the things that we dislike

3302
01:59:56,639 --> 02:00:01,760
about autoflowers uh thank you so much

3303

then going through them with me today to

3311
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:21,119
you know so that we can we can air them

3312
02:00:19,198 --> 02:00:22,960
out publicly so people can be aware of

3313
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:25,279
them and and also the ones that we've

3314
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:26,719
got some kinds of fixes for i'm glad

3315
02:00:25,279 --> 02:00:29,198
that we were able to provide those as

3316
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:32,000
well and we all know that as auto

3317
02:00:29,198 --> 02:00:35,279
flowers evolve um we're gonna see more

3318
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:37,039
and more of these uh unsavory attributes

3319
02:00:35,279 --> 02:00:38,158
get under our control so thanks so much

3320
02:00:37,039 --> 02:00:39,679

3323
02:00:41,359 --> 02:00:44,719
and create this list and help build this

3324
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:46,880
show so we could get like

3325
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:48,880
proper representation of like yeah we're

3326
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:50,639
frustrated but here's some fixes and

3327
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:52,400
this is what we do and how we handle

3328
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:53,840
those fixes and i think it's a very

3329
02:00:52,399 --> 02:00:55,039
valuable tool and some information for

3330

3331
02:00:55,039 --> 02:00:59,840
started or who have been growing them

3332
02:00:57,439 --> 02:01:01,678

3333
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:03,679
