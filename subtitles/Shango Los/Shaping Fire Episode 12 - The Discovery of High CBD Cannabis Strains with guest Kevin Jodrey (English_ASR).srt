2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,558
oral history has been important to

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,280
humans forever speaking our histories to

4
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,279
each other is how we learn about nature

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,919
each other and where we all come from

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,038
it's an essential part of being human

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:21,000
and passing our history on to the next

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,640
Generation now in the internet age oral

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,679
history takes place less around a

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
campfire and instead happens more often

11
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:28,640
with the aid of Technology on today's

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,720
episode we're going to take part in that

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,239
oral tradition and share sh the story of

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,839
how high CBD strains began in America

15
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,439
like lightning striking twice in the

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,840
same place in the early 2000s one line

17
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:43,439
of genetics bred by legendary cannabis

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,879
breeder Lawrence Ringo was showing High

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,000
percentages of

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,198
canabal at the same time a strain

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,759
startled Everybody by testing high in

22
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:55,558
CBD at the spannabis competition in

23
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:57,759
Spain these two sets of genetics soon

24
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,558
came together in Northern California and

25
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,439
American CBD was born

26
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,399

every part of the world to meet with

47
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,200
Kevin and share genetics techniques and

48
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,118
stories Kevin was also a close friend of

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
Lawrence Ringo and was present to see

50
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,239
CBD arise in America firsthand and help

51
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:54,478
it along today Kevin's going to tell us

52
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,280
about those first two years of CBD and

53
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,478
how these early cultiv ours made their

54
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,799
way into the hands of breeders Growers

55
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,879
and patients throughout the country

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,159
you are listening to shaping fire and I

57
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,199
am your host Shango Los welcome to the

58
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,800
show Kevin Hey pleasure to have me on

59
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,199
the show Shango yeah so glad you could

60
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,239
make the time so you know let's like get

61
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,958
right into it right because you know

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,719
I've heard you tell parts of this story

63
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,920
before and I'm really excited to you

64
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:21,959
know hear it for myself but but also to

65
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,280
share it with the audience so the the

66
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,360
small part of the story that I know is

67
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,159
that you know CBD uh coming to the

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,560
United States or or starting to be

69
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,400
focused on there in Northern California

70
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,400
was kind of happening two ways at the

71
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,280
same time your your friend uh Lawrence

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,280
Ringo was starting to find CBD and some

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,360
of the lines he was breeding but then at

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,439
the same time there was um there were

75
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,440
these seeds that came from spannabis uh

76
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,318
through pure analytics and so so there

77
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,919
were some seeds coming from Europe as

78
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:56,000
well so take us back to those early days

79
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,479
and explain how you know everything got

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,479
started up there well you you know when

81
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,280
you're talking about CBD if you just go

82
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,759
back to

83
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,799
2007 uh scientists believe that the CBD

84
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,798
had been bred out of cannabis for

85
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,560
psychoactive use and that there was this

86
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,680
belief that there was nothing over you

87
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:18,719
know maybe 2% CBD in existence and

88
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,319
Harborside in 2008 uh funded uh Steep

89
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,840
Hill they created their own laboratory

90
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:26,359
and they detected something called a

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,920
stinky purple which put him at 4% so all

92
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,680
of a sudden they started saying hey wait

93
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,318
a second CBD does exist in the world at

94
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,840
the same time about 208 a guy named uh

95
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:38,438
Wade Wade Lauder created harleyquin and

96
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,200
harleyquinn was basically a one:1 and so

97
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:42,759
he used genetics that he had and he

98
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,359
created one of the first CBD clones and

99
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,840
he released it through Harborside and

100
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,439
they started to put it out in small

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,519
quantities you know released 10 and 20

102
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:53,759
at that same period in time you have two

103
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,280
individuals that are doing breeding and

104
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:59,840
it's it was haime from resin seeds out

105
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,519
in Spain and it's it's Lawrence Ringo in

106
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,239
Northern California so the Spain the

107
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,680
Spain genetic group is we're going to

108
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,640
call that canonic and everything coming

109
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,840
out of Lawrence Ringo was based off of

110
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,839
the Sawa tsunami that he created but

111
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,879
these two individuals completely

112
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,120
unrelated completely unconnected both of

113
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,279
them started to work on lines that were

114
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,918
CBD dominant but neither one of them I

115
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,399
don't think knew it at the time the the

116
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:29,399
The Cutting that they worked on in Spain

117
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,478
came up at spanis with the 5% number and

118
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,439
it became became very attractive there

119
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:35,359
was a doctor named William Courtney

120
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,319
another doctor out of Luxembourg and

121
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,038
haime from resin seeds all got together

122
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,279
and said hey if we could bring these

123
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:43,120
seeds into Northern California we could

124
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,159
work a breeding project and try to see

125
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,800
if we can pull out some really high CBD

126
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,320
with no THC because at that time that

127
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,840
was believed to be a loophole in terms

128
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,599
of cannabis production if we could get

129
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,119
below the the THC numbers that that are

130
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,680
mandated by the DEA individuals could

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,439
then produce this almost as if it was

132
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,918
hemp and So Courtney was determined to

133
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,600
find these these numbers he believed

134
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:07,120
that CBD was one of the missing

135
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,160
components in individual's health so he

136
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,600
driving it from a medical Direction

137
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,600
working with haime from resin seeds they

138
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,320
bring the varietals over to Northern

139
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,919
California and they bring them over to a

140
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:20,079
guy Nam Drey Aaron so Drey Aaron's a

141
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,839
friend of mine Drey Aaron takes all the

142
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,800
katonic seed stock and he grows it all

143
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,918
out and he pulls out a bunch of

144
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,759
different fenos but the most famous feno

145
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:32,799
that got pulled out of it is ACDC and so

146
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,000
this 18 to1 incredible phenotype was

147
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,680
pulled out by Drey Aaron and there was

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,800
this huge uh struggle over what to do

149
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,800
with the Clone because they believed

150
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,639
that the Clone had value and and So

151
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,720
Courtney realized what he was working

152
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,079
with and he wanted to benefit from it

153
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,479
which he should because that's not a uh

154
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:52,879
a bad thing he is doing good work he'

155
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:54,719
like to get paid for this work because

156
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,079
he's doing so much research on it but

157
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,919
they were trying to understand how do

158
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:01,399
you get paid off a CBD when at that time

159
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,839
nobody would take CBD pounds you

160
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,439
couldn't even sell CBD to a dispensary

161
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,279
because no one knew what to do with it

162
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,639
if it didn't get you high it had no

163
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:13,519
value there was no understanding of it

164
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,160
but we understood um you know on a on a

165
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,758
on a a human level that the CBD had

166
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,199
incredible value and that once the

167
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,240
patients got a hold of it it would

168
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,400
really start to do something for them

169
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,160
and so Drey

170
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:28,239
Aaron willingly took that ACDC cut and

171
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,880
he gave it to me and at that time I was

172
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,160
the cultivation director for humble

173
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,120
patient Resource Center in Arcada and I

174
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,199
was running this large operation with

175
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,160
this large clone distribution operation

176
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,160
and I took that ACDC cut and we started

177
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,680
to propagate it and put it into the

178
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,240
Public's hands so that was where ACDC

179
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,560
really originated and started making it

180
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,319
into the public and now it's the progen

181
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,839
for if you take a look at Charlotte's

182
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,800
Web if you DNA Charlotte's Web through

183
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:57,318
phos you'll see that the charlott's web

184
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,319
and ACDC are connected so I doubt that

185
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:02,598
that Charlotte's Web is prior to AC DC

186
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,720
so we could say that Charlotte's Web is

187
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:08,598
more than likely a derivative of ACDC so

188
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,960
ACDC really created this massive super

189
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:13,878
CBD ultr low THC phenomenon that we're

190
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:15,560
experiencing and the and the beauty of

191
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,039
the story is that the guy that released

192
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,038
at Drey Aaron he didn't try to to to

193
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,399
hold in his and imagine what this is

194
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,360
worth right now I mean we're talking

195
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,918
about the CBD Empire and this guy

196
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,759
willingly released this on his

197
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:34,000
own um and and through humanitarian uh

198
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,199
desire because he realized that as much

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,120
as he would like to get paid too he

200
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,319
realized that if we would trying to use

201
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,519
money to to dictate the pace of The

202
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,479
Cutting moving into the world it would

203
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,158
completely slow down and actually

204
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,158
probably destroy the progress that was

205
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,439
about to be made and so he made this

206
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:52,519
incredible decision releases ACDC into

207
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:56,439
the market we start to have super high

208
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:57,799
th super high CBD super low uh THC at

209
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:01,240
that exact time that this little

210
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:04,720
phenomenon's going on Lawrence Ringo is

211
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,519
working on lines over in uh in Humble

212
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,319
but what he was working on was he had

213
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,639
grabbed and I had to go a cat and talk

214
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,039
to her because I had got this a little

215
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,720
messed up when I was talking to Jerry

216
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,360
Whiting because like I said we all hung

217
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,000
out we worked together but there's so

218
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,680
many little pieces and so I went and got

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,639
it clarified from cat and where where

220
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,000
Ringo really got this going was he went

221
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,759
and got seeds from uh Mark Emory and he

222
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,360
got New York City uh Diesel and Sour

223
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,759
Diesel and he bred them together and it

224
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,919
Formed something called the double

225
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,440
Diesel and so he ran the double diesel

226
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,679
for a while and at some point he picked

227
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,000
up a clone called the Ferrari cut from

228
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,519
some loggers and he took the Ferrari and

229
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,120
he went back into the double Diesel and

230
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,599
he went back into a saw Diesel and he

231
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,200
rolled it multiple times and he ended up

232
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,959
coming out with something that he called

233
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,519
the Sunami that he really liked Ringo

234
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:52,278
had had a back injury as a child I think

235
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,600
he was like maybe a young teenager and

236
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:55,879
he hurt his back messing with his

237
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,959
friends and so he's always had this back

238
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:01,679
problem and so he was looking for

239
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:03,719
cannabis that allowed him to uh function

240
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,319
and have pain relief but also have you

241
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,000
know some good mental Euphoria so that

242
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,720
you're you know you're uplifted and he

243
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,360
bred himself something that was really

244
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,680
solid for him as a varietal and about

245
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,000
that same time all this is occurring you

246
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,799
know Steep Hill popped out into 207

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,958
about the same time Samantha Miller from

248
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:23,599
Pure analytics popped out her lab and

249
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,199
Samantha Miller and Ringo hook up and

250
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,959
which was an incredible Union because

251
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,278
when they when they teamed up the the

252
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,239
work that occurred from that point

253
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:33,759
forward was just ungod ly in CBD

254
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,759
breeding but Samantha and Jason the the

255
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:39,159
team from Pure analytics hooked up with

256
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:42,120
Ringo and they tested his sour tsunami

257
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:43,838
and it came out at 11% CBD and I think

258
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,839
he had seven yeah it was high at that

259
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,760
moment and he had about seven or eight

260
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,360
other varieties at that same time that

261
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,838
were also CBD Dom and so that was you

262
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,079
know like I said you're you're you're in

263
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:59,480
the 207 208 time by the time we get to

264
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:02,199
201 so 3 years after this introduction

265
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,800
Ringo releases the first truly

266
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,440
stabilized line and when someone defines

267
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,919
stabilized line in in plant breeding or

268
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,320
in plant terms that means four

269
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:13,319
phenotypical distributions so every time

270
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,440
I breed it I'm going to get four very

271
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,640
specific phenotypes out of it

272
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,360
consistently and so when when Ringo was

273
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:23,039
able to create a one in4 CBD dominant

274
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,519
line he created the first CBD

275
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:30,439
reproducible line which was his sour Sue

276
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,799
line and so Ringo was taken his his

277
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,720
tsunami line and he started laying it

278
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,919
into everything that he could find that

279
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,639
was CBD dominant and of the variety to

280
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,240
increase tur profiles and he was working

281
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,399
with Samantha Miller and what Samantha

282
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,639
Miller had pioneered was predicate of

283
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,240
testing and so Samantha Miller was the

284
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,680
first lab where you could go and find

285
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,399
out your cannaboid levels of the plant

286
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:57,239
in vegetative form and it allowed i i i

287
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,679
and Ringo were friends but I went after

288
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,440
CB I went after THC numbers I was After

289
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:05,439
High wreck numbers he was After High CBD

290
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,160
numbers so we use predictive testing to

291
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,800
go after different directions in our

292
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:13,199
breeding directions and I used it to

293
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:15,278
find exceptionally high THC ratio

294
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,480
exceptionally high THC overall level

295
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,720
males and Ringo was looking for these

296
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,720
opposites exceptionally High CBD da

297
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,839
males and so Samantha Mela through her

298
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,560
predicate of work allowed this process

299
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,000
to suddenly speed up and it went from

300
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:35,679
having two varieties that were over you

301
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,078
know 15 16% CBD to the next year having

302
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,319
over

303
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:42,919
80 so you know you were you're talking a

304
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,920
breeding uh speed that was just

305
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:48,958
unbelievable and so the the the the idea

306
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:50,879
that CBD no longer existed to have you

307
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,958
know now we have thousands of CBD

308
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,519
dominant varieties in in less than eight

309
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:58,638
years man that's such a fast rise once

310
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,959
it got kicked in so from a from a from a

311
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:05,039
botney point point of view was was THC

312
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:07,199
and high levels of CBD in in the

313
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,360
naturally occurring land races and then

314
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,600
guys like you who were breeding for THC

315
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,399
were intentionally breeding out the CBD

316
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,519
so that um you know the THC was more

317
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:22,198
dominant or um was was CBD just not in

318
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,639
any real significance in the material

319
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:28,120
you were working with at all and so

320
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,039
getting these these genetics uh created

321
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:34,198
like this infusion of CBD into your

322
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:36,759
breeding lines well the the thing with

323
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:39,078
the thing with CBD is from my own my own

324
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:42,559
hunting through Gene lines is what I

325
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:45,198
found is that CBD really exists in

326
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,518
Pakistan and portions of like you know

327
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:48,679
maybe say Southern

328
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,440
Afghanistan and when you go through

329
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:52,599
those Gene lines is where you start to

330
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,320
see incredible CBD populations and and

331
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,600
so I always theorize that the people who

332
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,600
lived along equatorial to 20 on the

333
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,920
equator all those cerebral lines they

334
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,600
didn't need CBD we which what I I call

335
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,399
it you know medicine they needed

336
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,159
cerebral up uplifting because they were

337
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,159
living in a beautiful area but when you

338
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,000
liveing between the 20 and the 30 on the

339
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:12,759
parallel you're in some of the most

340
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,480
intense climate on Earth and those

341
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,958
people are typically the hash producing

342
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,278
regions desert regions and that's where

343
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,000
you see the CBD genetics because You'

344
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,639
say that those individuals choose

345
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,839
cannabis that makes them feel good for

346
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,440
their situation and so for us in the

347
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,480
United States we have all these Gene

348
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,920
pools that come into the us we work with

349
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,320
predominantly you see um all THC

350
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,399
modeling but whenever we started to tap

351
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,480
into anything that had Pakistani Gene

352
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:42,440
lines is where we started to see the CBD

353
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,120
components come out but CBD reduces the

354
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,959
ability for THC to really lift you so

355
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,639
for high CBD in a recreational line it's

356
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:53,838
the absolute worst thing you can have so

357
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,278
we were trying to drive CBD levels down

358
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,880
through perception because we didn't

359
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,838
have the lab at first to prove it but

360
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,799
once we started to really get into the

361
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,000
labs being able to analyze and figure

362
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:06,078
out we started to see that within the

363
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,440
entire population of cannabis very

364
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,239
specific populations with CBD dominant

365
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,800
and that was based off of the

366
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,959
cultivators who were growing the strains

367
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:17,399
to suit the needs of the population and

368
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,039
so individuals historically have always

369
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,198
cultivated cannabis to suit their needs

370
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,958
so when we started to really look at the

371
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,399
gene lines we realized it wasn't

372
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,599
distributed it was cultivated

373
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,958
specifically so what was the Genesis of

374
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,480
the lines that came from from Europe I

375
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,599
think you said that you were referring

376
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,959
it to as the the the canonic as the

377
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:43,079
Cornerstone but what what happened in

378
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:46,879
Europe that that you know suddenly the

379
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:48,399
these these lines were seen at spannabis

380
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,958
and then they found their way to

381
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,519
Northern California I mean who's doing

382
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:55,239
that work over there well it wasn't it

383
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,360
wasn't on purpose that's the irony no it

384
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,759
wasn't it was a it was they he did a a

385
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,278
G13 Haze hybrid

386
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,240
so they did a G13 Haze which is too very

387
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:06,600
uh it's a it's that's a true F1 you have

388
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,120
you have an extreme dissimilar genetic

389
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,440
material put together and in that

390
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,720
population you started to have a high

391
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,079
CBD so when haime haime from resin seeds

392
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,079
came over to NorCal with with Courtney

393
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:21,078
and we all hung out for a couple months

394
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:23,319
and and haime was trying to use that

395
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:25,479
mail that he had to tap into all these

396
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,160
other genetics to try to see if he could

397
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,560
put CBD in it but it was hella funny

398
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,838
because at that time

399
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,000
nobody wanted to touch CBD at all

400
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,639
because there was no market for it I

401
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,440
mean

402
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,879
none right so so people weren't knowing

403
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,000
how to use it yet so he was he was you

404
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:46,399
know not only um you know very helpful

405
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,198
but he was also Visionary seeing that

406
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,039
you know what we're ahead of the curve

407
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:52,639
on this once we start educating patients

408
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,519
they're going to be all over clamoring

409
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,278
for it well yeah I don't I would I don't

410
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,078
I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily say I

411
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,720
mean he was a H's a bright guy but I

412
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:02,679
don't know if he was Visionary as much

413
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,600
because Visionary would say he he

414
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:06,318
believed CBD was valuable and he went

415
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,399
and created it where he went and said

416
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:11,759
listen um let's go chase a direction he

417
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,198
more he really had a cutting that he

418
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,839
entered into a competition and it came

419
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:18,919
out with these numbers and they said

420
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,480
holy [ __ ] we didn't realize the line had

421
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:22,958
this potential and remember everything

422
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,879
we're talking about is because

423
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,318
Laboratories exist from this minute

424
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,439
forward so if Laboratories weren't in

425
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:31,120
the in this in this conversation

426
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,279
none of us have a clue what we were

427
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,240
looking at so are you are you saying

428
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:39,879
that that when he entered um the G13 Haz

429
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,360
into spannabis he did not know about the

430
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:45,278
high CBD levels but it was when it was

431
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,879
tested as part of the competition that

432
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,360
he got these results and everybody was

433
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:52,318
blown away Bingo oh my gosh what a lucky

434
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,079
break well look at look at look at

435
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:56,519
Lawrence I mean Lawrence wasn't breeding

436
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:59,599
for CBD in terms of per se like hey I am

437
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,799
breeding for CBD I mean she we we barely

438
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,920
knew about the damn cannaboids eight 10

439
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,279
years ago I mean really really we really

440
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,959
we are we were so ignorant 10 years ago

441
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:11,519
it's mindbending and we just knew what

442
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,839
we liked and so Lawrence knew that this

443
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,038
cannabis made his back feel good and I

444
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,918
remember when we were sitting at the

445
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,558
table in the shop me Samantha and

446
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,600
Lawrence and he was just like godamn I

447
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:24,160
can't believe I have such high CBD alals

448
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:26,240
in my lines by fact that I chose it

449
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,360
because it made me feel

450
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,839
good so when when haime brought

451
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:35,639
uh brought the strains over had he made

452
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:38,199
um seeds from his cut and he brought the

453
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,038
seeds or did he actually bring his own

454
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,919
cut both he brought the male cutting and

455
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,679
he brought seed

456
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,240
stock wow so did did he just bring one

457
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,000
cut or did he bring like a handful of

458
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,759
cuts in case you know it didn't make one

459
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,240
of them didn't make the trip well he

460
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,879
just brought the male well he brought he

461
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,038
brought plants but it was just the male

462
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,880
the only the only plant that came over

463
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:00,839
as a plant form was the male that he had

464
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,240
but everything else came as seed stock

465
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:04,558
because the problem with this is

466
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,319
remember it's a true F1 and so you're

467
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:12,599
going to see incredible population uh

468
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:16,879
dis dissimilarity and what we saw was uh

469
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:19,959
CBD from 20 to THC 0 to the exact

470
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,360
opposite thc2 CBD

471
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,200
0 so you know the katonic line was all

472
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,719
over the place you had to go through

473
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,679
this massive line to find anything that

474
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,640
made sense that's why I see C BD was so

475
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,480
difficult was that they they didn't have

476
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,480
the ability to find the males that

477
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,240
carried the high CBD Al and so you

478
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,079
couldn't you couldn't stabilize the

479
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,079
trait until the laboratory really

480
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,359
started to give us that ability and then

481
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,319
once they had the ability to start

482
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,639
driving the direction they could get

483
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:49,918
more of a consistency one in four is

484
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,720
where we were trying to go but the

485
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,280
canonic is still a train wreck if you

486
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,640
breed into it you know it's it's all

487
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,639
over the place and you have a lot of the

488
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,200
phenotypes are basically commercial hemp

489
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,159
hay coming out of the hay line has some

490
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,798
of the worst quality tur profile you

491
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:05,720
could Envision and it makes it great for

492
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:07,119
just a super you know an extraction

493
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,000
where you're going to add a turp or add

494
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:12,119
it to food but for people who want to

495
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,919
consume it as a product you know it it a

496
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,359
lot of it is you know the quality of the

497
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,759
experience and that's where some of the

498
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,038
canonic lacked and that's where Lawrence

499
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,319
was able to kind of come in and develop

500
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,200
stuff like the Swiss tsunami where he

501
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:28,119
had these beautiful orange Mandarin tpin

502
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,400
in a 15 to one and so you got to

503
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:33,359
remember that that extraction and the

504
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,280
labs all kind of touch CBD where they

505
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:38,759
all begin at the exact same time and so

506
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:41,079
extraction is really new and so people

507
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,599
weren't extracting CBD years ago they

508
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,960
were smoking it as flour and so what we

509
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,678
were doing is we were chasing through

510
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,519
CBD lines to find CBD lines that had the

511
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,640
right ratio the right total but also the

512
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,079
right tur profile that was palatable

513
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,600
because on a lot of these hemp combos

514
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,158
they just taste like [ __ ] and nobody

515
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,678
wants to smoke it right on so let's

516
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,440
let's go to our first break and when we

517
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,880
come back we'll talk more about um how

518
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,360
you guys turned through um all of the

519
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,120
seeds that you were getting to to find

520
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,759
the stuff that you wanted to work with

521
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:14,038
um you are listening to shaping fire and

522
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,480
my guest today is Kevin jrey founder of

523
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:17,679
Wonderland

524
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,200
nurser now that the health benefits of

525
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,320
tpin have become well known in the

526
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,400
Cannabis industry people everywhere are

527
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:25,639
looking for the purest tpin without

528
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,360
adulterant the problem with most tpping

529
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,038
providers is that they're not sourced

530
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,279
naturally and instead are made as a

531
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:34,038
byproduct of refining petroleum and

532
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:36,200
that's so sketchy the tpin sold by true

533
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:39,519
tpin are entirely different they are

534
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,000
certified organic non-GMO and food grade

535
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,558
that means that they are extracted from

536
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,919
real plant sources there are no solvents

537
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:49,158
of any kind they are distilled only with

538
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,280
steam that's right only steam in fact

539
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:53,480
turpins from True Turpin are so pure

540
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,119
that you can eat them not only that but

541
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,679
you can stack them with better results

542
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:00,279
too what I mean is other companies

543
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,038
turpins have got a few per of impurities

544
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:04,279
and when you stack those tpin to make

545
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,038
your blend you're adding a variety of

546
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:08,720
impurities that degrade your final

547
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:10,599
product true turpins also have strain

548
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,720

00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:15,399

welcome back you are listening to

573
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:10,599
shaping fire I'm your host Shango Los

574
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:13,038
and our guest this week is Kevin chadre

575
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,798
founder of Wonderland Nursery so before

576
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:18,079
the break Kevin we were talking about

577
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:20,440
how um uh both haime bringing genetics

578
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,759
CBD genetics from Europe and also there

579
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,640
in Northern California Lawrence Ringo

580
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:28,079
had both found CBD in the lines that

581
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,000
they were breeding very possibly because

582
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,879
of the Advent of all of this new CBD

583
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,759
testing and the arrival of the first

584
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:40,760
cannabis Labs so so once these um these

585
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:43,919
original CBD strains found themselves

586
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:46,359
into your hands what did you all do to

587
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,679
to churn through all of the possibility

588
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:51,319
of the genetics to find what you wanted

589
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:54,480
to make the the the spine of the lines

590
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:57,079
you guys were working on well I I was

591
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,400
running a dispensary at that moment and

592
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:01,359
if you go back you know eight8 years ago

593
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,519
everything was still kind of you know uh

594
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,759
risky now we're in legal land things are

595
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,798
a lot different but then things were

596
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,240
risky and

597
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:09,879
so what we were doing at that dispensary

598
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,839
was we were banking a lot of the

599
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,799
genetics for these operations where we

600
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:18,278
would hold copies of stuff so that there

601
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:20,158
was duplicate copies and then the the

602
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:21,759
relationship between William Courtney

603
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,960
and the and the dispensary was really

604
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:27,079
pretty good and so William Courtney had

605
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,759
had had uh communicated uh at the same

606
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:31,639
time we did the CBD we also did all the

607
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:33,519
juicing trials and so William Courtney

608
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,960
and the dispensary was pretty connected

609
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,519
and it it was a good relationship in the

610
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,400
sense that we were trying to understand

611
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,359
what the value of the CBD stuff was

612
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,440
because you got to remember there was

613
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:45,199
nobody nobody knew anything about this

614
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,798
and so I said I can dedicate x amount of

615
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,000
space to this in my shop so we can start

616
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,400
to hold and do the sifting and and it

617
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,960
was really just cracking seeds growing

618
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,519
them out and doing and doing the test on

619
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,919
them to find which one of these

620
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,960
varieties actually had marketable

621
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,480
qualities there was another there was

622
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,840
when the sift was done there was another

623
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,440
plan and it's out there I lost it myself

624
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:10,519
but there was a there was another

625
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:13,278
progyny called C6 and the C6 was katonic

626
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:14,879
6 I don't remember the exact number of

627
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,839
ACDC it might have been like you know

628
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,600
katonic 52 but katonic 6 was the exact

629
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:23,158
same numbers as ACDC it was an 18 to1

630
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:25,798
but it was probably like you know 20

631
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:29,000
times the production level it was this

632
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:31,119
massive cactus of a plant same thing

633
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,319
tremendously terrible tur profiles but

634
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,639
Supernatural production and we would use

635
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,918
the dispensary to churn through and sift

636
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,520
through and then once once we figured

637
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:42,880
out which one of these fenos had the

638
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:44,639
varieties you know the ratios we wanted

639
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,039
we we were able to stabilize on it at

640
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,880
that time we didn't we didn't know what

641
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:51,000
to do with with keeping uh ratios where

642
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,480
what do you what's the desire we kind of

643
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,640
know now like a one: one and a 2: one

644
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,880
and a 10: one and a 20 to one kind of

645
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,520
give you some some really good coverage

646
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,399
where you don't have to have 300

647
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:06,119
different CBD strains we can have some

648
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:08,839
basic ratios that give us relatively

649
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:11,119
changing amounts of THC and the two to

650
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:13,319
On's and the one: ones are giving us

651
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,839
enough THC so that the individual has

652
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:17,119
efficacy in that direction and with the

653
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,720
others we can work and so it was just it

654
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,359
was trying to understand at that time

655
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,360
did we need to have I mean Christ we

656
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:25,759
were trying to hold you know 50 60 70

657
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:28,599
copies of it meaning a 1:1 a 1.5 to1 a

658
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,919
one 2.1 2.5 to1 because we we didn't

659
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:33,359
know where the values were and so what

660
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:34,840
we knew was the ACDC and the C6 had by

661
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,839
far the greatest you know the

662
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:39,759
concentrations where they were 18 plus

663
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,759
but uh at the same time you know we

664
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,079
didn't we didn't know what to do with

665
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:43,319
them but once we started to release them

666
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,278
and they started to go into the med

667
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:47,519
situation it started to really uh pop

668
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:49,480
out what we started to do too was we

669
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,480
started to have people come in and

670
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,319
access all these CBD lines that we were

671
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,599
given out from the dispensary and you

672
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,240
started to see all these people breeding

673
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:02,079
the CBD lines into their existing lines

674
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,679
meaning we were giving them ACDC Cuts C6

675
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:07,798
Cuts Harley Quinn Cuts Lawrence had

676
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:10,038
provided the Swiss Sue he had given me

677
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:11,960
uh if I want to say like a maybe a

678
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:13,798
Harley suit a harleyquin tsunami that he

679
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,319
had done and we were we were providing

680
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:17,398
those to people all over the place you

681
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:19,558
know say eight years ago the beginning

682
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:21,719
of the the CBD to get it out into the

683
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:23,918
market and and that's really where you

684
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,919
see all these hybrids today that are

685
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,880
coming it was that push from that time

686
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,200
period so it was really pretty neat to

687
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,000
be able to sift through this stock and

688
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,360
pull out phenotypes it's just that you

689
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,240
know the irony of it is is that we just

690
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,278
didn't nowadays if we could repeat it if

691
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,159
we could repeat the process right now

692
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:42,000
where we had a lot better understanding

693
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,880
of what it was we were trying to hunt

694
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,278
and look for it'd be a lot more

695
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,760
effective you know you you do the best

696
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:49,960
you can with the knowledge you have at

697
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,079
the time but boy this was the beginning

698
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,919
of the whole CBD phenomenon and and we

699
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,439
really were just trying to understand

700
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,919
you know what do you do with it what

701
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,038
what works what levels it was it was so

702
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,919
new

703
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,759
that I'm sure we made plenty of mistakes

704
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,320
in the process and I I wish I could go

705
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,079
back and do it twice but hey you got

706
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,480
what you got yeah totally and you know

707
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,759
one thing that I think is important to

708
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:14,599
point out is now a second time the

709
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:17,278
importance of um the new cannabis Labs

710
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:19,199
right because you know even recognizing

711
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,960
uh that there was CBD in the cuts you

712
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,159
know instead of having to just you know

713
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,159
uh to them and and and figure out how it

714
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,760
made your body feel well you were

715
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,200
testing for the CBD and so you knew it

716
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,919
was there but now the predictive

717
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,120
breeding you were able to do where you

718
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,159
know you just had to crack a seed and

719
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:38,239
then in a few weeks you could test the

720
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,200
leaf and you didn't have to run it all

721
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,399
the way through flour I mean the amount

722
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,360
of time that you saved sifting through

723
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:47,000
these seeds is just

724
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:48,678
Monumental oh yeah yes it's unreal I I

725
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,319
still do it constantly now but there was

726
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:54,640
there's no way you can drive a project

727
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:57,000
that's cannaboid based accurately

728
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,159
through feel I mean and and I I've been

729
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,319
I've been growing for 38 years which

730
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,000
which isn't the longest grower I know

731
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:06,240
but man that's a long time and and I

732
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,519
still have to use lab tests to really

733
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,519
understand what it is that's affecting

734
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:13,159
me because when you change the ratios or

735
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:14,759
you shift the the minors it changes the

736
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,760
effect in perception and all of a sudden

737
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,200
you really don't know what you're

738
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:21,079
looking at and so the lab let us have

739
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,000
some true accuracy and if we had had you

740
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:26,759
know phos technology then it would have

741
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,519
allowed us to understand what made up

742
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:30,319
the plant we were looking at so that we

743
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:32,440
could really have said hey wait a second

744
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:35,079
go go to Chase Pakistan genetics I mean

745
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,519
if I want CBD I go after Pakistani

746
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:40,319
genetics specifically I don't even waste

747
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,480
my time looking anywhere else because I

748
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,678
know that the Pakistani lines the real

749
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,038
Pakistani lines from Pakistan that I get

750
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,600
shipped in from the trra valley those

751
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,480
things are so CBD Rich it's not funny

752
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,759
and so you know nowadays we know where

753
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,960
to look to find the populations it's

754
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,440
just you know trying to access it but

755
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,798
man if we had had you know phos working

756
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,240
in conjunction with pure analytics we

757
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:05,200
wouldn't been able to figure out how to

758
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,880
get the numbers high and then where the

759
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,519
lines existed from that contained those

760
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,000
genes and we would have been able to get

761
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,798
out of all the the the muddling covering

762
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,798
genetic form that was in the in the way

763
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:19,200
of the CBD Direction it's the same when

764
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:21,079
we're running you know high THC lines

765
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,080
I'm trying to get rid of stock that's

766
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:26,879
going to slow down that ability for the

767
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:29,158
THC to stack up I can only have so many

768
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,320
molecules in the basket

769
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:34,159
and you know maybe 30 35% total

770
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:37,960
everything may you know and if we add

771
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:40,440
TPS maybe 40 with turps complete and so

772
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,840
if that's the total that can be present

773
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,278
I'm trying on a on a on a THC level to

774
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:47,000
get rid of all my CBD but on on the

775
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:49,839
conversation we're having we're trying

776
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,919
to get rid of all the THC in those forms

777
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:55,319
and in those in specific genealogical

778
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,278
locations and lines you can do it and so

779
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:58,918
the laboratory right now is just blowing

780
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,159
my mind on how I'm able to see the

781
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,399
picture so I'm taking varieties that I

782
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:04,919
used to look at and I could DNA them and

783
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:06,518
I could say oh I got you this is

784
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,840
connected to this so maybe we should

785
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,240
Chase something over here right on that

786
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:13,278
makes sense so so let me ask you about

787
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,000
the um the the strains that you're the

788
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,359
seeds that you were pulling from

789
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,558
Pakistan because you knew they were CBD

790
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:23,079
Rich you know we talk a lot on this show

791
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:25,599
about how often uh genetics from you

792
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:28,319
know the US and Europe find their way

793
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:31,000
into these small communities because

794
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,960
they want to trade you know our new

795
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,960
school hybridized genetics locally and

796
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,000
we want to get their land races and

797
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,038
what's happening is that you know uh

798
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,480
some of our genetics are finding their

799
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:46,158
ways to you know Pakistan or Jamaica or

800
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,679
India or wherever and um and they um

801
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,278
they're corrupting the local land race

802
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:55,080
genetics so you know the people that

803
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:58,159
that you know who continue to go to

804
00:30:55,079 --> 00:31:00,278
Pakistan to try to find more of this

805
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,720
original land races to work with are

806
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:06,000
they finding that that that the CBD

807
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,960
aspect of it is becoming corrupted yet

808
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,679
well no because you're the the

809
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,519
difference between you know Pakistan and

810
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:15,519
Afghanistan and a lot of places is that

811
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,638
I mean very little Europeans are hanging

812
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,000
out over there for the last 10 15 years

813
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:21,678
and very little Americans are hanging

814
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,759
out over there so those are places where

815
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,679
you know they're really difficult to get

816
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,480
stock in and out and a lot of the stock

817
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,919
is being replaced by opium and so

818
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,159
they're Los in land race due to Opium

819
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:36,278
it's places like South America Central

820
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:38,159
America Africa those places are where

821
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:40,519
the you know the Euro and the and the

822
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,039
North American genetics are infiltrating

823
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:44,159
and and people don't understand what

824
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:46,278
land race means and land race means

825
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,080
non-cultivated it means that the plants

826
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:51,599
the plants seated and grew themselves

827
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:53,638
for time and because of that it contains

828
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,959
genetic information that says hey in

829
00:31:53,638 --> 00:31:58,719
this plant is the genes that said

830
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:02,360
survive during drought surv during a

831
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,880
flood handle pestilence handle uh uh

832
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:06,719
poor conditions and all those survival

833
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,159
genes exist and live within the gene

834
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,200
pool and what we do is we go into a land

835
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,278
race line and we do something called a

836
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,200
cultivated variety a cultivar and we

837
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,798
pull something out of it that we like

838
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,120
specifically and we monocrop it and the

839
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:21,879
problem is is that we don't have any

840
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,759
more of these land race populations to

841
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,720
look through so it's really similar like

842
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,879
when you're chopping the rainforest down

843
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,558
you've removed a lot of the genetic

844
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,960
material to work with and you can't

845
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:35,158
replace it and so for us right now it's

846
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,960
why I'm so so caught up with the genetic

847
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,639
stuff with phos is that it's allowing me

848
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,079
to relook at everything I'm touching to

849
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:42,918
see what am I really looking at so that

850
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:44,480
it makes it makes it you know worth your

851
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,559
time to sift through if you're trying to

852
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,360
find specific directions on your breed

853
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,839
lines and for people that are working

854
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:52,719
CBD or you know THC this is you know

855
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:55,199
incredibly important you know that's

856
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,079
interesting because to a certain degree

857
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,120
the the violence in those regions is

858
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:03,480
kind of protecting what is left of the

859
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:05,199
CBD stock there naturally that well yeah

860
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,679
a lot of the Cannabis is being pushed

861
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,159
out by poppies um but since there's not

862
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,278
a lot of Western folks showing up there

863
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:15,760
for the time being there's you know it's

864
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,759
probably like a natural Archive of CBD

865
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:19,759
strains oh guarantee because you got to

866
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,240
remember the the the people who live

867
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,278
there that traffic just like me I'm from

868
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:27,839
Humble County so I'm a I'm a trafficker

869
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:30,759
right but I'm a cannabis consumer and so

870
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,119
my whole my whole existence began as a

871
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:35,839
consumer like I assume most Pakistani

872
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,599
and Afghani people and so to them you

873
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,240
know they're growing and smoking what's

874
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,119
what's what's making them feel good and

875
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,599
if I'm living in in a in an environment

876
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:46,759
like Pakistan and I don't mean Society I

877
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:50,158
mean environmentally where Pakistan hits

878
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:52,480
like 135 degrees I mean you got like

879
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,840
Extremes in Pakistan that is so unreal

880
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,200
it might be some of the worst weather on

881
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,519
Earth I mean dry and hot and cold and

882
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,919
holy Christ so I I think that the people

883
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,200
there are still cultivating their

884
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,919
outdoor strains to suit the desires and

885
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,480
needs it's just that you know we don't

886
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,000
have an ability to go into these little

887
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,760
Villages and meet locals and say hey

888
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,039
your family's been growing for the last

889
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,760
200 years in this little Bowl here can I

890
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:15,079
access some of your Gene lines and if we

891
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,919
took it home it would have been some

892
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:18,280
really fiery stuff but I guarantee it

893
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,719
would have been some higher CBD

894
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,760
populations than anywhere else in the

895
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:24,158
world yeah right on that makes sense

896
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,800
well before we get into how uh these

897
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,358
these strains started finding their

898
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,159
their way into people's hands let's take

899
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:30,960
another short break you're listening to

900
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,559
shaping fire and my guest today is Kevin

903
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,918
attention to cannabis medicine it has

904
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,199
become incredibly apparent that full

905
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,519
extract cannabis oil known to some as

906
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:47,158
Rick Simpson Oil is the Cornerstone of

907
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:49,119
healing humans with medical marijuana if

908
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,039
you own a medical dispensary or retail

909
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,000
store you know that your customers are

910
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:55,559
asking for it every single day and if

911
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,199
you have been working with patients and

912
00:34:55,559 --> 00:35:00,320
seeking out quality full extract oil in

913
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:03,239
the Pacific Northwest you know the

914
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,680
provider deep green cat Jeter and her

915
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:07,959
team at Deep green have been making full

916
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:10,078
extract cannabis oil and setting the

917
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,720
standards for quality and exact dosing

918
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,880
for years in Washington state the Deep

919
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,319
green brand is known by patients and

920
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,599

patients and others in need at a time

923
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,838
when there are no national standards for

924
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:30,079
cannabis oil ensuring a product is whole

925
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:32,920
plant quality assured and lab tested is

926
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,599
often a matter of knowing your source is

927
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,079
reputable trust in a quality brand is

928
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,000
essential when choosing a cannabis

929
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,039
medicine that is going to be used

930
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,800
concentrated and in volume by any

931
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,079
patient and especially those with

932
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,359
weakened immune

933
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,599
systems deep green is looking for

cannabis oil to emerging medical and

937
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:57,920

Shango Los and our guest this week is

966
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,838
Kevin jrey founder of Wonderland Nursery

967
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:09,640
so before the break we were talking

968
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:12,078
about you know how the how the CBD

969
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:14,279
strains were put together how you sifted

970
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,560
through all the genetics um with the

971
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,599
help of the the the new cannabis

972
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:21,559
Laboratories you were you were able to

973
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:23,160
really focus your genetic program and

974
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:26,440
you found your you know your

975
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:29,920
cornerstones in the catonic and the ACDC

976
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:32,880
and um the wi from Lawrence so so now

977
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,240
we're to a point that that you have this

978
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,240
stuff and and people are starting to

979
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:41,959
extract the CBD out of it um how did the

980
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:45,199
how did these strains come uh find their

981
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,920
way into people's hands so that the the

982
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:50,799
the the amount of breeders who were

983
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,880
doing citizen science got so much bigger

984
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,200
and and then that the strains found

985
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,039
their way around the

986
00:37:54,199 --> 00:38:01,960
country so you you you get stabilized

987
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:04,519
sour Sue around 211 2012 we start

988
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:09,480
getting all the Clones to really move

989
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:12,679
out I took over another shop at that

990
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,358
time and I realized that the problem we

991
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:17,399
were having with CBD being really put

992
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,400
into the market was that people who were

993
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,480
commercial producers were intelligent

994
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:25,000
enough to understand the value of it but

995
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,920
people who were really medically needy

996
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,838
were really too poor to really afford

997
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,318
medicine it was it was something I

998
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:34,759
started to notice as a dispensary

999
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:37,719
operator where I started to realize that

1000
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,319
the true recipient was too poor to

1001
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,399
receive it and so they weren't going to

1002
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:43,039
be able to really help themselves and

1003
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,800
when you make medicine to give to people

1004
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:47,358
it's usually too expensive to sustain at

1005
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,839
a high level and so with cannabis to me

1006
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,559
so much of it is to be able to self-

1007
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:54,400
cultivate your medicine and so what we

1008
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:56,719
realized was that these these varietals

1009
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,400
needed to be um pushed into the the

1010
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,399
system but they they had to be pushed

1011
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,920
into a system at an affordable rate and

1012
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,318
I couldn't understand really how to

1013
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,720
figure out what affordable was so we

1014
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:08,960
just figured we' do it for free and so

1015
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:12,039
over the last four years you know we

1016
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,358
distributed over about 110,000 CBD

1017
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:18,719
clones and so that's through uh veterans

1018
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:20,279
groups uh any CBD Collective any person

1019
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,318
that could come to the shop could access

1020
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,119
any of the jeans and so over the last

1021
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:27,480
you know four years we've been able to

1022
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,160
fill up and then in and groups from all

1023
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,679
over the United States would send

1024
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:32,318
Representatives who then would get an

1025
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:34,000
official California person who would

1026
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:37,559
come in and get you know with the ID in

1027
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,280
the 215 but it allowed the CBD genetics

1028
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:41,400
to move across the country because they

1029
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,119
were free I didn't I didn't charge any

1030
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,760
money for them is that still the

1031
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:50,240
case we just had to stop in January 1

1032
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,520
because the prop 64 came out and so prop

1033
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,000
64 says no products can be given away

1034
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:58,039
for free so we're trying to figure out

1035
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,159
how we can work the taxes on it but it

1036
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:02,440
it it's just something that I was really

1037
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:03,719
uh I'm a strong believer in that I I'm

1038
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,519
somebody who's been a commercial

1039
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:08,078
cannabis producer most of his life but

1040
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:10,639
when I got into med cannabis I got

1041
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,680
really really struck by how poor people

1042
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,960
who were sick were I I really wasn't

1043
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,480
understanding of that situation I was

1044
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,639
kind of insulated from it I wasn't ill

1045
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,639
um I'm busy working so I don't see a lot

1046
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:23,118
of going on and I realized when I got

1047
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:25,239
into this position you know like N9

1048
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,000
years ago that the need for for

1049
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:28,719
compassion was incredible and then the

1050
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,400
CB BD thing was something that was so

1051
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,759
unbelievable for people who needed it

1052
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,039
for tumor relief inflammatory issues

1053
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,599
cancer relief and I said you know let's

1054
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,199
just make it free and so we were able to

1055
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,440
kick it out but what it did was it

1056
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,039
allowed everyone their brother to get

1057
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,039
the clones and if you were large

1058
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,599
producer we wouldn't give you trays of

1059
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,358
it you we focus primarily on people who

1060
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,160
were getting you know 10 to 20 clones at

1061
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:55,759
a time and it allowed us to just

1062
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:57,960
absolutely saturate the medical base

1063
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,520
with self- producers of their own

1064
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,480
medicine and we allowed a lot of these

1065
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:04,639
people that were doing this to to get

1066
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,440
genetics from Lawrence in seed form now

1067
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:08,000
Lawrence had died he passed away you

1068
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,679
know probably three four years ago but

1069
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,519
when he passed away I received a a huge

1070
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:15,598
collection of his CBD genetics and then

1071
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,559
I took that collection and spread that

1072
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,359
out into the system so that these genes

1073
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:22,318
were all in the world and then people

1074
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:24,838
you know medical elderly they would get

1075
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:26,639
seed packs of CBD from Lawrence and then

1076
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,719
they would get cuting from me that were

1077
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,358
connected to the seed pack and then I

1078
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:32,838
would help them with predictive and

1079
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:34,960
selection process so they could start to

1080
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:37,358
stabilize lines themselves and so you

1081
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,838
started to have Community groups of

1082
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:42,759
elderly that were doing their own CBD

1083
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,679
juicing program CBD medicine production

1084
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,640
and they were able to do it in a group I

1085
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:48,960
I was able to tie them in with labs and

1086
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:51,559
other makers so that they could all work

1087
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,159
in a in a really cohesive fashion so

1088
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:55,799
that they could afford to produce the

1089
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:57,480
medicine at the level they needed and it

1090
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,880
was such an in to me it was the the best

1091
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,838
thing I ever did in cannabis because it

1092
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,200
it's what it drove CBD throughout as far

1093
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:07,519
as I could stick it and no one had to

1094
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:09,318
pay for it so it allowed everybody to

1095
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,639
get their hands on it and what it did

1096
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:13,800
was it took people who were what I call

1097
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:15,358
mainstreamers people who what you're

1098
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,839
going to find in Med cannabis is that

1099
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,719
typically Med cannabis people aren't

1100
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:21,318
cannabis per se if they were cannabis

1101
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:22,598
per se they would already be on Med

1102
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:24,358
cannabis they would kind of integrate

1103
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:26,160
quickly but when you come from Med

1104
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:29,719
cannabis specifically you're usually a

1105
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:32,358
nonm can user and when we were able to

1106
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:35,879
take the money away from the true CBD

1107
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:37,639
end of it it just absolutely shocked

1108
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,640
mainstream people and it made a lot of

1109
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:42,759
them cry because they were needy of of

1110
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:45,400
of help and compassion and when they

1111
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,760
received it in such a human way it

1112
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,480
shocked them and it changed their

1113
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,200
perception of us as a culture and I know

1114
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,679
because I I see the Ripple of it through

1115
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:57,519
the communities and I was so grateful to

1116
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:59,358
be able to be part of that because it

1117
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,639
it's it's the ability for cannabis to be

1118
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:04,440
used intelligently by all people and the

1119
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:06,960
stigma is what's screwing it up and CBD

1120
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,039
to me was what allowed people on the

1121
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,679
mainstream to see us who are more wreck

1122
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,880
users as normal where just because I

1123
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,799
like to be you know infused with

1124
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,680
cannabis doesn't mean that I'm less of a

1125
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,920
human and now that people who had

1126
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,558
medical issues were able to get cannabis

1127
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,599
and when they went to get it they got it

1128
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:26,079
served to them in such an elegant

1129
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,760
gracious way that there was no way they

1130
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,839
could look at us as as being malignancy

1131
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,800
and so that it it was such a it was such

1132
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:36,279
a beautiful synchronicity of Goodwill

1133
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,839
and timing that you know I mean no

1134
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,720
matter what takes place with the federal

1135
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:42,279
government right now CBD is living in

1136
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:44,318
you know 10 million homes it's being

1137
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,880
grown everywhere yeah and you know

1138
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:50,920
because the conditions the human

1139
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:55,680
conditions that CBD offers relief from

1140
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:57,119
are so pervasive and and so you know

1141
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:00,358
they cause so many people to suffer

1142
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:03,680
offer um it's a profound human gift to

1143
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:05,920
be able to give High CBD whole plant

1144
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:08,598
medicine to somebody who's sick and

1145
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,159
watch their spasticity stop you know

1146
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:13,559
help them uh you know either either cure

1147
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:16,838
their cancer or just help their symptoms

1148
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:19,240
it's it's um you know it's it's it's

1149
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:22,719
profound for people who work with

1150
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:26,118
patients to see the relief but then to

1151
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:28,118
give them the relief for for no money

1152
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:30,318
because you're right patients you get

1153
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,960
broke fast because it's expensive being

1154
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:36,079
a patient um you know we we still see

1155
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,519
this every day uh as as more and more

1156
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,440
people get turned on to what CBD can do

1157
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:41,679
from them I mean heck that's even

1158
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,679
without even going into the states that

1159
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,879
are just medical now I mean you and I

1160
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,440
both live in W States now and and we can

1161
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,318
start to see how people are are starting

1162
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,838
to profit from it more but you know in

1163
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:53,800
the early days of every state it's just

1164
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,519
good Growers you know putting a certain

1165
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,480
amount of their crop to CBD and giving

1166
00:44:55,519 --> 00:45:00,079
it away mhm it was it was it was

1167
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,639
compassion it's just like RSO Rick

1168
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,318
Simpson Oil you know Rick Simpson was a

1169
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:07,400
a farmer who wanted to fight cancer he

1170
00:45:05,318 --> 00:45:09,880
he grew an acre he distilled it he gave

1171
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,559
it a shot it turned out he releases the

1172
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,800
recipe you know I I he could have made a

1173
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:17,920
lot of money off of it you know 100

1174
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:21,160
110,000 clones is a million 00,000

1175
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:24,519
so when that's that's a lot of money but

1176
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:27,679
it it's it's currency that is only has

1177
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:30,318
one value the currency of doing a social

1178
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,679
Justice you really can't calculate it

1179
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:34,558
because you have no idea who's

1180
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:36,679
benefiting from it and so you know to be

1181
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,319
able to be part it's funny you know you

1182
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:40,558
for all of us in cannabis at a career

1183
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:43,039
like me I mean we were all criminals I

1184
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:44,800
mean Christ we we ran from - every step

1185
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,558
of the way and now you know we're all

1186
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,960
pretty normal and we can function and

1187
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:53,160
stuff but to be able to to be able to

1188
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,079
take part in society in a positive

1189
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:57,480
manner when you probably always wanted

1190
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:59,318
to like most of us did was an incredible

1191
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,199
experience and so some of this stuff

1192
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:03,759
right now is allowing all of us that had

1193
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:07,118
to live this weird duality of existence

1194
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,839
we can now be open and honest and CBD

1195
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,358
cannabis to me more than any other thing

1196
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:14,799
is what allowed the mainstream to accept

1197
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:17,960
cannabis at all because once they

1198
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,519
realized that cannabis was valid for

1199
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:24,000
their need now they can start to say

1200
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:26,079
well maybe it's valid for your need and

1201
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,639
who's to say you're wrong once we start

1202
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,960
to find valid

1203
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:31,799
and so we started to see radical changes

1204
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,039
in how mainstream looks at people who

1205
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,200
smoke cannabis and I have the number of

1206
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:38,400
elderly that come to me for for cannabis

1207
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:39,799
assistance is unbelievable because you

1208
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,639
know we're try to explain to them how to

1209
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,039
use the products how to how do you

1210
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:46,440
hydrate your doses how do you figure it

1211
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:47,719
out and if and if the elderly are in

1212
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,000
concern or if you're ill and you're

1213
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:51,118
concern we let you come in just

1214
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,480
Apprentice at the shop and we'll be able

1215
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,039
to help you and show you and get you up

1216
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,400
to speed enough to where you're going to

1217
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:58,358
be able to go home and do your your your

1218
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,760
your cult ation work yourself and get

1219
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:02,639
some success we try to set it up to

1220
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,680
where we put them in groups to where the

1221
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,920
CBD people always work in groups of

1222
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:09,759
three and what it does it allows you I I

1223
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,599
I came up with a whole piece based off

1224
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,720
of the legal production amount of Humble

1225
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,119
County and so I did all this R&amp;D on my

1226
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:18,159
own but I used humbo County's legal

1227
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:19,519
numbers to create an indoor model

1228
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,279
because that's where they have the most

1229
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,719
ability most people can do indoor but

1230
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,519
not outdoor and so legally you're

1231
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:27,519
allowed this x amount of space so I

1232
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:29,719
created this little mini model and I did

1233
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,838
all the R&amp;D so I could understand how

1234
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:34,000
much came off of it and that's basically

1235
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:35,838
the model we put everyone into and it

1236
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,800
allows a couple of people to be able to

1237
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:39,119
cultivate a couple months of the year

1238
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,599
and then the rest of the month you don't

1239
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,440
have to cultivate you just benefit from

1240
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:45,280
the material and this the people who are

1241
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,119
are older and elderly and they they

1242
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,800
start to become weakened from their

1243
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,720
condition they don't have to suddenly

1244
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,359
fail from production because they don't

1245
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:55,639
have assistance so we we started to tie

1246
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:57,598
the groups together and and put people

1247
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:59,400
together and and I would just serve as

1248
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,599
the technical Hub and sometimes I would

1249
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,760
give the money to buy the tents or I we

1250
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,559
I would find extra lights or we would

1251
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,920
just do whatever we needed to do to

1252
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:10,280
facilitate but but it it allowed these

1253
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,960
people to feel strong enough to

1254
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,680
self-build their little systems and

1255
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,838
slowly all of a sudden you started to

1256
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:19,159
see regular individuals who never use

1257
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:21,000
cannabis suddenly have benefit from

1258
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:23,719
Cannabis better than they ever had from

1259
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,960
mainstream Pharmaceuticals and they

1260
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:29,799
became some of the most vocal proponents

1261
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,039
of cannabis usage of anybody I know I

1262
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,519
mean when you convert mainstream people

1263
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:36,800
into cannabis users and they have a

1264
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:40,480
change in life without any decrease in

1265
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:42,440
quality of life it is a change for all

1266
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,639
of us for the better and for all of us

1267
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,838
instead of commercial cabis guys or you

1268
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,920
know career users oh man we needed the

1269
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:51,880
we needed the break and it's funny but

1270
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:54,200
CBD which doesn't get you high allowed

1271
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,160
everyone who wants to get high an

1272
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:58,039
ability to say so without having to feel

1273
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:59,480
like you're a drug addict and ashamed

1274
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:02,798
yeah the best thing that ever happened

1275
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:05,719
for cannabis as a whole was you know the

1276
00:49:02,798 --> 00:49:07,400
the the the pictures on TV of kids

1277
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:09,759
having seizures then those seizures

1278
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,079
stopping you know I mean it to it

1279
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,000
totally opened up a whole new world so

1280
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,119
so let me ask you about the the the

1281
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,760
potential darker side of it because like

1282
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:19,079
you know so far we've been talking about

1283
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,599
you know the the the kind-hearted

1284
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:24,920
Growers who have been trying to put CBD

1285
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:27,280
in the hands of of patients um but I can

1286
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,920
imagine that there were probably some

1287
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,319
opportunists that you came across who

1288
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,280
were you know grabbing the ACDC strain

1289
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:34,759
and renaming it and try to claim it as

1290
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,599
theirs or something like that did you

1291
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,160
did you come across much of that while

1292
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,798
you were in the in the process of

1293
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,558
spreading it out uh not so much that

1294
00:49:40,798 --> 00:49:45,119
they were trying to grab it as their own

1295
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,119
it was just more a matter of you were

1296
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,200
seeing what I got to see was I got to

1297
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,599
see people's intent I mean I've been

1298
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:52,879
I've been in the drug game my whole life

1299
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:55,680
right so um I'm no virgin to seeing

1300
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,000
Shady but I got to see some different

1301
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:00,639
Shady where I got see people who they

1302
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,559
realized the value of the CBD and that

1303
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:05,838
these people were basically a captive

1304
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,160
Market that they needed the product and

1305
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:08,558
they would come to me and say Hey listen

1306
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:10,039
you know we want to we want you know

1307
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,960
20,000 clones from you so we could do

1308
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:11,838
this big production we're going to do

1309
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,240
this thing we're going to get all this

1310
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:19,119
money and and it was funny because it

1311
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:20,919
was for a lot of us that are in cannabis

1312
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,358
they believed the people that came to us

1313
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,880
to do this they kind of believed that we

1314
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:25,639
were corrupt too and it was weird

1315
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,440
because you know we're we're we're

1316
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,440
felony leveled you

1317
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,200
cannabis Growers at that you know prior

1318
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,039
and so we have a history of being you

1319
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:35,679
know law Breakers but we we none of us

1320
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:37,920
that were in cannabis wanted to do the

1321
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:40,078
scandalous [ __ ] and and and push the big

1322
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,519
CBD product and so what you got to see

1323
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,200
was this separation in cannabis where

1324
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:46,519
all of a sudden it was people who were

1325
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:49,279
not in cannabis who came in with the

1326
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:52,400
ability to commercially uh Salvage this

1327
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:57,519
product and push it and it was a direct

1328
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:58,720
war between them and guys like us Ringo

1329
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:00,480
you know all the people who were trying

1330
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:03,959
to get the product into the hands of the

1331
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:07,440
people so that they could self-medicate

1332
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:11,358
self-heal and so you know it you got to

1333
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,798
see this abuse of um of people it's just

1334
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:15,358
it's the same as you see with any abuse

1335
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:16,719
and and so it was It was kind of weird

1336
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,119
because it was the first time I got to

1337
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:20,598
see it in cannabis we've never had

1338
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:23,039
anybody really come in and and be

1339
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:24,798
parasitic like that we've never had you

1340
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:26,119
know anything that was quite like this

1341
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:28,440
where you had an ability to have a

1342
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:30,358
product that if you could get it below a

1343
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,639
certain THC level you could sell it

1344
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:35,838
online I mean that's where the whole you

1345
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:37,279
know ecdc this uh these CBD oils well

1346
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:39,400
all of a sudden it opens up the market

1347
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,680
for the entire fake Chinese hemp oil

1348
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,039
yeah so you're having all this

1349
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:45,078
industrial grade trash oil covered with

1350
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:47,358
pesticides and heavy metals being given

1351
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:49,960
to people who are who are very

1352
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:51,838
ill and so you know those are the issues

1353
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,519
with it that's why I tried so hard to

1354
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:55,440
get the product into the hands of the

1355
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:57,199
people and so many people I know did the

1356
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,318
same thing where we just drove it in

1357
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:00,439
Samantha Miller and Jason from P

1358
00:51:59,318 --> 00:52:04,000
analytics I mean they Christ they went

1359
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:05,639
on a crusade of uh free speaking

1360
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,798
lectures where they toured everywhere

1361
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:09,639
talking so that people would be able to

1362
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:11,440
understand what is this thing how do you

1363
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:14,039
use it what do you do with it where do

1364
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,760
you access it so this way individuals

1365
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:17,358
would be able to get themselves out of

1366
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,680
that situation to where they weren't in

1367
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:23,400
such a a potentially Usery role it's

1368
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:25,480
really interesting to consider how the

1369
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,200
the the street price or the retail price

1370
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,960
if you will of CBD has has evolved and

1371
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:31,439
will continue to evolve over the next

1372
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,639
decade you know you you were talking

1373
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,679
about in the first set that when when

1374
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:36,679
you first had the high CBD stuff you

1375
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:38,399
couldn't you know you couldn't give it

1376
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:39,919
away the retailers didn't know what to

1377
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,358
do with it people just want were looking

1378
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,680
for high THC and then with you know

1379
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:48,719
increased education and of course the

1380
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:50,798
the the super popular sanj Gupta uh TV

1381
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:54,439
uh episode about it you know suddenly

1382
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:56,960
everybody wanted it and and because of

1383
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:59,159
the you know there's just not enough

1384
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,280
CB you know prepared CBD oil to go

1385
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:03,759
around to all of the patients that could

1386
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,839
use it so suddenly the the prices then

1387
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,640
skyrocketed not because people were

1388
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:11,599
necessarily trying to um you know Screw

1389
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:13,000
people over but just because the market

1390
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,318
was pushing it because there was so

1391
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,679
little of it available and now that's

1392
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:19,880
even more so in Rec states where you

1393
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:21,118
know the the first wave of licensed

1394
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,358
Growers I mean they're going to go for

1395
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,680
the THC stuff because that that serves

1396
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:28,519
the most people but now for example in

1397
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:30,639
Washington you know there's just you

1398
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:32,480
know there's just barely enough of the

1399
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:35,078
CBD in the market even say that it's in

1400
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,599
the market so the prices are still high

1401
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:38,839
but you know a couple years from now

1402
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,920
there's going to be a lot more people

1403
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:42,798
growing it at the commercial and license

1404
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,559
level and the price will come back down

1405
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:46,759
but you know talk about a variable

1406
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:48,720
pricing of a product my gosh it's it's

1407
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,079
not quite to the commodity level yet

1408
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:54,279
where it's where it's as uh inexpensive

1409
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:56,559
as some THC stuff is no but you know you

1410
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:59,559
know where it's pricey is in ban States

1411
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,119
to mothers with kids who are dying yeah

1412
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:03,319
and and and so they're the ones that are

1413
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,280
just getting screwed on this I mean oh

1414
00:54:03,318 --> 00:54:06,838
my God talk about because the problem is

1415
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,359
that once they let the cat out the bag

1416
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:11,000
that cannabis has positive effects and

1417
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:12,639
it's not a Panacea it doesn't cure every

1418
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,760
damnn problem but it it can sure do a

1419
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,558
lot for a lot well then people who are

1420
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,000
having problems become curious because

1421
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,040
they're like hey they want to save their

1422
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,798
kid and the problem is that it opens

1423
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:23,279
them up because they typically don't

1424
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:25,599
understand production quality it's kind

1425
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,079
of like Rick Simpson Oil to me so you

1426
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,480
know for all like in Humble it's a

1427
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:30,798
little different because all of us are

1428
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,599
large Growers right and so if what we do

1429
00:54:30,798 --> 00:54:34,119
is we take portions of our crops and we

1430
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:35,559
have it turned into Rick Simpson from

1431
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:37,798
people we know that are Rick Simpson

1432
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:39,880
makers now now that 64 is here we'll

1433
00:54:37,798 --> 00:54:41,719
figure out how to work with this too but

1434
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,039
in the Years prior for the last say so

1435
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:45,919
many years we know people who do RSO

1436
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:48,759
production and what they'll do is

1437
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:51,280
they'll donate their time and they and

1438
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:54,000
and we pay for material I donate the

1439
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:56,440
material the Cannabis and we then

1440
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,079
produce RSO and then we could give it to

1441
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,159
people who are who are who are lower

1442
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,440
income who are going through uh tumor

1443
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:03,960
cancer because an RSO uh treatment is

1444
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:07,440
really about you know up [ __ ] sometimes

1445
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:09,480
up to six grand for for a two-month shot

1446
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,000
and so six grand is a tremendous amount

1447
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,679
of money for people who are absolutely

1448
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,960
wiped out and so you know what you have

1449
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:19,639
is the grower Community has typically

1450
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,119
carried a river of these people and and

1451
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:22,920
grower Community we don't talk about it

1452
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,640
we're not trying to get um hey look look

1453
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,880
at me I'm doing a good thing it's it's

1454
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:27,759
it's a it's a it's a thing that's

1455
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,798
necessary because if we don't do it the

1456
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,960
product won't be there so if the guys

1457
00:55:29,798 --> 00:55:34,480
that are growing weight aren't able to

1458
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:36,519
give up a little bit of weight you there

1459
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,920
there's no subsidized medicine for the

1460
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:40,000
people and it opens it up to these

1461
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,440
larger CBD type companies but they you

1462
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,358
paying some money you're paying you know

1463
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,720
for a CBD cartridge and form you know

1464
00:55:44,358 --> 00:55:47,759
you might be paying over a hundred bucks

1465
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:50,919
or something for a gram of oil to

1466
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,799
consume and that's incredibly expensive

1467
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:58,079
I think that's also why um folks who

1468
00:55:53,798 --> 00:56:00,759
need um RSO in even in legal states are

1469
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,519
still tending to find it in the casual

1470
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:05,280
or informal unlicensed Market because

1471
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,400
you know you most of the Growers that I

1472
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,039
know who are growing specifically for

1473
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,400
patients you know they they'll have

1474
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:12,920
their price for one gram but if they

1475
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,599
know you have cancer and you're going to

1476
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:18,079
do the 60 grams over 90 days uh regimen

1477
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:19,480
um you know they they tend to give you a

1478
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,920
price break because you're buying 60

1479
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,599
grams at once and they know you're sick

1480
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,358
well you know that's that's not how it

1481
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,200
goes in the rec States because you're

1482
00:56:26,358 --> 00:56:30,078
allowed to give you know volume price

1483
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:32,598
breaks like that the way that the laws

1484
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,760
are so far exactly and it makes it very

1485
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:38,079
hard yeah totally instead of buying 60

1486
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,400
grams you're buying 60 single grams and

1487
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,798
so you're paying full price for the

1488
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,798
whole for the whole lot of it which is

1489
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:46,440
of course you know hitting the person

1490
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:48,759
who can afford at least yeah totally and

1491
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,760
that's that's the part that's so Harden

1492
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,680
and and you know it I'm not smoking

1493
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,520
cannabis because I have glaucoma I like

1494
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:56,719
to get lifted mentally I'm I'm a

1495
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:58,920
spiritual smoker and and hopefully when

1496
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:00,759
I have you know if I have uh ever have

1497
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,079
medical problems cannabis hopefully will

1498
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,680
help me with that but you know from

1499
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:07,000
being in my position all these years

1500
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:08,919
what I see is if you're real Med you are

1501
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,960
having some real issues and that's when

1502
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,760
you start to get caught up with uh

1503
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,240
parasitic type individuals and so the

1504
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,079
problem with cannabis is that cannabis

1505
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:19,598
is is is almost traditionally always

1506
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:21,280
been pretty kind the people in cannabis

1507
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:23,599
dealing with each other and now we've

1508
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,760
changed it from a a shared product to a

1509
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,960
commoditized product and it's a question

1510
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,039
of you know

1511
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,559
how do you how do you still maintain the

1512
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:32,319
compassion that cannabis had cuz

1513
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:35,480
cannabis is not the normal everybody

1514
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:38,000
wants cannabis but I still like

1515
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,480
cannabis and I would prefer if it remain

1516
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,639
that way you know what I mean and and I

1517
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,559
don't mind business I'm about making

1518
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:46,558
money because I have to feed my children

1519
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:49,559
but cannabis is so elegant there's no

1520
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:51,720
need to diminish it with with shoty poor

1521
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:53,960
cheap behav you right on that's well

1522
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,318
said so so hey I I still want to talk

1566
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,720
Kevin jrey founder of Wonderland Nur

1567
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:31,119
so this has all been really inspiring so

1568
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:33,439
far Kevin and one of the things that

1569
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,920
we're all curious about is what CBD

1570
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,559
holds for the future I mean we certainly

1571
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,798
know that there are product developers

1572
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:43,240
coming up with new ways to get CBD into

1573
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:45,719
the human system to help you know bathe

1574
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:48,239
their endoc canabo system with you know

1575
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:50,199
these healthy cannabinoids but you know

1576
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:52,439
I know you come from a breeding

1577
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:55,399
background and there's just becoming

1578
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:58,079
more and more people interested in CBD

1579
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,599
and probably also breeding it so um I'd

1580
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,839
like you to like look into your crystal

1581
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,640
ball a little bit and and let us know

1582
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:07,078
what you see forthcoming with CBD

1583
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:09,038
breeding and uh and where you might

1584
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:10,720
encourage people to look if they're if

1585
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:13,039
they're looking to get involved you know

1586
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:16,038
breeding some lines

1587
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:18,559
themselves I think I think with a CBD

1588
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:21,359
breeding what you're going to find is

1589
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,680
that as we start to become really uh

1590
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:28,199
cognizant of the impact of the the the

1591
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:30,358
tpine profile on how we uh perceive the

1592
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:33,078
effect that you're starting to see

1593
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:35,880
people weaving CBD into a lot of the

1594
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:38,039
higher THC strains so that we can pull

1595
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,200
those tur profiles that we find so

1596
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:42,440
enjoyable and mix it in with the CBD

1597
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:44,159
because people are starting to find for

1598
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,318
a lot of individuals that it's a little

1599
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,798
bit too much THC it's a little too racy

1600
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:49,079
it's a little little too intense and

1601
01:00:47,798 --> 01:00:51,679
they're starting to find that they like

1602
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:53,720
CBD Blends but they need the turp

1603
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:55,358
profiles to get the effect that they

1604
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:57,598
really really want because we know that

1605
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:58,960
these tping profiles of what drive it

1606
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:03,318
and so what I'm seeing is I'm seeing

1607
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:05,960
some really interesting um CBD being

1608
01:01:03,318 --> 01:01:08,358
woven in with you know a lot of OG lines

1609
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,960
being intercrossed a lot of a lot of

1610
01:01:08,358 --> 01:01:14,239
these sexy you know OG Skittle lines

1611
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:17,280
sherbet lines cookie lines they're all

1612
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:20,199
being hit with with uh CBD pollen to see

1613
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:23,599
if we can find things that have those

1614
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:26,798
enjoyable pallet and presents but not in

1615
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:28,280
such a a powerful form what what's kind

1616
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:31,358
of cool too is they're starting to

1617
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:33,559
create uh delivery devices like pen form

1618
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:35,719
uh The Humble brand has a really neat

1619
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:38,760
pen that buzzes when you reach you know

1620
01:01:35,719 --> 01:01:40,679
like 2 and a half milligram dose and so

1621
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,280
the the thing about you know using these

1622
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:45,000
products is the titration the dose

1623
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,640
amount and so you're starting to see um

1624
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,880
pre-loaded pens that when you hit it it

1625
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:51,879
stops hitting after X amount is put

1626
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,920
through so you're able to really dial in

1627
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:56,599
your

1628
01:01:52,920 --> 01:02:00,440
dosages I think that your you're

1629
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:05,278
starting to be able to see CBD is um we

1630
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:08,920
can use it as a a a balance with THC so

1631
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:12,000
I have pens at my shop that a lab per

1632
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:14,680
Linux they made for me so that anybody

1633
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,278
that had an overdose on an edible or an

1634
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:20,318
overdose on too much uh BHO we could use

1635
01:02:18,278 --> 01:02:22,838
so I waited until I found someone who

1636
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:25,358
had a good overdose and we hit them with

1637
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:27,558
the CBD pens that were designed to

1638
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:29,358
completely counter effect to high THC

1639
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:31,400
and within seven minutes it knocked it

1640
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:33,278
completely out so someone went from

1641
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:35,559
having a full panic attack to complete

1642
01:02:33,278 --> 01:02:37,199
stability and seven minutes holy crap I

1643
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:38,880
I have not heard of that product I mean

1644
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:40,719
we're still when when somebody has an

1645
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,358
overmedicated experience we're still

1646
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:46,719
giving them you know bet caropine tpin

1647
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:49,880
you know to help bring them down but

1648
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:52,278
High CB yeah High CBD consumed nak it

1649
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:55,920
knocks it out what I'm seeing is high

1650
01:02:52,278 --> 01:02:59,278
CBD in spray form and people that have

1651
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,960
have uh epilepsy um I I was at I was at

1652
01:02:59,278 --> 01:03:02,920
an event and a lady fell down with a

1653
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,880
seizure and her friend went right over

1654
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,440
to her bag pulled out a spray bottle

1655
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,278
sprayed it in her mouth stopped her

1656
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,639
seizures on the spot and it was just

1657
01:03:08,278 --> 01:03:13,199
really an ACDC

1658
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:15,798
concentrate so you're seeing people who

1659
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:17,399
have these uh seizures bringing with

1660
01:03:15,798 --> 01:03:19,880
them their own medicine and people who

1661
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:22,358
are with them know to use it and the

1662
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:24,920
change in This Woman's uh the seizure

1663
01:03:22,358 --> 01:03:26,639
was instantly nullified and she after a

1664
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:28,200
few minutes she got up off the floor we

1665
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:31,519
cleaned her up and she went right back

1666
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:33,480
about her normal day and I mean you know

1667
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:35,880
you're seeing CBD being used in some

1668
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,400
really interest in methodologies to to

1669
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,519
help and change uh existing effects but

1670
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,119
it's being it's becoming so convenient

1671
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:46,119
to use you know um as far as the

1672
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:48,079
breeding lines go um uh you know you you

1673
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:50,599
used this great analogy earlier about

1674
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:52,079
you know this molecular basket and

1675
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:54,838
originally you're trying to breed out

1676
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:58,318
your CBD cuz you wanted to to leave more

1677
01:03:54,838 --> 01:04:00,480
room for more THC and more tpin if

1678
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:03,038
you're going to top out at 40% you know

1679
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:06,000
you want to use each percentile towards

1680
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:08,559
your goal um what would you see you know

1681
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,318
I mean I I personally think everybody uh

1682
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:13,278
you know can benefit from CBD even if

1683
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:16,480
they're even if they're toking for the

1684
01:04:13,278 --> 01:04:18,559
THC because the CBD just makes the THC

1685
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,719
experience uh that more much more

1686
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:23,000
pleasant but you're right the CBD

1687
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:25,318
strains have got crappy turps you know

1688
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,960
they're they're not very pleasant you

1689
01:04:25,318 --> 01:04:29,639
got to look you got to hunt and so what

1690
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,880
I do is I hunt through the lines and

1691
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:34,199
then we

1692
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:36,920
find a a cutting of it that we say hey

1693
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:39,838
this is something that's palatable and

1694
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:42,838
its chemotype is correct and it's its CH

1695
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:44,960
profile is Sexy And it grows well for

1696
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:46,759
the grower and then you have something

1697
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,559
that people can use and say hey I felt

1698
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:53,119
really good when I smoke that and then

1699
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:55,160
they go holy [ __ ] it's a 20% CBD 10% THC

1700
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:57,400
and so we're we're we're I don't tell

1701
01:04:55,159 --> 01:04:59,358
you what it is when I give it to you

1702
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,720
because otherwise you won't smoke it but

1703
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:03,159
when I start to give people some of

1704
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:05,598
these high CBD strains that have neat

1705
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:07,759
tur profiles you're seeing them

1706
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:09,278
gravitate to it and so we're doing it

1707
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,200
Shango we're getting people to be able

1708
01:05:09,278 --> 01:05:13,000
to really use cannabis in the way they

1709
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:16,519
should have which is in the way they

1710
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,960
need to so so let's talk to a minute

1711
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:21,480
specifically for the Breeders who are

1712
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,159
listening who are you know at least all

1713
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,599
over the country listening to the show

1714
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:26,960
and but but you know we've got some

1715
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:29,119
International listeners as well but but

1716
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:31,960
let's talk directly to them let's say

1717
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:35,079
that they are um you know a historically

1718
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,440
high THC grower they've been fascinated

1719
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:38,760
but about the story that you've been

1720
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:41,798
saying obviously they they know about

1721
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:43,480
CBD you know where where's the pro the

1722
01:05:41,798 --> 01:05:45,440
promise you know what what would you

1723
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:47,559
consider people do you know like like

1724
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,159
try to get their hands on ACDC and then

1725
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:52,119
start Crossing it with stuff or or where

1726
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:54,480
would you direct them well you got a

1727
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:56,838
couple options you know access some

1728
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:59,679
access some known CBD CBD cultivar so

1729
01:05:56,838 --> 01:06:02,239
you have clonal material in your library

1730
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:04,358
and then you'll go into a seed stock

1731
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:06,399
from CBD Dom stock so I would I would

1732
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:08,318
stick with Ringo stock he's done they've

1733
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:11,960
done some beautiful work his his kids

1734
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:13,880
are still running his business so um you

1735
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,559
know work with known lines and then the

1736
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:17,200
problem that you have with CBD that you

1737
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:19,278
have to be aware of is that when you do

1738
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:21,598
your predictive work on

1739
01:06:19,278 --> 01:06:23,679
CBD with if I pick I'll give you an

1740
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,960
example from THC so I choose a male and

1741
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:28,278
the male tells me it's you know it's a

1742
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:33,559
month and a half old I test it it says

1743
01:06:28,278 --> 01:06:36,358
it's 4% THC it's you know 0.1 CBD it has

1744
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:38,039
this ratio I can pretty much say that

1745
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:40,480
that male is going to be that all the

1746
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:42,880
way through adulthood and through flower

1747
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:46,358
but CBD is kind of weird where sometimes

1748
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:49,200
when we identify CBDs as kids they

1749
01:06:46,358 --> 01:06:51,119
chemically change they morph so to speak

1750
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:53,199
through their process and they end up

1751
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,640
not being the ratio they should have

1752
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:58,000
been from their predictive look so

1753
01:06:55,639 --> 01:07:00,278
you're doing predicative you use it to

1754
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,318
Mark out Liars but run the damn thing

1755
01:07:00,278 --> 01:07:03,798
through all the way this way you can

1756
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,679
double check and make sure everything

1757
01:07:03,798 --> 01:07:07,358
holds true is what you want and then

1758
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:10,440
once it once you know that that cutting

1759
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:12,358
holds true all the way through it does

1760
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:14,000
it doesn't mean that it changes crop to

1761
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:15,719
crop it just means that when I look at

1762
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,400
sometimes with kids I look at a kid the

1763
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:20,759
kids's predicted to be a genius well it

1764
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,358
doesn't work out so you may not have

1765
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,640
wanted to breed that kid you should have

1766
01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:26,000
said okay this one's going to be a

1767
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:27,879
genius put a note on him when he's 22

1768
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,239
let's still see if he's smart and let's

1769
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:33,358
see if he can still breed and and you

1770
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:35,038
have to be honest about that and so a

1771
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:36,719
lot of this is trying to get the lines

1772
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,559
and I think for a lot of breeders it's

1773
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:41,480
they say I want CBD because they hear

1774
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:43,359
the number and they go oh it's a CBD and

1775
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:46,119
the problem is it's not palatable

1776
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:49,038
there's no value to it it it's it's long

1777
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:50,680
flowering it's low yield you know what

1778
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,839
you want is you want you know what's an

1779
01:07:50,679 --> 01:07:54,358
ideal thing a good quality I have a

1780
01:07:52,838 --> 01:07:57,159
friend that did this in Oregon he just

1781
01:07:54,358 --> 01:08:00,078
really did a beautiful job breeding a

1782
01:07:57,159 --> 01:08:03,480
CBD a heavy a Pakistani a heavy

1783
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:07,318
Pakistani into the OG lines until he

1784
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:11,480
came up with basically you know a a 1015

1785
01:08:07,318 --> 01:08:13,719
CBD uh you know maybe 809 THC so he's

1786
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:16,719
got a beautiful CBD Dom strain with

1787
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:18,559
plenty of THC with that miren dominant

1788
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,600
profile so that he thinks he's smoking

1789
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,839
OG but he's able to really be a lot more

1790
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:24,880
Lucid during his day you know that's

1791
01:08:22,838 --> 01:08:27,359
what you're seeing you're seeing Growers

1792
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,719
who are able to say whoa I got you I

1793
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:33,560
need cannabis that's not going to wipe

1794
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:36,000
me out so hard for my daytime function

1795
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:38,679
and CBD too dominant makes you kind of

1796
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,719
edgy and racy too so it's really each

1797
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:43,399
individual kind of sorted out and and

1798
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:46,600
for me what I what I'm looking for in

1799
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:49,719
CBD lines is is the ability for the

1800
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:52,798
plant produce a product in flower form

1801
01:08:49,719 --> 01:08:55,119
that's quality there if it's quality in

1802
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:57,560
flour it's quality all the way through

1803
01:08:55,119 --> 01:09:00,039
do you mean as far as bag appeal yes in

1804
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:03,080
all forms I want it to smell good look

1805
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:05,719
good be good because the bottom line is

1806
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:07,359
that product still if if that product is

1807
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:10,079
good there it still is good on the other

1808
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:12,159
end it but not vice versa you want to

1809
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:14,838
have a CBD product that can be consumed

1810
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:16,879
as flour and not oil because the

1811
01:09:14,838 --> 01:09:19,679
tremendous number of cannabis smokers

1812
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,679
who smoke joints don't like pens so

1813
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:23,880
therefore they can't smoke CBD because

1814
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:26,759
CBD isn't provided to them in flower

1815
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:29,119
form in a form that's quality so I

1816
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:31,279
create it myself so that I can have it

1817
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:32,719
at my house or have it for people I know

1818
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,359
because if we want to smoke during the

1819
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:37,880
day but not get blazed this is the right

1820
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,719
product and you want it to be goodlook

1821
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:41,480
you want it to be good smoking it

1822
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:42,920
doesn't have the whole point the problem

1823
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:45,879
Shango is when someone put the word

1824
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:48,079
Medical on weed the whole concept was

1825
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:50,560
diminished as soon as someone said it's

1826
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,798
medical that means it can look like [ __ ]

1827
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:55,039
it can taste like [ __ ] it can grow like

1828
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:56,039
[ __ ] but because it's medical nothing

1829
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:58,039
else

1830
01:09:56,039 --> 01:10:01,880
and the truth of the matter is that's

1831
01:09:58,039 --> 01:10:03,640
marketing bong it all matters it always

1832
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,760
matters and it always will

1833
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:08,239
matter and and that's how you have to

1834
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,039
see it from like a plant perspective I

1835
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:11,839
don't think there's I'm I'm a Nazi on

1836
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:13,039
that one I don't think there's any

1837
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,840
question that we're going to get there

1838
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:17,319
you know a lot of people you know just

1839
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,960
in casual conversation will say to me ah

1840
01:10:17,319 --> 01:10:22,439
you know I don't want this CBD stuff it

1841
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:25,319
all it all sucks taste wise um but you

1842
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:27,319
know we've we've all been working on

1843
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:29,840
hybridizing these flavors of the high

1844
01:10:27,319 --> 01:10:32,079
THC stuff for decades right we've been

1845
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:34,920
carefully sculping these flavor we just

1846
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:37,479
got CBD you know six years ago so

1847
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:40,119
literally it's brand new it's brand new

1848
01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:41,599
we have very little and we and the

1849
01:10:40,119 --> 01:10:43,599
problem is that people aren't looking at

1850
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,320
it correctly because it's being looked

1851
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:49,079
at from a medical perspective only not

1852
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:51,840
from a recreational usage point of view

1853
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:53,880
where you start to weave the CBD and it

1854
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:58,600
would depend on the tur profile so your

1855
01:10:53,880 --> 01:11:00,880
CBD th ratio totals and profiles would

1856
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,159
all go into your creation and I'm

1857
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,640
telling you you're going to get some

1858
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:06,319
killer high CBD that's going to come out

1859
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,840
that's just going to be so unbelievably

1860
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:10,439
enjoyable to smoke it's just that

1861
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,600
they're not looking everyone's going the

1862
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:15,319
extraction so quick because extraction

1863
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,560
allows you to take commercial and make

1864
01:11:15,319 --> 01:11:19,920
it into a

1865
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:22,400
product extraction Cuts craft right out

1866
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,039
of the loop yeah and and while while you

1867
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:26,198
might be coming from medical cannabis

1868
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:28,640
plants we all know that there there are

1869
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:30,960
certain volatile turps that you lose any

1870
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:33,280
even your best extraction you know yes

1871
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:35,359
yes extractions leave something and take

1872
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:38,119
something the whole plant is the way to

1873
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:39,920
go for the most balanced effect and the

1874
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:41,399
B we and we know this from usage I mean

1875
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,039
this is I'm not arguing because I like

1876
01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:44,638
one over the other I I use all of them

1877
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:46,920
and I know that when I want to keep

1878
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:48,920
myself balanced on a cannaboid level it

1879
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,480
has to be whole plant flower because

1880
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:54,480
extracts just do not give you a balanced

1881
01:11:51,479 --> 01:11:56,198
effect over time yeah right on well

1882
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:58,319
