2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,599
my favorite kind of people

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,200
are open-hearted active learners these

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,679
are people who generally are kind to

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,599
others

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,199
try to not be a jerk and are really

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,079
engaged with the world and learning new

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,080
things

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,599
this is one of the reasons i fell in

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,439
love with the autoflower breeding

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,679
community a few years back

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,759
this often maligned and ridiculed

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,559
subgenre of cannabis cultivation

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,279
are some of my favorite underdogs in the

15
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,039
early days

16
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,799
they were laughed and trolled right off

17
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,558
the popular message boards until they

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,839
eventually formed their own

19
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,159
and throughout the years of being

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,079
hassled they just kept sharing genetics

21
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,319
and best practices with each other

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,840
slowly dueling the difficult grunt work

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,920
on autoflower genetics

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,840
that will make all the future autoflower

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,079
breeders look good

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,199
modern autoflowers are pretty much just

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,119
starting now

28
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,280
there have been some winners in the past

29
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,358
but now that rudoralis has been tamed

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,800
now is the time when talented growers

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,000
will really start building up the

32
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,518
library of autoflower terping profiles

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,359
if you've been listening to my show for

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,200
a while you probably noticed that i got

35
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,719
turned on to the power of autoflowers

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,560
about two years ago

37
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,319
i was attracted to autoflowers because

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
they were a perfect solution for me to

39
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,000
recommend to cannabis patients

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,239
who have weather not as perfect for

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,560
growing cannabis as california

42
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,000
from the pacific northwest where i live

43
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,799
through the northern climates of the

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,118
midwest

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,920
and the short summer cold northeast we

46
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,000
all want to grow

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,200
under the sunshine but our summers don't

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,759
stay hot enough

49
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,478
and our real summer weather rarely lasts

50
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,519
to the middle of

51
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,478
october when we normally harvest with an

52
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,640
autoflower

53
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,399
you can start it outdoors the last week

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,118
in may and harvest it

55
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,960
mid-september fully ripe and packed with

56
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,438
terps and cannabinoids

57
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,319
regular plants won't finish most places

58
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,478
until at least mid-october if at all

59
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,959
early october cold and rain makes for a

60
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,599
lot of disappointing growing seasons

61
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,319
with autoflowers you are harvested hung

62
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,798
to dry

63
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,000
and often in jars well before the rain

64
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,759
starts

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,318
so when i discovered autoflowers for

66
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,038
myself i dug in deeply to learn as much

67
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,560
as i could

68
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,199
and then programmed a whole year of

69
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,520
autoflower content in 2019

70
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,439
i had a few podcast episodes put

71
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,959
together a half dozen live panels and a

72
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,639
pair of live events

73
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,479
i was even invited to write a jacket

74
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,159
endorsement for the new jeff lowenfell's

75
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,639
book on autoflowers that came out that

76
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,439
year

77
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,598
it was a lot of fun commercialization

78
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,680
hasn't really come to autoflowers yet

79
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,598
they still have a very mixed reputation

80
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,800
and home growing is still in its infancy

81
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,280
in the u.s

82
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,360
but patients have adopted them and they

83
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,199
are remaking patient home growing which

84
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,200
is really cool to watch

85
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,280
so today shows an attempt to get the

86
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,238
early days of autoflower history up to

87
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
the present

88
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,159
on record from the perspective of a

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,080
person who is present from the beginning

90
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,000
this isn't a complete history because no

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,760
one could do that and we don't cover

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,158
modern commercial hemp varieties like

93
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,919
the work of oregon cbd and others

94
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,519
but at the end of the show today you

95
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,199
will have a really well fleshed out

96
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,640
understanding of the last 12 years of

97
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,799
thc autoflowers

98
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,878
being grown by home cultivators and the

99
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,040
basics of what breeding autoflowers is

100
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,359
all about

101
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,359
have you used cbg dominant cannabis

102
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
flower tincture or other preparations in

103
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
the last six months

104
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,878
dr ethan russo asked me to let you know

105
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,480
that he and others are conducting a

106
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,158
study to determine the benefits and

107
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,079
drawbacks to cannabiroll

108
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,759
and they would love your opinion the

109
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,599
questionnaire takes about 10 minutes and

110
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,399
can be anonymous if you wish

111
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,039
the study is available at bitly forward

00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,159
the time here during the holiday season

173
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,360
i've been wanting to have this chat with

174
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,360
you for a while and

175
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,120
and i'm glad we finally found the time

176
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,479
so let's get going by starting talking

177
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,478
about the

178
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,360
legacy um the legacy autoflower

179
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,800
cultivars

180
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,199
that existed prior to um

181
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,360
2010 because you know as we'll talk

182
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,080
later 2010 seemed to be a real changing

183
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,800
time but prior to 2010 it was kind of

184
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,599
crazy

185
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,000
tell us about those early cultivars so

186
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,160
yeah

187
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,279
um around 2009 and 2010 we

188
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,439
started to see the emergence of

189
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,599
autoflowering strains hit the market i

190
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,439
can remember

191
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,720
looking at seed banks like attitude seed

192
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,240
bank back in the day and

193
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,880
noticing these things were called

194
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,000
autoflowers and that they were

195
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,519
light cycle independent the only bad

196
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,439
thing about that was is they

197
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,519
weren't very potent and they didn't have

198
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,719
a lot of terpene content

199
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:27,758
and they just weren't robust plants

200
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,240
some smaller cultivars quick and fast to

201
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,840
grow

202
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,360
i think they were they were definitely

203
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,478
very early in their infancy at that

204
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,080
stage

205
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,439
so when you say not a lot of chirping

206
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,478
profile do you mean that there just

207
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,160
wasn't a lot there

208
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:41,758
at all or just that it was unpleasant

209
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,919
i would say a combination of both

210
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,520
honestly um you know it smell

211
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,120
the smell that was emitted from the

212
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,198
flower wasn't like

213
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,560
the gas that we look for today or the

214
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,240
other terpene profiles

215
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,160
that you know produce bakery smells or

216
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,400
sweets and things of that nature

217
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,319
but it was just though the smoke was a

218
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,918
little harsh because it was still

219
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,720
you know early root or alice it hadn't

220
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,478
had a lot of selection done to it

221
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,360
but what it did do was flower an

222
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,279
unseenly or obscenely quick time

223
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,038
so where did these reuteralis genetics

224
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,799
come from

225
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,719
from my memory and being around back

226
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,240
then watching them emerge a majority of

227
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,520
the stuff

228
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,439
was coming from the european market

229
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:27,359
spain and other eu territories where

230
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,519
uh they had been working with them you

231
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,680
know prior to 2010

232
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,120
low rider i think everybody remembers

233
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,319
low rider 2

234
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,598
there was you know snow rider and

235
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,919
mossy's purple gem there was also

236
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,399
a few other companies out there i think

237
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:47,439
dynafem had the roadrunner auto

238
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:50,638
and very early on

239
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,279
exploration of this plant it makes sense

240
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,079
that the

241
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,719
rotorolus genetics would you know show

242
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,758
up

243
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,479
in europe first considering the plants

244
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,038
originally came from siberia and russia

245
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,079
i mean those are those are you know so

246
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,800
close as far as

247
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,680
traffic routes go i can see how those

248
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,038
seeds would

249
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,000
you know easily be discovered in russia

250
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,079
then make their way

251
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,680
into you know europe for people to start

252
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,359
playing with then

253
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,879
you know isn't it isn't it odd to think

254
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,000
about how um

255
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,120
these same cultivars these pre-2010

256
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,680
cultivars

257
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,560
you know to one group of people um who

258
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,240
are like you know

259
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,598
visionary breeders they're like oh my

260
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,000
god this can change

261
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,598
everything you know over the next you

262
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,599
know x amount of years

263
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,360
and then they're also the same cultivars

264
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
that gave autoflowers such a terrible

265
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,560
reputation right because

266
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,000
even though alder flowers have gotten so

267
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,239
much better there's still people who

268
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,320
have

269
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,320
that knee-jerk response that oh autumn

270
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,760
flowers suck you know bad yield bad

271
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,640
smells and stuff and

272
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,200
you know that was definitely true

273
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:53,199
pre-2010

274
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,560
but uh but yeah these same cultivars

275
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,959
inspired a bunch of people and then

276
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,479
turned off a bunch of other people

277
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,319
that they did it was it was truly a

278
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,600
catch-22 and i think what you said there

279
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,240
was right on point

280
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,720
you know people saw a huge potential for

281
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,399
these

282
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,480
and maybe they may not have known at

283
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,839
that time what that potential was

284
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
but they decided to give the plant a

285
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,240
chance and then there are the folks that

286
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,160
you know got that impression stuck in

287
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,240
their head and then they didn't want to

288
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,079
either mess with it anymore or give the

289
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,839
the cultivar an opportunity

290
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,440
to change by assisting it you know we've

291
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,040
been assisting the cannabis plant in

292
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,839
whole for

293
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,838
centuries and i think that there was a

294
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,000
group that snatched a hold of that

295
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,480
new potential and really became like you

296
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,759
said a visionary on it and some people

297
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,879
stuck in their ways it's kind of like

298
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:41,360
the led versus uh

299
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,879
hid lighting debate you know there's new

300
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,879
tech and old tech and you see people

301
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,639
using a hybrid of the two

302
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,240
yeah and you know it's what a pain in

303
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,879
the ass too i mean as far as breeding

304
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,320
goes for

305
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,399
we'll talk more about the you know the

306
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,120
breeding in the third set but just

307
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,159
quickly

308
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,039
you know breeding autoflowers is not as

309
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,879
simple as

310
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,319
breeding regular photo periods where

311
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,879
you're just like you know male meat

312
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,278
female

313
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,879
boom you you've chucked some pollen and

314
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,039
now you've got new seeds

315
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,439
you know with with the autoflowers the

316
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:13,599
the root oralist genetics were so

317
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,560
janky with their low yields and smells

318
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,600
to to you know to dress that up people

319
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,879
were crossing it

320
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,639
into flowers that had a better

321
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,000
reputation and more attributes that

322
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,958
people liked but

323
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,278
but man it you're taking something that

324
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,199
is

325
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,639
janky and poor smell and hitting it

326
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,200
against something

327
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,600
that um that you potentially like well

328
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,800
gosh that takes a lot more work to breed

329
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,480
out those attributes that we don't want

330
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,399
exactly it does take some time

331
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,680
especially if you're you know

332
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,360
what i like to say building a new

333
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,639
cultivar from the ground up with reuter

334
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,278
alice

335
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,480
it's hard to get your hands on true

336
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:52,639
reuter alice these days

337
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,920
most people that want to start a project

338
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,039
to where they

339
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,559
take their their favorite photoperiod

340
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,360
strain and they want to make it an

341
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,599
autoflower

342
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,959
it does involve a few years worth of

343
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,040
work to do so

344
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,319
so those early days was there just

345
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,799
essentially one

346
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,879
rooteralis cultivar that people were

347
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,078
handing around

348
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,559
to to hit their their favorite plants

349
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,838
with or

350
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,439
were were there several to choose from

351
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,360
earlier on there were several to choose

352
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,600
from a lot of the painstaking work had

353
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,519
been taken out of it with the arrival of

354
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,759
low rider and lowrider 2 the purple

355
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,879
rider or purple gem

356
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,240
sour 60 was another big one back in that

357
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,480
early time frame

358
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,399
and i think a lot of that sub work had

359
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,519
been done to where the autoflowering or

360
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,159
day neutral trait

361
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,639
was dominant in the plant and we sure

362
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,199
owe

363
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,759
a lot of credit to those cultivators

364
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,519
breeders early on who did all that like

365
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:52,078
really annoying work to stabilize the uh

366
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,120
you know the autoflower recessive trait

367
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,759
right because like

368
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,519
it would not be nearly as much fun if

369
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,360
you had to do all that work

370
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,959
just to make your own fl autoflower

371
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,278
nowadays

372
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,838
that's correct you know it's they were

373
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:08,480
definitely pioneers in the field

374
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,560
and again i'll touch back on like dutch

375
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,240
passion and dynafem you know they saw

376
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,159
the potential very early they put in a

377
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,680
lot of work behind the scenes and

378
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,360
you know i come from and we've talked

379
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,000
about this we may talk about it a little

380
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,680
more as

381
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,759
i came from the forum days you know

382
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,239
there wasn't a um

383
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,759
a instagram out there or can a buzz or

384
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,440
any of these other platforms that we see

385
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,319
today to where we could just openly

386
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,720
share

387
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,600
about what was going on so how were

388
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,639
autoflower breeders finding each other

389
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,399
back pre pre-2010 so

390
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,919
i can i started delving into autos in

391
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,000
2009

392
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,078
and that's when you know you just kind

393
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,519
of perused these forums um

394
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,638
that were out there mainly at the time

395
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,639
for me was i see mag

396
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,240
and you would find other people

397
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,000
growing these autoflowers and you would

398
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,079
have to you know key item search or key

399
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,679
term search to be able to locate them

400
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,120
but that's kind of how we were finding

401
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,759
each other um

402
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,799
or through the forums and once we found

403
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,399
each other you know

404
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,359
um you start developing the

405
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,639
relationships and sharing knowledge

406
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,079
yeah you were dead we're going to be

407
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,959
talking more about autoflower network

408
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,759
here in a little bit

409
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:20,638
but um and talk a little bit about how

410
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:24,000
rough it was to be an autoflower person

411
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,799
on these on these breeders sites

412
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
so you know we were the the joke the

413
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,719
butt of all the jokes

414
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
the never taken seriously any time that

415
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,519
you would go into say just a

416
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,679
generalistic forum about

417
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,440
understanding a set of nutrients or

418
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,559
understanding a soil type or a grow

419
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,839
medium type

420
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,599
the minute that you mentioned that you

421
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,720
were growing an auto cultivar

422
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,600
do with you know radio silence or you

423
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,040
got

424
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,399
you know or you get you know you got

425
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:49,599
laughed at you got told you're growing

426
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,958
ditch weed

427
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,040
um you know it was kind of you know

428
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,479
it was getting bullied for the for lack

429
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,958
of a better term back in those early

430
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,039
days so you know we kind of had to uh

431
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,319
you know rely on each other and rely on

432
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,519
a community

433
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,480
right on so so that was a drag and we're

434
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,399
really grateful

435
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,320
um that we have so many more resources

436
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
now and and let's so let's let's

437
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,160
let's talk about how that turning that

438
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,198
corner happened so

439
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,439
you know for anybody who's been

440
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:20,799
following this there's something like

441
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,839
like magic happened there around 2

442
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:26,559
2010 2011. and a lot of things in the

443
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,760
autoflower scene happened at once and

444
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,799
they were all going

445
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,519
in the direction of stronger autoflowers

446
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,838
and a stronger autoflower community

447
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,198
um so what do you think happened there

448
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,839
in 2010

449
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:42,399
um that really started to you know push

450
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,240
the threshold and turn the corner to

451
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,320
to this what you know present blossoming

452
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,480
of the autoflower scene

453
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,639
you know i'll take it back to community

454
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,399
um everybody that was joining up on

455
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,079
these forums they initially started out

456
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,679
in one place and then one thing leads to

457
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:56,879
another you either get banned or you

458
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,559
move on

459
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,159
and around 2010

460
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,039
we started finding each other in a new

461
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,879
forum roll it up and i noticed an influx

462
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,278
and what we decided to do

463
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,078
was basically have one sole dedicated

464
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,399
thread

465
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,239
to autoflowering cannabis because we

466
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,120
were searching and hunting for a sub

467
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,120
forum

468
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,879
or a place that we could go in as the

469
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,278
community at large who all had the same

470
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,679
love for the specific cultivar cannabis

471
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,600
and we could share the stuff that to all

472
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,879
make us understand it and grow it better

473
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,399
because in the main forums it was

474
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,159
getting lost in the wind

475
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,480
you know it was you know a few posts

476
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,319
here a few posts there a section here

477
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,000
and there wasn't one simple central

478
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,040
resource for all of us just to get

479
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,879
together and

480
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,958
trade ideas with and have a virtual

481
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,278
smoke sesh if you will and

482
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,559
share about this so i think around 20 i

483
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:48,480
know around 2010

484
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:50,239
there was a thread formed and roll it up

485
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,639
and that's where i noticed a lot of

486
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,919
people starting to migrate too

487
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,919
and see a need for um

488
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,439
better information more in depth and

489
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,639
places to talk about experience with

490
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,480
them other than just

491
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,560
oh my god this plant flowers without a

492
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,278
light cycle yeah it doesn't taste very

493
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:10,479
good but we can grow a lot of weed quick

494
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:12,000
so is this so so right after this period

495
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,759
when you started seeing these people

496
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,159
come together um

497
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,360
on the roll it up is this when you and

498
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,159
your co-founders

499
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,399
decided now is the time to create your

500
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,480
own home with autoflower.net the

501
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,039
autoflower network

502
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,278
in a nutshell yes you know i had brought

503
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,719
over the forum call or not the forum but

504
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:31,439
excuse me the thread called the art of

505
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,240
the auto and

506
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,600
roll it up and it was a place where it

507
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,639
was centralized like i was speaking

508
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,839
about before

509
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,799
and after working in there for a few

510
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,240
months i got

511
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,599
um approached by um a breeder by the

512
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,839
name of mossy

513
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,560
and a gentleman from canada

514
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,480
to basically create our own home we had

515
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,799
bagged admin and roll it up

516
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,240
multiple multiple times just to give us

517
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,559
a sub form we weren't looking for a

518
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,480
dedicated forum

519
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,000
our main page splash page on their site

520
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,519
we just wanted a place where we can make

521
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,959
it easier for people to find each other

522
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,759
instead of having to come and comb

523
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,679
through

524
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,558
you know google search results or even a

525
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,038
really poor search engine on a forum

526
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,959
and so we got approached and we started

527
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:17,519
spitting ideas and what we wanted it to

528
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,919
be

529
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,519
and one thing led to another and the

530
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,319
gentleman from canada

531
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:26,480
got the server space and knew a little

532
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,838
bit of coding i knew some back end work

533
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,720
as far as server maintenance and

534
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,319
building

535
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,558
and mossy had the information and

536
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,798
experience she was one of the earlier

537
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,639
what i like to call independent breeders

538
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:37,599
that weren't big name like dutch passion

539
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,759
and dynafem

540
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,798
you know she had really put the work

541
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,679
into

542
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,000
early root or alice and really working

543
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,080
it

544
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,839
geared towards meds and improving

545
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,159
terpene profiles

546
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,279
to where you know it was actually a good

547
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,000
medication for

548
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,839
better circulation for nighttime and so

549
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,519
she played a huge key role and she's

550
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,199
kind of a silent

551
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,038
person and i like to talk about you know

552
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,440
talk about her as much as i possibly can

553
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,119
because she was a mentor a to me

554
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,360
and i think she left a huge impact as

555
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,038
she had one of the first colored autofl

556
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,479
autoflowering cannabis varieties out

557
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,119
there

558
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,160
so is where was she living or still i

559
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,079
don't know

560
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,919
she's still in spain spain it's

561
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,079
interesting how much spain comes up

562
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,480
right around this time with the change

563
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:25,759
in genetics would you say that

564
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:29,519
um you know spain was at the

565
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:31,919
forefront of the of the new the new wave

566
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,079
of autoflower genetics at this time

567
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,120
i would agree with that there was a huge

568
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:40,480
gravitational pull towards that region

569
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:42,479
spain's has some different laws

570
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,919
than what we do and especially at that

571
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,360
time and i think it was a as a hub

572
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,679
for a lot of this autoflower and from

573
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,519
what my experience has been and you know

574
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,880
kind of growing up in this culture for

575
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,519
lack of a better term

576
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,640
has seen like a lot of the stuff is

577
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,918
european-based but

578
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,840
a lot of it's spain based it's it's

579
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,360
interesting too because um you know

580
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,439
people there's one set of people who

581
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,319
talk about the fantastic

582
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,679
heritage genetics that come from europe

583
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,439
and then and then you've got other

584
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,840
people who talk about these trashy

585
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,600
european genetics and i think that like

586
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,918
you know they both are probably true

587
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,399
right

588
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,200
just just just like most truths have got

589
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,679
a little bit of

590
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,960
this and a little bit of that um you

591
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,840
know there's all of this

592
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,840
this uh this new amazing work that's

593
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,759
coming out of spain at this time

594
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,678
but then there's also other people

595
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,000
putting out stuff that had not really

596
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,200
hit

597
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
the mark of of some of those folks that

598
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,840
were bringing their

599
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
seeds over and so yeah there was good

600
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,439
and good and bad stuff coming out of

601
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,279
europe just like there's probably good

602
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,400
and bad stuff coming out of everywhere

603
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,079
right now

604
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,840
what you know do you remember some of

605
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,079
those names coming out of spain who

606
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,199
who were the first reliable people doing

607
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,839
stuff in spain

608
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,759
around around this 2010 time around the

609
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:01,199
2010 time

610
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:03,440
again dutch passion dynafem

611
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,960
i hadn't seen some of our newer big

612
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,640
brands that come out of spain quite yet

613
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,360
at 2010 because

614
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,880
i think with we'll give an example one

615
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,079
of the cultivars was think different by

616
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,400
dutch passion

617
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,519
it was the largest autoflower i had ever

618
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
seen

619
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,240
within a year and i think they were

620
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,400
working on it well before

621
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,839
obviously the 2010 marker coming into

622
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,840
the 2011 mark

623
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,879
but it was called think different and it

624
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,519
was huge

625
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,640
um guys went from getting a few ounces

626
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,440
per plant and it

627
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,280
to getting a pound per plant grown in

628
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,080
the you know proper conditions and it

629
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,960
really

630
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,678
i think set off like this emergency

631
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,519
flare of like

632
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,759
there's some huge potential here and so

633
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,720
i think it helps shift

634
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,720
some people who are on the fence to

635
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,400
really take a look at this plant and

636
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,679
start working it as a whole and i think

637
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,720
some people made some huge

638
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,640
you know changing decisions to grab a

639
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,759
hold of that

640
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,038
um with with the resurgence

641
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:05,038
of of spain spanish autoflower

642
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,720
genetics or maybe not resurgence but the

643
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,200
explosion of spanish

644
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,798
autoflower genetics and with people

645
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,038
around the world

646
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,079
you know being able to see that

647
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,359
happening

648
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:19,439
between the various forums uh you know a

649
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,119
couple of the threads but then also the

650
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,480
beginning of autoflower

651
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:27,038
um network um did there did there

652
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,480
did spain start to attract attention for

653
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,440
being a leader and start to

654
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,279
you know attract brain power towards it

655
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,000
i definitely think it did i can remember

656
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:35,839
early on

657
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,839
so you know we'll kind of fade into the

658
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,678
beginning of autoflower.net we get a

659
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,439
forum up we have an informational board

660
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,960
we've got people coming from all over

661
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,798
the world to join

662
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,360
we you know harvested a lot of people

663
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,480
from the older threads the older message

664
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,759
boards

665
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,599
and i think it gave a gateway for people

666
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,798
to come in and start to share

667
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,319
and then i noticed after we get

668
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,720
everything up and running i have to take

669
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,639
a little bit of a hiatus and

670
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,880
i come back and when i come back i see

671
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,159
this this new brand that a at first

672
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,919
the hillbilly and me didn't know how to

673
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,679
pronounce to pronounce the name

674
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,600
but after seeing it enough i had to do

675
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,720
my research and that was mephisto

676
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:20,158
and and so i've um

677
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,480
was was mitch in spain or was

678
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,840
was mitch going to spain because i've

679
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,960
never been clear about that because i

680
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,519
always thought i always thought

681
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,200
mephisto was an american brand but then

682
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:29,599
then but then people keep on telling me

683
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,519
like

684
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:34,000
oh when mitch went to spain like did he

685
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,079
come back what's what's the story

686
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,119
um from what i know mitch left to go to

687
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,960
spain from where i am not 100 certain on

688
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,079
that part of the backstory

689
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,319
but i do know that he went to spain

690
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,798
to really put in the work to you know

691
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,119
build up the mephisto brand

692
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:52,960
for so many people that really seems to

693
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,599
have been

694
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,720
like mitch is part of a lot of people's

695
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,558
um

696
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,000
background story right like when i when

697
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,558
i talk to people

698
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,919
early heads who are into autoflowers a

699
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:05,918
lot of them

700
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,759
you know get to a point in their story

701
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,000
where and then i got a bunch of seeds

702
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,359
from

703
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,880
mitch you know and it seems that

704
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:16,959
um uh you know mitch going to spain

705
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,200
with the connections that he already had

706
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,720
solidified and him deciding that he was

707
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,558
going to be

708
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,839
you know he wanted to he wanted to learn

709
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,279
in that scene he wanted to be a part of

710
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,279
the best practices

711
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,639
uh and and you know i don't want to put

712
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,000
words in his mouth because i

713
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,919
i haven't had the opportunity to

714
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,079
interview him but but um

715
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,759
you know someone goes to a hot spot

716
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,000
because they want to participate and i

717
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,599
can

718
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,119
imagine that um he got so excited that

719
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,480
that's where a lot of these people

720
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:46,239
got turned on to was like through him

721
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,400
yeah and you know i agree you know and

722
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,200
once his genetics started popping up on

723
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,240
the forums

724
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,880
and started popping up on the autoflower

725
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,480
network

726
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,520
you know it really gained him a lot of

727
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,400
credibility for what he was doing

728
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,400
and so to answer your other question

729
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,840
about it being a stateside company

730
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,240
i don't think it really was a stateside

731
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,480
company ever it was just a way to

732
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,480
get that flowing to the state side and

733
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,360
and maybe maybe i just thought it was

734
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,919
a u.s company because there are there's

735
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,199
so

736
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,080
many of his seeds here and um there is

737
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,440
such a

738
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:23,678
huge um

739
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,519
following for him you know i mean there

740
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,080
are there are a handful of good

741
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,200
autoflower uh breeders putting out seeds

742
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:32,240
now no doubt

743
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:36,159
but i would say for for you know most

744
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,640
folks mephisto is you know has been the

745
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,480
top of the mountain for a long time

746
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,640
people wanted those seeds and and they

747
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,319
were often sold out which you know makes

748
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,240
everybody want them more

749
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:47,918
and you know in the last few years

750
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,400
certainly there there's a lot of other

751
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,320
really

752
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,440
excellent you know other people breeding

753
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,558
including yourself

754
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,840
um but i think that uh mephisto deserves

755
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,879
a lot of

756
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,480
um respect for for being some of the

757
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,400
first folks to

758
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:08,079
you know really stabilize mass produce

759
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,880
and get out these new autoflower

760
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:13,439
cultivars but at the same time doing it

761
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,720
in a savvy cool way with creative

762
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,759
packaging

763
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,079
and and you know engaging names

764
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:22,640
and they you know the whole the whole

765
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:25,918
package where it made it really easy

766
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,520
to become like a fanboy you know exactly

767
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,038
no i agree you know it was a different

768
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,119
it was definitely a different approach

769
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,359
that none of us had seen before because

770
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,959
i don't know if you purchased seeds back

771
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,278
around that time frame i mean they had

772
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,880
us

773
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,720
they may have came in a snazzy like

774
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,000
matchbox style

775
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,640
um booklet with a glass

776
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,079
vial in the center you know they may

777
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,840
have some cultivar information on the

778
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,558
back expected cycle times

779
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,158
and expressions but there was never

780
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:53,759
really a

781
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,840
marketing angle that what you saw with

782
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,319
mephisto it was definitely different

783
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:58,798
than

784
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,399
we had seen before and that this kind of

785
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:01,200
like kind of brings it all together

786
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,880
right like

787
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,360
we've got we've got all these new

788
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,840
genetics being developed in spain

789
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:11,839
um now that the you know the actual

790
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:13,519
autoflower you know the recessive rudy

791
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:15,199
has been stabilized so that people could

792
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:15,519
just use it you know they don't have to

793
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,640
do

794
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:21,119
six or seven years of of you know

795
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,960
breeding work to isolate that before

796
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,798
even trying to make their flavors

797
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,720
they could just take somebody else's

798
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,960
work and then build their flavors on top

799
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,120
of it so all these great

800
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,240
uh all this all these great seeds coming

801
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,879
out of spain

802
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,720
and then and then you know mitch and

803
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,320
folks like mitch going to spain

804
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,919
and spreading that information around

805
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,000
the world and then

806
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,120
autoflower network creating this

807
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,359
community where

808
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,719
autoflower breeders could feel at home

809
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,879
and share

810
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,798
best practices internationally i mean

811
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,880
boom right i mean i think that is

812
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:56,079
that is the turning point where the

813
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,880
entire modern autoflower scene come from

814
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,519
comes from yeah you know i definitely

815
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,278
think that

816
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,079
it was a you know a tri-spoked thing

817
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,839
where it was like these three

818
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,839
massive things came to a head and it

819
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:09,278
just kind of supernovaed from there

820
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,879
um you know they started to get in

821
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,159
better recognition cultivars were

822
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,200
becoming better there was actually

823
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,720
variety

824
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,960
you know it wasn't just short plant one

825
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,720
and short plant three you actually had

826
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,000
some you know real varieties starting to

827
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,200
show up

828
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,720
you know you were talking about laying

829
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,519
the foundation of the original root or

830
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,278
alice and

831
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,879
you know like we've talked about earlier

832
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:30,558
in this it's a very gangly

833
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:34,480
and you know runty style plant and then

834
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:36,240
now for somebody to be able to just

835
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,919
give you pics and choices and

836
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,399
expressions that you want

837
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,640
you could really see how the foundation

838
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:45,359
and how the mentality has changed

839
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,880
yeah right on cool right on well let's

840
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,240
go ahead and take our first short break

841
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,399
and be right back you're listening to

842
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,319
shaping fire and my guest today is dan

843
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:55,278
jimmy of mandalorian genetics and the

844
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,278
autoflower network

845
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,320
oxygen is an essential plant nutrient

846
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,319
and keeping sufficient dissolved oxygen

847
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,480
in the root zone is a challenge

848
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,398
gaia's brand of ultra fine nanobubble

849
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,558
systems will help your garden thrive in

850
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,319
ways you may not have considered

851
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:12,319
no matter if you grow in soil

852
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,798
hydroponics or aquaponics

853
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,720
gaia's ultrafine nanobubble systems will

854
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,679
increase your dissolved oxygen

855
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,759
and increase your yield often the first

856
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,759
sign of inadequate oxygen supply to the

857
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,000
roots is wilting of the plant under warm

858
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,919
conditions and high light levels

859
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,440
insufficient oxygen results in an

860
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,278
accumulation of toxins

861
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,798
and an insufficient amount of water and

862
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,278
mineral absorption

863
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,119
if oxygen starvation continues mineral

864
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:38,960
deficiencies will begin to show

865
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,158
roots die back and plants will become

866
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,159
stunted

867
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,799
healthy roots supplied with sufficient

868
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,600
oxygen are able to absorb nutrient ions

869
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:47,200
selectively

870
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,959
from the surrounding solution as

871
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,360
required in studies

872
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,480
this has shown a 30 increase in plant

873
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,798
growth

874
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,399
not only do ultra fine oxygen bubbles

875
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,000
allow your plants to thrive

876
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,239
but they will keep your drip lines and

877
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,480
irrigation pipes and plumbing clean too

878
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,038
because algae pythium and other invasive

879
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,480
species only survive in low oxygen

880
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:08,640
environments

881
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,640
and the gaia system only costs about two

882
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,679
dollars per day to run

883
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,840
gaia ultrafine oxygen nano bubblers

884
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,000
are also great for making compost teas

885
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,319
and wild crafted nutrient teas

886
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,038
the smaller bubbles of truly dissolved

887
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,158
oxygen

888
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:28,000
allow more microbes to reproduce faster

889
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,919
go to gaia's website at h205.com

890

891
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,919
oxygen and how to purchase this simple

892
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:38,558
yet amazing technology

893
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,559
that's h205.com

894
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,240
as cannabis regulations become more

895
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:42,960
demanding and consumers become more

896
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,798
educated

897
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,480
it is increasingly important to avoid

898
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,158
the use of chemical pesticides when

899
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,839
cultivating cannabis

900
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,520
beneficial insects have been used for

901
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:53,839
decades by the greenhouse vegetable

902
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,359
and ornamental plant industry and today

903
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:57,439
many cannabis cultivators

904
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,119
are moving from sprays and chemicals to

905
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,038

to release seeds to hemp farmers that

947

will be legal

also these new varieties cannot be

958
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:47,440
pollinated by your neighbor's

960
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,798

oregon cbd seeds are non-gmo certified

without outside investment

967
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,600
they continue to refuse outside

968
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:07,278
investment that would change their

969
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,000
company culture

970
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,839
oregon cbd grows tons of fresh food on

971
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,480
their research farms for local food

972

banks

973
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,679
literally tons of food they also give

974
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:20,558
away tens of thousands of pounds of r d

975
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,519
flour to patients as their company began

976
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:23,359
to succeed

977
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,278
seth and eric started donating money to

978
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,158
the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber

979
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,079
cause 2

980
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,240

and they treat their employees right

985
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,798
oregon cbd pays for

986
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,880
full health and dental coverage for

987
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,119

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,880
about this threshold moment

1014
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,759
in like 2010-2011 time where we had this

1015
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,200
combination

1016
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:46,398
of um you know auto flowers

1017
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,640
becoming really stabilized in spain

1018
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:50,719
people going to spain because they

1019
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,519
wanted to participate

1020
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,798
people then sending their seeds all

1021
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,319
around the world

1022
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,918
and then people getting to know each

1023
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,519
other and best practices through the

1024
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,080
autoflower network

1025
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,200
and it all kind of came together at once

1026
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,240
so

1027
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,760
you know over these last you know

1028
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,119
nine years or so since then we have seen

1029
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,520
uh yields increase terpene profiles uh

1030
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,760
better um just just the plants are

1031
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,559
getting more sophisticated

1032
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,240
i'm really curious uh dan what you are

1033
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,078
seeing now i mean like

1034
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,239
you're you're a breeders breeder right

1035
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,919
like you you you not only breed really

1036
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,078
excellent autoflower plants that people

1037
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,480
enjoy to grow and are great for parent

1038
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,480
patients and they look pretty like not

1039
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,358
only that but you're also like

1040
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,440
um you know you you help run autoflower

1041
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:42,159
network and you're a nerd right so

1042
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,800
you are you're you're you're you're you

1043
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,480
know you

1044
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,720
you are into the details of a lot of

1045
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,320
this and so i'm hoping that um

1046
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:52,559
you can give me a good kind of overview

1047
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,960
of of what we're seeing the different

1048
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:58,239
veins of because you know as we know

1049
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,559
breeders work on different parts of the

1050
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:03,439
plant the parts that interest them

1051
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,239
and um i am not involved enough in the

1052
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,800
autoflower

1053
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,439
breeding scene to know what these other

1054
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,920
buckets

1055
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,519
are so so let me just hand you the mic

1056
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,639
and why don't you just tell us

1057
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,639
what you are seeing um evolve here

1058
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,920
in the in the last you know let's say

1059
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,078
six years and

1060
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,119
and where you see people working and

1061
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,680
feel free to name drop

1062
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,119
if you want but mostly i want us all to

1063
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:28,239
have a better idea

1064
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:31,599
of of what's being worked on and what's

1065
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:34,879
novel in autoflowers right now

1066
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,960
sure i mean honestly you know quickly

1067
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,000
the things i can see is a potency

1068
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,199
increase

1069
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,280
true terpene profile inc changes

1070
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,639
and i think the biggest thing is the

1071
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,320
overall structure and

1072
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,639
flower to leaf ratio are the biggest

1073
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,160
three

1074
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:53,920
shifts i've seen most recently

1075
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,358
i've seen you know in the earlier days

1076
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,960
you see a lot of stuff that was probably

1077
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:58,559
based off the low rider or low right or

1078
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,159
two genetics some of it could have been

1079
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,119
done from

1080
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:05,199
the sour 60 stuff we saw earlier even

1081
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,320
the road runners from donovan

1082
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:09,598
and oh you can see even though it was

1083
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,039
from these different brands and

1084
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,800
different breeders you could see some

1085
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,400
similarities between those plants and

1086
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,359
what i mean by that is you see a lot of

1087
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,358
the

1088
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,279
root or alice you know still coming

1089
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:20,960
through yeah the yields increased yeah

1090
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,240
the plant size has increased

1091
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,199
but we're still seeing a lot of the

1092
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:27,439
morphology from the root or alice

1093
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,039
may that be high leaf ratio long

1094
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,079
extended leaves

1095
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:34,239
um from the main stem on your main fans

1096
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,000
um up until now where you actually can

1097
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:38,239
tell the difference between a cultivar

1098
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,079
through some breeders um you know

1099
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:42,559
they've become more stabilized

1100
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,400
uh i think the people that have put in

1101
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:48,000
the most work are seeing

1102
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:51,519
more of a homozygous you know um

1103
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,920
cultivar expression per ten pack um

1104
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:54,960
another thing that i i've seen that has

1105
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,159
shifted

1106
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,639
is it used to be

1107
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,399
commonplace to get regular seeds all the

1108
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,559
time like when you got autoflowers back

1109
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,240
in the early days it was regular seed

1110
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,000
there were very very few feminized and i

1111
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:09,759
think that was a big milestone for mitch

1112
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,199
as well was getting out mass numbers of

1113
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,480
feminized seeds

1114
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:16,159
for people and now

1115
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,400
in the market it's really really hard to

1116
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:20,559
find regulars and all you seem to find

1117
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,000
is feminized autoflowers which is fine

1118
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:23,519
and dandy and it's great because there's

1119
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,280
multiple benefits and we can talk about

1120
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,800
that later um

1121
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,560
but i think those are the biggest things

1122
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,400
that i've seen shift um

1123
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,320
as well as potency um you know i

1124
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,440
personally took my whistle just a little

1125
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,440
bit

1126
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,119
i've got several 18 to 25 percent thc

1127
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,720
cultivars that are coming out where back

1128
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,480
in the day you were lucky to see 13

1129
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,239
percent

1130
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,679
you know so that's been a big change and

1131
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:46,879
i think that comes with the selective

1132
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,879
reading that's been going on

1133
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,800
people moving more away from the

1134
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,240
traditional root or alice and just

1135
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,920
seeking more of the day neutral trait

1136
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,959
rather than getting to the autoflower

1137
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,639
tray quicker

1138
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,679
it's interesting i like i like that

1139
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:02,319
little insight you tossed in there about

1140
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:04,078
the different the different strategies

1141
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,119
breeders will have whereas

1142
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,119
some folks are are taking hyped strains

1143
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,599
and just hitting it with the rudy

1144
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,240
and putting something out which you know

1145
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,079
may be

1146
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:19,439
a faster you know girl scout cookies

1147
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,680
but but it may not be i don't know

1148
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,000
finished right like like yes you

1149
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:27,598
successfully made the autoflower

1150
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,079
uh she goes fast but um but there's

1151
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,440
something

1152
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,960
extra to it to i don't know sculpt the

1153
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,920
terpene profile

1154
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,400
so that it's more than the hype name and

1155
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,880
whereas

1156
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,079
other folks are not looking to reproduce

1157
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,680
the hype name

1158
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,119
and they're coming at it from a

1159
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:44,879
different direction

1160
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,640
you know independently not trying to

1161
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,480
recreate something else

1162
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:50,159
but instead to create something

1163
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,079
different and i'm not saying that

1164
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,719
that neither i'm not saying that just

1165
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,880
hitting you know a hype strain

1166
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,078
with you know root or alice is bad i'm

1167
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,680
not saying that because i've

1168
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,839
i have grown a lot of fun stuff that way

1169
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:03,440
too all i'm pointing out is that it's a

1170
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:04,960
different approach it is a

1171
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,559
you know it's a very specific breeding

1172
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,760
strategy

1173
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:09,838
correct yeah it's just a different

1174
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,359
approach it's just like you know you can

1175
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:12,799
have several cooks in one kitchen they

1176
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:15,440
all have one dish they got to make but

1177
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,680
everybody gets to that point differently

1178
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,280
yeah two totally and you know even we

1179
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:20,399
get this even in regs right we've got

1180
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,079
people who are

1181
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,680
they're taking their uber mail and

1182
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,320
they're hitting the top the ten

1183
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:28,399
hot strains that they like and they're

1184
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,760
doing you know all ten of those versus

1185
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,920
this one uber mail

1186
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,960
versus people who every project they've

1187
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,079
got has got different males

1188
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,920
correct yeah so um so

1189
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,480
um as you are as you were seeing these

1190
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,039
um

1191
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,559
these different attributes come out of

1192
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,920
the plant

1193
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:52,078
um when did you start to see that period

1194
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,720
where people were starting to

1195
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,359
start to be picked up more at retail

1196
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:59,279
right

1197
00:39:55,358 --> 00:40:01,598
like like um no doubt when they started

1198
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,320
making so many feminized autoflower

1199
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,359
seeds

1200
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,160
they got picked up um really quickly by

1201
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:08,719
the uh by the patient market right

1202
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:10,480
because

1203
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:12,879
there there really isn't a better

1204
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,159
patient homegrown plant than a feminized

1205
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:19,358
autoflower it is the easiest of easiest

1206
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,960
and uh and you know um you know i

1207
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,639
you know i teach that to the patients

1208
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,559
that i work with like hey you need any

1209
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:25,838
safe place to start this is your safest

1210
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,759
place to start

1211
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:29,519
but that doesn't necessarily mean that

1212
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,240
that's where when peop when

1213
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,079
when autoflower breeders used to like

1214
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:35,838
more successfully actually get

1215
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,280
money for their seeds right because it's

1216
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:39,119
one thing trading with your friends

1217
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,720
because the market isn't there for it

1218
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,119
but then there's the day that comes that

1219
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:45,199
people start buying the seeds when did

1220
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,358
you when do you think that started

1221
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:49,358
i mean i bought my my first autoflower

1222
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:51,119
seeds all the way back in 2009

1223
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:52,400
when i first got what i got involved

1224
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,519
with and that came from the attitude

1225
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,240
seed bank

1226
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,679
um that you had you still had some

1227
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:59,439
options available but it wasn't as

1228
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,919
widespread as today

1229
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,559
um there were a couple brands out there

1230
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,079
um

1231
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,679
and i know i keep repeating dutch

1232
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,560
passion and dynafin but those two

1233
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,598
are so stuck in my memory from just the

1234
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:11,599
wow factor

1235
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,119
seeing these things and there are

1236
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,480
several other great brands that i know

1237
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,920
i'm forgetting to mention right now and

1238
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,960
i apologize but

1239
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,800
you know i want to say nirvana was

1240
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,039
another location you could find them too

1241
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,880
and yeah you could buy them as early as

1242
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:30,639
back then but i think the larger influx

1243
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,119
came probably 12

1244
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,639
13. once the form started getting more

1245
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,559
momentum and

1246
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,639
you know mephisto was getting momentum

1247
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:39,119
and then the market was kind of driving

1248
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,879
itself

1249
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,480
that way and i could be off a little bit

1250
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,000
with those dates as far as like the mass

1251
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,960
boom of when everything took off for

1252
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,519
that group

1253
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,119
but um from my memory and if my mom

1254
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,880
serves me right you know i know it was

1255
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,240
somewhere

1256
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,640
in between 2011 and 2012 2020 that it

1257
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:56,559
really

1258
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:59,838
really took off but you could buy them

1259
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:03,279
back as early as 2009 on attitude

1260
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:04,239
so um you know as far as the ruderalis

1261
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,119
taste

1262
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:08,879
um to what degree do you think the

1263
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,280
ruderalis taste is still

1264
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,920
prevalent in all of the autoflowers

1265
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,720
because

1266
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,318
it does seem to be different from

1267
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,719
breeder to breeder what do you think is

1268
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:21,759
influencing how much you're tasting the

1269
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,519
the grassy rudy in there i think it's

1270
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,040
breeder selection

1271
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:28,559
i think it is you know dependent upon

1272
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,400
what they're looking for as a result

1273
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,000
part of the plant what the parent inputs

1274
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,400
were

1275
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,639
i think i spoke about this earlier about

1276
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,079
the higher leaf ratio

1277
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:42,400
rugeralis is known to have high leafy

1278
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,400
content in between its buds therefore

1279
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,000
giving you more chlorophyll which in

1280
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,358
turn if it's not dried and cured

1281
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,559
properly gives you a lot more of that

1282
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,358
grass hay

1283
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,719
taste to the flower and i think with the

1284
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:54,960
improvement of

1285
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,480
you know the calyx to leaf ratios on

1286
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,280
these plants we're seeing a lot of that

1287
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,639
dissipate

1288
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,640
and i think that's what's happening when

1289
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:02,239
people are doing selective breeding

1290
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:03,838
with an outside source maybe another

1291
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:05,118
photo period or something of that nature

1292
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,480
where it's not continuance

1293
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,160
of the rudy gene

1294
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,760
so i'm going to put you on the spot here

1295
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,759
which is probably not fair but i'm going

1296
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,400
to be i'm going to ask you to

1297
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,680
name drop some of the breeders that that

1298
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,160
you think are doing good work

1299
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,759
and i want to i want to preempt this by

1300
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:22,480
saying that you know i recommend that

1301
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,000
everybody

1302
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,599
go to autoflower.net and you know if

1303
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,280
you're interested in growing auto

1304
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,119
flowers or if you're interested in

1305
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,400
breeding them that is the place to go

1306
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,920
because

1307
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,240
that is where i went to find um

1308
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,680
the seeds that were being made by

1309
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:42,000
talented people

1310
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,239
that may not necessarily have the

1311
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,880
commercial push behind them yet right

1312
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:47,919
because

1313
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,800
the autoflower for sale scene is still

1314
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,000
very

1315
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,318
young and and so you're still

1316
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,599
you know buying from a lot of uh

1317
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,880
individuals

1318
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,400
either you know via mail or um you know

1319
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,960
at a at a convention

1320
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,000
or or a big smoke sesh or something like

1321
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,039
that

1322
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,159
and um so so you know that is really

1323
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,480
great place to buy

1324
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:12,719
is to go and and look at the plants and

1325
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,400
read the threads and find out the person

1326
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:16,399
who you dig their style

1327
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,720
and then and then buy direct so so

1328
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,079
that's cool but there's no question also

1329
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,118
that there are a couple

1330
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,880
um really good seed banks now that are

1331
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,559
bringing people together to represent

1332
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,240
them to take some of the sales

1333
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:32,239
off of the sales stress off of

1334
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,838
um the the breeders themselves because

1335
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,519
just because you're a breeder does not

1336
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,199
mean that you are a great marketer of

1337
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:38,800
your own stuff either and you know you

1338
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,039
got to have respect for that

1339
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,720
so with all that being said and my

1340
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:44,800
encouraging people to hunt

1341
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:45,759
out breeders that are maybe less

1342
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,480
commercial

1343
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,560
um why don't you plug a couple folks who

1344
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,800
you appreciate their work for people who

1345
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,480
are are looking to start with um

1346
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,240
they want a good first autoflower

1347
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,119
experience

1348
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,479
um definitely there's a few that come to

1349
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,240
the top of my head if they want a good

1350
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,719
first experience there's a company out

1351
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:07,598
there called night owl seeds

1352
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,799
which is run by daz he has done some

1353
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,838
phenomenal work

1354
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,240
has been trained by one of the best to

1355
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:15,440
produce auto femmes and his stuff sells

1356
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:16,879
out everywhere

1357
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,440
it's one of the hardest one of the

1358
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,559
hardest you know cultivar lineups to get

1359
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,000
your hands on

1360
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,599
when they come up for sale they

1361
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
immediately sell out

1362
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,800
um definitely think that that's a good

1363
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,639
place that people should start

1364
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,440
i've got a friend uh brother mendel's

1365
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:35,358
selections

1366
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,960
they're based out of the middle of the

1367
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,759
country uh they're not

1368
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,199
so much on in the seed banks but if you

1369
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,000
search them out on facebook

1370
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,358
and instagram you'll find some beautiful

1371
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,480
beautiful

1372
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:50,960
worked cultivars from these guys um

1373

1375
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:55,598
myself now

1376
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,440
he really has a passion behind it like

1377
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,640
daz and myself and you know to kind of

1378
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,880
have that same

1379
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:02,559
in visionary style i got a friend out

00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:19,519
of

1390
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:20,719
you know what you can find locally that

1391
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:22,239
are doing

1392
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:23,838
you know approaching it in a different

1393
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:25,118
style to make a better plant for the

1394
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:27,838
community at home

1395
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,280
you know go ahead i was gonna say i've

1396
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:32,639
just seen a lot of their stuff

1397
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,480
expanding with the green wave coming

1398
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,400
and it's nice to see that happen with

1399
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,079
guys that are passionate about it

1400
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,160
and you know really put the time into

1401
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,359
work and and i know you're a humble dude

1402
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:43,358
but but i will also

1403
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:44,880
say that you know plug your mandalorian

1404
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:47,199
genetics because i love

1405
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,400
i love growing purple plants and you do

1406
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:51,439
a lot of purple

1407
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:55,358
lots of uh you know uh candy smells

1408
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:57,358
and um reliable plants right and um

1409
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,679
you know we have grown a lot of them

1410
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:02,719
here on vashon island when i say we

1411
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:04,719
i mean uh folks who are patients on the

1412
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:07,439
island who are growing with their

1413
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:08,959
with their medical certification and

1414
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,000
you've been so kind as to

1415
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,880
donate seeds to our our local vimeo

1416
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,400
meetings

1417
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,160
and so patients have been able to get

1418
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,358
some of your seeds for free and it was

1419
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:19,920
really nice

1420
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:21,759
to see if so many people have a good

1421
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,000
first time experience with autoflowers

1422
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,160
especially here in the pacific northwest

1423
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,838
where like you often have summers like

1424
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,039
we did this summer where nothing photo

1425
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:30,639
period finished

1426
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:33,199
because the weather was so bad and

1427
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,799
nights got cold so fast so

1428
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:36,558
by all means oh you know and and your

1429
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,119
stuff wins awards too right

1430
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,480
so i'll trash on awards a different day

1431
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,280
but you know that is something to be

1432
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,960
said when

1433
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,400
when uh you know your stuff's winning

1434
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,599
awards so mandalorian

1435
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,000
is uh well to be considered um as well

1436
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,079
so i like what you said though about um

1437
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,800
the you know the the autoflower

1438
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,440
scene being lifted up by this kind of by

1439
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,000
the green

1440
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,079
rush right and i think that autoflowers

1441
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,280
are really the right place at the right

1442
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,119
time

1443
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,400
because there's so much more home

1444
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,720
growing and

1445
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,920
autoflowers are so convenient for newbie

1446
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:10,879
home growers

1447
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,639
and feminized seeds are um you know

1448
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,079
convenient for everybody and you know a

1449
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,078
lot of people still prefer

1450
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,280
the reg seeds and that's fine but you

1451
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,359
know um

1452
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,319
so many people when ease is their number

1453
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,119
one thing a

1454
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:25,199
a feminized autoflower is is the top of

1455
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,240
the pile

1456
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:32,000
it is cool to see some other people

1457
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:35,759
like helping push the auto flower

1458
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,119
tide forward if you will and so

1459
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,880
like let's talk a little bit about the

1460
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:42,000
autoflower cup so

1461
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,000
um i i unfortunately missed

1462
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,159
the autoflower cup the last time i had

1463
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,079
the opportunity two years ago because

1464
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,279
i was actually running a panel at

1465
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,160
cultivation classic

1466
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,480
on autoflowers so i didn't get to go um

1467
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:54,000
so

1468
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,159
you'll have to tell me all about it so

1469
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,280
so so who's behind the autoflower

1470
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:02,558
cup and what have we seen so far

1471
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,040
so the 2019 cup was down in the grants

1472
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,280
pass

1473
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:08,079
oregon area it was put together by a

1474
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,200
gentleman of the name of james hastings

1475
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,680
james i wasn't too familiar with him

1476
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:14,159
before

1477
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,078
the word started buzzing around that

1478
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,318
this cup was going to be put together

1479
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,680
um they put the cup together for five

1480
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:21,838
days down

1481
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:23,519
in oregon on a campground that was

1482
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:26,639
cannabis friendly which was really

1483
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:28,400
really amazing and honestly the things

1484
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,078
that i take from that experience were

1485
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,519
one it was nice it was the first time

1486
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,400
that i've been around

1487
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,838
that kind of event um as far as like

1488
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,160
everybody's there for the same minded

1489
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:37,519
goal

1490
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,598
everybody's there to share their

1491
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:41,920
cannabis cultivation and

1492
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,280
you know exchange information and talk

1493
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,200
it was like bringing the forum

1494
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,559
alive because i got to meet a lot of

1495
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:47,199
people that i've only known screen names

1496
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,680
for years

1497
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:51,519
yeah you know and their personalities

1498
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:53,838
outside of that screen name was just an

1499
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:56,719
amazing

1500
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,920
way to see that they were the same way

1501
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,000
on the forum because they all cared

1502
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,400
about the plant and it was an experience

1503
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,838
like

1504
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,800
it'll be one of those ones for me to go

1505
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:06,639
down like i'll never forget it i met so

1506
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,720
many great people there was so much good

1507
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:10,159
food

1508
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:12,078
it could have been a little bit better

1509
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:13,440
planned for events over five days and

1510
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,680
i'm just being honest

1511
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,280
um you know we're pretty much willing

1512
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,799
free to roam anywhere down there because

1513
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,480
it's absolutely gorgeous there were

1514
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,800
lakes there are hiking trails

1515
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,159
all kinds of stuff to do but when it

1516
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,318
came down time for like you know

1517
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,920
competition and things like people were

1518
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:31,519
doing their testing and

1519
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,639
um you know it was basically people's

1520
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:34,480
choice you know there was

1521
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:37,039
we entered into it without all the hype

1522
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,440
i think that you sometimes see behind

1523
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,719
um larger competitions it was nice like

1524
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,318
a communal thing

1525
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:43,358
to where people that had been putting in

1526
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:44,558
all this work for all this time and

1527
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:45,440
talking to each other we were able to

1528
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,200
come out

1529
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,720
show our best and just have a good time

1530
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:51,039
over a long weekend

1531
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:52,159
yeah five days that's a really long time

1532
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:54,800
man i mean like even

1533
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:56,159
even a three day event feels long by the

1534
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,280
by day three

1535
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:01,838
but you know a five-day when you add

1536
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,720
um you know the campground and the

1537
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:04,318
forest

1538
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:06,078
and you know i can i mean we're in

1539
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:07,119
oregon so there are probably mushies

1540
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,839
everywhere

1541
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,440
um i can see how you know a good

1542
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:13,679
summertime camp out is

1543
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,639
is going to be even more than the cup

1544
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:16,078
it's more like a

1545
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:18,480
it actually sounds more like an

1546
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,640
autoflower rainbow gathering

1547
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,000
yeah i mean yeah to be completely honest

1548
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:24,159
with you

1549
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,838
know everybody you know enjoyed the the

1550
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:27,838
hikes and the fishing and

1551
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:29,199
um it was just kind of like this pow-wow

1552
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:30,880
with a award

1553
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:32,879
ceremony at the end and i think the

1554
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,720
reason it was done for five days is

1555
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,000
a lot of the stuff wasn't you know i've

1556
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:37,199
seen different

1557
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,880
uh framework as far as these

1558
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,159
competitions go where the flowers sent

1559
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,160
out way ahead of time

1560
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:43,838
and people have weeks to maul over the

1561
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:46,000
different stuff that they're looking at

1562
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:48,719
and i think this is what the one spot

1563
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,159
where it was lacking was because

1564
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:51,759
everything had to be tested over those

1565
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:52,558
five days so i think that's what gave it

1566
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,240
its length

1567
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,760
but i think that it could have been done

1568
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,639
a little sooner as far as testing

1569
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,640
because

1570
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,239
you know you depending on your amount of

1571
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:01,838
entries that's a lot of cannabis to get

1572
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:05,118
through without having some kind of like

1573
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:06,719
entre entres effect or you know overlap

1574
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,720
of what's going on

1575
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,799
yeah i hear that let's uh let's give

1576
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:13,759
some love to jeff lowenfels

1577
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,880
about his autoflower book too because um

1578
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,040
you know one of the one of the

1579
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,640
challenges the autoflower community has

1580
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,679
is just reaching

1581
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,000
outside of the autoflower community it's

1582
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:24,399
so

1583
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,880
insular and we you know we we trade

1584
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:29,519
genetics we trade stories we cherry

1585
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,160
best practices but most of it is kind of

1586
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:32,719
like uh

1587
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,719
inward focusing um which which kind of

1588
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:35,598
explodes the expansion of the scene

1589
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,519
which may be

1590
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,800
for the better right because it makes

1591
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:40,960
that um

1592
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,880
you know primarily authentic very

1593
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,240
interested people get involved but at

1594
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,880
the same time

1595
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,919
if we want the scene to grow and if we

1596
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,838
want people to buy

1597
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,358
autoflower seeds from the people putting

1598
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:52,480
in the work the word's got to get out

1599
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:53,759
there and then

1600
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,519
you know so anybody who doesn't know

1601
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,160
jeff lowenfels is

1602
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,039
um known as lord of the roots and he put

1603
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:03,920
out a

1604
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:03,920
seminal series of books

1605
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:07,598
all about living soil you've probably

1606
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:09,519
heard of teaming with microbes

1607
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,599
teeming with nutrition and teaming with

1608
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,639
fungi you know they are they are a

1609
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,440
baseline

1610
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:16,000
of understanding well growing anything

1611
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,240
in in

1612
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,440
soil but certainly growing cannabis in

1613
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:21,039
soil if you haven't read them you should

1614
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,440
check them out but

1615
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,719
jeff got all turned on to autoflowers

1616
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,039
living up in alaska

1617
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:28,318
and just generally being a you know 40

1618
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:31,519
plus year

1619
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:34,880
gardening nerd and so he put out um

1620
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:36,639
this book on autoflowers and um

1621
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,920
and it was an interesting book um why

1622
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:41,279
don't you tell us dan

1623
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,838
about the interesting direction um uh

1624
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,280
that that jeff took it and and who who

1625
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:48,799
his book ended up actually being

1626
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:51,920
for um you know in a show ended up being

1627
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,839
the introduction for people to give an

1628
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,760
autoflower a try for the first time

1629
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:57,358
and you know i have to laugh because you

1630
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,920
know i was excited about the book coming

1631
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:00,880
out and

1632
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,159
you know somebody with jeff's caliber

1633
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,039
stepping into the limelight with

1634
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,118
something that we

1635
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,880
that you were talking about we have been

1636
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,519
quote unquote in the shadows with for so

1637
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,960
long

1638
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:12,880
was amazing to see and you know you

1639
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,720
talked about how like it's so much

1640
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,920
you know inclusive with the autoflower

1641
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:18,000
community i think that's

1642
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,760
you know done wanted to you know done a

1643
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,440
couple things one like you said

1644
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,839
we haven't really got out there until

1645
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,800
somebody like jeff but two it's also

1646
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:27,838
created this

1647
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,599
weird um bond

1648
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:31,519
amongst the breeders and the people who

1649
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,480
take it passionately to kind of watch

1650
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,400
out for one another

1651
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,760
so it was kind of cool to see but jeff's

1652
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,000
exposure

1653
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,440
to the autoflower approached i think was

1654
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,358
great you know he joked with me i told

1655
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,119
him i was buying the book and i was

1656
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:45,119
honored enough to have a few pictures in

1657
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,640
there you know and that was awesome to

1658
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,240
me so of course i had to purchase it he

1659
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:50,078
kept telling me he's like no dan

1660
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:52,159
he's like this book isn't for you he's

1661
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,680
like it's not for people who

1662
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:55,358
already understand the cultivation of

1663
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:56,239
the autoflower it's for your aunt or

1664
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:57,838
your uncle

1665
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:59,439
or your crazy cousin who wants to get in

1666
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:01,599
there and start growing some

1667
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,880
homegrown and take an you know easier

1668
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,119
approach to it

1669
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,480
and you know i think jeff hit the nail

1670
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,920
on the head with that one

1671
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,838
he got it out there i've read through it

1672
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,760
a couple times and

1673
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:14,078
you know he's bait he's made a nice

1674
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,400
introductory way of people to

1675
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,079
know what an autoflower is see the basic

1676
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,519
mechanics of the plant and what to do

1677
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,559
with it when it's done

1678
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:24,239
and not just with jeff sir i got to say

1679
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,440
you know you stepping out into the

1680
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,439
limelight

1681
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,798
um with the several different seminars

1682
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,880
that you have done

1683
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:32,079
to discuss auto flowering plants you

1684
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,119
know you

1685
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:37,920
between jeff and yourself you have given

1686
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:40,400
the autoflower community

1687
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,599
that outward shining light that hey

1688
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,680
these guys are over here doing

1689
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,359
miraculous things we see it we love it

1690
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:46,399
we think you guys should love it too and

1691
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:48,798
this is why

1692
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,838
and i think your approach with the live

1693
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:52,079
seminars and

1694
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:53,358
the shaping fire recordings that you

1695
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,720
have done about the autoflowers is

1696
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:56,480
really given a broader

1697
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,318
spectrum of what we're trying to do and

1698
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,838
what they can do for

1699
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:02,400
either a commercial setting or the home

1700
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:04,318
grower and patient right on dude well

1701
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,160
first thanks for saying that but but i

1702
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:07,358
think that jeff and i come from the same

1703
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:10,399
place where

1704
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:13,039
we are both like giddy

1705
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,680
and excited about autoflowers and what

1706
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:18,079
it can do for home growers and patients

1707
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:19,759
and um we you know neither of us are

1708
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:22,000
breeders but we're so excited about it

1709
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,079
we wanted to talk to people about it so

1710
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,119
you know he he wrote a book about it

1711
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:29,599
that was how he

1712
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:31,680
you know voiced himself and for me i i

1713
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,960
programmed all of 2019 with like

1714
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,879
autoflower events

1715
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,720
that were free for folks and stuff and

1716
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,480
that was what i was able to do but

1717
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:40,879
i think in the end we all want the same

1718
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,280
thing we want we want the breeders to

1719
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,880
get the recognition that they deserve

1720
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,319
for the hard work that they're putting

1721
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,519
in and these beautiful plants they're

1722
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:51,440
designing

1723
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:54,000
and we want to make sure that people

1724
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,798
who have any kind of interest in growing

1725
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,440
cannabis

1726
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:59,440
have can grow cannabis so they know how

1727
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:02,480
to get into it because

1728
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,079
you know hell we all want cannabis to be

1729
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,400
in gardens as commonly

1730
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:08,400
as tomatoes and the only way we can do

1731
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,280
that is if we've got you know breeders

1732
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,079
breeding

1733
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,119
and people you know like like jeff and i

1734
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,680
and you

1735
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,200
telling people that it's happening so so

1736
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:19,919
that's cool and also you know

1737
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:20,960
there's nothing like um uh throwing

1738
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,240
events

1739
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,440
um uh to be able to meet new cultivators

1740
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:28,239
right because like i met

1741
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,559
so many great people um you know like

1742
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:30,719
like

1743
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,720
like for example at uh uh indo expo i

1744
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:34,558
was giving a talk on on autoflowers and

1745
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:36,239
why she people should try them and

1746
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,079
and daz was there you know and like you

1747
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:39,358
know i had heard about dazmofisto and

1748
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,839
followed him and stuff and

1749
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:43,199
and he came up after the after the talk

1750
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:43,920
and he's all like hey man nice to meet

1751
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:45,519
you and

1752
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,519
you know it wasn't my best performance

1753
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:49,039
but it was you know it was cool to turn

1754
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,400
people on to stuff but it was nice to

1755
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:52,558
meet people who

1756
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,400
um i look up to in the scene like dads

1757
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,200
right you know good folks who are doing

1758
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,119
good work

1759
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:00,519
and i think that's that's part of what

1760
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:03,519
makes um autoflowers so good is because

1761
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:06,318
everybody has been so ignored

1762
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:08,318
for so long that really there aren't a

1763
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:10,000
lot of [ __ ] in the scene people are

1764
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:13,279
really nice to each other

1765
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,639
because um we've all been on the edges

1766
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,480
for so long

1767
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:18,000
yeah and i agree and that's that second

1768
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,760
part i was talking about earlier is just

1769
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,119
kind of it's formed a bond between all

1770
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,280
of us to where

1771
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,280
yeah i i haven't i've met a few that

1772
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,599
were a little persnickety but i've never

1773
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,400
met

1774
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:30,079
like um that elitist mentality it's like

1775
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,440
okay you've experienced this and you've

1776
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,519
worked with him in this long

1777
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,119
and you've seen that but we can both

1778
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:36,079
avoid that by doing this at the other

1779
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,240
it's it's it's

1780
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,440
almost like the forums have shifted into

1781
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:41,679
real life

1782
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,720
um because one of the main mindsets that

1783
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:45,759
we wanted to create

1784
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:48,399
on the autoflower network was

1785
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,680
a lack of better term a safe place where

1786
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,358
you come in and share that knowledge and

1787
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:53,759
you're not going to get

1788
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:55,039
you know barked at by 15 20 other people

1789
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,319
telling you you're stupid and that

1790
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:59,199
autoflowers are [ __ ]

1791
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:01,279
yeah you know it was a place and it was

1792
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,239
amazing to watch the morphology of that

1793
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,240
too because

1794
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:05,919
after that tone was set and the site

1795
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:08,239
started to gain its momentum

1796
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,960
like the admin didn't have to step in

1797
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:10,959
the the

1798
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,400
the general population by going there's

1799
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,960
no room for that here we're not here for

1800
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,119
that and

1801
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,318
it's cool to hear you see that come out

1802
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,640
in real life too

1803
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:19,838
yeah i absolutely do um you know the

1804
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:21,838
autoflower network

1805
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:23,440
while i don't um spend a lot of time

1806
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:25,679
there because i don't um

1807
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,720
breed i love just going and reading

1808
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:29,039
threads to learn

1809
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:30,399
best growing practices and honestly for

1810
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:32,719
the jokes

1811
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,318
oh absolutely because it's like the

1812
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:36,719
folks there are really funny

1813
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:38,480
so um all right so so let's go ahead and

1814
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:40,239
take our second break when we come back

1815
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,880
we're gonna talk about

1816
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:43,838
um uh breeding with autoflowers and

1817
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,880
we're not gonna go

1818
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:51,440
into it heavy duty uh science approach

1819
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:54,079
but but i do want to talk about um

1820
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,720
why breeding autoflowers is are

1821
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,079
different

1822
00:59:54,719 --> 01:00:00,639
some of the unexpected challenges and

1823
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,760
uh and mostly why why we need to make

1824
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,960
sure we have respect for these

1825
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,440
autoflower breeders because

1826
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,798
because this is not super easy uh we're

1827
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,200
gonna take a short break and be right

1828
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:09,199
back

1829
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:11,279

guest today is dan jimmy of mandalorian

1831
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:17,200
genetics and the autoflower network

1832
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,519
as a business owner you are incredibly

1833
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:21,279
busy in reality you are responsible for

1834
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:23,199
everything your company does you've got

1835
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,599
so many responsibilities every single

1836
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:25,118
day

1837
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,119
that often you just don't have the time

1838
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,720
to really dig into your marketing as

1839
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,838
deeply as you'd like

1840
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:31,519
you know there's more that you could do

1841
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:32,000
to reach out to new customers and

1842
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:33,440
encourage

1843
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,119
loyalty and the customers you already

1844
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,880
have but you certainly don't have the

1845
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:39,200
time for it and you're not ready to hire

1846
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,079

packaging and website very pretty but

1854
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,400
they leave responsibility for improving

1855
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,440
your bottom line up to you

1856
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,358
they don't want that kind of

1857
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,000
responsibility but that's pretty much

1858
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:02,318
the most

1859
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,838

and keep them coming back to you and

1865
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:13,679
telling their friends

1866
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:15,679
now if you happen to be a new cannabis

1867

company or an established company moving

1868

kirsten especially can help you not only

1870
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,798

whole plant medicine terpenes heritage

1875
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,318
check out what she did recently for moon

1877
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:38,000
moon time medicinals.com kirsten and her

1878
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,920
team put together

1879
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,358
a whole brand package for them built

1880
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,400
their website and wrote their sales

1881
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:44,078
materials

1882
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,519
no doubt this is a paid commercial spot

1883
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,318
but that does not mean they bought my

1884
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:48,239
opinion

1885
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:49,759
i've worked with blunt branding on five

1886
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:50,558
projects now for various of their

1887
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,160
clients and

1888
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:53,519
every single time they have done more

1889
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:54,960
than they have promised and over

1890
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:57,038
delivered on results

1891
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,880
i love how they generate new revenue and

1892
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:01,039
focus on that as the goal instead of

1893
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,880
just making a pretty logo

1894
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,559
similarly every single friend i have

1895
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,880
referred them to has come back to thank

1896

me

1897
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,798
and that just does not happen every day

1898
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,079

01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,640
get a male plant i like and a

2000
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:13,838
female plant i like and i put them near

2001
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:15,838
each other or i

2002
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:17,679
or i apply some pollen with a paintbrush

2003
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:18,318
and oh i've made seeds for next year and

2004
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:20,239
that's just

2005
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:21,358
fun right it makes me feel closer to the

2006
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:23,838
plant

2007
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:25,838
but when i started listening to breeders

2008
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:29,279
talk about breeding autoflowers i'm

2009
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:30,318
like oh hell no that sounds like a lot

2010
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:32,480
of work

2011
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:34,558
and um and the thing is is that for the

2012
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,679
for the passionate people i know in the

2013
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:37,920
in the breeding community for

2014
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:38,879
autoflowers they ain't no thing to them

2015
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,159
they're like oh no

2016
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,680
well this is just expected to get

2017
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:43,679
something good and i like and i love

2018
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:44,719
them for it because i get to pop their

2019
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,879
seeds

2020
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:49,598
but i think it's a good thing for for

2021
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,440
growers to know what's behind the secret

2022
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,960
sauce so they can you know properly

2023
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,200
value these seeds

2024
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,318
so so dan why don't you like walk us

2025
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,480
through um

2026
01:05:56,318 --> 01:05:59,838
what the breeding of an autoflower looks

2027
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,358
like

2028
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:02,639
yeah i'll approach it um in two

2029
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:03,279
different ways and we'll keep it you

2030
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:04,639
know like you

2031
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,760
look at a high level here that way we

2032
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:09,199
can get a generalistic understanding um

2033
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,880
you know you did mention and i'll start

2034
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:12,399
with the simplicity first

2035
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,880
um you did mention about you know you

2036
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,559
take your favorite cultivar and

2037
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,160
male and then female put them beside

2038
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,119
each other and then you get seeds from

2039
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:22,480
that run

2040
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:24,400
and autoflower to autoflower is pretty

2041
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,240
much going to do that for you

2042
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,720
if you're somebody who is wanting to

2043
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:31,118
experience pollen chucking to see

2044
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:33,759
how this takes place if you have a

2045
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:35,358
percent auto flower female and 100 auto

2046
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,960
flower male

2047
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:39,838
and you let them pollinate each other

2048
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:43,440
you will get 100 auto flowering seeds

2049
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:44,159
now with that said um you're gonna get a

2050
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,519
lot of genetic

2051
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:47,358
variety you're gonna see a lot of

2052
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:50,318
different things so expect

2053
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:52,318
all kinds of different phenotypical

2054
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:54,318
expressions showing up in that seed

2055
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:56,000
but at a high level if you just want to

2056
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:57,519
experience that process and

2057
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,679
you know be self-sufficient and make

2058
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:00,159
your own seeds that's one way you can

2059
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:03,038
approach

2060
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:04,798
it now the more in-depth side of it and

2061
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:08,480
it's a side that you were talking about

2062
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:11,838
with the complexity levels is i think

2063
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:14,159
the breeder or the more current breeders

2064
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:16,000
approach to it is

2065
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,078
taking a photo period male or female and

2066
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,639
introducing it to an autoflower

2067
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:22,720
now when you do so you have a lot of

2068
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:23,838
work to do and what i mean by that is

2069
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:25,759
you have generation

2070
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:27,038
generational selections that have to

2071
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,559
take place

2072
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:32,720
in order for you to make that plant a

2073
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:35,760
true autoflower

2074
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:37,838
i think a lot of the earlier autoflowers

2075
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,200
that were done this way were done with

2076
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:40,880
the expectation of

2077
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:43,279
bringing out the autoflowering trait

2078
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,640
first and i can understand that you know

2079
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,160
like we were talking earlier

2080
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:48,000
the hype strains you want to get that

2081
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:49,598
fast flowering cookies out there or the

2082
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,519
flash flowering gmo

2083
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:54,079
and the quickest way to do that is

2084
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:55,679
inbreed or you know make your initial

2085
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,200
parental selections and then inbreed

2086
01:07:55,679 --> 01:08:01,038
looking for the autoflower trait

2087
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:02,798
only if you're looking more to change

2088
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,400
the morphology and get rid of a lot of

2089
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:07,119
the ruderalis i think there's a lot more

2090
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:09,920
of a selection process that has to go on

2091
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:11,920
and with that selection process i'll

2092
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,000
cover that a little bit your initial

2093
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,680
cross is going to give you your f1 seeds

2094
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,838
those f1 seeds

2095
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:20,318
are going to be primarily dominant in

2096
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:22,000
the photo period lines genetic makeup

2097
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:25,120
it's going to be very rare for you to

2098
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,359
see a fully auto flowering

2099
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:29,439
expression out of that first round of

2100
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:31,600
seeds so then you ask yourself well

2101
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:33,439
what do i do to make that show up the

2102
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,199
best option there is to inbreed that

2103
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:37,039
line and what i mean by that

2104
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:38,719
is you take a male and a female from

2105
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,759
that first generation

2106
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,399
and and breed them together giving you

2107
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:46,000
your

2108
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:47,838
f2 generation at the f2 generation

2109
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,319
you're going to start seeing

2110
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:52,880
similarities from mom similarities from

2111
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,400
dad you may even see some autoflowering

2112
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,359
expression

2113
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:58,479
now with that i will caution you back to

2114
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:00,880
what we were talking about

2115
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:02,559
you know breeding quickly for just the

2116
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,600
autoflowering trait if you're that's

2117
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,400
your end goal

2118
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,039
let's start looking at the f2 and if you

2119
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:08,960
find

2120
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:10,960
you know one that is going to go full

2121
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,279
autoflower and one that kind of stalls

2122
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,679
out

2123
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:16,080
from the autoflower it'll grow up it'll

2124
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:17,440
start to pre-flower it'll go into what i

2125
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:19,679
call bud set

2126
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:21,519
and then it needs 1212 to finish its

2127
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,960
light cycle

2128
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,319
at that point i think that would be a

2129
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,679
good selection for you if you're just

2130
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,480
hunting something that's going to come

2131
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:28,640
out

2132
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:29,919
in an autoflower fashion that would be

2133
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,719
my next round

2134
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,719
to select from if you're looking to kind

2135
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:36,719
of incorporate you know what you really

2136
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:38,560
liked about the photoperiod mom

2137
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,399
but you want just the autoflowering

2138
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:43,359
genetic from the father

2139
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:45,439
or vice versa i think you need to start

2140
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:47,359
really digging into

2141
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:49,759
your seed count at that point at the f2

2142
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:53,120
look for something that's

2143
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:55,119
doing the stall on both sexes both male

2144
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:57,840
female and then push that to the third

2145
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:59,119
you know generation and at the third

2146
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,880
generation you could

2147
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:02,640
probably start seeing a little bit more

2148
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:05,760
of a balance between

2149
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,039
auto flowering and some that still may

2150
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,440
be photo period

2151
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:11,439
and then you can start picking at that

2152
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,519
point based upon your terpene profiles

2153
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:14,158
your flower densities your expressions

2154
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,000
of

2155
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:17,599
leaf color whatever your you know

2156
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,679
tickles your fancy

2157
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:24,400
and then making your f4 by f4 if you

2158
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:26,399
select in that manner you should see

2159
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:27,439
really close to 100 autoflowering

2160
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:29,599
genetics

2161
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:31,759
um it's a little bit more time intensive

2162
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,280
it's a lot more sifting through seeds

2163
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,960
and there's a good possibility if you

2164
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:36,000
pick up that nature or if you pick up

2165
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,198
that direction

2166
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,119
that you're going to have to go through

2167
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:41,519
quite a few seeds to find what you want

2168
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:43,198
if you want a true if you want to

2169
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:47,120
represent both parents truthfully

2170
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:50,479
i believe so if it takes to f4

2171
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:53,519
just to get all of the seeds to

2172
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:53,519
be autoflower

2173
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:57,198
do we have to go further than that to

2174
01:10:56,079 --> 01:11:00,079
also

2175
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:00,719
lock down some of the individual tray or

2176
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:03,198
like the

2177
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,719
like like taste traits shall we say like

2178
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:06,960
do you need to do

2179
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:09,279
can you be selecting for both at the

2180
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:12,560
same time can you be selecting

2181
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:16,238
for both the autoflower traits and the

2182
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:20,080
um you know yield and

2183
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:24,238
potency traits at the same time or do

2184
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:25,439
do you need to choose which ones first

2185
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:27,198
i think you could do it all at the same

2186
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:28,479
time if you know you're taking good

2187
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:29,198
notes and you know what you're hunting

2188
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:31,279
you know

2189
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:33,439
i'm guessing you need a big sift too as

2190
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:35,359
i'm asking the question i'm all like oh

2191
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:37,279
you can you can choose for both if

2192
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:38,960
you've got a lot to work with and so

2193
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:40,880
if you're if you're if you're gonna

2194
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,158
you're trying to do this with 20 seeds

2195
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,359
you're going to be a lot more limited

2196
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:44,879
than if you're trying to do this with

2197
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,000
200 seeds

2198
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,279
that's correct and that's what i was

2199
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,319
talking about earlier you know having

2200
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:50,079
that sift and

2201
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:52,319
also you know if you're wanting to do a

2202
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:54,960
true photo to autocross you know have

2203
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:58,559
your end goal and have your mindset

2204
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:00,800
you know where you want to be at the end

2205
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,480
and you can definitely do that sifting

2206
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,920
and hunt out the multiple traits you

2207
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:05,759
know you see one that goes

2208
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,039
to pre-flower and stalls but it has a

2209
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,000
leaf structure you want it's got a

2210
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:10,238
balance on each side

2211
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,238
that you want it the plant itself looks

2212
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:13,119
balanced you see some nice symmetry in

2213
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:14,559
the plant

2214
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:15,599
and then you might have color from the

2215
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,480
other one you're like okay i want the

2216
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,920
color too

2217
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:20,639
and you could do that as part of your

2218
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,480
sift and i think that's what's creating

2219
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,079
the more modern day autoflower i think

2220
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:26,639
that's what a lot more

2221
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:27,679
the approach is rather than seeing a lot

2222
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,199
of you know

2223
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:30,800
new stuff come out that's yeah it's

2224
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:32,079
autoflower but it still kind of looks

2225
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,159
like root or alice but it's

2226
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:36,079
had a different photo parent that wasn't

2227
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:38,238
worked as in depth

2228
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:39,279
you know needing to work something to f4

2229
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:40,959
or further

2230
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:42,559
you know is definitely further if you're

2231
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,039
not going to have a lot of sift

2232
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,760
um that that means that you're going to

2233
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:51,119
be doing

2234
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:53,039
a lot of cycles and selecting um

2235
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:54,800
is it a fair assumption to say that a

2236
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:57,279
lot more of the autoflower folks

2237
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,640
are incorporating indoor uh breeding

2238
01:12:57,279 --> 01:12:59,920
over the winters because like you know

2239
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,880
with a lot of the

2240
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:04,000
a lot of the um photoperiod stuff um

2241
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,239
people can just grow

2242
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,479
outdoors during the summer and get work

2243
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:10,238
done enough that over a couple seasons

2244
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:12,000
though they can develop something really

2245
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:15,599
good for the outdoor

2246
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,279
but if you need to get to f4 before

2247
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,719
all of your seeds are even showing the

2248
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:21,759
autoflower trait

2249
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:24,000
that tells me that um you know to get

2250
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,600
to get anything done in your lifetime

2251
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,399
you're going to need to be growing

2252
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,760
in you know multiple tents indoors at

2253
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:32,000
the same time

2254
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,600
as you're you're watching for

2255
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,600
expressions under the sun during the

2256
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,199
summer and testing

2257
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,120
that's absolutely correct i think that's

2258
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:41,279
the one key thing that we need

2259
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:43,198
as breeders is the indoor space

2260
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:44,559
separated space especially

2261
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:46,399
because i mean yes pollen is highly

2262
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,080
volatile but there are easy steps to

2263
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:51,759
contain and control that

2264
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:54,079
um but it does take

2265
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,119
around the clock year-round work

2266
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:56,559
especially if you're working on

2267
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:58,719
something new and i

2268
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,480
you did ask um in the earlier question

2269
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:02,079
and i didn't touch on it but i i'd like

2270
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:03,919
to is you asked about like

2271
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:05,519
continuing the f generations for

2272
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,800
stabilization and to answer that

2273
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,840
question is yes

2274
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:12,960
um a lot of the work that i have done

2275
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:17,119
um is in the neighborhoods of s6

2276
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:19,840
f7 f8 and f9

2277
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:21,119
and then really around f5 or f6 i'm

2278
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,840
starting to see that

2279
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:25,599
balance across so not only do you have

2280
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,440
the years of work or the time frame of

2281
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,520
work just to get what you want

2282
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:31,359
then you have to stabilize it to a point

2283
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,400
where it's become

2284
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:36,319
that same or close to same cultivar

2285
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:38,079
expression across the ten pack that way

2286
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:39,599
it's not like pokemon and you open it up

2287
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:43,359
and there's 15 different types

2288
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:46,159
and i like to steal that one from you

2289
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:48,079
i i said that yeah i i'm pretty sure you

2290
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:50,479
had a meme on that at one point in time

2291
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:51,760
oh yeah i did that's funny all those

2292
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:52,959
different animals together ah dude

2293
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:56,320
that's funny

2294
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:58,560
um all right so so now that people are

2295
01:14:56,319 --> 01:15:00,960
getting an idea of what it would take

2296
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,480
um i'm sure that people are falling into

2297
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,520
at least two categories there's one

2298
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:05,759
category

2299
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,560
of folks who you know they just want to

2300
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,760
understand

2301
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,320
autoflowers because they're going to

2302
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,440
grow some and they want to sound cool

2303
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:13,359
talking with their friends about

2304
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:15,599
autoflowers and then there's another

2305
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:17,279
basket which are people who are like

2306
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,360
okay i want to try breeding some

2307
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:21,039
autoflowers i've got this idea i want to

2308
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:21,599
do i've got these tastes i want to bring

2309
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:24,560
out

2310
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,320
um what would you tell what what are the

2311
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,760
steps that you would tell somebody to do

2312
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:30,158
if they wanted to

2313
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,840
um get involved i'm assuming that

2314
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:34,559
there's probably a thread

2315
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,199
on autoflower net that's dedicated this

2316
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,679
and then

2317
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:40,000
and then what are people using as the

2318
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:41,119
ruderalis input nowadays i'm sure that

2319
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,319
there's

2320
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:46,238
you know some kind of stabilized option

2321
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:48,639
that most people are working with that's

2322
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:50,479
hard to screw up

2323
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:52,079
um i think a majority and i'll answer

2324
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:54,718
that part first so like

2325
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:55,519
the majority of the people i think are

2326
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:57,600
using

2327
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,120
predefined autoflowering genetics that

2328
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,840
have been worked for years i don't think

2329
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:03,840
a lot of people are going back to

2330
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:06,000
pure root oralists for their foundation

2331
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,279
because that takes a lot of work

2332
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,719
it takes a whole lot of work because

2333
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:10,800
you're not only just hunting the

2334
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:13,119
autoflower

2335
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:15,039
trait from the original reuteralis what

2336
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:16,880
you're also dealing with is all of the

2337
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:21,439
other genetic recessive traits of

2338
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:25,199
low potency bad yield funky growth

2339
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:26,799
um so if they are wanting to learn about

2340
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:28,799
it i definitely think you know get out

2341
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,880
there and find some regular seeds and

2342
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,640
put them side by side to understand it

2343
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,000
if they want to get into the depth i

2344
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,480
would get out there and i would

2345
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,359
look for you know reputable breeders

2346
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,639
especially

2347
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:40,479
independent breeders because the

2348
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,280
independent breeders tend to have more

2349
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:43,119
regulars

2350
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:45,599
which i was talking about before which

2351
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:47,279
are really really hard to find

2352
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,199
you don't have a lot of people out there

2353
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:51,759
offering regular autoflowers these days

2354
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:53,678
and to have a foundation

2355
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,159
without the complexity of understanding

2356
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:59,520
how to feminize a seed

2357
01:16:56,158 --> 01:17:01,759
you need to have a male counterpart

2358
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,360
let me i want to i'm going to plug heart

2359
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,560
rock mountain right now because that's

2360
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,559
where i've been uh

2361
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,920
his seeds and your seeds are the are the

2362
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,719
stuff that i've been getting that's

2363
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,560
regular

2364
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:13,279
and it's actually kind of an interesting

2365
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,199
upside i'm a big fan of the dragonfly

2366
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:16,238
earth medicine uh regenerative

2367
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:19,439
agriculture

2368
01:17:16,238 --> 01:17:22,399
techniques certification and

2369
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:23,359
at the moment most of their people are

2370
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:26,000
are shying away

2371
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:27,920
from from making feminized seeds and so

2372
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,719
they're putting out lots of autoflowers

2373
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,760
but they're all

2374
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:33,439
rags and so if you can find um

2375
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,440
a seed breeder who's playing with

2376
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:36,479
autoflowers that's also dragonfly

2377
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:40,319
certified

2378
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:43,678
it's like hitting a gold rush oh i agree

2379
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:44,639
yeah totally i um his um hard rock

2380
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:47,760
mountain

2381
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:49,679
uh farms uh their uh their lions claws

2382
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,719
one of the first ones that i personally

2383
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:53,359
came across

2384
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,800
that truly hits like funk and gas i i

2385
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:56,238
don't know why and maybe it's just the

2386
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,159
stuff that i've grown i've probably only

2387
01:17:56,238 --> 01:18:01,198
grown 45 or 50

2388
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:02,000
autoflower cultivars but do you find gas

2389
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:04,479
is kind of

2390
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,840
still missing in autoflowers i don't i

2391
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:07,519
don't i haven't come across

2392
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,279
you know i come across like you know you

2393
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:11,600
know the sweets and the candies and the

2394
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:12,479
bubble gums and the and even the cheeses

2395
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,719
and the northern

2396
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:17,759
um cheese hazes and stuff but but i

2397
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:20,239
don't i haven't found a ton of gas

2398
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,760
i personally haven't either i've got a

2399
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:23,599
few different cultivars and i got one

2400
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:26,159
that smells like acetone

2401
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,920
and it was the first chemically chemical

2402
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:29,599
smelling autoflower that

2403
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,440
i had ever personally experienced and

2404
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,719
i've you know obviously been to a few

2405
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:34,399
different events i've got friends that

2406
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:35,520
have been growing auto cultivars for

2407
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:37,519
years and you're right

2408
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:40,400
the floral the berries the fruits the

2409
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:42,960
candies are really coming out from them

2410
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:43,839
but i think the more modern day auto is

2411
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,000
leaning that way

2412
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,279
because they're getting the the breeders

2413
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,600
that are working with them

2414
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:51,198
are the ones that are taking their time

2415
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,320
are in search of those terpenes so i

2416
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:53,759
definitely think we're going to start

2417
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:54,000
seeing more of a gassy because that's

2418
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,239
one

2419
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,319
thing that i've been approached and

2420
01:18:56,238 --> 01:18:59,599
asked the most honestly by

2421
01:18:58,319 --> 01:19:01,679
people that are interested in growing

2422
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,640
these in large scale is so where are the

2423
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:04,480
terpenes at

2424
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,400
where's the gas at like we want that

2425
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:09,119
fuel smell because that's

2426
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:10,639
what the public wants and i even think

2427
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:11,760
even the home grower wants that for a

2428
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:15,360
nostalgic reason

2429
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:17,440
you know because that's a very common um

2430
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:18,559
nose profile that we we often associate

2431
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:19,919
to cannabis and

2432
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,320
it's getting there but i don't think

2433
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,560
it's full-fledged hammered there yet

2434
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:26,158
i think we still have some work to do

2435
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,800
yeah i think that you're right on that

2436
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:28,639
and so

2437
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:31,039
let's use that to transition here to

2438
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:34,159
kind of a wrap up where do you see

2439
01:19:31,039 --> 01:19:36,319
the autoflower scene uh going right now

2440
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:37,759
what are the major trends that you think

2441
01:19:36,319 --> 01:19:39,759
are going to play themselves out over

2442
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,679
the next couple years

2443
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,800
number one is just the uprise in the

2444
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:44,800
homegrow

2445
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,640
i'm part of a bunch of different groups

2446
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,039
about two different forums

2447
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,000
and you know i can see as each new state

2448
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:51,439
is going legal

2449
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,279
either medicinally or adding

2450
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:54,399
recreational to their medicinal

2451
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:56,960
certified you know

2452
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:58,158
legalities a lot of home growers really

2453
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,640
starting to pick it up because they can

2454
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:01,599
literally put a 2x4 tent in their closet

2455
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:04,159
with an led

2456
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,679
and get at it you know i remember back

2457
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:06,799
in the day we would grow them in pc

2458
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:09,600
cases

2459
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,920
um because you mean like computer cases

2460
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,520
yeah

2461
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,600
so i would just you know take a large

2462
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,679
computer case got the internals

2463
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:18,400
rig up some you know fluorescent lights

2464
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:21,520
inside of it and let it go to town wow

2465
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:23,119
um you know so seeing the plant evolve

2466
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,239
from that into the home grow i

2467
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:25,760
definitely think that's we're going to

2468
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:26,638
see a huge influx there and i'm already

2469
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,320
seeing it

2470
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:32,079
um based upon instagram and

2471
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:33,519
like i said a few other platforms you

2472
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:35,279
really see the home growers

2473
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,520
grabbing a hold of the autoflower

2474
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:39,198
especially now the states are legal and

2475
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,960
the second wave and what i'm really

2476
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:44,799
seeing is supplemental for

2477
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:46,399
farming um especially and i'll talk

2478
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,760
specifically to our climate

2479
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:51,279
um our climate in this northern section

2480
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,000
is similar to the one that's over in

2481
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:54,800
maine

2482
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,158
and you know kind of central us michigan

2483
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:59,440
and stuff like that

2484
01:20:56,158 --> 01:21:00,079
and i'm seeing farmers use them to

2485
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:02,319
supplement

2486
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:04,158
either their veg space during the winter

2487
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:05,679
because they're an all outdoor facility

2488
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:06,960
and they veg their moms over the winter

2489
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:07,520
they do their cuttings and stuff like

2490
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,760
that

2491
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:11,520
and they're producing a yield during the

2492
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,719
same time they're flowering out or not

2493
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,960
flowering out excuse me

2494
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:16,399
vegging out their next year's crop

2495
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:18,239
indoor facilities are

2496
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:19,679
filling their mother rooms with

2497
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:21,039
autoflowers while they're waiting for

2498
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:22,639
their clones to take

2499
01:21:21,039 --> 01:21:25,439
and get ready for the bloom room it's

2500
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:29,039
adding another layer of

2501
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:30,319
revenue for the company with extremely

2502
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:32,399
low overhead costs

2503
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:33,759
because as you as and i know and jeff

2504
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:36,158
speaks about it in the book

2505
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,000
they don't need a lot of food now there

2506
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:38,559
i'll caveat that there are a few out

2507
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,479
there

2508
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,000
you know as the selective breeding is

2509
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:43,519
taking place that

2510
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,198
they do need some food they need a

2511
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,560
little bit more attention but i think

2512
01:21:45,198 --> 01:21:49,759
that's with any kind of plant

2513
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:52,159
but i'm seeing that wave hit the

2514
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:53,440
the farm the large scale farm market too

2515
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:54,879
from coast to coast

2516
01:21:53,439 --> 01:21:56,879
it's really interesting to see how

2517
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,639
they're being used as a tool and some of

2518
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,119
them are selling it as flour and some of

2519
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:00,719
them are

2520
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:02,158
a lot of them are doing it for extracts

2521
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:05,600
maybe rosin

2522
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:07,039
maybe for cartridges for edibles

2523
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,800
see a lot of different options happening

2524
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:10,000
with it so i'm seeing those two direct

2525
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:14,239
avenues really starting to

2526
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:16,719
move through with the auto

2527
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:17,599
wave so to speak it's really interesting

2528
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:20,800
to see

2529
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:22,079
folks who ordinarily would not be into

2530
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,079
autoflowers

2531
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:25,840
suddenly warm up to them and start

2532
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:28,158
growing in them when they realize

2533
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,199
that you know if you start your auto

2534
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:32,399
flowers

2535
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:34,799
um early in may that they'll finish

2536
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:35,679
uh in the same time of year that a light

2537
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,440
depth would

2538
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:40,639
and so you actually have flour to bring

2539
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:42,479
to the market that's uh fresh and usable

2540
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:43,840
maybe even just um you know if you're

2541
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:46,000
doing outdoors on

2542
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,119
a on a less quality part of your

2543
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,560
property because

2544
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:50,960
because they actually you know being

2545
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,080
from siberia a lot of these plants like

2546
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,880
really like to be

2547
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:57,119
abused and have stones in the soil and

2548
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,719
like just be kind of ganky soil

2549
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:00,639
but then you know other folks who are

2550
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:01,359
doing indoor they realize that oh wow we

2551
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:04,159
can grow

2552
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:04,719
ottos in our mother room or in our veg

2553
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:07,439
tent

2554
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:08,880
you know because they are they are light

2555
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:10,238
independent

2556
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,520
correct and you know i mean you're

2557
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:12,158
vegging out and you're holding your

2558
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,639
mothers at

2559
01:23:12,158 --> 01:23:16,399
either 18 6 or 24 any kind of higher

2560
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:17,679
variation and these guys are just

2561
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:18,879
going through their mechanics and they

2562
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:20,639
just need a little bit of water along

2563
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,719
the way

2564
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:23,760
yeah absolutely i think that is i think

2565
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:27,279
that as they are

2566
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,880
increasingly picked up um by

2567
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:30,880
i don't know let's let's let's call them

2568
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:33,840
commercial taste makers right

2569
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:35,600
as as the bigger players are are

2570
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,319
bringing out autoflowers

2571
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,199
you know early season offerings you know

2572
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:42,719
i think that

2573
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:44,638
um you know the last vested vestiges of

2574
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:46,560
autoflower

2575
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:48,000
taboo will go away and it's just going

2576
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,800
to be part of the scene it's going to be

2577
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,399
like you know

2578
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,000
you know regs light depth and

2579
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,319
autoflowers and it's it's they're all

2580
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,639
going to be on the same playing field

2581
01:23:54,319 --> 01:23:57,759
i would love to see that um and like you

2582
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:59,600
said a minute ago it's

2583
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:01,600
you know slowly changing one mind at a

2584
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,880
time some people that were so hell-bent

2585
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,719
about

2586
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:06,719
you know oh it's ditch weed oh it's just

2587
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:09,840
that you know it's low rider

2588
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:11,520
to actually watching them grow and then

2589
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,199
they see it and they're like holy [ __ ]

2590
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,000
okay so yeah it's not the same thing

2591
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:15,599
anymore

2592
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,279
and that's usually all it takes if you

2593
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,679
can get the a person who is a

2594
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:22,800
disbeliever and say here

2595
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:25,359
here's 50 seats grow them

2596
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,000
let me know what you think you know and

2597
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:28,000
that

2598
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,840
usually helps turn the mind around and

2599
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,359
you know providing pictures and coas you

2600
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:34,239
know that that really helps too

2601
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:35,039
because you know your commercial taste

2602
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:37,599
makers

2603
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:38,399
uh love to see numbers and when they see

2604
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,560
numbers and

2605
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:41,920
and everything lines up to their model i

2606
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,760
think they're more apt to do so and i

2607
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,279
hate that sometimes it takes that depth

2608
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,440
of transition

2609
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:48,880
but sometimes it just does some people

2610
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:50,000
are open to it yeah we'll give it a shot

2611
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,880
other people need a little bit more

2612
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,319
proof

2613
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,319
but they're slowly coming around it's

2614
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:56,158
nice to see yeah you give to use your

2615
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:57,119
example you give somebody 50 seeds and

2616
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:59,759
they look at it

2617
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:00,960
they will look at autoflowers all with

2618
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,560
new eyes

2619
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,480
because they'll see a couple different

2620
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,880
phenos some of which they'll like

2621
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:08,238
they'll see the increased consistency

2622
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,480
versus what it was like before

2623
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:12,399
2010 and then they'll smoke it and go

2624
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:14,479
like damn though this is really good

2625
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:16,559
especially since you know it's it's a

2626
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:17,119
misnomer that potency is the end-all

2627
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:20,000
anyway

2628
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:22,079
like thc potency and a lot you know you

2629
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,279
can get stuff in the mid-teens with good

2630
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:25,679
terpene profiles

2631
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:27,599
that just give you a fantastic buzz you

2632
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:30,560
know people who are demanding you know

2633
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:32,079
you know 28 29 30 i think they're

2634
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,960
missing the bigger picture

2635
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:36,238
and and since autoflowers don't do those

2636
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,319
kinds of numbers

2637
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:40,559
um if you're if you're gonna cozy up to

2638
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:42,399
autoflowers it also teaches you

2639
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,320
that you don't need those kinds of thc

2640
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:45,519
potency numbers either

2641
01:25:44,319 --> 01:25:47,519
you know and i agree with you and thank

2642
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:49,120
you so much for saying that uh you know

2643
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,880
i've had stuff that's been in the lower

2644
01:25:49,119 --> 01:25:53,760
percentage you know from

2645
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,319
a photo period plant that you know it

2646
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,239
might have

2647
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:57,599
it had you know just enough terpenes it

2648
01:25:56,238 --> 01:25:59,839
had the right amount of thc there was

2649
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,920
enough synergy there to melt my face off

2650
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,360
to where like you smoke at 31 and it's

2651
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,960
just like oh

2652
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:07,119
you know it's it there's something else

2653
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,800
going on there other than just potency

2654
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:10,079
or even trichrome coverage you know

2655
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,279
that's the other thing too and a lot of

2656
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:12,880
that was one of the that's one of the

2657
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:15,359
biggest reps that otters get is

2658
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:17,600
oh they lack trichromes i could see that

2659
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:19,119
at a beneficial point for hash making

2660
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:22,320
but like i also don't believe that

2661
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:23,439
that's fully translated into potency

2662
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:24,960
yeah i agree with that and you know

2663
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:25,839
since you mentioned hash one of the

2664
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,399
things that um

2665
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,920
i personally like about autoflowers is

2666
01:26:28,399 --> 01:26:32,319
um in my experience they don't

2667
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:33,279
nug up the same way that many photo

2668
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:35,359
periods do

2669
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:36,319
they're they're they're a little looser

2670
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:38,880
and um

2671
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:40,880
i think they hash great they because the

2672
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,480
the internal trichomes are so much

2673
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:45,920
easier to get cold

2674
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:48,718
and to have you know drop off and

2675
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:50,319
leave the actual material without having

2676
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:52,639
to beat it all up i think that

2677
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:55,279
autoflowers are great for hash

2678
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:55,920
yeah i i've got some experience had some

2679
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:58,000
really

2680
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,520
good experiences with returns on you

2681
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,319
know either ice water hash

2682
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,360
or even dry ice hash you know a lot

2683
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:06,079
better

2684
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:07,439
breakage because i think exactly what is

2685
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:09,519
happening is what you said

2686
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:10,719
is you they don't get super tight there

2687
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,840
are some out there that do but a

2688
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:14,480
majority don't

2689
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,920
and there's more surface area of good

2690
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:16,879
trichrome heads that you can actually

2691
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,440
get into

2692
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,119
rather than having to pulverize it and

2693
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:23,759
release a lot of the chlorophyll too

2694
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:24,158
yeah right on well dan thank you so much

2695
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,719

you know get this into the history books

2706
01:27:42,158 --> 01:27:45,759

big autoflower company you know

2709
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,479
commoditizes the story and claims that

they

2711

that had to do with autoflowers

2793
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:36,880
there was episode 47 which was uh the

2794
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:39,439
very first

2795
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,880
shaping fire live that was at a

2796
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:44,079
cultivation classic

2797
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:45,760
in portland and my guests for that are

2798
01:30:44,079 --> 01:30:47,119

2799
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:50,560
were talking about earlier

2800
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:52,000
and seth crawford who is a an autoflower

2801
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:55,440
breeder from

2802
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,198

but the two of them together on on stage

2805
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:04,399
not only was

2806
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:06,400
insightful for both commercial growers

2807
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:08,238
