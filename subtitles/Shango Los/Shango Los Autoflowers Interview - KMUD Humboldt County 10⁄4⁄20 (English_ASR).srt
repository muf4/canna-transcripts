00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,678
do you want to introduce our guests and

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:07,758
let our listeners know who

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:10,718
who we're having this sunday yeah

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,080
yeah we are i'm actually really excited

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,000
about this guest this week so we're

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,919
going to have shango los on

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,079
he is the host of a podcast called

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,800
shaping fire which is all about

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,198
the science and uh some technology as

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,199
well

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,519
of cannabis so um i actually

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,480
was not a fan of podcasts previously

13
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,479
because

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,760
it was kind of was the the age of this

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,119
american life and

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,640
sometimes they were good but sometimes

17
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,718
they weren't and i was just kind of like

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,320
a podcast i don't know maybe not super

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,320
interested in those

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,480
and somehow heard about uh

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,799
shangri-losi's shaping fire podcast and

22
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,599
started listening to it and i was just

23
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,000
absolutely mind blown by the guests he

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,559
had

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,558
their level of expertise he's a

26
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,198
phenomenal interviewer

27
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,119
so it was kind of it changed my world

28
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,000
from like i don't really like podcasts

29
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,759
to

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,840
figuring out that there was this

31
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,920
incredibly diverse world of wonderful

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,239
podcasts and podcast representers out

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,600
there

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,400
so i'm super excited to have him on this

35
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,919
week

36
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,439
um he is up in vashon island which is up

37
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,239
in the far reaches of the pacific

38
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,639
northwest

39
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,959
so he's going to be talking to us today

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,079
about autoflowers

41
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,839
i know that most of us who have been in

42
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:28,478
this industry for a while

43
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,880
like pre pre-64 and definitely pre-215

44
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,159
we probably have experienced autoflowers

45
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,519
as a root oralis

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,840
strain which was not very much fun

47
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,118
and they just weren't very good genetics

48
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,240
and they were just

49
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,078
weird plants right yeah so yeah things

50
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,000
have really changed from back then to

51
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,199
where they are now and autoflowers are

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,640
actually getting a really good rep

53
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,399
especially in places

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,399
like the far pacific northwest where you

55
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,079
have such a short growing season

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,320
you really can't grow a lot of the same

57
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,399
cultivars that we do down here

58
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,359
so um he's gonna yeah be talking to us

59
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,718
about all of that and i'm

60
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,438
super excited yeah yeah and the other

61
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,280
little

62
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,079
tricks you might have for growing up

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,318
there in the pacific northwest

64
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,560
we have shango yeah oh great come on

65
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,639

much yeah for joining us we really

69
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,239
appreciate you taking some time out to

70
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,000
uh to talk with us today

71
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,680
sure absolutely i've enjoyed your little

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,159
conversation that you were having about

73
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,159
smoke

74
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,359
we have been experiencing smoke up here

75
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,439
as well in uh

76
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,480
on vashon island in washington state

77
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,959
where i live

78
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,079
and one of the things that uh people are

79
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,360
very aware of here

80
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,080
is that you know um old smoke and

81
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,160
uh old soot doesn't have a smell to it

82
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,360
you know we know all about how

83
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:52,159
um uh terpenes volatilize off cannabis

84
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,680
and so over time cannabis smells less

85
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,840
and less

86
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,120
aromatic that's actually the same thing

87
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,000
for smoke as well

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
over time the the aspects of it that we

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,560
smell

90
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:08,080
from the burnt um you know natural uh

91
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,439
material and chemicals eventually those

92
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,080
those terpenes volatilize and go away as

93
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,959
well

94
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,159
and so just because our flowers don't

95
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,319
smell like smoke

96
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,079
doesn't mean that we shouldn't be aware

97
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,399
that they very well may have

98
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,080
uh you know soot-related toxins in them

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,080
it's a it's a very sticky wicket

100
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,439
yeah sticky wicket it is indeed i i'm

101
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,640
wondering too there's been a lot of talk

102
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,400
this year i don't know shane

103
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,158
if you've heard of this it was somewhat

104
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
new to me uh

105
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,280
well actually it's not really because i

106
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,239
tried it once a long time ago and was

107
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,479
like heck no

108
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,319
but there's a water curing process that

109
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,199
you can use where you're

110
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,759
literally submerging your flower into

111
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,759
water

112
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,039
and then changing that water out every

113
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,759
day and

114
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,438
it wicks off it basically like it you

115
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,759
know utilizes all the chlorophyll it

116
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,359
gets that all off and it also removes

117
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,120
many of the terpenes so you end up with

118
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,959
a very smooth smoke but there's not

119
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,680
a lot of flavor or nose to it

120
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,598
um so i wonder if for small home growers

121
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,120
that really are concerned that might be

122
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,839
something they could try

123
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,599
but like i said i all kind of doing it a

124
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,680
long time ago once and being like oh

125
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,599
heck no way too much work

126
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,759
yeah i agree with you on that i've only

127
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,520
tried that once before with one plan

128
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,840
you know uh you know being a host of a

129
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,719
podcast i i i try to

130
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,599
try everything once right and so i i

131
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
tried it once

132
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,759
and um i found that the

133
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,440
the plant material started to degrade

134
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,840
and so every time i was taking it out of

135
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,079
the water it was losing plant material

136
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,079
and

137
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,519
i didn't really care for that part of it

138
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,478
um and

139
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,039
uh and and for most of the people that i

140
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,599
work with

141
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,240
who are home growers i don't um have as

142
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,240
much uh to do with commercial growers

143
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,319
um you know as far as being hands-on i

144
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,800
live on vacheron island where

145
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,079
most of our growers are are outdoor

146
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,280
patients and folks

147
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,519
and so most of the folks were just

148
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,918
shaking their plants and blowing

149
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,599
uh the soot off so so most of the

150
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,560
patients are not having the problem most

151
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,400
of the problems that

152
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,038
we're having are folks in eastern

153
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,959
washington and of course down in oregon

154
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,478
who have got a large number of plants

155
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,159
and i'm not sure what their

156
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,079
their solutions are going to be you know

157
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,919
one one interesting thing to note as far

158
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,000
as the water curing

159
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,680
it's actually very common in eastern

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,800
washington where it's very

161
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,560
very dry and very dusty to harvest their

162
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,319
plants hang them upside

163
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,879
down like you would a side of beef or

164
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,839
something and spray them with the hose

165
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,959
and then the water just cascades off of

166
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,239
the plant

167
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:46,079
into this big muddy muddy pool

168
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,519
below it and then because the air is so

169
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,519
incredibly dry there the plants just

170
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,198
just dry with some fans and and there

171
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,120
you have it most people that's not going

172
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,960
to be a good option for them though

173
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,560
simply because living in the pacific

174
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,519
northwest if you're going to get your

175
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,839
whole plant

176
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,240
wet including the flower you are looking

177
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:08,478
for mold

178
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,319
yeah yeah we are the southern edge of

179
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,478
that pacific northwest

180
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,759
i consider us to be pacific northwest

181
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,599
we're like the very southern as

182
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,639
a part of it here in humboldt

183
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,680
yeah all of us who live in rain forests

184
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,199
yep yeah we've definitely you know like

185
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,879
i said we've we've played with the bud

186
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,520
washing technique previously

187
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,079
and we found that it just that the

188
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,599
oxidation that occurred was so rapid it

189
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,519
was really kind of hard to get around

190
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,960
but i don't know if that was because

191
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,478
of the vinegar and baking soda

192
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,318
and then you moved it to a hydrogen

193
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,000
peroxide and then you moved it to a

194
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
plain water rinse and

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,839
you know it was a decent amount of

196
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,199
product we were moving through so we

197
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,159
started moving through it

198
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,560
rather rapidly so i feel like maybe we

199
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,759
didn't

200
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,759
rinse it extremely well but you know

201
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,439
it's going to be interesting to see when

202
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,639
testing starts coming through

203
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,959
as to what this is going to look like

204
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,000
for commercial cultivators in california

205
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,680
especially with

206
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,720
our testing that requires less than 25

207
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,199
percent

208
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,560
contamination for foreign particles and

209
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,120
i don't know if that's 25

210
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,478
of the entire bud 25 of the buds have

211
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,280
something on them

212
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,719
or what might be the case uh processors

213
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,519
are definitely going to have their hands

214
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,599
full

215
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,598
this fall and winter though for certain

216
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,639
right right i hadn't thought about that

217
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,159
about the content for sure one thing for

218
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,598
sure they're going to be getting smoky

219
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,880
packs on the east coast for the

220
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,879
unlicensed market no doubt

221
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,470
they probably already are

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,470
[Laughter]

223
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,318
yeah actually we're we're getting almost

224
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,680
close to the top of the hour already

225
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,319
which is crazy i feel like we just

226
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,120
started

227
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,120
conversing but um real quick do you want

228
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,519
to kind of talk a little tiny moment

229
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,399
here

230
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,318
about some of the auto i know you're

231
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,519
you're a big proponent of the autoflower

232
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,199
right

233
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,038
oh yeah a big proponent of it you know

234
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,000
it's it's not something for every single

235
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,478
grower but it is definitely a good plant

236
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,079
for

237
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,918
a large swath of of the

238
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,279
you know the total number of people who

239
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,120
grow so

240
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,318
if you want me to seek into that i would

241
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,519
be happy to

242
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,560
yeah let's send let's do that at the top

243
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:36,639
of the hour let's go into that some more

244
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,879
and so yeah i'd be curious to

245
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,799
learn one thing that i've learned about

246
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,599
uh one thing i've learned from

247
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,000
teaching about autoflowers primarily to

248
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,839
patients for the last few years

249
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,600
um is one of the things i've learned is

250
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,519
what i've learned from folks down in

251
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,159
your area right because there's a lot of

252
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,360
resistance to autoflowers

253
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:59,439
from the traditional heritage growers

254
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,200
right off the bat because generally

255
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,640
speaking while there are some

256
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,839
larger um you know cultivars of

257
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,799
of autoflowers most of the plants are

258
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,800
smaller they

259
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,399
they they top out somewhere between

260
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,719
three and five feet

261
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,000
they're a little thinner in yield and

262
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,759
bud structure

263
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,839
um though the terpene profiles are

264
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,958
often incredible and there's a lot of

265
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,760
good terpene profiles on the market now

266
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,879
folks really love those monster trees

267
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,240
and and i talk to

268
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:31,278
folks who are heritage growers and

269
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,039
they're like listen the you know

270
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,399
everybody loves a beautiful tree right

271
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,240
you know especially down where you are

272
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,919
we all love the redwoods

273
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,519
but one of the things that really

274
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,399
brought um

275
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,440
large trees cannabis plants to

276
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,480
prominence was the 99

277
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,040
plant maximum because suddenly

278
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,080
if you only were allowed to run 99

279
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,639
plants legally

280
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,680
each one of those plants had to just be

281
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,559
incredible and

282
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,919
huge because you were limited in number

283
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,799
and so

284
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,199
that really added a lot to the mystique

285
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:08,399
of the big plant beyond just

286
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,440
the sheer beauty of it and so the the

287
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,120
people who

288
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,519
uh uh most quickly uh embrace

289
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,000
autoflowers are people who are not as

290
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,720
concerned about the 99 plant minimum

291
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,399
and so the four categories of those

292
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,519
people tend to be number one first and

293
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,600
foremost and

294
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,600
the folks that um you know i'm most

295
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,639
active teaching autoflowers to which is

296
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,680
patience

297
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:34,958
because you know while large

298
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:37,199
plants are certainly sexy they are

299
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,119
challenging for many patients who may

300
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,399
have mobility issues

301
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,278
or space issues or um

302
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,240
or you know an ability to break them

303
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,360
down and

304
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,039
and and work the plant themselves right

305
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,879
a lot of us when we're harvesting those

306
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,639
big plants we're on ladders we're using

307
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,240
multiple people sometimes

308
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,679
and this is just not something for

309
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,919
patients and so

310
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,759
right off the bat autoflowers were

311
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,719
something that were embraced by patients

312
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,039
because

313
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,560
they were they were a smaller commitment

314
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,599
you got you know high

315
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,599
cannabinoid profiles they smell good

316
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,278
they give a sense of success and and

317
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,560
probably most importantly

318
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:19,759
they give a sense of um

319
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:22,958
self um you know being able to take care

320
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:25,200
of yourself right uh being being uh

321
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,639
self getting getting your medicine thank

322
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,759
you self sufficient that's exactly what

323
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,120
i'm trying to get into

324
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,958
and and that's really important for

325
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,720
patients who are used to depending on

326
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,119
caregivers and doctors and

327
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,720
and you know very often uh they're also

328
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,320
depending on food banks and things like

329
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,360
that so to have a plant

330
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,399
that you can grow yourself and harvest

331
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,320
yourself and

332
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,159
and make your own medicine is is a

333
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,360
fantastic win so so that's the first

334
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,240
group of people the second group of

335
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,879
people

336
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,360
are home growers who are uh perhaps

337
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,639
growing

338
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,959
indoors where having a monster plant is

339
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,200
not

340
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,239
important in fact they may be growing in

341
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,560
a tent

342
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,560
and so some of the challenges with

343
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,039
regular seeds is that you know they can

344
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,159
often

345
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,919
outgrow the tent if you're not on top of

346
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,319
you know keeping them topped and trimmed

347
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,120
and all that but with auto flowers they

348
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,120
really fit

349
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,278
a four by four you know by 70 inch tent

350
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,639
really well where you don't have to top

351
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,799
them at all so it makes them very

352
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,039
convenient for an indoor tent

353
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,078
and also a lot of home growers also need

354
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,120
to use a certain amount

355
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:29,278
of discretion when they are at home now

356
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,560
i recognize that uh you know where you

357
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,000
live uh you

358
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,359
have a a personal plant minimum and so

359
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,799
that's great so people don't really have

360
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,278
to hide them as much

361
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,278
unless they are concerned with their

362
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,360
neighbors swiping them or something

363
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,200
but here in washington and for most of

364
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,440
the rest of the country

365
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,639
you still need to hide your plants

366
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,720
because we don't have

367
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,159
a legal number of plants that you can

368
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,720
grow in washington

369
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,399
without a medical card and that's still

370
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,959
how most of the country is

371
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,879
and so for people who still need to tuck

372
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,119
their cannabis plants in between their

373
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,200
tomatoes and their corn in their garden

374
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
autoflowers are a really fantastic

375
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,920
option because there's a lot of bang for

376
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,480
their buck

377
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,439
and and they tend to grow out uh

378
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,720
horizontally

379
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,560
instead of just upwards and uh and and

380
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,800
um many of them have got

381
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,000
phenotypically they don't look as much

382
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,519
like uh

383
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,799
cannabis plants i mean the leaves are

384
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,159
the the sun leaves are still

385
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,799
recognizable

386
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,360
but the plants themselves many of them

387
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,000
don't

388
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,360
have the the traditional structure so so

389
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,159
so that's the second category is

390
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,639
homeowners

391
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,000
the third or fourth category is

392
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,399
commercial thc

393
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
growers now this is something that i

394
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,320
have found more and more

395
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,399
commercial growers down in california

396
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,760
reaching out to me to talk

397
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,879
about this because they've realized that

398
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:55,198
right in the summertime uh

399
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,720
dearth of cannabis you know that that

400
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,439
july august time

401
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,480
when when all last year's outdoors is

402
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,800
long gone

403
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,800
there is some indoor around but really

404
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,719
everybody's getting ready for

405
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,240
uh depths to harvest and then and then

406
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,278
full terms to harvest

407
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,399
uh those growers who are looking to make

408
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,559
money mid-summer

409
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,078
are starting to grow auto flowers

410
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,719
because if they um

411
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,919
if they start them june 1st they're

412
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,560
ready to harvest

413
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,559
september 1st and if and if you happen

414
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,359
to live in a bioregion

415
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,479
in uh you know in the in the emerald

416
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,959
triangle area

417
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,440
where you get warmer in may you can

418
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,518
certainly start them as early as may 1st

419
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,639
and then oh my gosh you're done august

420
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,198
1st and you're bringing

421
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,519
fresh flowers to the market at a time

422
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:44,319
when not a lot of people have them

423
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,879
and so you get people growing them

424
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,000
either

425
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,000
to you know move into the flower market

426
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,198
uh but but honestly most of the people

427
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,120
who i've talked to

428
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,240
in your area who have been trying them

429
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,440
they're growing them

430
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,240
to put into the extraction market so

431
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,519
that they can bring

432
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,799
fresh flowers with unique terps and um

433
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,639
and they you know and they've got them

434
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,519
in in august so that's

435
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,399
that's for today yes i want to do a

436
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,039
follow-up

437
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,480
on the extraction but we do need to take

438
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,480
care of our top of the hour business

439
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:20,638
okay i'll hang tight okay okay hold on

440
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,719

thank you you're welcome

459
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,800
so shingo i have a question about the

460
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,039
autoflower now it does

461
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,559
i would say i'm a little bit adverse to

462
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,799
it because it just

463
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,559
just comes across as kind of commercial

464
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,719
to me i i don't know

465
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,638
i i don't know if it's going to have the

466
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,079
nuances and the

467
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:35,278
flavors and aromas that i'm used to but

468
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,838
if there's a good hash train i'd be i'd

469
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:37,838
be interested

470
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,838
well one of the interesting things is um

471
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,679
you know i'd actually say

472
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,920
the majority of them are good hash

473
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,638
trains for one particular reason which

474
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,039
is

475
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,000
a lot of people talk trash about

476
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,319
autoflowers because

477
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,039
they don't necessarily have the

478
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,399
tightness

479
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,278
of a rock hard indica flower like you

480
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,919
get growing

481
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,600
in there in the humboldt region but for

482
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,360
most of the rest of us in the country

483
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,279
our flowers don't finish like that

484
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,000
anyway so we're used to growing

485
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,119
flowers that are more open and and

486
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,240
autoflowers

487
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,599
since they are you know whatever uh you

488
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,838
know whatever traditional

489
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,558
uh cultivar that we like to grow crossed

490
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,639
into a root oralis ruderalis flowers are

491
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:23,759
typically very much more open

492
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,199
and so they give up their trichomes much

493
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,519
more um reasonably than trying to work

494
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,600
with

495
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,519
really rock hard buds which are which

496
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,399
are great for bag appeal and are sexy to

497
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,400
smoke

498
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,759
but to get them to open up during the

499
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,160
hashing process

500
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,599
has got some amount of challenges and

501
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,720
you're always going to lose trichomes on

502
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,279
the inside

503
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,279
whereas autoflowers so long as you find

504
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,399
something with a taste profile you like

505
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,599
and certainly you want to make sure

506
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,679
they've got

507
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,199
fragile trichomes in that particular

508
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,679
cultivar but they're just about

509
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,720
all open flowered which is why a lot of

510
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,160
people look at

511
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,600
autoflower and say oh i don't want to

512
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,558
grow these don't these don't have good

513
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,399
bag appeal

514
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,918
well they only have you know

515
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,640
questionable bag appeal

516
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,480
if you are from where you live and all

517
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,280
the flowers that you grow are gorgeous

518
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,000
and are you know magazines spread

519
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,639
quality

520
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and but you live in a place where um you

521
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,799
know that is unique

522
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,720
in our country and in the world and so

523
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,960
for just about everybody else

524
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,480
um the tightness of the flower that you

525
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,919
can get in california or

526
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,519
indoor anywhere um a lot of people are

527
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,320
just really glad to have

528
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,918
good smelling plant with cannabinoids so

529
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:35,038
so i would say that

530
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,600
certainly autoflowers are great for hash

531
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,558
and and most of the people that i know

532
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:43,119
who are home growers and and you know

533
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,049
enjoy making ice water hash themselves

534
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:46,479
they grow their autoflower

535
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:49,200
[Music]

536
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,919
group of plants intentionally to make

537
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,519
hash

538
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,200
and so maybe they'll maybe they'll have

539
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,879
some full terms uh for

540
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,038
smoke and to take to parties because

541
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,280
they look sexy but then the hash that

542
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,679
they're making is from the autoflowers

543
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,200
you know one of my favorite autoflower

544
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,280
hash making

545
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:10,558
cultivars is is actually from

546
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:12,160
daniel at um at heart rock mountain he's

547
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,879
got this fantastic

548
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,640
cultivar called lion claw and uh it's

549
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,679
you know it's got all the full flavor

550
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,919
that you were saying that you were

551
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,720
concerned about missing from a full term

552
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,120
plant

553
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,720
um because it it's got that tang you get

554
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,599
from alcohol esters that

555
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,120
a lot of you know the early autoflowers

556
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,240
didn't have they were looking for

557
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,479
complexity

558
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,519
and the lion claw from from heart rock

559
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,640
mountain that's the first one that i

560
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,679
came across where

561
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,240
i got a reliable six-foot plant it had

562
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,440
the full

563
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,279
flavor that had great uh bud shape

564
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,360
and that looked kind of like a northern

565
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,000
lights five plant traditionally looks

566
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,159
like

567
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and and they're really good the thing

568
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,038
about is is you gotta grow a lot of them

569
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,319
right i've probably

570
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,440
been involved with like i don't know

571
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,759
growing 80 85 different cultivars

572
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,200
and and there were a lot of losers

573
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,879
there's no question about it that there

574
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,319
were a lot of them that were just kind

575
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,480
of mediocre

576
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,558
but you got to remember like we're not

577
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,759
we're not in the same situation we were

578
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:09,839
10 years ago

579
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,839
where autoflowers didn't produce and

580
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,798
they smelled like crap and they didn't

581
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,079
smoke very well we're 10 years later and

582
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:20,798
while they might not

583
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:23,839
be the same as the like epic genetics

584
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,879
that come out of the humble um you know

585
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,480
in the emerald count

586
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,080
emerald um triangle area this is a

587
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,400
this is a game that's just getting

588
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:35,279
started and as more and more

589
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,679
of the solid heritage growers start to

590
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,720
move

591
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,360
into autoflowers because of how useful

592
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,558
they are

593
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,639
i think that we're going to find the

594
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,279
terpene profiles getting more along the

595
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,679
lines of what you expect

596
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,639
from a from a photo period but don't

597
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,360
think that the

598
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,720
the autoflowers don't smell good if

599
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,319
you're growing an autoflower and it

600
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,038
doesn't smell good it just means that

601
00:20:54,319 --> 00:21:02,240
you've got the wrong

602
00:20:55,038 --> 00:21:03,919
autoflower how so how did it mean

603
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,519
i think that part of part of the

604
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,759
problems that a lot of people have with

605
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,918
the autoflowers on the commercial market

606
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,079
is they're not in that you know

607
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,520
california's got this whole

608
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:17,279
idea that you need to be above 20 thc

609
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,720
and the autos that i've seen the testing

610
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,720
on them they're not coming back anywhere

611
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,960
close to that the closest i've seen was

612
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,279
a

613
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,880
high somewhere in the high teens for

614
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,639
total cannabinoids

615
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,120
and i think thc was resting around 14

616
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,120
and maybe for hash that works but even

617
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,479
the hashmakers that i know

618
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,158
don't really want to mess with something

619
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,120
that's that low in thc

620
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,120
so i don't know if california commercial

621
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,158
market is quite there yet with its

622
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,719
ability

623
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,280
to embrace the autoflower as it exists

624
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,480
but

625
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:50,240
i do love the idea of breeding it and

626
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,919
starting to you know taking those

627
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,640
breeding projects and dialing them in

628
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,640
after a few years i i think that there's

629
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,000
a lot of growers in your area that gave

630
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,840
them a try this year right

631
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,240
like for example i'm i'm familiar with

632
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,678
the folks at uh moon time medicinals

633
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,679
there in garberville

634
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,960
and uh they've got this beautiful huge

635
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,759
culture that they have

636
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,759
uncovered right and so uh if they run

637
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,679
their full terms there they do cat

638
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,038
a cough and catch some weather at the

639
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,798
end of the cycle

640
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:21,519
and so this year they grew um what

641
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,839
600 square foot no 6 000 square feet is

642
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,798
it anyway a huge ass

643
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,000
excuse me um hugo culture full of these

644
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,038
autoflowers

645
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,720
and they finished the end of august and

646
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:33,679
they were beautiful and they were able

647
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,038
to move them

648
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,360
into the extraction market now are

649
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:40,400
autoflowers going to be ready for the

650
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,519
california

651
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,480
flower only market now and that's kind

652
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,558
of a stretch but

653
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,240
but you also got to remember where you

654
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:51,200
are as far as

655
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,839
the the totality of the market you guys

656
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,558
are

657
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,439
growing olympic level plants and

658
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,200
genetics

659
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,679
and so yeah it's probably going to be

660
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,919
more for patients and home growers

661
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,880
and extraction and hashing at the

662
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,360
beginning

663
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,640
until they get some of that sexy bag

664
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,279
appeal that of the stuff that you

665
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,840
normally grow

666
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:17,119
and how are auto flowers

667
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,879
like what's the how were those

668
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,319
bred i mean could i take a strain of

669
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,559
mine and turn it into an

670
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,240
autoflower or what do you know much

671
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,038
about that process

672
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,759
well while i'm not breeding autoflowers

673
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,079
myself

674
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,440
i interact with a lot of breeders who

675
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,558
are doing it because

676
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,038
you know for i i have been carrying

677
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,678
the the gospel of autoflowers across the

678
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:39,759
country

679
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,759
with talks and so autoflower folks who

680
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,960
are breeding reach out to me and say hey

681
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,240
what are you what are you hearing what

682
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,519
are you learning what do you what do you

683
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,960
think of these seeds

684
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:52,079
and so um they are you know you

685
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,038
are choosing a ruderalis cultivar that

686
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,399
you like

687
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:58,158
you and and the root of ruralis um

688
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,600
you know lineage if you will has come

689
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,720
from siberia

690
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,558
um uh in russia and they have got very

691
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,120
short summers and very early

692
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:07,839
winters and so these plants were

693
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,319
discovered

694
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,480
that that are used to very short uh

695
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,839
summer time so as soon as they

696
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,038
are biologically mature they immediately

697
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,359
go into flower

698
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,640
and so that is where we get the short

699
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,759
season from

700
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,559
and then folks take their favorite um

701
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,359
regular cultivars like the one that you

702
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,359
have that might

703
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,879
be a um you know a farm specialty for

704
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,599
yours and they cross them

705
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,520
into the root oralis and then your first

706
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,199
wave you'll have a certain percentage

707
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,599
and then you'll sift those

708
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,240
and then uh and then normally this is

709
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,079
where i

710
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,319
you know i get become less involved at

711
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:47,439
this point but but normally by the

712
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,079
by the the second generation you have

713
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,240
yourself

714
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,240
at um you know at a significant number

715
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,200
of autoflowers and you're ready to

716
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,278
breed those for market um it does take a

717
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,278
bit of work it's certainly not as simple

718
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,359
as just pollen chucking like we all love

719
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,079
to you know eat you know everybody can

720
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:06,719
can do a simple cross um these take a

721
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,119
little more effort and more time to sift

722
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,960
and

723
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,199
instead of making a seed in a season

724
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,360
you're talking about more like three or

725
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,038
bringing your project indoors so

726
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,959
so the short answer is yeah you can

727
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:20,319
totally take your favorite strains from

728
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,240
your farm and make them autos

729
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,439
if you decide you want to take on that

730
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,120
project and

731
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,759
and while i've seen most of the

732
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,879
mainstream cultivars that have been auto

733
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,640
flowered

734
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,278
they do have a slightly different taste

735
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,278
because the root oralist does carry some

736
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,759
of its own flavor profile in there

737
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,119
but the more you work it um you know the

738
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,839
closer it can be

739
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,839
to your

740
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:48,199
[Music]

741
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,640
yeah i remember these two way way

742
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,558
way back maybe wendy does too the

743
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,400
rudoralis name the first time i heard it

744
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,918
was probably like

745
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,679
late 80s or something and they were kind

746
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,520
of popular with the gorilla growing

747
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,880
techniques too because the plants did

748
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,720
stay smaller and they were kind of

749
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,600
easier to tuck away and hide

750
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,480
under the bushes but that was the first

751
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,119
i heard of it

752
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,319
and then that was it they kind of maybe

753
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,719
they came and went but now they're

754
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,960
coming back

755
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,839
yeah we definitely played with that back

756
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,360
in the day

757
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:37,278
and um again it's not the same thing as

758
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:41,119
it was because back in the day

759
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:43,679
it was really not good i mean there was

760
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,319
it was literally we didn't even know the

761
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,600
term root

762
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:47,359
i mean we knew the term root or alice

763
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,678
but we called it ditch weed because it

764
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,439
was

765
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,720
like the stuff that grew in the ditches

766
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,159
and you just

767
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,759
i mean it didn't have flavor it didn't

768
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,480
have terpenes it really didn't get you

769
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,960
very high

770
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,720
it was much closer to what we consider

771
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,840
hemp nowadays

772
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,720
than what we are now terminologying uh

773
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:07,519
using the terminology of an autoflower

774
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,600
which is um yeah it's been interesting

775
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,200
i'm kind of wondering like

776
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,038
who is bringing it back because i don't

777
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,679
think this just popped into the scene

778
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,119
as these amazing autoflowers but yet i

779
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,720
haven't heard about the people like this

780
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,719
should have taken at least

781
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,159
you know three to four years to get the

782
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,000
right root or alice and

783
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,320
get the strain at least a little bit

784
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,079
stabilized so that your cultivars are

785
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:29,038
decent and then working that strain

786
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,558
through to

787
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,398
increase your cannabinoids and your

788
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:33,200
terpenes and yeah just like you were

789
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:37,278
saying shango

790
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,600
just uh working that line to increase

791
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,839
the positive aspects of what you want in

792
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,839
your cultivar and decreasing

793
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:47,038
those negative aspects that used to come

794
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:49,038
with with root or alice back in the day

795
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:50,798
it's it's funny that you say you know

796
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,720
you you you wish you know

797
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,240
you're surprised you hadn't heard of it

798
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,960
or you or you should have heard of it

799
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,079
and the thing is

800
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,278
is that autoflower people because of

801
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,558
the bad you know because of the trash

802
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,839
that is talked by

803
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:08,960
by many heritage outdoor breeders um

804
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,439
autoflower breeders uh were you know

805
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,640
laughed

806
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,519
off of forums and stuff and so um

807
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,038
the the the arrogance of of heritage

808
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,398
growers and people who just wanted to

809
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,720
grow big trees

810
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,239
caused the autoflower people to have to

811
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,839
create a community of their own

812
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,399
and so there actually is a huge

813
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,798
community of autoflower people natural

814
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:31,918
nationally that your listeners can

815
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:34,879
connect with at autoflower.net

816
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,640
because the autoflower breeders who you

817
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,000
know were pushed off these other forums

818
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,360
by just being laughed at

819
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,119
they're like fine we're going to take

820
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,359
our ball and go home and so they went

821
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,359
home and they started their own

822
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,278
uh breeding community and they have been

823
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,439
working together and trading genetics

824
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,359
and trading best practices and

825
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,558
you know developing the the the better

826
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,719
reuteralis that

827
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:55,678
you know imparts the timing but not the

828
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,159
taste

829
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,919
and now there's you know not only a lot

830
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,320
of commercial growers that are putting

831
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,919
out

832
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,158
excuse me commercial breeders that are

833
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,120
putting out you know commercial quality

834
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,520
seeds i mean heck

835
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,639
most of the commercial hemp market is

836
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:13,839
based on

837
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,840
um autoflower seeds but then also

838
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,440
there's so many bedroom uh breeders who

839
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,360
are breeding exceptional

840
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,440
seeds now that are available at

841
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,519
commercial scale that you can get

842
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,798
so uh one of the important things for

843
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,519
for all of us

844
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,558
in cannabis media to do is to you know

845
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,599
shake off

846
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,720
the reputation that autoflowers had 10

847
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,719
years ago

848
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,360
and and engage with modern breeders like

849
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,880
like dan jimmy at mandalorian genetics

850
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,759
and daniel at heart rock mountain who

851
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,960
i've already mentioned

852
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:48,879
and zero zero from spain and and das

853
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,519
mephisto who's uh doing

854
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,039
a line called a night owl under the

855
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,519
mephisto genetics

856
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,158
family like all these people are making

857
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,278
really

858
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,760
great flowers that are

859
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,079
flowers for now they're modernized

860
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,960
autoflowers that people are very happy

861
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:07,599
with

862
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,000
but again it really depends on what your

863
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,839
use

864
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,880
is if if you're trying to put an

865
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:16,319
autoflower versus traditional genetics

866
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,480
in california to be ready in october

867
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,839
well the traditional genetics are still

868
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,000
going to be better

869
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,199
but if you're trying to get plants to

870
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,720
harvest in august

871
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,480
if you're a patient if you're a home

872
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,880
grower or if you're going to want to

873
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,679
have

874
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,039
acres and acres of plants and you want

875
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,159
them all to be the same

876
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:36,079
so that you can harvest them uniformly

877
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,919
well then autoflowers is a godsend to

878
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:40,558
you

879
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,679
there's also i know that sunshine and i

880
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:42,798
have actually talked about this a little

881
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,200
bit and i know other commercial

882
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:48,639
cultivators too that have talked about

883
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,240
that in california specifically in order

884
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,000
to get a license

885
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,679
you have to declare what type of

886
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,398
cultivation style you use

887
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,840
it's either outdoor mixed light tier 1

888
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:01,199
or mixed light tier 2

889
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,398
or indoor and mixed light tier 1

890
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,038
means that you're using light

891
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,839
deprivation and under six watts per

892
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:10,079
square foot of supplemental lighting

893
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,038
so unfortunately that license costs

894
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,759
quite a bit more

895
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,359
you also have state and local licenses

896
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:16,798
state and local permit fees which are

897
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,359
generally more you have

898
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,119
excise fees which are generally more so

899
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,759
something like an autoflower that you

900
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,479
could

901
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,398
you know companion plant if as it were

902
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,558
throughout your full term

903
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,479
get that boost mid-season so that you

904
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,759
have a bit of a paycheck before

905
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,240
the market floods in the fall and then

906
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,519
harvest those out let your full terms

907
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,000
fill in

908
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,798
is something that is for me very

909
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,240
attractive

910
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:46,960
and um you know very interesting

911
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,278
as long as i know i can sell it i also

912
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,600
am

913
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,599
dragonfly earth medicine certified so we

914
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,079
have agreed in that contract

915
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,759
to not put anything to hydrocarbons so

916
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,158
it can't be blasted it would have to be

917
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,119
made

918
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,159
into either dry sift or ice water hash

919
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,079
um

920
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,440
possibly co2 but i try to avoid that

921
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:05,759
myself

922
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,558
and like i said just a few hashmakers

923
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,158
i've talked to

924
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,599
they haven't worked with autos yet and

925
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,080
they're like i don't know

926
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,639
i don't know would it work i don't know

927
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,079
so it's good to hear that there are

928
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,000
a lot of people that are using it for

929
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,918
hash and uh maybe that's something we'll

930
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,278
have to play with next year

931
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,840
you know it's kind of funny to think

932
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:24,880
about that even though california is a

933
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,519
leader in

934
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,159
everything cannabis because the rest of

935
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,720
the country

936
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,240
has got worse weather than you are you

937
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,038
you know california folks haven't really

938
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,480
necessarily

939
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:37,679
had the the need to explore outside of

940
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,480
traditional seeds

941
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,798
and in this probably maybe only this one

942
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,720
way

943
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,319
california might be catching up with

944
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,519
what the rest of us have been doing for

945
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:49,278
a few years

946
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,278
because we don't have your weather

947
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:53,679
well the mold

948
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,119
i taste mold every year in the eel river

949
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:01,200
valley

950
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:03,518
so yeah i have i shared some similar

951
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,960
issues that you have there up in

952
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,839
washington

953
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,840
living growing in the rainforest so to

954
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,839
speak

955
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,399
we we definitely don't grow certain

956
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,158
cultivars because of

957
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:19,518
the problem that you know the botrytis

958
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,360
and powdery mildew and things and we

959
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,120
just kind of learned to be

960
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,519
very picky about you know cultivars and

961
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,839
cultivar specific we're also again we

962
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,480
are

963
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,558
in an incredibly privileged and blessed

964
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,480
area for growing cannabis because it has

965
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:34,480
been done here for so long

966
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,159
that we have a lot of stabilized

967
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,880
genetics we have a lot of interest

968
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,360
coming back

969
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,080
into legacy california cultivation and

970
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:44,158
what those legacy cultivars are

971
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:46,000
so um we yeah we definitely have not

972
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,320
really seen the need

973
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,398
to you know play with the autoflowers

974
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:50,960
until again most recently with all of

975
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:56,000
our

976
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,000
prop 64 shenanigans and policy which

977
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:02,558
well i mean i will say for mold

978
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,960
or for botrytis in particular now of

979
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:05,200
course

980
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,278
i'm not talking about smoking the mold

981
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,159
this is after you remove the mold from

982
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,878
the plant

983
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,838
but actually having a little bit of

984
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:15,519
botrytis

985
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:17,519
on your plant that plant it will be

986
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:18,800
sweeter and better tasting i know that

987
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:21,440
sounds kind of crazy

988
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,560
but a little bit of mold will actually

989
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,878
give you

990
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:25,918
a little sweeter smoke and that's not

991
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,799
smoking the mold

992
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,918
that's just how the plant ripens with

993
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,200
that little

994
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:36,000
bit of mold on it so i carefully monitor

995
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,918
it and i don't want to get it obviously

996
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,838
it's going to greatly affect yields at

997
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,319
some point

998
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:45,440
and i just am careful how much of the

999
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,079
crop is a strain that does mold

1000
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,480
but it's not necessarily it's you know

1001
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,320
it is

1002
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,639
it's the plant it will quicken its

1003
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,760
ripening just a little bit

1004
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,240
but if but it can also

1005
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,960
keep you from getting your plant fully

1006
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,559
ripe

1007
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,639
as well with that mold so

1008
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,000
it's not you know it's not the worst

1009
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:09,358
thing in the world

1010
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,119
but it's uh it pushes a stress response

1011
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:12,480
in the plant as well so it'll actually

1012
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,920
be like oh shoot

1013
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,760
something's going on yeah like you're

1014
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,079
saying i gotta finish faster

1015
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,000
i need to push into you know the

1016
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,760
trichome production and terpenes in

1017
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,800
order to protect myself

1018
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,599
um i i don't i i always hope for no mold

1019
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,599
personally but

1020
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,920
you know all of us cannabis growers by

1021
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:32,719
the third week of september we're

1022
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,960
starting to get

1023
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,078
suspicious and a little anxious right

1024
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,720
because we're all like checking the

1025
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,440
weather

1026
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,598
and making sure our air flow is good and

1027
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,720
and watching for molds because when the

1028
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,079
rains come

1029
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:48,078
um you know crops can go bad uh quickly

1030
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,079
if we're if we're outdoors

1031
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,119
especially or in hoops or things like

1032
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,200
that and

1033
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:58,559
it is remarkable to have the experience

1034
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:01,358
of seeing plants uh

1035
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,519
you know that that magical last week

1036
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:04,400
when you smell those mature terpene

1037
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:06,559
profiles

1038
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,160
and you're all like god i love being a

1039
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,000
cannabis farmer you know and

1040
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,239
you like we usually only get that one

1041
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
time a year unless we dep as well

1042
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,000
and and we smell them and everything to

1043
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,039
get that experience

1044
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,519
the first week of september when and

1045
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,199
have

1046
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:26,639
no mold and be able to harvest and have

1047
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:29,039
everything hung and be done and

1048
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,239
have it be september 15th by that point

1049
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,519
and realize that

1050
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:36,078
you know you you you harvested 95

1051
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:36,639
of your plants perfectly healthy they

1052
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,240
smell

1053
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:41,440
great um it's a really startling diff

1054
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,679
startingly different

1055
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,639
growing experience than growing full

1056
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:46,559
terms which

1057
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,559
i adore right i've got nothing bad to

1058
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,719
say about full terms

1059
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:53,199
except for depending on where you live

1060
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:55,118
they don't finish right and so

1061
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,919
for those people autoflowers may be a

1062
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,920
really good option

1063
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,640
so how do those autoflowers ripen kind

1064
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,159
of similar can you let them go

1065
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,799
slightly over rice and they're still

1066
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,078
good oh for sure yeah you can you can

1067
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,839
definitely let them go it's one of the

1068
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,839
things that's cool about autoflowers

1069
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,480
is that um they've got a lot more

1070
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,519
flexibility not only can you let them go

1071
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,800
a little long

1072
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,400
um let's say in case um

1073
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,320
let's say you're planted and oh gosh you

1074
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,039
have to evacuate right

1075
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,640
if it takes you another week or so or

1076
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,880
you know 10 days to

1077
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,960
to harvest them um you've got a little

1078
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,119
more you've got a little larger window

1079
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,838
of opportunity than you do

1080
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,480
trying to do that in october but here's

1081
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,719
the thing that

1082
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,800
really gets people's attention you know

1083
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:42,799
most of us have got food um

1084
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,079
gardens as well right because we want to

1085
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,280
be self-sufficient

1086
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,160
and one of the things that we do

1087
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,359
throughout the summer is um

1088
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:54,078
is um uh plant um

1089
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:54,880
oh serial planning what's the phrase i'm

1090
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,160
looking for

1091
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,599
consecutive planning um

1092
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,039
anyway where you where you plant some

1093
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,640
this week and you plant some next week

1094
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,039
and you plant some the next week

1095
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,319
and so um you can do that with auto

1096
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,440
flowers and so

1097
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,920
you can uh take a plant that say for

1098
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,838
example

1099
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:17,280
a 92 day from germination to

1100
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:20,400
um to harvest plant and you can plant

1101
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,640
you know one group of them on uh

1102
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,440
may 15th and another group on the on the

1103
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:27,679
21st and another group on june 1st

1104
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,720
so that instead of having to harvest all

1105
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:32,319
your crop

1106
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:34,719
within a week you can actually

1107
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,760
harvest some every week over the course

1108
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,439
of a month

1109
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,960
which uh succession planning that's what

1110
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,760
i'm trying to think of and

1111
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,800
succession planting like this is in

1112
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,200
wildly more

1113
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,880
convenient than waiting waiting waiting

1114
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:50,159
oh my god quick let's pull

1115
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,160
everything as fast as we can

1116
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,800
yeah yeah absolutely and that's that's

1117
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:57,358
that changes things again for california

1118
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,039
market

1119
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:01,199
because we're always talking about the

1120
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,079
drying space how much drying space do

1121
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:03,519
you need and

1122
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,200
how much more do you have to get and

1123
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:09,119
what kind of you know

1124
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:10,879
ada compliant government sanctioned

1125
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,519
you know commercial building do i need

1126
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,838
to dry my weed in

1127
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:19,119
so um i'm getting more and more

1128
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,119
convinced as this goes on

1129
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,599
yeah you know a lot go ahead

1130
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,720
i'll just have to see if i can get some

1131
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,119
good melt out of it

1132
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:30,559
and some good grief but i haven't really

1133
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,440
seen it yet but i'm not

1134
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:33,440
all that experienced

1135
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,880
well i wish that we would have uh been

1136
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,319
able to connect at uh emerald cup uh

1137
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,800
sunshine i would have been able to

1138
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,760
hand you some decent melt and then for

1139
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,880
you to try

1140
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,440
um you know it really depends on what

1141
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,920
people experience as their air quotes

1142
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,320
end of

1143
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,800
season right because we all look at

1144
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,800
different attributes for end of season

1145
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,440
you know for some people it's you know

1146
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,000
less sun and cooler days for some folks

1147
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,559
it's fog for some folks like me it's

1148
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,719
cooler nights below 55.

1149
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:07,679
some folks it's it's rain it might come

1150
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,719
early

1151
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:13,118
um for people who have got these sorts

1152
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,838
of problems at the end of their season

1153
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,720
autoflowers are a great idea

1154
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:21,358
and if people are particularly into the

1155
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:24,159
size of the plants because they've got

1156
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:24,719
um numerical limits uh being in the

1157
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:27,759
ground

1158
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:30,480
helps a lot most of the

1159
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,440
smaller autoflowers that people see

1160
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,159
pictures of

1161
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,599
and and they find dissatisfying is

1162
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,000
because these plants are

1163
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,800
also in containers and they're not in

1164
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,920
you know

1165
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,359
you know 300 gallon you know huge

1166
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,240
uh linen containers either they're

1167
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:48,960
most people grow an autoflower in five

1168
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,838
to seven

1169
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,440
gallon pots and so they're on a deck or

1170
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:55,519
they're indoors and so

1171
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,480
the plants are not really given the

1172
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:59,599
opportunity to

1173
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,920
do you know be to their full potential

1174
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,960
but if you are somewhere that is growing

1175
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,400
an autoflower

1176
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:10,159
either right in the ground or in

1177
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:13,358
a large pot of of really active

1178
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:16,879
living soil the plants really do

1179
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:19,119
get bountiful and bigger and with larger

1180
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,920
flowers and more

1181
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,079
identifiable bud structure it's just

1182
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,800
that there's not as many photographs of

1183
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,839
those

1184
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,079
on instagram for people to see because

1185
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,000
again the people who were first adopters

1186
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,680
of autoflowers are people

1187
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,079
with less than ideal conditions for

1188
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,078
growing

1189
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,519
so let's just one of the things i wanted

1190
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,639
to ask you about too

1191
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:46,880
is the community of growers

1192
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,239
where you live can you speak a little

1193
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,400
bit about

1194
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,919
about the growers where you are in the

1195
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,400
community that you have do you have any

1196
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,000
trade associations or

1197
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,760
sure sure um so here on vashon island um

1198
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,280
we have gone through a very significant

1199
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,640
transition since

1200
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:08,000
uh the normalization and the

1201
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:11,118
the the existence of a licensed market

1202
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,960
so historically vashon island

1203
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,680
has been a very popular um unlicensed

1204
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,599
underground cannabis growing community

1205
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:20,480
we had good flowers coming out of here

1206
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,200
we had

1207
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,838
an array of good purple genetics like

1208
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:25,439
ovp

1209
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,039
which here is known as the original

1210
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,599
vashon purple

1211
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,358
and bands that would come to seattle

1212
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,160
would intentionally

1213
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:36,078
uh put their feelers out to to have

1214
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:37,679
somebody come over to vashon island or

1215
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,119
you know invite somebody to the show

1216
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,759
that would bring them some

1217
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,519
vashon grown flower during their tour so

1218
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,520
that was cool and you know we

1219
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,440
the island's been in some you know

1220
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,519
popular magazines like like there's like

1221
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,119
there's a classic early 80s playboy

1222
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:52,960
episode that talks about

1223
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,720
vashon cannabis and stuff so you know

1224
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,000
there's a bit of a reputation but

1225
00:42:54,719 --> 00:43:01,519
but then when medical got started

1226
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,960
suddenly became far more popular

1227
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:07,519
because the underground growers

1228
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,639
were kind of selling against each other

1229
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,639
on the island

1230
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,639
and there wasn't a lot of the flower

1231
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:14,000
leaving the island so vashon had

1232
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,000
incredible flower

1233
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,519
at very low prices because these

1234
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,119
talented growers were just

1235
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,960
selling against each other in the same

1236
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,000
community and so

1237
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,519
the prices tended to go down

1238
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,159
once once medical started

1239
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:31,440
that's where i got involved more with

1240
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,000
cannabis here on

1241
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,760
vashon island by starting a trade

1242
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
organization here

1243
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,119
called vimeo originally it was the

1244
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,239
vashon island

1245
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,039
marijuana entrepreneurs alliance but

1246
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:47,679
since licensing we've changed the e from

1247
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:50,318
being entrepreneur to being enthusiasts

1248
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:52,399
and so in the early days of vimeo what i

1249
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:52,800
was doing was developing relationships

1250
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,760
with

1251
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,680
the dispensaries over town in seattle

1252
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,640
and port orchard in tacoma

1253
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,118
and we were moving the flowers that were

1254
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,799
grown

1255
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:07,200
on island into dispensaries

1256
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,800
all around the seattle area and so that

1257
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,159
was great you know farmers were happy

1258
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,519
because they were getting more

1259
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:16,000
for their pounds and also we started

1260
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:19,519
doing things like bulk buying soil and

1261
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,280
other soil amendments and inputs in bulk

1262
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:23,440
as a group and then splitting them up so

1263
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,440
that everybody could save money

1264
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,639
and we started having meetings and and

1265
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,039
then and then the

1266
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:29,759
laws changed right like i know how prop

1267
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:31,358
64

1268
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,200
screwed so many of your people and the

1269
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:36,639
same thing happened here

1270
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:39,118
and so um they gave licenses to

1271
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:41,118
a whole bunch of uh you know people who

1272
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,599
were new to the industry and were not

1273
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,160
part of the medical scene and then they

1274
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,440
limited

1275
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,920
the uh licenses and so

1276
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,200
a lot of people who wanted to transition

1277
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,079
from the

1278
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,559
legalish medical market to the more

1279
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,160
legal

1280
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,559
licensed market were not given that

1281
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,598
opportunity

1282
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,599
but then as you all are experiencing

1283
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,200
down there they started cracking down on

1284
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,400
everybody else who doesn't have a

1285
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:10,159
license and so it became

1286
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,680
the people who were growing for the

1287
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:15,199
medicinal market

1288
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,318
and doing so with some amount of legal

1289
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:18,879
protections

1290
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,519
now don't have the stores to take their

1291
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,400
product

1292
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:23,440
and also are under much greater risk and

1293
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,559
so we've seen this

1294
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:30,240
we've seen this change from there being

1295
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:32,559
maybe two dozen significant

1296
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,279
you know traditional market growers back

1297
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:34,559
in the day

1298
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,240
and then you know a whole bunch of small

1299
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,759
things but you know two dozen big ones

1300
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,399
and granted we only have about

1301
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,240
10 000 people on the island um and that

1302
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,680
transition to oh my gosh

1303
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:47,279
you know several hundred uh medical

1304
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:50,318
growers on the island

1305
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,440
but now the the

1306
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:57,440
commercial scale black market

1307
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:00,400
unlicensed folks are mostly gone

1308
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,599
on the island and the medical people are

1309
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,519
definitely gone because there's no

1310
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,920
stores to sell into but what we have

1311
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,039
now is a lot more people growing for

1312
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,720
their own head

1313
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,639
so you've got a lot of people who used

1314
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:12,159
to be afraid to grow

1315
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:14,318
you know five or ten plants for

1316
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:16,719
themselves a lot more people

1317
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:19,358
doing that for themselves so we've got a

1318
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:19,919
much more decentralized grow for

1319
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:23,039
yourself

1320
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,559
environment here on the island and

1321
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,199
the people who are not growing for

1322
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:30,078
themselves are either buying in the

1323
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:30,879
still existing you know heritage market

1324
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,280
on the island

1325
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,720
or honestly people go to the two stores

1326
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,960
on the island

1327
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,639
even though the prices are high and can

1328
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,358
you believe it we don't test for

1329
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:43,440
pesticides in washington

1330
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:45,440
people the convenience and the variety

1331
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,358
is really great because you you don't

1332
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,639
find a lot of people growing sativas on

1333
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:51,119
the island because

1334
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,400
they can't grow outdoors here and not a

1335
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,599
lot of people want to spend

1336
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:59,119
12 or 13 weeks of electricity um

1337
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,720
to essentially get the same for

1338
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,240
the same price as you would a bag of

1339
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,279
indica

1340
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:08,639
or uh and so the market's really changed

1341
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,400
here it's it's a very unusual thing

1342
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,239
yeah one of the things that i want to

1343
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,039
just recognize washington for

1344
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:16,159
i think he's also a member of your

1345
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:19,440
community

1346
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,000
is it david rice he did he came from

1347
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,079
humboldt

1348
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,039
originally but one of the things is sun

1349
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,960
grown if washington had not passed sun

1350
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:28,800
grown with their legalization it might

1351
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,240
have been harder for us in california

1352
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,480
believe it or not

1353
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:37,519
and i'm like really that was um jimmy

1354
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,838
moberg from canistel farms

1355
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:41,759
he also had a lot to do with getting sun

1356
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,078
growing into washington

1357
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,800
and i believe that that also helped us

1358
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,680
here in california

1359
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,160
i agree jeremy moberg is a he's a force

1360
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:52,799
to be

1361
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,440
reckoned with he uh he not only is a you

1362
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,400
know high

1363
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,639
energy person who does a lot of research

1364
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,440
but um he doesn't take no for an answer

1365
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:01,759
very often

1366
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,119
and he's got a lot of inertia behind him

1367
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,680
and so

1368
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,280
i've i've interviewed him on my first

1369
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,679
podcast on

1370
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,440
for entrepreneur and we talked at length

1371
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:14,480
about the importance of

1372
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:18,400
sun grown both for cannabis culture but

1373
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:21,358
also it was important to not

1374
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,119
make all flour have to be grown indoor

1375
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:24,639
with electricity i mean eventually we're

1376
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,640
going to be growing indoor

1377
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,480
with solar but the batteries are not

1378
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,239
quite there yet but we will get there

1379
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,079
eventually and the

1380
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:34,318
you know one of the worst parts of

1381
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,839
indoor will you know be gone and that'll

1382
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,079
be great for everybody

1383
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:39,119
but uh but you're right activists like

1384
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,280
jeremy and

1385
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,119
the sun growers association and of

1386
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,040
course all of the

1387
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,160
uh beautiful sun grown people that

1388
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,960
you've got down there

1389
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,759
it really took us working together

1390
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,960
because you know

1391
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,839
the politicians mostly they want what is

1392
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,720
the minimum

1393
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:57,599
that they have to put on the line to

1394
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:01,039
make

1395
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,599
this happen and doing the bare minimum

1396
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,239
to protect yourself politically is

1397
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,640
really

1398
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:07,598
not going to necessarily make the best

1399
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:09,279
policy

1400
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,200
and for them to say okay we're going to

1401
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,800
allow cannabis but oh gosh

1402
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:15,439
people might get it outdoors so you have

1403
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,400
to do it under lock and key in buildings

1404
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,000
that is a that is a crisis of vision

1405
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,039
that is people who are not

1406
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,880
choosing to learn the bigger picture

1407
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:30,400
um or they are being influenced by

1408
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,640
indoor lobbyists

1409
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,318
yeah i i think there's a lot of

1410
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,318
influence going on

1411
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:38,318
by lobbyists and i also think there's

1412
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:41,920
some amount of

1413
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:43,279
you know um kind of back pedaling that

1414
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,960
the politicians have to do because

1415
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,119
there's been so many decades of

1416
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,920
stigmatizing cannabis but now that

1417
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,519
it's so widely recognized and accepted

1418
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,639
it's really hard for them to just be

1419
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:55,519
like oops our bad

1420
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,879
okay all cool just go and do you it's

1421
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:58,719
more like well we're not going to

1422
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,000
necessarily say this isn't dangerous

1423
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:00,719
we're going to say that maybe you need

1424
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,039
it if you

1425
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:03,919
have a medical condition but we still

1426
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:07,358
need to be

1427
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,000
you know conscientious of keeping the

1428
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:10,558
children

1429
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,318
safe and you know there's really at

1430
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,760
least in in california and a lot of the

1431
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:17,039
western states

1432
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,359
this real push of um

1433
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,079
you know safety and environmental

1434
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:22,400
concern

1435
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,960
which are all very legit but it's funny

1436
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,280
to talk about environmentalism and then

1437
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,639
still allow you know so much indoor

1438
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,680
cultivation

1439
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:33,358
uh but yeah anyway i'm not gonna go too

1440
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,960
far down that road because that's just a

1441
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:37,119
whole wormhole

1442
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,720
in and of itself but i definitely think

1443
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,240
that sun grown

1444
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:43,759
and outdoor is you know obviously kind

1445
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:45,919
of where we need to be pushing

1446
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,440
and having things like autoflowers is

1447
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,480
something that could help those smaller

1448
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,280
growers get through

1449
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,559
some of these processes to to get to

1450
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,280
where they would like to be which is

1451
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:57,280
maybe just doing full term outdoor

1452
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,880
there's one thing there's one thing

1453
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,079
challenging about autoflowers that's

1454
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,920
worth mentioning

1455
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,000
and that is the fact that you cannot

1456
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,358
clone autoflowers

1457
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,960
and so there is an increased price uh

1458
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:13,119
to growing uh auto flowers because

1459
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,559
uh you know so much so many of us will

1460
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,280
we will hunt for

1461
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,800
the particular mom or moms that we

1462
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,359
really like and then we will

1463
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,160
clone heavily and now we have those

1464
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:24,480
plants

1465
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:26,239
but with autoflowers since you cannot

1466
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,280
clone them

1467
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:32,078
you have to germinate your seed

1468
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,720
and most people germinate it in the

1469
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,880
final

1470
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:36,000
pot or or ground if that's what they're

1471
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,358
going to do because they don't

1472
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,239
transplant well and that means that

1473
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:42,880
instead of

1474
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:44,399
buying one pack of seeds and hunting it

1475
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,960
for mothers and making

1476
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,838
a few hundred or more clones off of that

1477
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,039
you're if you want

1478
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:53,519
600 plants you need to buy 600 seeds

1479
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,159
and so there that is something for

1480
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:56,318
people

1481
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:57,358
to be aware of as well because that's

1482
00:51:56,318 --> 00:51:59,440
that's that is

1483
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:00,799
not that's not a convenient aspect of

1484
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,200
autos

1485
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,720
so so shango you said if you want 600

1486
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,159
plants you have to buy 600 seeds are

1487
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:07,838
these being feminized or are they

1488
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,480
straight run

1489
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:12,719
both both um you know certainly the

1490
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,119
feminized autoflower seeds

1491
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:16,959
um are a hotter property and they are

1492
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,440
more popular and they sell more

1493
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,760
because generally the people who are

1494
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:25,119
growing autoflowers in the first place

1495
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:28,559
have got space time

1496
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,680
or just convenience issues and man there

1497
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,720
is nothing

1498
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,679
more sad than you know mentoring or

1499
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:36,558
helping out

1500
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:37,598
a cannabis patient who grows seven

1501
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,079
plants

1502
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,960
and then four or five of them end up

1503
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,640
being male

1504
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,318
and they have to call them right and

1505
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:45,759
then now they're down to two gosh that's

1506
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:48,960
such a sad thing

1507
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:52,160
and so the the kinds of people who are

1508
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,880
are first to experiment with autoflowers

1509
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:56,159
they're mostly getting feminized seeds

1510
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,838
because they want to know

1511
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:00,159
if they grow seven seeds they're going

1512
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:03,039
to have seven medicine producing

1513
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,159
plants and so certainly there are lots

1514
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:06,719
of regular

1515
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:08,318
um you know male female seeds available

1516
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:09,358
in the autoflower market and they're

1517
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:11,519
fabulous

1518
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:12,558
uh but they're all those are not for

1519
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:14,800
everybody either

1520
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,839
we had a call in question from someone

1521
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,880
who said that

1522
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:22,799
everyone he knows who grows autoflowers

1523
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,800
has a problem with hermaphrodites

1524
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,000
could you call it that was certainly a

1525
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:28,318
problem back in the day right um you

1526
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,719
know

1527
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:31,358
um i don't you know i can't ask the

1528
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:33,439
caller

1529
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:35,039
you know how many of their friends and

1530
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,200
where do they live and what seeds do

1531
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:40,639
they use and how long ago was that

1532
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:43,439
but um you know hermaphrodites can

1533
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:44,558
show up in regular seeds and in femme

1534
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,280
seeds and in

1535
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:49,680
autoflower seeds it's sloppy breeding

1536
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,160
and you can sloppy breed in anything

1537
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:54,000
um the sloppier stuff that i've received

1538
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:54,558
from people yeah i'll see some bananas

1539
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,400
right

1540
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,559
um but i'll see some bananas in my

1541
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,318
regular stuff as well from a sloppy

1542
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,920
breeder so i would say

1543
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:03,119
you know where you're getting your seeds

1544
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,920
make sure they know what they're doing

1545
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,440
and buy good genetics

1546
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,519
i was gonna say there's been something

1547
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,440
going on lately also because we have

1548
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,880
some legacy cultivars that we've been

1549
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,400
growing for

1550
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,800
you know forever and still managed to

1551
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,920
get

1552
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:22,000
some real hermaphrodism this year and

1553
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,838
i i don't know i i've talked with a lot

1554
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,119
of people that are like what is going on

1555
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:27,039
because this isn't normal

1556
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:29,680
there's been i've seen quite a few grows

1557
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:31,920
now a surprising number

1558
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:33,440
that grew really good genetics from

1559
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,358
really good breeders

1560
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,480
and ended up having all kinds of very

1561
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:39,679
bizarre things

1562
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,838
happening the most notable was

1563
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:43,519
a early bloom where it did not come out

1564
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:45,358
of flower but then it started putting

1565
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:46,798
out vegetative branches and then those

1566
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:48,558
would go into bloom and that would put

1567
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:51,280
out another vegetative branch

1568
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,160
wow so they were getting all this like

1569
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,960
different

1570
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:57,039
kind of like a consecutive planting of

1571
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,039
corn but it was all one plant

1572
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:01,679
and and it was like i've i've seen that

1573
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:03,440
once about five or six years ago with a

1574
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:07,039
cultivar that we got

1575
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,480
out of china creek and and it grew great

1576
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:09,838
for the first year and it grew great for

1577
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,358
the second year and the third year i did

1578
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:12,239
exactly that and i've never seen it

1579
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:15,519
since

1580
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:18,558
until this year when i know four growers

1581
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:20,000
different cultivars one of them

1582
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:23,119
didn't tell me who the genetics or

1583
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,159
cultivar was but at least two breeders

1584
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:28,720
not related and so i and

1585
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:31,279
well while i do agree that most

1586
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:33,679
hermaphroditism is sloppy breeding

1587
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,359
or it's a cookie genetic which just has

1588
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:37,519
that tendency and then not good

1589
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:39,759
cultivation strategies and their

1590
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,559
cultural methodology is off and they're

1591
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,559
you know

1592
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,680
have light leaks and weird weirdness of

1593
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:47,680
that sort

1594
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:49,199
or watering issues but um but yeah it

1595
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:50,719
kind of is interesting to see that

1596
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:52,318
there's some weird things happening this

1597
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,318
year too

1598
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:56,318
and again i don't know with the

1599
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:57,440
hermaphroditism and the autoflowers if

1600
00:55:56,318 --> 00:55:58,639
that's

1601
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,798
something like you were saying if that

1602
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:02,159
was current or

1603
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:03,920
previous we never experienced that with

1604
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:05,679
autoflowers way back in the day but

1605
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,358
um like i said i only played with them

1606
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:10,719
once and and then i was

1607
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:12,960
not going to mess with it again for your

1608
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:13,919
listeners who are very much interested

1609
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,838
in um

1610
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,920
plants that hermaphrodite or more

1611
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:21,039
technically become intersex

1612
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,039
um the podcast that i host

1613
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:24,400
shaping fire we had a really good

1614
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:28,318
interview recently

1615
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:31,358
with uh with cannabis breeder ryan lee

1616
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:35,119
also known as chimera and he goes uh

1617
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:38,318
into detail about female only breeding

1618
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:41,599
and we we talk at length about uh

1619
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:42,880
what causes uh plants to go intersex and

1620
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,000
the the variety

1621
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,760
of pressures that could be put on a

1622
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,039
plant to cause them

1623
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,680
to to show um you know

1624
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:55,279
both genders and so folks might want to

1625
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:56,960
check that out uh if

1626
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,839
if they're you know if they're nerds

1627
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,358
about uh hermaphroditism

1628
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,159
which uh which episode is that against

1629
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:05,759
chango uh i wish i knew the number i'm

1630
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:08,318
i'm gonna guess it's like uh

1631
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,280
65. uh i don't know it off the top of my

1632
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:13,358
head

1633
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:15,200
but it's with ryan lee ryan lee okay

1634
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:16,639
perfect i haven't heard that one yet

1635
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,919
i'll have to i'll have to backtrack a

1636
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:19,598
little bit i've been

1637
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,318
working and not listening very much to

1638
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,318
anything so

1639
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:26,558
but yeah it's definitely an interesting

1640
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:29,920
aspect

1641
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:31,680
so far so good on my in-house genetics i

1642
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,000
didn't have

1643
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:36,078
any hermaphrodite going on or any

1644
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,920
branches but

1645
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,440
yeah interesting if there's any other

1646
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,280
colors and colors

1647
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,798
there are a few minutes to call into the

1648
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,839
radio show and we can't

1649
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:49,280
put you on the air but our engineer br

1650
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,759
can take your questions and we can get

1651
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,720
to you

1652
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,359
get to it and the number is nine two

1653
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:56,959
923-3911

1654
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:59,759
so thank you caller i appreciate that

1655
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,760
for bringing that up

1656
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:08,399
you were asking earlier about you were

1657
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,358
asking earlier about um

1658
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,838
growing in the pacific northwest and um

1659
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:13,920
uh

1660
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:15,199
it's it's fun because most people

1661
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,760
consider uh

1662
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:18,798
indoor originating here in the pacific

1663
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,079
northwest

1664
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:24,000
and the first big jumps and lights um

1665
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,280
you know starting here and and i must

1666
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,920
admit i have not

1667
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,680
dug deeply into that histories but um

1668
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,240
it's it's a it's a common thing for me

1669
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:32,078
to hear

1670
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:33,759
even when i'm down in your area at

1671
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,920
emerald cup people talking about

1672
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,960
the early tech and and best practices

1673
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,358
coming out of indoor

1674
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,039
in this area and so you know we've got

1675
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:44,318
really great indoor

1676
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:47,199
in washington um but

1677
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:49,519
when we have a good summer it's it's so

1678
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:51,439
much more preferable to get the wide

1679
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:52,880
open terpene profiles that you get under

1680
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,599
the sun and of course it's

1681
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,240
less expensive and it's easier to hide

1682
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,960
and

1683
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:59,838
um you know it just feels good to grow

1684
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,199
in the ground

1685
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:05,199
versus indoors or or in a tent

1686
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:06,719
but one thing we've been experiencing is

1687
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:09,439
that even though

1688
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:09,838
the pacific northwest is going to be a

1689
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,559
good

1690
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:14,480
place to live for you know the rest of

1691
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,960
my lifetime anyway

1692
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,719
there is no doubt that the climate is

1693
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:22,318
changing and so

1694
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:25,519
um we are we will eventually have

1695
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:28,159
um longer hotter summers

1696
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:28,719
more like southern oregon but for the

1697
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:32,798
moment

1698
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:35,679
we are experiencing the increasingly wet

1699
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:36,318
winters which means that uh when we used

1700
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:38,239
to just

1701
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:40,318
get like oh a little spot of rain the

1702
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:41,679
end of september a little spot the first

1703
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:43,920
week or two of october

1704
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:45,519
and then about october 15th the rains

1705
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,119
really started

1706
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:50,000
our cold our nights going below 55

1707
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,400
started six

1708
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,599
weeks ago and our rain started four

1709
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,480
weeks ago

1710
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:57,519
and certainly there is a seasonal

1711
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,719
variation

1712
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:00,559
but but when you listen to the

1713
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:02,159
meteorologists they're saying wow

1714
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:03,680
every year the rains are starting

1715
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:06,960
earlier and earlier

1716
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:10,078
and and and that's another

1717
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,440
benefit of autoflowers is that if if

1718
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:15,039
your medicine

1719
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:18,480
or your income is based on bringing in

1720
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:21,199
agriculture it's a great idea to

1721
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,920
have some autoflowers going as a backup

1722
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:24,558
plan

1723
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,079
in case like this year we have the worst

1724
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,400
weather that we've had in a decade

1725
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,480
for growing outdoor full-term cannabis

1726
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:33,599
here and people are losing

1727
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:37,280
you know easily 60 70 of their

1728
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:39,599
outdoor uncovered plants even in hoop

1729
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,079
houses because we've had so much fog and

1730
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,119
cold

1731
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:47,039
nights that puts the substrate to sleep

1732
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:49,440
and so but the people who also um

1733
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:50,159
had auto flowers and they hedged their

1734
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,000
luck

1735
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,159
they're like yeah you know i'm taking a

1736
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,880
hit this year on my full terms

1737
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:57,358
but i pulled in a whole bunch of autos

1738
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,000
so

1739
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:01,920
i'll still be able to you know take care

1740
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,880
of either my medicine or

1741
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,798
their customers uh you know for the time

1742
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,119
being

1743
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:10,318
that's interesting i feel like that um

1744
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,720
some of the hermaphroditism we're

1745
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:15,679
experiencing this year is because

1746
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:16,558
like for me and most of us that have

1747
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:19,279
been doing this for

1748
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,559
quite some time we generally start our

1749
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,119
seeds right in mid

1750
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,960
february mid to end of february and

1751
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,240
those were the plants that most of us

1752
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,960
had the most trouble with

1753
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:31,039
and i think it's because our our year

1754
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,039
was just so weird this year it was so

1755
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:34,639
cold for so much longer i think that the

1756
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:36,639
plants possibly

1757
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:38,000
kind of thought it was going into winter

1758
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:40,078
and then all of a sudden it was summer

1759
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,079
and then they just got confused and

1760
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,318
you know that can just warp those kind

1761
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:48,000
of that epigenetical potential of

1762
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:49,519
a plant um so interesting you guys

1763
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,358
you guys are getting our the longer

1764
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:54,239
winters and we're getting these just a

1765
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:56,480
shift of seasons almost

1766
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,159
yeah i do remember that cold spell we

1767
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,280
had

1768
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:03,759
early early in the spring and

1769
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,960
i did plant i did plant later which may

1770
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,760
be why i didn't have

1771
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,559
many issues with my seeds but yeah i

1772
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,559
remember that

1773
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:13,200
hey guys i got another listener question

1774
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:16,720
about autoflowers

1775
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:16,719
and she

1776
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:20,640
i think she direct seated and she said

1777
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,399
it took

1778
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:24,318
two weeks longer than she expected and

1779
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,280
what's the uh you know how long do they

1780
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:26,719
go

1781
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,200
does it depend on the variety because

1782
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:31,679
this one was an og strain

1783
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:32,399
sure well um yeah there's there is a

1784
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,118
range there

1785
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,000
they seem to depending on the the

1786
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:39,119
original

1787
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,559
um the cultivar that you're you're

1788
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,640
breeding into

1789
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,319
uh that will play a role and then

1790
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:46,400
they're ten they're there are different

1791
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:47,759
reuteralis cultivars that you can go

1792
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,358
into and so

1793
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:55,920
loose loosely autoflowers run into

1794
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:59,038
60 90 and 100 day cultivars

1795
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,838
mostly i've really only come across good

1796
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,760
plants that are

1797
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:05,519
90 to you know 90 to 100 days

1798
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,960
and when i say good i mean i'm looking

1799
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:09,920
for bigger plants there's there's

1800
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,440
fantastic small plants that are 60 days

1801
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,760
but that's just really not enough time

1802
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:17,280
to get big for you know the kind of

1803
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:20,559
effort that i'm looking for the when

1804
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:24,160
the plants take longer when direct

1805
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:26,240
seeded it's usually because the plant is

1806
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:27,759
not being kept warm enough now certainly

1807
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:29,919
i don't know what your

1808
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,240
what the caller is doing but we

1809
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,400
experienced that here ourselves a lot of

1810
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:36,558
people tried to start their autoflower

1811
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,680
seeds may first this year

1812
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:42,720
and it was cold here um until

1813
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:45,199
uh second week of june and

1814
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:45,838
and so a lot of people who direct seeded

1815
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:48,078
uh

1816
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:50,480
in the beginning of may their plants

1817
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:53,039
just sat there as sprigs until

1818
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,880
june and then they started going off and

1819
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,720
they they weren't entirely successful

1820
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,920
whereas people who waited a month to

1821
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:00,078
june 1st

1822
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,358
so they direct seeded into a warm

1823
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,760
substrate where

1824
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:05,199
you know the microbe life was alive they

1825
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,720
popped right up and these were the same

1826
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:08,719
seeds right they popped some of them in

1827
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:11,759
may and some of them in june

1828
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:13,759
and so keeping the substrate warm i

1829
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,960
don't think that in most cases

1830
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:19,440
substrates are going to be you know as

1831
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,679
warm in may in most parts of the country

1832
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,960
one of the workarounds that we've used

1833
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:25,679
is to

1834
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:28,559
even though the plants don't like to be

1835
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:30,239
transplanted

1836
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,240
if you want to grow in the ground which

1837
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:36,000
is always warmer you can start

1838
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:39,519
in a 1 gallon and let the plant start

1839
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,519
indoors and then in the first say

1840
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:44,000
two two and a half weeks then go ahead

1841
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:46,559
and transplant it outside that way the

1842
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,559
you can transplant outdoors without

1843
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,920
disturbing the root zone

1844
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,119
and a lot of people get away with that

1845
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,838
but you wanna you wanna make sure you

1846
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:56,559
keep that root zone

1847
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:58,719
so shango you've said a few times that

1848
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,160
they don't like being transplanted

1849
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:01,919
is that just that they're going through

1850
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:04,078
some heavy transplant shock

1851
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,079
or what what happened why what's the

1852
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:07,440
deal with the transplanting

1853
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,000
yeah that's exactly it it's the

1854
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,039
transplant shock these plants don't live

1855
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,440
very long

1856
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,559
and we're all used to with photos we

1857
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,720
transplant them

1858
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,240
it slows them down for you know a little

1859
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:19,679
bit and then they just come on right

1860
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:21,358
back and that's no problem

1861
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:22,960
but if a plant's only going to live for

1862
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:26,318
90 days the

1863
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:29,599
transplant shock slows them down enough

1864
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:33,038
to make them really

1865
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:35,760
you know disappointing plants so

1866
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:37,440
when using autoflowers you want to do

1867
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,079
your best to

1868
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,679
transp or germinate in the soil you're

1869
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,318
going to stay at and you don't want to

1870
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:44,639
disturb

1871
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:45,838
the roots and so you want to pack your

1872
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:48,719
your one gallon

1873
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:50,078
a little more tightly so that when you

1874
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:52,959
if you were to transplant

1875
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,760
into a larger container or the ground

1876
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,240
that you don't

1877
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,200
disturb the roots that will be in the

1878
01:05:56,239 --> 01:06:01,118
interior

1879
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:02,719
of the soil so could you do a direct

1880
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:04,000
seed and it seems to me like thinking

1881
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:06,879
back to some traditional

1882
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,079
agriculture what we used to do way back

1883
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,640
in the day was you have these little

1884
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:12,400
things called cloches or hot caps

1885
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:14,318
and you would put that over your tomato

1886
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,720
to germinate your tomato in ground

1887
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:19,279
earlier and it was just like it created

1888
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:21,439
a tiny miniature greenhouse

1889
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:23,200
so i'm wondering uh if that would be

1890
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,480
something that might work for that or if

1891
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:27,038
you think it would still be

1892
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,240
too cold regardless no i think that's a

1893
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:31,280
great idea actually

1894
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:32,239
um and and what's interesting too is

1895
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:35,760
that uh

1896
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:39,439
when we are direct seeding outdoors

1897
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:42,720
we run into many more

1898
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:44,960
mice and bird problems because normally

1899
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:48,558
when we go outside we're already to

1900
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:51,920
a you know 12 inch or more clone that

1901
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:53,920
is not as susceptible to mouse and bird

1902
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,000
but when you're putting an autoflower

1903
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:59,039
seed that is this like delicious

1904
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:02,798
newly alive morsel

1905
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:06,079
uh birds and mice uh are way more likely

1906
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:08,960
to attack them um uh once you what

1907
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,760
four years ago or so um we lost like you

1908
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,358
know 30

1909
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,520
of these plants and it's like you know

1910
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:16,318
when you're when you're buying them

1911
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:17,358
right off the shelf and you're paying 10

1912
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:19,759
bucks a seed

1913
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,719
that that hurts you know and so i think

1914
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,280
the idea of

1915
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:23,759
a cloche or um you know a lot of people

1916
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,880
just

1917
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,319
take um you know plastic two-liter

1918
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,760
bottles that would normally go into the

1919
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:31,440
trash or the recycling

1920
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,039
and they'll they'll cut off the bottoms

1921
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,880
of those now certainly that's not gonna

1922
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,559
work at commercial scale

1923
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:42,318
but for somebody who's gonna do ten

1924
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:45,680
plants in their yard that'll be great

1925
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:47,119
yeah absolutely that's uh it's i mean

1926
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:50,239
commercial scale even if

1927
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:51,680
you're still paying ten dollars a seed

1928
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:54,959
i don't know that starts to lose its

1929
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:56,719
attractiveness pretty rapidly for me

1930
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,318
at commercial levels you're not paying

1931
01:07:56,719 --> 01:07:59,679
ten dollars a seed though right

1932
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:01,358
you're paying ten dollars a seed if

1933
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:03,598
you're buying a pack right

1934
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:05,920
um yeah at a commercial level if you're

1935
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:08,079
buying a hundred or a thousand seeds

1936
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,960
uh those seeds are more down like two or

1937
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:12,400
three bucks

1938
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:15,519
uh and uh you you might have a

1939
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:17,279
um you know a a a commercial volume you

1940
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:19,119
have to buy at that rate

1941
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,560
but the vast majority still like like

1942
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:22,399
we're all saying they're they're

1943
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,640
the autoflower folks fall into two

1944
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,358
categories patients and home growers who

1945
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,279
are buying

1946
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,480
like one or two or more packs and

1947
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,920
they're growing those

1948
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:35,119
or commercial scale people

1949
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:37,920
and they are buying in in you know 100

1950
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:40,479
500 or 5 000

1951
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,920
counts and so they're very different

1952
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:43,678
markets and honestly they're they're

1953
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:47,440
different types of seeds too

1954
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:49,600
there's far more variety in the um

1955
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:51,678
in the i don't know the the patient and

1956
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,000
home grower market than there are people

1957
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:55,679
who

1958
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:59,520
are creating uh large-scale seeds like

1959
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:02,719
you know by far the the top commercial

1960
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:04,400
grower or breeder is oregon's cbd seeds

1961
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,798
that makes

1962
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:08,639
plants for the hemp market and their

1963
01:09:06,798 --> 01:09:11,198
minimum buy is 5 000

1964
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,000
seeds whereas you get to somebody who's

1965
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:15,599
making

1966
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:19,279
high quality thc plants

1967
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:21,679
uh like daniel from hard rock mountain

1968
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,400
you know he's doing 100 and 500 packs

1969
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:24,960
into the light

1970
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:26,399
licensed market um and much less that

1971
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,560
you're going to buy one pack at a

1972
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:31,759
dispensary

1973
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:35,839
