2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:09,419
up until last summer I really didn't

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,910
have much good to say about CBD

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,830
extracted from hemp I'm not a fan of CBD

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,280
isolate or spiking cannabis products

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,379
with it

7
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,480
CBD just doesn't work reliably for

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,429
patients on its own each of the plants

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,350
cannabinoids terpenoids flavonoids and

10
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:24,300
lipids are vital components that humans

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,939
require to achieve the healing that

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,769
comes with the entourage effect but last

13
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,420
summer something new occurred it was the

14
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,879
first season that plants were grown at a

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,130
commercial scale that were legally hemp

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,320
but they had all the medical marijuana

17
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,170
genetics this is a monumental difference

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,210
up until last summer good folks were

19
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,910
taking industrial hemp fiber plants and

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,890
extracting CBD the problem with CBD

21
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:49,319
isolate though is that the science does

22
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,420
not support its medical efficacy and the

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,909
only reason it exists is because of the

24
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,550
artificial market for isolated CBD

25
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:59,759
created due to federal prohibition of

26
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:02,038
the medicinal whole plant quality whole

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,259
plant medicine comes from whole medical

28
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,019
cannabis plants not from hemp fiber

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,939
plants while the two may share a Latin

30
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,640
name they are wildly different plants

31
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,169
due to years of hybridization the hemp

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,118
plants just don't have the terpene

33
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,118
profiles and other attributes found in

34
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,670
medical cannabis but CBD from hemp fiber

35
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,250
plants is federally legal enough that it

36
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,560
can be sold online so people grow the

37
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,349
fiber hemp plants extract the CBD and

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,820
are selling it rapidly last summer

39
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,158
though some farmers in the u.s.

40
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:33,899
approached CBD plant genetics from the

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,630
opposite direction and instead of

42
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,939
growing fiber plants they turned off the

43
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,640
allele that makes THC in medical

44
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:45,000
cannabis plants and grew truly medical

45
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,500
cannabis plants legally as hemp these

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,780
plans that normally would have been

47
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,030
highly regulated and sold in cannabis

48
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,239
stores were allowed to be grown in open

49
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,689
fields unsecured because with the THC

50
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:00,328
allele turned off they tested below 0.3%

51
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:02,250
THC which makes them legally a hemp

52
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:05,129
plant even though these are really

53
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,140
medical cannabis plants the evolution of

54
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:09,118
this hybrid plant moves us beyond the

55
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,740
simple vocabulary of describing a plant

56
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:11,780
as hemp

57
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,820
or medical cannabis there are now

58
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,250
medical cannabis plants that are

59
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,340
regulated as hemp without being the

60
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,199
fiber producing sort while confusing for

61
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,180
outsiders this evolution will again

62
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,789
remake the CBD market over the next five

63
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,950
years and for die-hard CBD enthusiasts

64
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:30,229
like me there's finally a scalable

65
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,250
low-cost method of providing CBD to

66
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:33,259
patients everywhere

67
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,030
the next major milestone will be the

68
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:38,030
inclusion of cultivars that have above

69
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,159
0.3% THC but we're not quite yet they're

70
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,960
federally if you want to learn about

71
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,490

guest today is Seth Crawford

96
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,590
Seth is a deinstitutionalized academic

97
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:36,319
with a master's in public policy in a

98
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,930
PhD in sociology his focus has been on

99
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,519
the political economy of cannabis for

100
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,500
years now he has been consulted by

101
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,750
lawmakers and policy specialists for

102
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,650
better understanding of how the cannabis

103
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,500
economy works

104
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,450
he's now co-founder of Oregon's CBD a

105
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,219
company researching developing and

106
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:54,049
wholesaling high CBD cannabis seeds

107
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:55,909
today we're gonna talk about the

108
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,660
dramatic evolution occurring in CBD

109
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:00,889
genetics hey welcome to the show Seth

110
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:03,049
pleasure to be here thanks for having me

111
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:04,459
thanks so much for coming back so so

112
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,740
let's start at the very beginning you

113
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:10,879
know you and your brother Eric saw this

114
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:13,340
opportunity to produce CBD on the large

115
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,040
scale because there were so many

116
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,410
patients that were yearning for it and

117
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,780
yet to do it large scale you had to

118
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,910
figure out a way to make it legal to

119
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,909
grow in volume where you lived in

120
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:28,730
Oregon so so what did you and Eric see

121
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,820
in this opportunity that decided to push

122
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:36,410
you in this direction of producing CBD

123
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:38,959
from plants that are legally hemp we

124
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:42,980
have always really been looking forward

125
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:45,189
to the day of being able to grow enough

126
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,020
plants to do scientifically accurate

127
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:50,660
selection you know it's we've we're

128
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:54,079
hobby breeders for a decade before we

129
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,370
got into this full scale and there's

130
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,889
some really neat things that you can do

131
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,319
as a hobby breeder and people are doing

132
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:02,180
this all over the world and we love to

133
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,099
see it but there are a lot of things

134
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,759
that you just can't do with you know

135
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,640
four plants or six plants that really

136
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,759
emerges when you start growing thousands

137
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,680
at a time to do your selections that

138
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,449
that was that was one of the driving the

139
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,389
driving factors for us was just being

140
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:21,500
able to breed better plants yeah that

141
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:24,860
makes a lot of sense when you can do a

142
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,930
sift that's that huge you're just gonna

143
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,730
jump ahead of hobbyists like you were

144
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,189
saying you're only gonna do there their

145
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:33,890
patient max of four or 15 or whatever

146
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:35,990
it's going to be you know one of the

147
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:38,089
things I want to really drill on in this

148
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,030
part that's what sets you apart from a

149
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:42,949
lot of the other hemp from CBD producers

150
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:46,369
because I actually I do talk a lot of

151
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:49,310
trash about hemp derived CBD on this

152
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:52,009
show but but the weird thing is I always

153
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,230
have to make this caveat except for the

154
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:56,418
stuff that comes from oregon CBD seeds

155
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,540
right because you guys are going about

156
00:05:56,418 --> 00:06:01,430
this a different way than nearly

157
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,160
everybody else in hemp and if I

158
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,259
understand it all correctly you know so

159
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,770
many of the hemp from CBD companies they

160
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:12,949
started with the fibrous version of hemp

161
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:15,620
and they are trying to breed in the

162
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:19,879
medicinal qualities of you know full

163
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:22,129
cannabinoid content medicinal terpenes

164
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,709
and you know in order to be able to pull

165
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:27,709
the entourage effect out of a fiber

166
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:30,079
plant and you know I have not seen a lot

167
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:31,399
of success in that however you guys came

168
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,550
from the other direction you guys

169
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:37,689
actually started with a legit

170
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:41,530
healing full-spectrum marijuana medical

171
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:45,098
marijuana plant and you decided to turn

172
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:48,068
off the THC allele and which as far as

173
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:50,829
I'm understanding from outside of the

174
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:53,110
CBD market that CBD hemp market that is

175
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:56,439
a wholly new approach so break that out

176
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:59,830
a little bit for us would you yeah that

177
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:04,240
that's accurate description of of what's

178
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:06,189
going on you know not only entourage

179
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,788
effect for individuals who would be

180
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:11,439
consuming the the final product but the

181
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:13,598
other thing that you end up missing out

182
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,990
from just a basic plant biology

183
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:20,139
perspective if you have no terpenes in

184
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,759
your plant you generally have more pests

185
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:25,389
you have more disease you have more

186
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,500
problems cannabis in in the in the long

187
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:31,329
term evolved many many different

188
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,189
different terpene combinations that

189
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:36,098
allow it to thrive in its natural

190
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:37,930
environment as the hand of humans has

191
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:39,399
started to select for those different

192
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,769
characteristics we've obviously

193
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,769
gravitated towards particular smells and

194
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:47,079
particular effects that go along with

195
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:50,680
with those terpenes whether it's for THC

196
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:53,139
in combination with THC or CBD or as

197
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,598
we'll talk about pretty soon CBG and

198
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:58,028
other cannabinoids so what we were

199
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:01,000
really really trying to do was to just

200
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:02,528
recreate that that like you said an

201
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,449
entourage effect but that beautiful

202
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:07,180
pallet that comes along with well bred

203
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:10,800
cannabis in Oregon we're lucky enough to

204
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:13,120
be surrounded by literally decades of

205
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,310
incredible breeding that has been done

206
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,949
by a number of different individuals and

207
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,658
put into the sort of the public well in

208
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:23,560
terms of cannabis varieties that

209
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:26,968
individuals have access to and we once

210
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,139
once we had figured out how to how to

211
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:33,578
essentially turn off the the THC

212
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:35,829
production it allowed us to then go back

213
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:37,569
to those wells and find those really

214
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:39,759
interesting to European combinations and

215
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,310
breed them back in to create new lines

216
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:45,490
and that's that was basically the the

217
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:46,929
essence of our business to begin with so

218
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,129
so what can you

219
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:50,588
tell us I mean I understand that there's

220
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:53,588
a certain part of where your genetics

221
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,610
come from that is proprietary but I'm

222
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:56,830
sure that there are people who are

223
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:00,490
listening like me who would just love to

224
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:03,399
hear what cultivar of medical cannabis

225
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:06,430
you started with and what you did to it

226
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,950
to turn off this THC allele because I'm

227
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:11,289
sure that that has raised flags for a

228
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,480
lot of GMO minded people in the audience

229
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:16,449
so so for those of us who really care

230
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,730
can you break that out a little bit yeah

231
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,770
there's there's really no secret we

232
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:25,149
didn't start with anything that was that

233
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:27,179
was miraculous or strange we started

234
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:30,490
just like most other I would say

235
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:34,000
small-scale breeders getting different

236
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:37,120
varieties from Europe mostly from Spain

237
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,169
and also natively sourced here in the in

238
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,028
the United States most of the varieties

239
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:45,269
you can see sort of the the history of

240
00:09:43,028 --> 00:09:48,370
the emergence of CBD

241
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:50,949
many of the varieties were one-to-one so

242
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,009
these are type 2 cannabis plants that

243
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,620
have relatively equal parts THC and CBD

244
00:09:54,009 --> 00:10:00,580
that was that was the starting block

245
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:03,159
that we we began with and really what it

246
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:06,070
comes down to with with all real

247
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:07,929
cannabis breeding the answer to get to

248
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:11,050
your solutions generally starts with

249
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:12,370
inbreeding we just do a lot of line

250
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:16,120
breeding inbreeding

251
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:18,459
specific plants selfing those and when

252
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,370
you self those plants you start to lock

253
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:23,889
in specific characteristics and say with

254
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:28,330
a one to one plant if you if you were to

255
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:31,240
self that you're going to end up with 25

256
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,520
percent of the resulting progeny as high

257
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,980
CBD plants 25 percent of the resulting

258
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,159
progeny will be high THC and the other

259
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:42,149
50% are roughly 50 percent are still

260
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:46,990
type twos so it the initial the initial

261
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:49,679
process was not at the time it may have

262
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:52,240
seen fairly revolutionary but in reality

263
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,979
it's really not and there are a number

264
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,620
of other people who are doing that as

265
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,120
well some of the the later advances that

266
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,970
we were able to achieve like

267
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:06,169
flowering type 3 high CBD plants and now

268
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,759
type 4 CPG plants that that I think is

269
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:12,500
that's definitely something that did set

270
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:16,939
us apart and it was it was mostly driven

271
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:19,039
by agricultural necessity we could

272
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,500
create really good plants identify them

273
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:24,110
clone them and run those clones and

274
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:28,490
fields and you have really good outcomes

275
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:32,210
but to to grow at a truly industrial

276
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:33,528
scale to make you know a an affordable

277
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,660
medicine for people that's actually

278
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:38,960
effective you really can't just grow

279
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:42,829
clones and that's when we started really

280
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:46,970
working on producing viable f1 hybrid

281
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:49,670
seeds using our are very inbred line and

282
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:52,940
recombining those was that was the goal

283
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:55,069
always to create a feminized and auto

284
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,420
flower seed or is that something that

285
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:59,150
you realized was going to be necessary

286
00:11:56,419 --> 00:12:01,370
as you started interacting with your

287
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:04,009
agricultural clients and realizing oh my

288
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,589
god we need to make this easier you know

289
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:08,838
if for us it was out of necessity just

290
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:12,709
in terms of how we could maximize our

291
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,450
own production Eric and I have always

292
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:17,539
seen auto flowering plants as having a

293
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:20,209
very very interesting niche if if

294
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:22,278
managed properly and we've always been

295
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:26,389
curious about whether or not that would

296
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:33,409
end up leading to innovations on in

297
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:35,600
large-scale agriculture I think that it

298
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:38,269
does and I think what we're seeing right

299
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,350
now is not just on the CBD side but also

300
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:44,088
on for THC as long as you can get the

301
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,550
right terpene combination in those

302
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:49,430
flowers Auto flowers are fantastic for

303
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:51,829
large-scale production if it's if it's

304
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:54,500
going into an oil whether that's for cut

305
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,900
consumption or for a vape pen or you

306
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,450
know whatever else a myriad products are

307
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:01,879
on the market autos are incredibly

308
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:05,180
useful but it was it was mostly just

309
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:07,399
trying to develop initially and this is

310
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:12,589
back in 2016 it seems like forever ago

311
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:14,000
right now but in 2016 we were we were

312
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,820
trying to give ourselves as many options

313
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,309
as possible you know if you're trying to

314
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,960
grow early in the season you know your

315
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:23,269
best bet is probably an auto flowering

316
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,889
plant and if you're trying to grow you

317
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,710
know to maximize production you want to

318
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:28,939
have a plant that finishes early in the

319
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,280
season but it's still photo period

320
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,950
sensitive so we developed our early

321
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,199
lines to do that and if you have a long

322
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,480
enough growing season you can you know

323
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,009
potentially have a third crop with Auto

324
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,269
flowers as they tend to be a little bit

325
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:45,110
more robust and resistant to freezing I

326
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:47,659
think it's really interesting to

327
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,750
consider it because you know feminized

328
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:53,029
in Auto flower seeds in the you know

329
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:56,029
traditional heritage cannabis farmer

330
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:57,980
world they get a you know short shrift

331
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:01,009
right feminized and Otto flowers or

332
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,240
somehow seen as unnatural and a lot of

333
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:03,740
people have a lot of gripes with them

334
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,810
but when you when you talk to people

335
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,899
about their particular gripes it's

336
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:11,299
because you know they got some seeds

337
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:13,610
that had been you know bred into a

338
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:16,129
feminized and so now there's like hermes

339
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:18,230
and their stock and it seems that the

340
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:20,840
reasons why people don't like feminized

341
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,180
an auto flower has little to do with the

342
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:26,240
seed itself and everything to do with

343
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:28,609
how people have used them incorrectly

344
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,639
for their purpose whereas you're

345
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:34,879
designing these seeds specifically for

346
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,100
multi acre grows in an agricultural

347
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:40,009
setting where you're dealing with really

348
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,740
high volume and every plant has to be

349
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:46,700
the same and harvested you know either

350
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,870
at the same time or in known waves and I

351
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,940
think that's an important thing to point

352
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:53,450
out is that these are feminized and auto

353
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:58,480
flower seeds for a reason that has never

354
00:14:53,450 --> 00:15:02,180
existed before that's exactly right

355
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,210
and a.22 and they're almost two separate

356
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:08,149
issues I mean the the complaints about

357
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:13,310
auto flowering plants especially for THC

358
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:17,209
production were legitimate I grew out of

359
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:19,339
flowering THC plants present at six 2007

360
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,530
shortly after they kind of emerged on

361
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,139
the market and they were terrible I mean

362
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:26,439
you could see the promise with them but

363
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:28,509
the terpene profile was awful

364
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,820
you know it left you just feeling like

365
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:32,679
you know you've been hit by a train and

366
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,390
not in a good way

367
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:36,459
they were they were they were not

368
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:38,230
sophisticated they did not have good

369
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,820
palates but the performance was

370
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,039
something that I just you know

371
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,140
immediately latched onto and said if you

372
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,509
can if you could make the flavor better

373
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:50,679
and increase the overall resin content

374
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:53,439
this has potential you know it took it

375
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:55,989
took a decade to get back to to that

376
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,840
need it before before we started

377
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:01,539
developing the newer versions of them

378
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:05,620
but in that interim time in the in that

379
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:09,429
10 years there was sort of a revolution

380
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,320
in and good terpenes being added into

381
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:14,469
those autoflowering THC plants as well

382
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,460
so have been have been working to

383
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,860
improve that was I think we're to the

384
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,420
point today where you can end up with

385
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,620
with fairly high quality plants that

386
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:23,019
come out of come out of the

387
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:27,070
autoflowering world with a feminized

388
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:30,009
feminized see your point is spot-on a

389
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,900
lot of a lot of breeders you know you

390
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:35,250
can't see me so I'm doing air quotes at

391
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:38,439
this point but some breeders who are

392
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:41,980
more interested in just selling seed

393
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:46,240
than necessarily creating good stable

394
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,889
lines they're not as careful with with

395
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,200
weeding out those from a frenetic traits

396
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:55,449
we're to the point with with our

397
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:57,840
breeding that we see one male and I

398
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:00,460
they're not males they're they're

399
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,440
they're definitely female plants but

400
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,590
they're male they have male phenotypes

401
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,750
so we've we've found one in 4,000 in our

402
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,609
fields and this is literally we're

403
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,990
talking about millions of plants that

404
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,369
have been grown in in Oregon and

405
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,620
elsewhere over the last two years using

406
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:16,569
our seed and it's it's a very consistent

407
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:19,949
rate we get one in 4,000 that have a

408
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:24,009
male phenotype we've screened them using

409
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:27,160
PCR doing the the genomics test from

410
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:28,420
medicinal genomics and they they're

411
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,250
female even though they have male

412
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,080
phenotypes the really interesting

413
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,500
background on that too is that if you

414
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:39,699
use one of those those phenotypic males

415
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,028
to pollinate other female plants you're

416
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,610
going to end up with

417
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:45,169
fifty percent that are phenotypically

418
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:47,119
male and fifty percent that are

419
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:50,240
phenotypically female so it's a it's a

420
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,469
strange a strange mutation that's going

421
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,788
on and I'm not really sure what's

422
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,610
happening I don't think anybody knows at

423
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:58,849
this point but uh an interesting feature

424
00:17:55,609 --> 00:18:01,668
for sure but one in 4000 versus you know

425
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:03,980
having hermaphroditic traits built into

426
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:05,929
your plants we feel like that's a pretty

427
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:09,259
good ratio you know that's for us that's

428
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:11,149
one plant every two acres you end up

429
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:13,849
having to cut down see that's you know

430
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:17,928
that's actually epic will will that will

431
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:21,769
that you know typically male yet somehow

432
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:23,899
female plant be a risk to the rest of

433
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:27,288
the crop oh can there be any pollination

434
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:29,449
oh yeah yeah it'll definitely pollinate

435
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:31,429
and yet we recommend to farmers that you

436
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,980
basically walk your field you know it's

437
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:36,048
the old adage of the best fertilizers of

438
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,750
farmers footprints is definitely true in

439
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:40,460
this case you go out and you find those

440
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,288
as soon as they start flowering they're

441
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,460
very easy to spot they look just like a

442
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:48,710
male and you we cut them down and you

443
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,808
know even though that adds labor for the

444
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:54,019
farmer it kind of warms my heart right

445
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:57,048
because even though we are scaling up

446
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:59,870
and industrializing several aspects of

447
00:18:57,048 --> 00:19:01,339
cannabis production there's still

448
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:03,319
something in it that the farmer has to

449
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:05,629
be in the in the field and be around the

450
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:08,750
plants and to give it that human touch

451
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:10,789
or at least awareness very much so very

452
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,909
much so in it you know it really draws

453
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:15,230
attention to the risk of pollen floating

454
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:18,110
around in the environment in the first

455
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,788
place you know that that one male plant

456
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:22,009
it's not going to pollinate your entire

457
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:25,250
crop and the chances of it you know

458
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:26,990
pollinating a neighbor are very slim but

459
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,849
you will end up with a twenty five to

460
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:32,659
thirty foot section of your field that

461
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:34,119
is just completely seated and seeds you

462
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:36,679
know obviously scattered throughout

463
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:39,709
wherever the wind was blowing we had a

464
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,240
fairly interesting I say interesting now

465
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,919
because it's been long enough that I'm

466
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,710
not completely emotionally scarred from

467
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,049
it anymore with interesting situation

468
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,509
back in 2016 we were trying to make

469
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:52,339
feminized seed doing a light deprivation

470
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:53,879
run in the middle of the summer and we

471
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:59,339
had a neighboring farmer that had

472
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:02,040
planted about 38 million male female MCS

473
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:06,059
just broadcast see it was the first his

474
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:07,799
first year growing and it ended up you

475
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:10,919
know it's a tremendous amount of males

476
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:15,299
that were out in this field and the the

477
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:18,000
pollen from that field destroyed farms

478
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:20,730
15 miles to the north 15 miles to the

479
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,250
south 15 miles to the west excuse me to

480
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,450
the east everybody to the West was fine

481
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:28,049
because that's the way that the wind was

482
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:31,140
blowing but that that one just

483
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:33,419
small-scale experiment ended up in the

484
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,759
the first major year of production for

485
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,640
Oregon recreational growers you know it

486
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:41,609
seeded a lot of crops it destroyed we

487
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,500
lost 15 million seeds in in in that

488
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:46,439
summer alone just due to contamination

489
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,059
we had to destroy them so pollen pollen

490
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,519
is a significant issue and it's

491
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:52,349
something that we have tried to be out

492
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:54,150
on the forefront in terms of providing

493
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:56,129
education of farmers to make sure that

494
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,150
they know just what the risks are and to

495
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,880
have good communication with their

496
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:02,400
neighbors but also question question the

497
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,370
veracity of seed makers with the claims

498
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,590
that they're making it's a the adage

499
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:11,909
about cannabis seeds being a seedy

500
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:14,669
business is very very true you know your

501
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:16,620
unfortunate neighbor seeding the whole

502
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,640
valley and you mentioned you know it

503
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:19,769
points out the importance of

504
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,270
communication what did your valley do

505
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:23,160
because your valleys full of hemp

506
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:24,960
farmers now from what I understand what

507
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,700
did you guys do to increase your

508
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,079
communication so that kind of malarkey

509
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:33,870
doesn't happen again well it's it's been

510
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:37,970
an up rode up rode up an uphill battle

511
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:40,439
to be perfectly honest most farmers are

512
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,390
are responsible about it and try to

513
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,700
communicate the Department of

514
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:48,750
Agriculture in Oregon makes available

515
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,370
the list of farm sites and the acreage

516
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,789
so we know where all the other hemp

517
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:55,259
farms are in the state and we have email

518
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:56,579
addresses and phone numbers and that

519
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:59,309
sort of thing to be able to communicate

520
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:01,529
with other farmers that that's the the

521
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:03,929
main thing that you have to do but at

522
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:06,500
the same time there are some especially

523
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:08,180
older traditional farmers

524
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,970
sort of thumbed their nose and just say

525
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,650
look I have a right to farm and we've

526
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,960
basically had to come back and say well

527
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,970
we do too and you're right the farm is

528
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,600
infringing on ours and if you pollinate

529
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:23,420
our crop with your your your grain crop

530
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:25,189
that's worth a dollar a pound we're

531
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,019
probably going to have to resort to

532
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,509
legal action and we don't want to do

533
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:31,460
that but the precedent needs to be set

534
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:35,869
that that people who pollinate others

535
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:37,700
are responsible for that so I why to

536
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:39,679
change hats for a minute before we go to

537
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,940
our first commercial you know up to this

538
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,840
point we've been talking a little bit

539
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:47,720
about specifically you know oregon CBD

540
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:50,029
seeds your company but but but a lot of

541
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,430
people know you as your you know

542
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:56,299
academic professor role where you

543
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:59,180
testify in front of the legislature and

544
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,769
are just you know a general CBD expert

545
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,830
right so I want you to put on that hat

546
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:06,200
for a minute so take off your your CEO

547
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:08,509
co-founder hat and put on your your

548
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,740
professor hat and and and and answer me

549
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:16,490
this how is what you are doing there and

550
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:18,680
the seeds that you are providing to your

551
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,700
your partners in Oregon how does that

552
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:24,880
compare to what is going on in the other

553
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:28,160
hemp hotspots in the country for example

554
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,580
Colorado because you know as I as I tell

555
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,170
people about what you're doing in Oregon

556
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:36,019
which you know when I toured your

557
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:39,019
facility you know it's mind-blowing

558
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:40,430
right is what's going on there if you if

559
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:41,900
you've been taking care of patients for

560
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,519
a long time and you think about it

561
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,280
you're like oh my god this is like the

562
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:49,490
Holy Grail you know low price high turps

563
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:51,829
high CBD not from fiber hemp oh my god

564
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,750
right but but at the same time there are

565
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:55,849
people also excited about their

566
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:58,069
breakthroughs in Colorado and other

567
00:23:55,849 --> 00:24:00,289
places but but they seem to be of a

568
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:01,849
different tenor so stepping away from

569
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:05,480
the fact that you've got a company and

570
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:07,219
into your academic shoes how is what you

571
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,519
are doing compared to what's happening

572
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:13,250
elsewhere in the United States yeah

573
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:15,259
that's a it's a great question you know

574
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,180
and it's you know if we're gonna go to

575
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:18,890
the professor route it kind of gets to

576
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,298
the the point of the work that I was

577
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,959
doing before

578
00:24:20,298 --> 00:24:27,578
my area of expertise was sort of social

579
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:30,528
networks a long-term organization of

580
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:34,308
capitalist societies you know these sort

581
00:24:30,528 --> 00:24:36,138
of big picture you know 500 year or 500

582
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:37,459
year views on the development of

583
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:40,308
different social systems around

584
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:42,349
different technologies whether that's an

585
00:24:40,308 --> 00:24:44,989
agricultural technology or markets and

586
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:47,598
you know that sort of thing and I bring

587
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:50,619
that to where we're at today with with

588
00:24:47,598 --> 00:24:53,418
cannabis because it's it's an absolutely

589
00:24:50,618 --> 00:24:55,249
exceptional time to be alive in

590
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,709
witnessing what's going on with this

591
00:24:55,249 --> 00:25:00,440
particular market in good ways and in

592
00:24:57,709 --> 00:25:03,169
bad ways we see the good as you just

593
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,318
described incredible access for for

594
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:07,699
patients and people who didn't even call

595
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:10,848
themselves and would never call

596
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:13,068
themselves patients or just people who

597
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:15,468
are a little bit older who have aches

598
00:25:13,068 --> 00:25:17,328
and pains and they can take this what

599
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:19,639
amounts to a nutritional supplement and

600
00:25:17,328 --> 00:25:22,009
end up having a higher quality of life I

601
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:25,428
mean it's it's D stigmatized to the

602
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:27,048
point where we're just constantly being

603
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:29,538
approached by people who are using these

604
00:25:27,048 --> 00:25:31,578
compounds to to just have a have a

605
00:25:29,538 --> 00:25:34,489
better time in in their their golden

606
00:25:31,578 --> 00:25:36,798
years it's fantastic to see that the the

607
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:39,019
negatives are you know consolidation and

608
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,209
lack of diversity and all of the things

609
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:43,940
that you see happen in all the top elec

610
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:45,709
markets monopolistic markets we're

611
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,440
seeing that definitely emerge right now

612
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:51,669
but on the exciting the exciting set in

613
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,679
these different states Colorado Kentucky

614
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:56,778
North Carolina now is coming online in a

615
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:58,659
big way I mean there's we have 37 states

616
00:25:56,778 --> 00:26:02,659
that have industrial hemp laws passed

617
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:04,940
allowing some form of production right

618
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:07,249
now Oregon Colorado and Kentucky are

619
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,288
definitely out in the forefront and the

620
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:10,818
the folks who were early adopters who

621
00:26:09,288 --> 00:26:12,858
had some capital behind them have

622
00:26:10,818 --> 00:26:16,358
finally gotten their their processing

623
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:19,578
centers up and running to a point where

624
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:21,228
they they can actually handle the amount

625
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:24,798
of material that is is being produced

626
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:28,190
and not only handle it but you know that

627
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:30,798
the demand is as more CBD has has

628
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,820
entered the market the demand has just

629
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,559
increased X

630
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:34,669
financially along with that so it's one

631
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,230
of those situations where the more

632
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,779
people know the more they're exposed to

633
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:41,690
it the greater the demand and it's

634
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:44,440
worked out really well for for everybody

635
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:47,059
in this in this industry

636
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,549
awesome innovations both on the product

637
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:51,980
side on the extraction side and the

638
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:53,809
scalability just being able to put good

639
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,370
good marketing plans together and how to

640
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:57,589
distribute this and get it

641
00:26:55,369 --> 00:27:00,109
you know from point A to point B having

642
00:26:57,589 --> 00:27:04,279
a more robust regulatory environment

643
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:06,139
where we it's no longer I think we're to

644
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:08,569
the point now with hemp at the federal

645
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,090
level that we we know that it's not just

646
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:13,579
going to go away it's it's only going to

647
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:15,559
continue to expand and that's given

648
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:17,779
given a lot of the people in the

649
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:19,369
industry a little bit more confidence

650
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:22,369
that the direction that we're going is a

651
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:23,599
good one and it's okay to continue to

652
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:26,419
invest your time and labor in this

653
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:29,509
because it's it's really just gonna go

654
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:31,519
up so as far as seed providers go now I

655
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:33,950
want to drill down very specifically to

656
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:37,250
this potentially difficult question so

657
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:39,080
so what makes Oregon CBD seeds great is

658
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,450
the uniqueness of your seeds and the

659
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:44,809
fact that you came from that the medical

660
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:48,580
cannabis side and then brought it under

661
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:51,409
the umbrella of hemp by Creative

662
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:51,799
hybridization is anybody else in the

663
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,350
country

664
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:56,779
been successful doing that I mean do you

665
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:59,059
have competitors that are doing putting

666
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:01,160
out these same kinds of seeds that they

667
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:03,859
have found their way to this same

668
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,110
solution or are you guys the only folks

669
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:09,469
in the country that are that that are

670
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:12,439
coming from the cannabis medicine side

671
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:14,720
and not from the fiber hemp direction oh

672
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,220
no there's there are definitely

673
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,809
definitely others who have been doing

674
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,259
the same thing and who've been doing it

675
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:23,720
just as long as us some good some good

676
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:28,069
breeders in Colorado we have good

677
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:30,170
breeders in Oregon as well they're the

678
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:32,299
the fun part is is there's there's

679
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:34,400
always somebody always somebody doing

680
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:36,470
something unique the thing that really

681
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,630
sets us apart was the creation of the

682
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:40,549
auto flowering plants and in addition to

683
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:42,680
that are the development of our early

684
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:45,079
flowering photo period sensitive

685
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,779
varieties so we are the only ones who

686
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:50,189
are doing that at this

687
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:51,928
and for us that's that's the major

688
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,490
technological innovation in addition to

689
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:55,860
having terpene rich very very high

690
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:58,019
content plants that was the major the

691
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:00,539
major innovation that has really pushed

692
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:03,569
a lot of the farmers in Colorado in

693
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:06,329
Kentucky in it in addition to Oregon

694
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:09,689
farmers in our direction are the three

695
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:11,579
hotspots of Oregon Colorado and Kentucky

696
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,900
are you guys all allowed to buy seeds

697
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:16,470
from each other or do you have to buy

698
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,929
seeds in state I know we are allowed to

699
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:22,019
ship anywhere in the United States it

700
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:24,150
has a section seven six zero six farm

701
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:26,160
bill compliant industrial hemp research

702
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:29,610
program so we ship to Kentucky we ship

703
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:32,100
to Colorado we ship Vermont Maine North

704
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:33,418
Carolina South Carolina we have some

705
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:35,639
clients in Florida that are coming

706
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:39,030
online later this year anywhere there's

707
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,610
a hemp program we can ship all right

708
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:45,720
awesome so so now with this first set as

709
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:48,659
talking about kind of where the the seed

710
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,130
technology is at the moment I think

711
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,808
let's wrap up this first sex I'm really

712
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:54,840
excited about the second set because

713
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:56,369
your season was insane and it was an it

714
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:59,639
was very enjoyable for me to watch it

715
00:29:56,369 --> 00:30:01,739
from a state of way and and and watch

716
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,809
you go crazy and it'll be a good story

717
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,579
so so stick around folks we're gonna

718
00:30:03,808 --> 00:30:07,289
take a short break and be right back you

719
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:11,548
are listening to shaping fire my guest

720
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:13,079
today is Seth Crawford of Oregon CVD we

721
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:14,700
humans are attracted to plants because

722
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:17,279
they offer us relief and are a whole lot

723
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,169
of fun sometimes though the best parts

724
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,210
are buried inside the plant and we need

725
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:23,130
to use specialty extraction technology

726
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,230
when it comes to cannabis it is

727
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,330
extraordinarily important to extract its

728
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,308
precious oils without changing them in

729
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:31,589
the process we want to preserve the

730
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:33,480
properties of the cannabinoids terpenes

731
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:37,319
and other constituents that all work

732
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,029
together since 1994 Eden labs has been

733
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:40,918
developing extraction technology and

734
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:43,470
processes to do just that

735
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,360
Eden labs was founded by a cannabis

736
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,610

737
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,219

738
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:52,168

740
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:57,240

741
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,940
Eden labs flagship product is the newly

742

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,240
market it is the high flow from Eden

745
00:31:04,378 --> 00:31:08,519

Shengo Louis and our guest this week is

843
00:34:55,150 --> 00:35:00,400
Seth Crawford he's co-founder of oregon

844
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,980
CBD so now that we've got you all set up

845
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,289
at how you got to this summer there Seth

846
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,559
let's talk about this craziness that was

847
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:11,699
this summer so people have an idea of

848
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:15,159
the of the magnitude we're talking here

849
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:17,889
describe the number of fields that you

850
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:19,960
were running and then also the

851
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:22,089
associated fields like you know in your

852
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,480
area that were that were using your

853
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,480
seeds

854
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:32,929
uh yeah that's what we had five separate

855
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:34,779
locations various various acreages are

856
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:38,960
our main research and development field

857
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:42,400
was about forty forty thousand plants

858
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,858
planted on around thirty five acres

859
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,389
total number of seeds that went out for

860
00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:48,920
the state of Oregon and to a couple

861
00:35:47,389 --> 00:35:53,319
other states we were looking at about

862
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,670
two thousand acres worth last season a

863
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,980
substantial number of substantial number

864
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,510
of plants yes substantial number it's

865
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:02,570
really enjoyable to walk through that

866
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:05,359
much terpenes being given off to and so

867
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:08,359
and so you had your fields and you

868
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:11,179
provided your you know seed leadership

869
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:12,710
to other folks in your valley and and

870
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:15,259
we've already hit the story of the guy

871
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:17,088
pollinating the valley a couple years

872
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:20,000
ago but but what I'm kind of putting

873
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:21,858
together is that your local area you you

874
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,789
guys have kind of become the epicenter

875
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:27,799
of of hemp growing in Oregon and there's

876
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:29,570
there's some amount of partnership you

877
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:33,760
guys are kind of like a UH

878
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:36,170
an industry block of intention right

879
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,750
yeah I think that's an accurate

880
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:40,039
description although I'd also throw in

881
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,980
Southern Oregon as well southern

882
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:45,769
organism has long been a large cannabis

883
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:48,108
producing area and a lot of the the

884
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:50,000
recreational farmers have they started

885
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:51,710
out last year doing smaller plots but

886
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,960
are moving in this year to bigger plots

887
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,088
and it's really becoming a force unto

888
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:00,170
its own as well but here here in the

889
00:36:56,088 --> 00:37:02,690
valley we're after after the great

890
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:05,809
pollination event of 2016 everybody's

891
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:08,059
sort of banded together to to try to

892
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:12,710
ensure that new farmers were educated

893
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:14,900
and that the other farmers had access to

894
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:17,630
not only feminized seed but good

895
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:20,240
information one of the the major

896
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:23,030
concerns that we've had is sort of

897
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:26,329
unsavory characters making claims about

898
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:28,010
seed that they sell last season you know

899
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:30,319
people were saying this is mostly

900
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:33,200
feminized and farmers would plant it and

901
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:37,039
it would be fifty percent female which

902
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:38,359
is not mostly feminized that happened on

903
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,969
a regular basis yet

904
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,160
seed sellers who were offering offering

905
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:45,980
varieties that were actually type 2

906
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:48,079
plants so equal parts CBD to THC and it

907
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:51,139
led to about 10% of the the state

908
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,909
failing their THC compliance tests so

909
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:55,819
everybody's trying to trying to watch

910
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:57,949
out not only for their own interests but

911
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:01,280
the the interests of the larger

912
00:37:57,949 --> 00:38:04,699
industrial hemp community at large so

913
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,920
it's turned into a nice sort of

914
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:08,839
cooperative that everybody can

915
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,119
contribute to you know it just occurred

916
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,910
to me that that you know the the

917
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,069
compliance tests to make sure that the

918
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:18,019
the amount of THC in the plants are so

919
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:21,140
low those happen at the end of the

920
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:25,460
season and because your plants are high

921
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:28,219
CBD no THC your farms don't have the

922
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:31,820
same kind of hardcore security around

923
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:34,069
them that THC plants do and it's it's

924
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:37,010
funny and somehow ironic that there were

925
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:39,620
all of these one-to-one plants that were

926
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:42,980
being grown in fields just out next to

927
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:45,589
people's houses and and they were fine

928
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:48,769
and safe just because no one knew they

929
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:50,900
had THC in them even though those plants

930
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:55,039
are like every high schoolers dream to

931
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:58,010
go grab yeah exactly exactly and it's

932
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,480
scary to be to be perfectly honest it's

933
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,570
sad for the farmers that ended up buying

934
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:05,750
those seed they were they were built by

935
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:07,490
unscrupulous unscrupulous breeders but I

936
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:10,250
mean what you're saying is is completely

937
00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:12,769
true the problem is is that if you're

938
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:14,659
over 1% so if you if you're over 0.3

939
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:16,820
percent THC you fail your compliance

940
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:18,859
test but if you're over 1% you get

941
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,080
turned into the local sheriff's and

942
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:23,930
that's that's a that's a significant

943
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:26,900
problem especially if you have 10 to 20

944
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:28,549
acres of those plants you you you the

945
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,230
numbers that you're talking about would

946
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,730
lead to a life sentence in prison

947
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,260
I think Jeff Sessions was just talking

948
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,150
about reinstituting the death penalty

949
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:38,810
for for people who were growing that

950
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:40,309
many cannabis plants so it's a laughing

951
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,949
matter to a certain extent because we

952
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:45,710
can say hey people did this and even

953
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:47,629
though it was it was unscrupulous people

954
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,340
who were misleading them the world

955
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,690
didn't in just because some THC was

956
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,869
grown outside without offense and

957
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,759
security it

958
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:56,099
the neat part you know the two downside

959
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:57,480
is is it's a it's a legitimate risk and

960
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:59,700
there's a lot of problems that can come

961
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,829
along with that yeah the thing that you

962
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:04,199
could you could pull a felony for what

963
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:05,999
is absolutely a technicality and seed

964
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:09,088
purchase that is scary as hell

965
00:40:05,998 --> 00:40:11,189
yeah yeah and the the part that really

966
00:40:09,088 --> 00:40:13,889
got us is that we knew that this was

967
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,358
going to happen we knew where the seed

968
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:18,778
source was coming from we knew that

969
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:23,369
there had been male THC plants that were

970
00:40:18,778 --> 00:40:24,960
outdoors in a neighboring field and we

971
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:28,230
knew that the C crop had been

972
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,150
contaminated but because there is no

973
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:32,338
seed certification program there's no

974
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:34,230
you know you don't have to have any

975
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:38,190
verification that the seed is actually

976
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,789
type 3 industrial hemp is sort of a

977
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,798
free-for-all

978
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:43,109
then it's allowed some grifters to to

979
00:40:40,798 --> 00:40:44,670
enter the marketplace they usually stick

980
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:46,528
around for one year and everybody

981
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,930
figures out that they don't know what

982
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:50,699
they're doing and they'll try to get

983
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:53,308
some quality seed but in the meantime

984
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:55,710
the lives are ruined crops are lost and

985
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:56,160
it just it's a black eye for the entire

986
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:59,579
industry

987
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:02,578
right on so it's this next part of the

988
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:03,930
interview that that kept me so excited

989
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:06,329
to have you back as soon as that you

990
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:08,548
could find time for us again and that is

991
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:10,559
that the the evolution of your business

992
00:41:08,548 --> 00:41:13,318
model over the course of this last

993
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:16,650
summer so what I'd like you to do is to

994
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:18,960
- you know I understand that the the

995
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:21,470
major force of your business model was

996
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,318
that you were going to make and sell

997
00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:30,509
feminized autoflowering high CBD nearly

998
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:33,028
zero THC seeds but as part of that you

999
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:35,849
need to have these research and

1000
00:41:33,028 --> 00:41:37,768
development fields and and so that you

1001
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:39,900
can see how your plants are coming along

1002
00:41:37,768 --> 00:41:41,848
on how they work in real agricultural

1003
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,548
environments so at the end of the season

1004
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:46,289
you were going to have I think you said

1005
00:41:44,548 --> 00:41:49,559
maybe seven acres or something like that

1006
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:51,749
of plant material that was R&amp;D but now

1007
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:53,220
you've got all this flowers so so I'm

1008
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:55,649
just kind of kind of set you up to tell

1009
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:58,409
this story of what was your plan what

1010
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:59,999
were your plans going to be for the

1011
00:41:58,409 --> 00:42:02,009
flower at the beginning of the season

1012
00:41:59,998 --> 00:42:05,549
and how did that evolve

1013
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:07,349
over the course of the summer yeah

1014
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:09,590
well you know this valley is we had

1015
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:11,579
experienced the year before

1016
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:16,320
sometimes there's pollen floating around

1017
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:18,389
so we had basically just planned on

1018
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:22,320
planting our field getting our research

1019
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:24,659
crops in running the risk of getting

1020
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,120
pollinated and having having a seeded

1021
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:28,589
crop and basically the only option that

1022
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,049
you have at that point is to turn it

1023
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:33,000
into oil and sell it to extractors so

1024
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:34,560
that that was essentially our plan going

1025
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,769
into the season we just wanted to do our

1026
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,119
field trials to to ensure that the

1027
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:42,059
varieties that we are offering to

1028
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,339
farmers for this this season actually

1029
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,750
perform the way that we described so we

1030
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,490
like to run our field trials to here

1031
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:51,570
before and then then offer the seed once

1032
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:54,149
it's been progeny tested we got to the

1033
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,980
end of the season and you know we kept

1034
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,230
checking the flowers and you know

1035
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,969
there's no pollen yet you know have

1036
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,469
another week goes by there's no there's

1037
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:03,299
no pollen yet that I'm not seeing any

1038
00:43:01,469 --> 00:43:06,559
seeds forming you know and we finally

1039
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:09,300
got basically about two weeks away from

1040
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,820
two weeks away from from the initial

1041
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,400
harvest and everything looked really

1042
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,890
good there you know there were no seeds

1043
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,430
in it and you know at that point you're

1044
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:23,009
looking at you're looking at 35 acres of

1045
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:28,349
unseeded just beautiful Turkey and rich

1046
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:30,270
flowers it's as you got to experience

1047
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:32,429
it's it's very hard to be able to

1048
00:43:30,269 --> 00:43:34,079
accurately describe the excitement that

1049
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:37,079
one who's passionate about cannabis and

1050
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,730
terpenes will have walking through it is

1051
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,429
so there's so much joy in that

1052
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:43,320
experience oh my god walking through and

1053
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:44,669
smelling all the terpenes as the Sun is

1054
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:48,030
hitting the flowers and they're all

1055
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:50,190
calling out oh man it's yeah it's

1056
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:52,050
otherworldly and it just it puts a smile

1057
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:54,119
on my face to think about it and every

1058
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:56,700
time we we send a farmer out the door

1059
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:58,079
with with seed you know it's the one

1060
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:00,719
thing that we generally leave them with

1061
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,940
is just wait until August you know when

1062
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:06,719
your field is in full bloom and it's you

1063
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:08,429
don't have to harvest just yet it's a

1064
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:11,480
it's a truly magical experience it's

1065
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:13,369
it's transformational it's very cool

1066
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,889
we got to that point in the season and

1067
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:18,259
you know we'd we had had some some folks

1068
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:20,719
come from Switzerland who really wanted

1069
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,040
to get our flowers because you know they

1070
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:24,169
came and they smell them early in the

1071
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:28,099
season and Wow these are these are

1072
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:30,260
tremendous but we you know knowing that

1073
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:33,650
the risk of contamination I didn't want

1074
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:36,080
to put us into a situation where we you

1075
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:38,990
know we would get into a contract to

1076
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,119
supply trimmed flowers or something like

1077
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:42,289
that that's what they wanted and then

1078
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,869
end up with a seeded crop and not be

1079
00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:47,840
able to follow through on it but once we

1080
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:49,900
made it to that point in the season we

1081
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:53,930
realized that okay

1082
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:56,000
we're good we're gonna trim and dry as

1083
00:44:53,929 --> 00:45:00,529
as many of these acres as we possibly

1084
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,480
can and send them internationally - to

1085
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:03,980
Switzerland all right so let me hold you

1086
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,449
right there cuz that's a big deal

1087
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:08,300
number one how did the people in

1088
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:11,689
Switzerland found find out about your

1089
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:15,019
little farm in Oregon that's a great

1090
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:19,039
question I'm I'm honestly not sure but

1091
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:21,259
we're contacted pretty regularly the the

1092
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:24,199
Swiss European sorry that the European

1093
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:26,390
and Swiss hemp market for smokeable

1094
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:28,579
flowers has has really just taken off in

1095
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:31,039
the last couple years Switzerland has a

1096
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:33,380
1% THC rule which gives you a little bit

1097
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,900
of flexibility and in the oil content of

1098
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:38,420
the plant and so they they've been

1099
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:41,570
producing it in mostly in glass houses

1100
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:45,800
for the last two years trying to meet

1101
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:48,230
the demand and they saw Oregon as you

1102
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:50,570
know sort of a hotbed of production and

1103
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:53,719
started reaching out to different farms

1104
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:55,580
throughout the state and most of the

1105
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:58,189
farms that we're growing good material

1106
00:45:55,579 --> 00:46:00,829
we're all actually growing our seat so

1107
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:04,760
the band as they say the roads all seem

1108
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:08,029
to lead back to us and so they they

1109
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,950
found us and and we got them some

1110
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:11,660
flowers

1111
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:13,699
so so one of the things that I picture

1112
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:17,690
in my head is that as the summer goes

1113
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:20,089
and as more people you know hear your

1114
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:22,250
story and they hear the first podcast

1115
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,309
that I did with you at the beginning of

1116
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:26,280
the season

1117
00:46:23,309 --> 00:46:27,929
and you know in the hemp people just

1118
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,330
start talking about what you guys are

1119
00:46:27,929 --> 00:46:33,989
doing that you're starting to get more

1120
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:36,269
and more you know VIP contact from the

1121
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:38,939
US and interested people from other

1122
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:42,509
countries and and I can feel like this

1123
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:44,880
brewing this attention and people making

1124
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:47,400
contact with you and yearning for your

1125
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,470
stuff is that how it was feeling for you

1126
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,170
as well as you're like oh my god we're

1127
00:46:49,469 --> 00:46:55,679
we're riding this bowl of a product and

1128
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:57,570
now everybody wants it very much so very

1129
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:01,980
much so and that was that was true both

1130
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:04,260
on you know our flower material and on

1131
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,329
the the seed itself because the flower

1132
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,520
material was I think it was excellent

1133
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:10,889
the products that are coming out of it

1134
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:12,659
were we're definitely things that I'm

1135
00:47:10,889 --> 00:47:16,429
proud of and I think everybody on our

1136
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:19,769
crew is would say the same thing but

1137
00:47:16,429 --> 00:47:21,599
because it was an R&amp;D field you know we

1138
00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:23,039
were basically doing the trials for what

1139
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,000
other farmers will be growing this

1140
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:29,880
season and the the buzz was definitely

1141
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,829
palpable so it led to not only the

1142
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,450
demand I demand for the flower material

1143
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:34,349
for the resulting trim and you know all

1144
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:38,989
the other products that go along with

1145
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:43,889
that but for the seed as well our our

1146
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:46,439
harvest cease was was long arduous as

1147
00:47:43,889 --> 00:47:48,779
they always are for everybody but it

1148
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,360
didn't stop I mean we went from we went

1149
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:54,570
from our our flower harvest and trimming

1150
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:58,050
and exporting to building out new

1151
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:59,340
facilities in three separate counties to

1152
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:04,050
make sure that we could we could meet

1153
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:05,220
the exploding seed seed demand and you

1154
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:07,560
know I want to take a quick second here

1155
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:09,269
and mention you you've dropped out three

1156
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:11,250
or four times it's been increasing as

1157
00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:12,750
the interview is gone so if you're

1158
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,309
listening and you're like I keep on

1159
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:17,809
losing you know like a second or two

1160
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:21,059
it's because we're Seth lives way out

1161
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:23,880
early in Oregon they are experiencing a

1162
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:26,639
thunderstorm and so when the weather

1163
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,559
gets bad they drop packets sometimes so

1164
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:29,969
don't think that it's that it's your

1165
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,739
phone or whatever we're just we're just

1166
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:33,480
occasionally dropping packets from Seth

1167
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:35,309
so so thanks for staying on the line

1168
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,969
there Seth even though it's the

1169
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:40,469
weather's getting crazy down there

1170
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:42,569
so prom yeah sorry for the jobs yeah

1171
00:48:40,469 --> 00:48:44,579
well you know so so so I want to finish

1172
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:46,680
up this great Switzerland stories so now

1173
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:48,179
that you know the the Swiss folks found

1174
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:50,369
you and they contacted you and they

1175
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:51,869
wanted to buy your flower but you're

1176
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:53,069
like I don't want to commit to the

1177
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:54,869
flower because we think it's gonna get

1178
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:57,269
seated over the summer now you're two

1179
00:48:54,869 --> 00:49:00,239
weeks out from harvest and you've got

1180
00:48:57,269 --> 00:49:02,849
all of this unseated sinsemilla high CBD

1181
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:04,379
flower and you're like oh my god this

1182
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:07,589
product this is the value of this

1183
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:10,019
product just just shot up because it's

1184
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:13,050
got great value in other countries so

1185
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:14,550
how did that deal finish up because you

1186
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:17,010
know I talked to you briefly during that

1187
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:19,230
time and you were like oh my god we've

1188
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:22,440
got it we got to hire all this new staff

1189
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:23,820
and trimming machines and and and we

1190
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,800
gotta figure how to package this and get

1191
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:27,240
it to Switzerland so so tell that part

1192
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,900
of the story because I found it pretty

1193
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:35,789
engaging oh it was traumatic I don't

1194
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:38,639
even want to revisit it yeah I mean just

1195
00:49:35,789 --> 00:49:41,579
a number of different growing pains and

1196
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:44,239
in logistical details of you know

1197
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:45,659
basically learning how to operate

1198
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:48,149
large-scale machine

1199
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:49,409
trimmers hiring a very large crew of

1200
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:52,010
people to come in to do the finish

1201
00:49:49,409 --> 00:49:57,179
trimming with that packaging

1202
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:58,380
I had never I'd never shipped quantities

1203
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:03,329
that we were talking about we ended up

1204
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:06,360
using FDA approved 55-gallon drums with

1205
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:09,409
plastic liners we could fit about 30

1206
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:12,180
pounds without without crushing the the

1207
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:13,980
resulting product about 30 pounds in

1208
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:15,839
each one of those and you could fit four

1209
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,449
of those on a pallet and then shrink

1210
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:23,180
wrapped them and off they go so it was

1211
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:28,460
just non-stop deluge of trimming

1212
00:50:23,179 --> 00:50:30,779
packaging wrapping shipping and and in

1213
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,970
going back into the field to then

1214
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:35,519
harvest more and more and more and dry

1215
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:38,730
and you know basically maximizing our

1216
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,559
drying space and our throughput and just

1217
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:42,329
have it there's no way that we could

1218
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,539
have done what we did without the crew

1219
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:47,860
that we had everybody was very devoted

1220
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:50,920
to to the cause

1221
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:52,480
and for a lot of people it was sort of a

1222
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,340
mind-blowing experience you know

1223
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,409
everybody is used to you think

1224
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,940
industrial hemp and you definitely don't

1225
00:50:56,409 --> 00:51:00,279
think of the flowers that we were

1226
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:01,950
pulling out of that field so it's it was

1227
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,610
it was fun it was definitely uh

1228
00:51:01,949 --> 00:51:05,349
definitely a good experience for

1229
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:06,940
everybody involved and this is one of

1230
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:08,739
the times that you're really glad that

1231
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:11,440
you're growing Otto flowers too so that

1232
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:13,599
you can stagger the harvest because with

1233
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,280
with regular photosensitive flowers

1234
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,130
everything would have been ready just

1235
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,780
about the same time so this is this is

1236
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:21,849
the interesting part we did have Auto

1237
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,920
flowering plants but the material that

1238
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:25,960
we were trimming were their photo period

1239
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,780
sensitive varieties but they have been

1240
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,820
designed to flower very very early and

1241
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:32,350
the other characteristic that we've been

1242
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:35,769
able to put into these plants is that

1243
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:37,769
you can stagger the harvest with them

1244
00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:40,360
and you get about a three week window

1245
00:51:37,769 --> 00:51:42,070
the first batch was finished the first

1246
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,510
week of September the second batch was

1247
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,980
done the second week of September and

1248
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:46,630
then you know we were basically

1249
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:48,610
harvesting until the rains hit after

1250
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:50,860
that with the the later the later

1251
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:53,110
maturing varieties but they they're all

1252
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:54,910
within the same the same basic harvest

1253
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,920
window and that's that's one of the

1254
00:51:54,909 --> 00:52:00,339
innovations that we've been able to that

1255
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:02,740
we've been successful in breeding into

1256
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:05,289
the lines that we've developed so we're

1257
00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:08,639
all familiar with seeing the the kinds

1258
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:13,559
of machines that are used to harvest

1259
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:15,579
fibrous hem what kind of you know

1260
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:18,309
mechanizations can you use for

1261
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:20,110
harvesting you know when you want to

1262
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:22,210
preserve the flowers it's all done by

1263
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:26,590
hand and the only mechanized part is the

1264
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:29,260
trimmer that is correct yeah and it's

1265
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:30,910
what we tell clients is a charity there

1266
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,620
are a number of different options for

1267
00:52:30,909 --> 00:52:34,750
your finished product at the end of the

1268
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:37,150
season you know you can you can flash

1269
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:39,489
dry it and the terpenes will vaporize

1270
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:41,559
and it's it's basically only useful for

1271
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:45,459
isolate there is a market for that it's

1272
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:48,219
although it's a lower value then the the

1273
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:50,079
next best option is something like a low

1274
00:52:48,219 --> 00:52:51,819
temperature hop kiln that's operating

1275
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,969
anywhere between 80 to 90 degrees and

1276
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:57,280
just moving a tremendous amount of air

1277
00:52:54,969 --> 00:52:58,989
just getting that air movement to dry

1278
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,460
those products retain a lot of the

1279
00:52:58,989 --> 00:53:01,369
heavier terpenes you lose your monitor

1280
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,519
pians

1281
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:07,009
but you still end up with a nice

1282
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:09,980
synergistic potential medical product

1283
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:12,560
that would be turned into oil that the

1284
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:15,289
highest value is if you you treat it

1285
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:19,279
just like a high-grade THC plant you

1286
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:20,960
hang dry it slowly cure it and then you

1287
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,370
know we went with the the mechanical

1288
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:27,470
route on on on trimming just because the

1289
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:30,710
cost of hand trimming would have been

1290
00:53:27,469 --> 00:53:33,139
prohibitive and not physically possible

1291
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:34,400
to be perfectly honest with the quantity

1292
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:37,039
that we were dealing with and also

1293
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:40,160
probably not necessary honestly you know

1294
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:43,519
hand trimming is certainly something

1295
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:45,259
that changes the bag appeal but the at

1296
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:50,239
at this point the audience that you were

1297
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:52,130
serving were cigarette smokers in in

1298
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:56,689
Switzerland which is certainly a

1299
00:53:52,130 --> 00:54:00,500
different crew than West Coast cannabis

1300
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:04,429
connoisseurs exactly exactly yeah it was

1301
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:09,980
it was I've never been a big fan of

1302
00:54:04,429 --> 00:54:12,859
machine trim but it did a decent job so

1303
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:15,079
so um I gotta ask how did how did you

1304
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,970
get all these pallets and and if you can

1305
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:18,829
tell me how many pallets of these four

1306
00:54:16,969 --> 00:54:22,039
drums were there and how did you get

1307
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:23,329
them Switzerland honestly I don't even

1308
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:25,400
remember how many there were

1309
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:27,529
that's a blur but there were a lot that

1310
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:31,940
left our facility like like 100 though

1311
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:34,670
right uh not not that many not yeah I

1312
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:39,320
have no way to translate how 37 acres

1313
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:42,769
into pallets right yeah yeah and in

1314
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:45,710
different products as well so with the

1315
00:54:42,769 --> 00:54:48,050
with the pallets we would basically just

1316
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:50,690
we had a shipping company that would

1317
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:53,240
arrive and take the pallets directly to

1318
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:55,700
the Portland Airport and they would they

1319
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:58,789
would fly out to Zurich with a direct

1320
00:54:55,699 --> 00:55:00,500
flight the the company that was

1321
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:02,750
purchasing it from us would take

1322
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,219
possession at the Portland terminal so

1323
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,210
it was no longer ours they were in legal

1324
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:08,538
possession of it

1325
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:10,668
so the off it went the

1326
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:13,729
that that's that's one way of doing it

1327
00:55:10,668 --> 00:55:16,909
we also have these very large bags are

1328
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:20,268
used for grass grass seed other other

1329
00:55:16,909 --> 00:55:22,788
seed crops grains called super sacks and

1330
00:55:20,268 --> 00:55:25,998
those can hold about anywhere between

1331
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:28,039
250 to 300 pounds of trim material all

1332
00:55:25,998 --> 00:55:31,218
at one time and and they're basically

1333
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:32,719
just a pallets worth of material that's

1334
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:35,989
kind of the industry standard in terms

1335
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:39,199
of shipping large quantities of material

1336
00:55:35,989 --> 00:55:40,969
to processors domestically but that's

1337
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:44,239
that's also now going international as

1338
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:47,329
well so this last question before we go

1339
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:49,400
to break I hope that you don't deem it

1340
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:51,199
unfair but I'm gonna set it up properly

1341
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,929
but it's it could be a hard question and

1342
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:55,668
I know you to be a very patient centric

1343
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:57,798
dude both you and your brother have got

1344
00:55:55,668 --> 00:56:00,679
big hearts you you work with patients

1345
00:55:57,798 --> 00:56:01,699
you give advice to people for CBD you

1346
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:03,650
like them to have strong

1347
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:06,679
endocannabinoids systems and you are

1348
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:08,809
very invested in your local cannabis

1349
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:10,818
scene so you're you're the kind of

1350
00:56:08,809 --> 00:56:13,759
people that we want to see succeed and

1351
00:56:10,818 --> 00:56:17,028
when I visited the farm I had all these

1352
00:56:13,759 --> 00:56:18,438
visions of you know low price to

1353
00:56:17,028 --> 00:56:20,778
cannabis getting into the hands of

1354
00:56:18,438 --> 00:56:23,568
patients and I was excited for that and

1355
00:56:20,778 --> 00:56:27,018
yet somehow I was also excited for you

1356
00:56:23,568 --> 00:56:29,989
that you got this amazing buyer in

1357
00:56:27,018 --> 00:56:32,748
Switzerland and that was cool but all

1358
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:37,489
this CBD was now leaving the United

1359
00:56:32,748 --> 00:56:39,828
States and yeah you had to have been

1360
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:42,469
torn about that and I'd love to hear

1361
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:46,189
about your decision yeah very very much

1362
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:48,229
so you know the the largest influencer

1363
00:56:46,188 --> 00:56:52,728
of that was the fact that you know we

1364
00:56:48,228 --> 00:56:55,248
have this this Oregon market that we

1365
00:56:52,728 --> 00:56:57,889
could have sold directly into had it not

1366
00:56:55,248 --> 00:57:03,168
been prohibited by state law at the time

1367
00:56:57,889 --> 00:57:06,918
you could not sell cannabinoids or flour

1368
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:08,598
product into the adult use market if it

1369
00:57:06,918 --> 00:57:11,719
was derived from industrial hemp and

1370
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:14,088
that was just the strange quirk in in

1371
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:16,429
the Department of Justice in the state

1372
00:57:14,088 --> 00:57:19,159
of Oregon in their interpretation of the

1373
00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:22,200
existing law it took us a whole year to

1374
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:24,539
get that change we just are

1375
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:27,000
our lobbying group for industrial have

1376
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:29,579
farmers just got that passed in the last

1377
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,800
legislative session in March so we hope

1378
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:34,530
to be able to to sell products not just

1379
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,119
CBD but also CVG and other novel

1380
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:38,339
cannabinoids this weed is we're able to

1381
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:41,730
isolate them into the Oregon market

1382
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:44,369
first excellent but yes very bittersweet

1383
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:46,139
yeah totally both sides of that too to

1384
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:47,910
see all the potential and then realize

1385
00:57:46,139 --> 00:57:49,650
that it wasn't actually gonna make it

1386
00:57:47,909 --> 00:57:51,000
into local patience yeah bittersweet

1387
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:52,619
well said alright let's go ahead and

1388
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,329
take our second short break you are

1389
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:57,289
listening to shaping fire my guest this

1390
00:57:54,329 --> 00:57:59,609
week is Seth Crawford of Oregon CBD

1391
00:57:57,289 --> 00:58:01,980
using pesticides when growing cannabis

1392
00:57:59,608 --> 00:58:04,380
has been common for a long time nowadays

1393
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:06,570
though we know better we know that most

1394
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,070
pesticides formulated for food crops

1395
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:10,500
have never been tested for use with

1396
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:12,750
cannabis they've been tested to be eaten

1397
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:14,730
in tiny doses they have not been tested

1398
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:16,880
to be inhaled and especially not

1399
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:19,230
concentrated into a cannabis oil

1400
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,970
chemical residues from pesticides are

1401
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:23,490
not healthy for anyone but they are

1402
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:25,108
especially dangerous for patients for

1403
00:58:23,489 --> 00:58:27,419
commercial cannabis growers this has

1404
00:58:25,108 --> 00:58:29,190
become very impactful cannabis

1405
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,829
enthusiasts and patients have gotten

1406
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:34,769
educated enough that they avoid growers

1407
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:36,420
who used pesticides not only that but

1408
00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:38,699
states across the country have begun

1409
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:42,269
making pesticide testing mandatory on

1410
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:43,769
all licensed cannabis crops the time has

1411
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:45,869
come to find a better way to fight

1412

garden pests than covering your cannabis

welcome back you are listening to

1477
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:18,840
shaping fire I'm your host Shango Llosa

1478
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:22,620
our guest this week is Seth Crawford

1479
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:24,000
co-founder of Oregon's CBD so in this

1480
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:27,059
last section we're going to talk a

1481
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:33,690
little bit about legality and a lot

1482
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:35,670
about the future of CBD derived hemp but

1483
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,710
first of all I want to hit on the the

1484
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:40,200
Reggie Godinho interview that we had

1485
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:43,320
last week all about intellectual

1486
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:46,769
property and cultivars because I know

1487
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:48,820
that it excited you and engaged you in a

1488
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:50,920
lot of very important ways

1489
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:53,289
so I want to give you the floor so that

1490
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,990
you can kind of speak to the topic last

1491
01:01:53,289 --> 01:01:59,590
week of of protecting these important

1492
01:01:55,989 --> 01:02:01,449
cultivars that you are developing yeah

1493
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:04,990
it was an excellent interview I'd really

1494
01:02:01,449 --> 01:02:06,819
appreciate you just making the time and

1495
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:08,439
and regi for making the time to have

1496
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:11,500
that conversation I think it's an

1497
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:14,170
incredibly important moment in time for

1498
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:17,889
the entire cannabis industry having

1499
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:19,599
moved from you know a system where each

1500
01:02:17,889 --> 01:02:22,929
individual breeder was doing their own

1501
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:25,980
thing and generally in small small ways

1502
01:02:22,929 --> 01:02:29,799
but others doing it in larger ways

1503
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:31,929
having having a new legal environment in

1504
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:35,019
place as I think changed the the

1505
01:02:31,929 --> 01:02:36,339
calculations for a lot of people one of

1506
01:02:35,019 --> 01:02:38,320
the things that we have done is

1507
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,610
basically what what Reggie was

1508
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:44,519
advocating for and that is to

1509
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:46,980
preemptively file patents to protect the

1510
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:49,239
breeding technology breeding approach

1511
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:53,079
that we use to create a lot of our

1512
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:55,539
varieties at the end of the day whether

1513
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:57,009
or not the US Patent Office will will

1514
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:58,480
grant that is you know obviously

1515
01:02:57,010 --> 01:03:00,040
something that we're gonna have we're

1516
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,990
going to do our best to make that happen

1517
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:05,190
the way that we end up using it however

1518
01:03:01,989 --> 01:03:08,229
is a lot of people are concerned about

1519
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:10,030
individuals or corporations holding

1520
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:13,329
these patents and then excluding wide

1521
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:16,450
swaths of certain types of plants or

1522
01:03:13,329 --> 01:03:18,130
chemo types or chirping profiles from

1523
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:19,629
the general public that's something that

1524
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:20,980
we're very concerned with as well it's

1525
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:25,000
obviously not something that we would be

1526
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:29,230
doing but you know it raises this this

1527
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:31,449
this this really complicated issue for

1528
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:33,449
people who are investing a significant

1529
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:35,769
amount of time and energy and and money

1530
01:03:33,449 --> 01:03:38,559
into the development of unique cultivars

1531
01:03:35,769 --> 01:03:40,000
where chemo types or even just potential

1532
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:43,090
breeding strategies like like we're

1533
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,730
doing there needs to be some sort of way

1534
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:47,320
to stop those bigger companies you know

1535
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:49,780
the the one that's always raised is

1536
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:53,200
Monsanto and soon to be called Monsanto

1537
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:54,640
bear Bayer Monsanto or whatever but you

1538
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:56,409
know two and a half billion dollars in

1539
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:58,719
research every single year is a

1540
01:03:56,409 --> 01:04:00,460
substantial amount and that's not

1541
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:03,379
something that we can compete with so

1542
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:05,269
it's I think a lot

1543
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:08,059
the folks that are sort of out in front

1544
01:04:05,269 --> 01:04:09,650
on this are are preemptively

1545
01:04:08,059 --> 01:04:11,719
trying to protect the work that they're

1546
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:13,579
doing and there are others who are

1547
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:16,039
trying to make sure that all of the

1548
01:04:13,579 --> 01:04:19,969
previous work is is accounted for it's

1549
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:22,759
out in the public domain the interesting

1550
01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:24,439
interesting times to say the least but

1551
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:27,200
it's it's it's something that I think

1552
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:29,869
that a lot as Reggie Highline I think

1553
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:32,539
cultivators and breeders would be very

1554
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:35,359
wise to look into the potential for for

1555
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:37,460
doing stuff like that yeah and you know

1556
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:40,340
you know competing with their 2.6

1557
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:41,840
billion dollar R&amp;D budget is only the

1558
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:45,680
half of it right because their legal

1559
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:47,900
budget is insane as well and you know

1560
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:52,579
they may be able to develop the same

1561
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:54,530
things as smaller cultivators are are

1562
01:04:52,579 --> 01:04:58,309
working on with that kind of R&amp;D budget

1563
01:04:54,530 --> 01:05:00,500
but also trying to defend your you know

1564
01:04:58,309 --> 01:05:03,650
chemo virus or cultivars or techniques

1565
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:06,469
against somebody like Bayer Monsanto is

1566
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:07,789
that that's its own problem that doesn't

1567
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:09,379
even take place in the field that

1568
01:05:07,789 --> 01:05:12,590
happens in the courtroom and in briefs

1569
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:14,869
and is just as ugly let's talk for a

1570
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:16,850
second about one of your most valuable

1571
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:20,900
strains I mean you've your whole line is

1572
01:05:16,849 --> 01:05:23,329
is is unique for their own reasons but

1573
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:24,769
but I know that you are excited as well

1574
01:05:23,329 --> 01:05:27,380
as a lot of patients I know are excited

1575
01:05:24,769 --> 01:05:29,030
about your CVG strain so what would want

1576
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:31,940
to talk a little bit about that and and

1577
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:37,070
your hopes of protecting that so that

1578
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:40,460
you can share it yeah it's first of all

1579
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:45,769
CBD is phenomenal it's incredible in in

1580
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:49,340
terms of its pain relief muscle spasms

1581
01:05:45,769 --> 01:05:52,190
spasticity as a topical it's great for

1582
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:54,170
eczema and psoriasis it's it's one of

1583
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:56,929
those compounds that you know once

1584
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:59,150
you've tried it it it's it's kind of

1585
01:05:56,929 --> 01:06:01,309
mind-bending - to say the least that

1586
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:03,110
it's uh it's just been tucked away for

1587
01:06:01,309 --> 01:06:06,019
so long inside of the cannabis genome

1588
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:07,910
and it's now just just popping up so

1589
01:06:06,019 --> 01:06:10,070
we're really excited to be able to to

1590
01:06:07,909 --> 01:06:14,719
bring that to to the table for farmers

1591
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:16,539
in 2019 the at this point it's not just

1592
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:18,329
one variety I think we're at

1593
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:20,349
there's between seven and nine

1594
01:06:18,329 --> 01:06:22,269
individual lines that we're working on

1595
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:24,699
that have very different approaches and

1596
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:26,860
different practical applications whether

1597
01:06:24,699 --> 01:06:29,710
it's for the production of field

1598
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:34,030
production with harvests using combines

1599
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:35,800
or terpene rich varieties that will be

1600
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:38,410
hand harvested in the same way that a

1601
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:41,620
lot of the the finest flowers are still

1602
01:06:38,409 --> 01:06:43,719
grown for THC production a number of

1603
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:45,549
different options different flavors and

1604
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:46,809
different characteristics we have some

1605
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:49,660
that are a hundred to one

1606
01:06:46,809 --> 01:06:51,610
CBG to THC we have other varieties that

1607
01:06:49,659 --> 01:06:52,179
we've now developed that are over 300 to

1608
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:54,460
1

1609
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:57,339
CBG to THC which means that you can do

1610
01:06:54,460 --> 01:07:00,760
an oil extraction basic rough oil

1611
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:03,550
extraction and still be below the point

1612
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,830
3 percent THC limitation at the federal

1613
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:07,269
level definitely some game-changing

1614
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:08,980
things that are that are coming out and

1615
01:07:07,269 --> 01:07:12,400
will be available to farmers for for

1616
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:14,349
2019 and you know CB G's since since

1617
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,289
people don't spend a lot of time using

1618
01:07:14,349 --> 01:07:19,420
it on its own it doesn't have as much of

1619
01:07:17,289 --> 01:07:23,139
a rep as other parts of the plant and

1620
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:24,820
and certainly when you come across CB g

1621
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:26,379
it's not going to be in a whole plant

1622
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:30,970
right most of the time it's it's because

1623
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:32,829
it's extracted out but but the proof was

1624
01:07:30,969 --> 01:07:37,539
in the pudding when we visited your farm

1625
01:07:32,829 --> 01:07:42,309
in and and we we tried a dab of your CB

1626
01:07:37,539 --> 01:07:45,130
g rich strain and and we left your

1627
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:47,230
sampling booth um you know I I thought I

1628
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:49,210
know at first I didn't think i fel

1629
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:50,530
anything and then I realized I was in a

1630
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:52,869
really good mood and kind of felt like I

1631
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:53,560
was walking on clouds but my associate I

1632
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:56,859
brought with me

1633
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:59,650
he's got lifelong pain and on that

1634
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:01,630
particular day his leg was all flared up

1635
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:03,910
and and he was uncomfortable in my car

1636
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:06,760
and it was a drag and we got back out to

1637
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:09,009
my car and we're driving away and he

1638
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,830
like nudges me he's like dude I don't

1639
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:13,780
hurt and my legs fine and I'm all like

1640
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:16,509
I'm like oh that's nice he's like no you

1641
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:18,699
don't understand and so that's when we

1642
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:21,009
first started talking about how you know

1643
01:08:18,699 --> 01:08:22,449
we talked about CBD being 20 to one all

1644
01:08:21,009 --> 01:08:25,329
the time and how nice it is to be able

1645
01:08:22,449 --> 01:08:27,278
to get cannabidiol into folks with with

1646
01:08:25,329 --> 01:08:29,409
you know a low amount just trace amounts

1647
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:32,230
of THC especially kids who don't want

1648
01:08:29,409 --> 01:08:34,449
be lethargic at school you know through

1649
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:38,559
their parents of course but but with the

1650
01:08:34,449 --> 01:08:40,869
CBG you know you know 100 to 1 CVG and

1651
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,539
that is an you know a powerful pain

1652
01:08:40,869 --> 01:08:48,729
reliever this opens up like a whole new

1653
01:08:43,539 --> 01:08:53,769
field of cannabis clinical medicine not

1654
01:08:48,729 --> 01:08:56,799
that they're gonna be giving them I mean

1655
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:58,600
to be perfectly blunt I think that

1656
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,100
America would be a better place I think

1657
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,980
every every place in the world would be

1658
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:06,100
better off if every adult had a CBG pen

1659
01:09:02,979 --> 01:09:09,669
a vape pen in their pocket like you

1660
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:12,340
described it's it's not psychoactive but

1661
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:15,190
it's also I describe it as being a

1662
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:17,110
profound experience in the sense that it

1663
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:20,109
provides a significant amount of mental

1664
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:22,179
clarity if you are anxious or if you've

1665
01:09:20,109 --> 01:09:24,460
had too much caffeine or you know you're

1666
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:28,869
just you're you're tense

1667
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:31,510
it is a non psychoactive relaxer I mean

1668
01:09:28,869 --> 01:09:32,859
it just it calms people down in addition

1669
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:35,680
to having all of those different pain

1670
01:09:32,859 --> 01:09:37,589
relieving properties it's I don't want

1671
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:40,600
to you know you don't never want to be

1672
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:42,670
making proclamations that are a little

1673
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,870
bit of a reach but I do think that for a

1674
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:45,699
lot of people who suffer from chronic

1675
01:09:43,869 --> 01:09:48,340
pain this is one of those amazing

1676
01:09:45,699 --> 01:09:51,250
substances that will help them not take

1677
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:52,930
opiates and the more the more

1678
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:54,939
cannabinoids that we have at our

1679
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:57,550
disposal to be able to deal with things

1680
01:09:54,939 --> 01:09:59,829
like opiates the better off we're all

1681
01:09:57,550 --> 01:10:02,289
going to be but we are really looking

1682
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:04,000
forward to seeing thousands of acres of

1683
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:05,890
this in production and in the coming

1684
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,630
years and so if you've got seed for

1685
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:10,329
these strains coming out next year I

1686
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:13,210
take it that you are following Reggie

1687
01:10:10,329 --> 01:10:18,250
gaudino strategy and defensively

1688
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:19,899
patenting it in advance yeah we are it

1689
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:22,779
the reason that we're not releasing it

1690
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:24,250
to farm Rizzo is the for the same reason

1691
01:10:22,779 --> 01:10:28,239
that the varieties that you saw in the

1692
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:30,369
field last year are the seed the test

1693
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:32,979
crop for what farmers are growing this

1694
01:10:30,369 --> 01:10:34,899
season we do field trials to make sure

1695
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:36,699
that we're doing accurate progeny

1696
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:39,189
testing so that we can make the best

1697
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:40,529
seed possible for farmers I don't know

1698
01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:42,559
of any other companies that do that

1699
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:44,779
outside of you know

1700
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,940
general agriculture and seed production

1701
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:49,009
for other crops we basically just tried

1702
01:10:46,939 --> 01:10:52,099
to Mir that you know we've we've taken

1703
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:54,710
our success and built a genomics lab

1704
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:56,510
we're doing in-house testing we do these

1705
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:58,189
these large-scale field trials to make

1706
01:10:56,510 --> 01:11:00,230
sure that the product that goes out is

1707
01:10:58,189 --> 01:11:02,419
going to perform exactly the way that we

1708
01:11:00,229 --> 01:11:05,089
say it is because we a know it really

1709
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:09,350
well and B are telling the truth based

1710
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:12,230
on on legitimate field applications of

1711
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:14,060
the product so that's that's the goal

1712
01:11:12,229 --> 01:11:16,129
this season this summer is we're growing

1713
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:18,470
out all of these different new creations

1714
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:19,819
and finding out which one's work and

1715
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:22,760
which ones don't

1716
01:11:19,819 --> 01:11:24,500
from a farming perspective right on yeah

1717
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:27,050
cuz a lot of these seeds there's a big

1718
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:30,399
difference between growing 25 plants in

1719
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:32,869
your yard versus the growing 25 acres

1720
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:35,389
agriculture is a whole different animal

1721
01:11:32,869 --> 01:11:37,670
and and to that point you know you need

1722
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:40,220
a lot of seeds to be able to grow that

1723
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:41,930
many plants and from what I saw when

1724
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:45,920
when you had your announcements of seed

1725
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:47,900
sales this year you had way more people

1726
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:50,480
interested than you had seeds people

1727
01:11:47,899 --> 01:11:52,279
were showing up to your seed sale days

1728
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:55,339
and essentially you know buying out your

1729
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:57,170
whole run on that day and then and then

1730
01:11:55,340 --> 01:12:00,860
you know I've been watching your posts

1731
01:11:57,170 --> 01:12:02,690
about your new your seed manufacturing

1732
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:05,119
structures so can you just give me a

1733
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:08,479
little bit idea of how much you've

1734
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:10,460
chosen to scale up and and if you think

1735
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:16,879
that you're going to meet demand this

1736
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:20,210
year I think we'll be able to meet well

1737
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,560
that's probably a stretch I think we're

1738
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:23,720
gonna be able to meet the demand for

1739
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:26,090
this season but the crazy part is is

1740
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:29,329
that people come out of the woodwork

1741
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:31,760
between now and May first and and large

1742
01:12:29,329 --> 01:12:34,659
orders are definitely happening we went

1743
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:37,460
from being able to produce you know

1744
01:12:34,659 --> 01:12:39,769
basically about 5 million seeds per year

1745
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:42,260
to being able to produce 50 million per

1746
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:45,680
year and this summer we're going to be

1747
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:47,989
scaling out we have 500 lights between

1748
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:51,170
our three main production facilities

1749
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:54,139
we're scaling that up to 2,000 lights so

1750
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:55,569
that we can produce every year we'll be

1751
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:58,000
able to produce about a hundred million

1752
01:12:55,569 --> 01:13:00,639
so we're doing everything that we can to

1753
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,859
make sure that this is a viable

1754
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:05,969
large-scale agricultural crop for as

1755
01:13:02,859 --> 01:13:08,799
many farmers as we can possibly get into

1756
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:10,989
into the farming it's weird too because

1757
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:13,210
right that that's just producing those

1758
01:13:10,988 --> 01:13:15,189
seeds is like running an entirely

1759
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:16,658
separate company I mean you're selling

1760
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:19,479
seeds you've got all these seeds in your

1761
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:20,559
R&amp;D fields your your your machine

1762
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:23,198
trimming it and sending it to

1763
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:25,869
Switzerland and oh yeah we've got these

1764
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:26,319
you know four or five locations with 200

1765
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:30,488
lights

1766
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:32,859
producing like this this epic volume of

1767
01:13:30,488 --> 01:13:35,049
seeds that it's in a nut self sounds

1768
01:13:32,859 --> 01:13:37,000
like a hassle you do it all indoors

1769
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:38,650
right so as you were complaining about

1770
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,469
your neighbor that pollinated the whole

1771
01:13:38,649 --> 01:13:44,769
valley you and instead are doing it in

1772
01:13:41,469 --> 01:13:47,529
very tightly controlled areas with you

1773
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:50,050
know vacuums that pull in inside and

1774
01:13:47,529 --> 01:13:52,719
everything right so that so that it's a

1775
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:57,190
it's a very sealed up manufacturing

1776
01:13:52,719 --> 01:14:00,399
process exactly exactly you know the

1777
01:13:57,189 --> 01:14:04,509
nice part about what we're doing is you

1778
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:06,789
know growing inside is the only way to

1779
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:08,349
really ensure that that you're going to

1780
01:14:06,789 --> 01:14:10,630
have a quality product that's not

1781
01:14:08,349 --> 01:14:13,119
contaminated and you know we've talked

1782
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:15,460
about this before but you know one one

1783
01:14:13,118 --> 01:14:17,380
male one legitimate male one pollen

1784
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:19,090
grain from a male plant would destroy a

1785
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:21,219
crop and we would have to to basically

1786
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:24,219
get rid of get rid of all of those seeds

1787
01:14:21,219 --> 01:14:29,078
and we do that quality is the of the

1788
01:14:24,219 --> 01:14:31,599
utmost concern for us if if a farmer

1789
01:14:29,078 --> 01:14:33,698
ends up with one plant in their entire

1790
01:14:31,599 --> 01:14:36,159
field that is sampled by the Department

1791
01:14:33,698 --> 01:14:39,309
of Agriculture that has if it's a type 2

1792
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:40,960
plant if it's a one to one that one

1793
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:44,860
plant would make them fail their

1794
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:48,099
compliance test so we we do everything

1795
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:51,848
in our power to make the production side

1796
01:14:48,099 --> 01:14:54,159
sealed clean and and and not not

1797
01:14:51,849 --> 01:14:55,869
worrying about pollen contamination we

1798
01:14:54,158 --> 01:14:57,219
also flower in the in the winter that's

1799
01:14:55,868 --> 01:14:58,448
when we're making all of our seeds so

1800
01:14:57,219 --> 01:15:00,609
that we can miss that the large

1801
01:14:58,448 --> 01:15:02,559
potential plumes of outdoor pollen just

1802
01:15:00,609 --> 01:15:05,109
in case it's going on during the regular

1803
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:07,059
harvest season but even after all of

1804
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:08,458
that we still grow out you know these

1805
01:15:07,059 --> 01:15:10,708
test batches

1806
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:12,958
do our PCR screen to make sure that

1807
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:15,179
there are no y chromosomes in our gene

1808
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:17,368
pool so when when farmers are getting

1809
01:15:15,179 --> 01:15:19,618
seed from us they can they can

1810
01:15:17,368 --> 01:15:21,868
reasonably assume that they're going to

1811
01:15:19,618 --> 01:15:23,069
perform as as we've claimed and we're

1812
01:15:21,868 --> 01:15:25,708
trying to back that up with it with

1813
01:15:23,069 --> 01:15:27,988
basically 21st 21st century science

1814
01:15:25,708 --> 01:15:30,149
being brought to bear on this ancient

1815
01:15:27,988 --> 01:15:33,868
awesome agricultural crop that we've all

1816
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:36,478
been growing for generations so what do

1817
01:15:33,868 --> 01:15:38,339
you what do you see as being you know

1818
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:40,829
looking forward to this summer what do

1819
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:42,328
you see as being some of the the

1820
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:44,639
interesting hot points like you know

1821
01:15:42,328 --> 01:15:47,368
last last summer you were super shocked

1822
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:49,469
in a good way because you you didn't get

1823
01:15:47,368 --> 01:15:53,368
pollinated with somebody else's seeds

1824
01:15:49,469 --> 01:15:55,939
and therefore instead of having CBD rich

1825
01:15:53,368 --> 01:15:58,768
flour for extraction you actually had

1826
01:15:55,939 --> 01:16:01,889
CBD flower that was sensimilla without

1827
01:15:58,769 --> 01:16:03,689
seeds and so it was much more valuable

1828
01:16:01,889 --> 01:16:06,239
than you had planned

1829
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:09,300
but it created a kink in your business

1830
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:11,279
model what do you see as being potential

1831
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:14,189
changes that could happen either for

1832
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:14,998
your business model for the industry in

1833
01:16:14,189 --> 01:16:20,550
general

1834
01:16:14,998 --> 01:16:23,609
this coming summer to be determined you

1835
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:25,380
really given up on forecasting it's just

1836
01:16:23,609 --> 01:16:27,538
it changes so dramatically and so

1837
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:30,239
radically every season I know that for

1838
01:16:27,538 --> 01:16:32,309
us and for our company we've gone

1839
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:35,118
through tremendous growth in the last in

1840
01:16:32,309 --> 01:16:37,969
the last year and we are trying to

1841
01:16:35,118 --> 01:16:40,828
devote ourselves fully to the process of

1842
01:16:37,969 --> 01:16:43,739
creating seed and doing good field

1843
01:16:40,828 --> 01:16:45,748
trials and I don't think that we're

1844
01:16:43,738 --> 01:16:48,178
going to be doing trim flower again this

1845
01:16:45,748 --> 01:16:50,908
season it was awesome one off last year

1846
01:16:48,179 --> 01:16:54,389
and it worked out but for us to be able

1847
01:16:50,908 --> 01:16:57,208
to focus on on the breeding and not just

1848
01:16:54,389 --> 01:16:59,309
CBG but but all the other minor

1849
01:16:57,208 --> 01:17:01,529
cannabinoids that that are basically

1850
01:16:59,309 --> 01:17:04,139
coming online is better testing is

1851
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:08,248
emerging that's that's really where our

1852
01:17:04,139 --> 01:17:11,340
focus is and being able to create

1853
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:13,469
varieties that will will succeed and

1854
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:15,208
thrive in other areas we're doing a lot

1855
01:17:13,469 --> 01:17:19,050
of custom breeding projects right now

1856
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:20,429
for say tropical areas different totally

1857
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:22,288
different environments that we're not

1858
01:17:20,429 --> 01:17:24,208
accustomed to and we don't have

1859
01:17:22,288 --> 01:17:26,728
we don't necessarily have access to in

1860
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:29,358
the summer for us to grow here so we've

1861
01:17:26,729 --> 01:17:32,628
had to build out climate-controlled

1862
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:35,309
environments to replicate those those

1863
01:17:32,628 --> 01:17:39,719
you know low very high levels of

1864
01:17:35,309 --> 01:17:43,109
humidity very warm you know basically

1865
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:44,908
try trying to do controlled experiments

1866
01:17:43,109 --> 01:17:47,909
to develop varieties that will work in

1867
01:17:44,908 --> 01:17:50,518
other other areas as well right on well

1868
01:17:47,908 --> 01:17:53,009
that's all really inspiring and and all
