10
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:35,189
we also have to start an extraordinary

11
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,200
YouTube channel with over 150 speaker

12
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:39,599
videos I've recorded and events just

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,750
like this one Eric's presentation from

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,689
today will be there next week and you

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,980
probably got 4 or 5 videos with Eric at

16
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,439
this point talking about different

17
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,500
aspects of greenhouses so make sure you

18
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,000
check that out at shaping fire calm and

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,619
there are postcards at the back near the

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,469
door while they last to help you

21
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:00,390
remember the name is shaping fire eric

22
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,210
Branstad has been producing canvas on

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,010
Northern California for decades he's a

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,450
nationally known greenhouse and like

25
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,490
death expert speaking nearly everywhere

26
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,829
now for almost 15 years

27
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:15,659
he's now he is now founder of greenhouse

28
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,060
advisory group helping commercial

29
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,099
cultivators choose placement build and

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,469
even rescue under producing greenhouses

31
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,669
he's also a lot of really good guy in a

32

thank you I feel my father right

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:40,650
although I did that I run the keynotes I

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,019
gotta have my phone in order to run that

37
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,440
presentation I'm not tucking my social

38
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:48,359
medias thank you for having me Thank You

39
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,450
Jango for that nice introduction it's

40
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,939
always good seeing you and a little bit

41
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,460
about me I my family started farming in

42
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,069
1862 in California not too far from

43
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:01,799
sacrum and so they weren't into cannabis

44
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,929
and when I was 18 years old I left to go

45
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,780
to Humboldt County and and kind of

46
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,509
follow my way in the cannabis I guess

47
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,340
you could say so I started learning a

48
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,619
lot of that right away a lot about

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,150
cannabis right away at that time for

50
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,250
light deprivation it was called black

51
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,520
boxing at the time people would take

52
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,530
cardboard boxes and individually black

53
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,330
box each plant in order to create this

54
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,090
photo period the old-timers in the

55
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,700
sixties late 60s gone into the 70s used

56
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,250
to black box all their small seedlings

57
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:33,929
in order to get them to sex and so

58
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,539
people have been black boxing for photo

59
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,019
period for one reason another since the

60
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:41,280
early 70s from a lot of my research I

61
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:44,400
really got into the greenhouse side of

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:49,650
things for light deprivation greenhouses

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,060
in 2006 and so basically we I was with

64
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,769
the company called forever flowering

65
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,239
greenhouses and pioneered the light

66
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:55,860
deprivation technique we didn't

67
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,650
necessarily invent it but we kind of

68
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,049
made it available to the public and also

69
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,870
spent a lot of time doing research and

70
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,969
development on how to best work these

71
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,129
things and so my presentation today is

72
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:10,199
is so much on the technological side of

73
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:12,299
how to grow in the greenhouses because

74
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,250
I've done that a lot and I'm basically

75
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:15,270
kind of gonna go over where we where we

76
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,310
were

77
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,650
out there where we've come how far we're

78
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,210
going those kind of things it's a little

79
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,569
bit of a history lesson to to kind of

80
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,969
see why things we did are emplacing and

81
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,979
today one of the reasons people went

82
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:30,689
into greenhouse is primarily because

83
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,819
prohibition was starting to lighten up

84
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:36,960
especially in California and so with our

85
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,489
quasi legal 215 greenhouses especially

86
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,159
up in Northern California were quite

87
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,379
popular you know mainly because of the

88
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,329
weather a lot of times the weather was

89
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:47,009
the main concern for needing a

90
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,630
greenhouse and it wasn't even used as a

91
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:51,000
greenhouse most people would put the

92
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,889
skin on took the skin off if a ray put

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,259
it on if it doesn't it's a nice day

94
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,479
leave it off type of thing it wasn't

95
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,979
until later on where we really started

96
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:00,929
refining these light deprivation

97
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,030
techniques and realizing that we can use

98
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,469
the greenhouse more year-round and it

99
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,240
really does make a lot of sense though

100
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:09,240
because greenhouses were invented for

101
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,010
wintertime most people in cannabis and

102
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,600
hemp are all in for the summer and so

103
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,789
it's kind of an opposite way of looking

104
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,379
at things sometimes when you have these

105
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:17,909
contraptions that weren't intended for

106
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:19,680
different seasons with these typical

107
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,780
grow you know these type of growers only

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,579
wanted to use them when they're not

109
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,699
necessarily intended for so of course

110
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:28,649
they have a lot of stumbling blocks and

111
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:30,000
I like to say hostility that comes along

112
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:32,669
with it just because a lot of people go

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,189
there you have to get too hot you know

114
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,810
and so the first thing did you know

115
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:38,339
people say they come from a poor

116
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,589
background us we need a cooling system

117
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,419
but you know we're not all in Pueblo

118
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:44,879
Colorado where it's really hot and

119
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:48,160
really dry or really dry even for that

120
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,978
regardless of the key California in the

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,449
West Coast is full of places that are

122
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:54,579
high humidity you know in the Emerald

123
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,620
triangle on a 90 degree day can have 40

124
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:58,930
percent relative humidity already and so

125
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,910
the traditional cooling systems and wet

126
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,310
walls the greenhouses don't always work

127
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:06,160
like they do in some of these drier

128
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,530
places and so back in the day we kind of

129
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,240
had to start out from this you know you

130
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:12,189
know grass root style I guess you could

131
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,168
say because we were also off the grid

132
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:15,879
even today in California there's a lot

133
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:18,098
of licensed farms that are off the grid

134
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:20,589
they don't have electricity and so they

135
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:22,509
still use these type of greenhouses

136
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:24,879
right here so the hoop house was really

137
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:26,800
the original or the first type of

138
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,139
greenhouse that was used for pulling

139
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,020
tarps to actually pull the tarp over to

140
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,490
create this photo period and so we

141
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:36,129
didn't really you know start out with

142
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,620
automated everything and also with

143
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:40,089
automated requires electricity so again

144
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,870
you had to really look at things from a

145
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:45,310
basic standpoint and so the food causes

146
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,780
you know these ones have some beds in

147
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,550
them but there were also containers

148
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:51,129
30-gallon grow bags were the most

149
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,930
popular container for the majority of

150
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:55,209
time I guess you would say you can grow

151
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,340
a pretty big plant in a 30 gallon grow

152
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:59,408
bag and we would move it in and move it

153
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:01,538
out the same day the 30 gallon grow bags

154
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:02,949
would be on a pallet so that we can move

155
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:04,329
a min and move now without actually

156
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:06,819
having to carry on we could call a

157
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:08,740
rental company and rent a tractor or a

158
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:10,360
bobcat for the day we didn't have to buy

159
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,180
a piece of equipment we just rent it

160
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,919
have it there pull the plants out move

161
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,629
the new plants in and most of the time

162
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:18,818
with the new planets we had four or five

163
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:21,129
foot tall trees ready to go inside so

164
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:23,860
they were able to be flowering the same

165
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:25,509
day as we moved out and that model

166
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,720
changed a little bit because of people

167
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:29,160
trying to recycle their soils

168
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,740
one thing everybody used to throw their

169
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,970
soil away gave new soil containers you

170
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,680
know this kind of thing when we get into

171
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,240
the beds people are saving their soil

172
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,949
they're not throwing the soil out every

173
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,750
time and so you know a lot of the

174
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:41,909
growing techniques have changed over the

175
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,220
times but one of the main reasons was

176
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:47,430
also the plant counts in California we

177
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,560
were subjugated to plant counts of some

178
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,930
counties and places before we win prop

179
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,750
60 for recreational we had some counties

180
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,970
that did to have some wannabe ordinances

181
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,069
that says okay you can grow 25 plants

182
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,620
you can grow 60 plants you can grow 12

183
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:02,909
plants in these various counties and so

184
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,399
of course you wanted to grow the biggest

185
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:07,530
plant possible and that's why they grew

186
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,969
in the 30 gallon Greg Maddox on a pallet

187
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,419
to be able to move it and move out right

188
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,480
away

189
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,009
now we have no limited unlimited plant

190
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,660
counts we're still within a square

191
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:18,060
footage but you can grow as many plants

192
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,800
as you want in that space and so it's a

193
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,120
lot more popular these days for people

194
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:27,120
to be growing in really small plants the

195
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,949
hoop houses like I said have different

196
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,990
forms over the course of time and one of

197
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:33,479
those was the start of the plywood in

198
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,579
walls and you can see a lot of today's

199
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,990
like Deb greenhouses have solid end

200
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,289
walls because they're keeping the light

201
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:42,090
out where the blackout system is because

202
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,530
on the end walls where there's fans and

203
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:44,879
doors it's really hard to automate a

204
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,529
curtain right there we have all these

205
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,750
different squares and openings and

206
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:50,819
things and so it was much easier just to

207
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,680
make the end wall solid but that came

208
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,319
with problems too along the way and so

209
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,579
the first hoop house that we did you

210
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,319
know we thought the plywood would be

211
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,969
great we use the light trap some of the

212
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,240
fans you can see in that picture of the

213
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:05,160
to square the two squares are the light

214
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,840
traps that would keep the light from

215
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,430
going

216
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,709
we're able to still use the exhaust

217
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,150
vents and intakes years before that we

218
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:12,979
didn't do anything we didn't have like

219
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:16,489
traps all the time so we have really had

220
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:18,319
to know when to pull our tarps and the

221
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,079
weather around that sometimes it wasn't

222
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,300
always as easy as it is now as far as

223
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,039
breathability and so nonetheless what

224
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,569
happened was is this greenhouse still

225
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,300
had a hot pocket from the roll-up

226
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:30,709
sidewalls up is a dead zone and so it

227
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,080
doesn't matter if you open the doors

228
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:35,538
turn on the fans when you turn on the

229
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,680
fans you actually don't get one air

230
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:38,538
exchange per minute because you've

231
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,189
broken the seal of negative pressure by

232
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:42,500
rolling up the side or opening the door

233
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,510
the fan pulls from the closest point of

234
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,070
no resistance so we saw right away a lot

235
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:48,080
of people running the hoop houses wrong

236
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,900
because they constantly have the sides

237
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,759
of that these big you know electricity

238
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:55,699
consuming fans running and they still

239
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:57,289
were struggling with the heat and so

240
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,660
basically what we did for this

241
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:02,269
greenhouse at the time because we didn't

242
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:05,120
really know exactly what to do was right

243
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:07,039
up here in this zone we cut it out with

244
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,909
a sawzall maybe what we called a trap

245
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:13,219
flap and we by opening both ends up at

246
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:14,958
the top right there we didn't have air

247
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,089
traps so that it would heat up because

248
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,849
again greenhouses trap air the air

249
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,709
that's trapped heats up and that air has

250
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,570
to go somewhere and if the fans don't

251
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:26,389
get rid of it we have to avoid it

252
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:28,339
naturally and so by not trapping air it

253
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:29,778
didn't heat up and so that was the

254
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:32,120
number one goal was to avoid the

255
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:34,250
greenhouse effect in the summertime and

256
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,440
so we did that with the plywood in walls

257
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:40,820
and then it went a little further

258
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:43,220
the next 2.0 wasn't this one actually

259
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,680
that's a nice little picture was this

260
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,200
one the doors go from the ground all the

261
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,879
way to the ceiling and so by having the

262
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,410
doors go from the ground to the ceiling

263
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,659
we now have the door and we have the

264
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:55,819
vent at the same time and so a lot of

265
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,139
people with the hoop houses go with the

266
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,030
path

267
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:00,370
and ventilation because of being off the

268
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:01,750
grid or limited amount of power or if

269
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,490
you're in California you don't just get

270
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,700
power all the time anymore they shut it

271
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,919
off so basically having the sides rolled

272
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,629
up and having both ends open from the

273
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:12,490
top to the bottom took away the

274
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:14,950
greenhouse effect we avoided the solar

275
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:17,230
gain which was the important part of the

276
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,700
greenhouse growing in the summertime we

277
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,139
didn't need it to be a greenhouse we

278
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,050
didn't walk outside on a hundred degree

279
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:25,029
day going we needed to be 130 that just

280
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:26,949
isn't the case so avoiding the solar

281
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:28,899
gain in the greenhouse was crucial and

282
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,509
then the next step was having the

283
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:33,039
greenhouse cover do the work for us as

284
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:34,720
we get through the hoop houses we'll see

285
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,279
some cool in here some artwork people

286
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,399
start adding some artwork to their

287
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:44,079
greenhouses anybody guess what strain

288
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:45,279
that was reflecting purple punch right

289
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,040
you can see the cookie over there

290
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,839
knocked out the banana over there but

291
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:56,339
for more punch didn't end up being as

292
00:10:49,840 --> 00:11:00,310
punchy as we hoped this is California

293
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:02,860
this is a 40-acre hoop house farm so I

294
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:04,989
mean people do scale up with hoops a lot

295
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,649
of people go all hoops or firm little

296
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:10,659
you know basic cottage or whatever there

297
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:11,980
are these are considered berry hoops but

298
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:14,199
they're already existing in Santa

299
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,789
Barbara County you can see stuff to see

300
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,740
they're full of cannabis and so that's

301
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:20,949
40 acres of cannabis growing in hoop

302
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,649
houses and so there is some scalability

303
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:27,400
to it but again it does require a lot

304
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:29,649
more labor when we talk about the light

305
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,899
depth technique a lot of people familiar

306
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,459
with it nowadays from the more automated

307
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,049
systems but back in the day when we

308
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,750
first started pulling tarps it was with

309
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:40,000
ropes and standing on ladders and doing

310
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,860
some crazy stuff and so really what

311
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,960
would they would do is that have a piece

312
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,360
of a plastic laying on the side of the

313
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,769
greenhouse with some ropes attached to

314
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,539
that piece of plastic and then some

315
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:51,639
tennis balls at the end of the rope and

316
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:53,319
so that what they do is stand on one

317
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,509
side of the greenhouse throw the tennis

318
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,190
balls over the greenhouse and then go to

319
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:59,230
the other side and grab the ropes to

320
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:03,610
pull them over and so this is

321
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:10,210
what that would look like it's good

322
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:12,750
talking this is also what it looks like

323
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,750
in the fails

324
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,430
yeah so that facility has 10 of those

325
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:33,649
greenhouses and you can imagine the

326
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:35,870
labor involved in 10 greenhouses on a

327
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:38,029
licensed facility you know kind of doing

328
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,710
this and so you know over the course of

329
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:41,600
time we see a lot of people have to cut

330
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,100
corners or chew the fat in some cases

331
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,080
and so there's a lot of different ways

332
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,820
to chew the fat and this wouldn't be one

333
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,980
of them I see that a lot I went to a

334
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,690
greenhouse facility recently new

335
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,460
construction and a way to save a couple

336
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,320
bucks since they didn't get the the

337
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,570
light depth system you know and so in a

338
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,070
lot of ways you can get by for a minute

339
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,990
but if you're trying to create flowers

340
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,879
throughout the summer you need the

341
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,460
curtain system and so saving some money

342
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:05,990
right there isn't really making any

343
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,340
sense because you're not actually going

344
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,409
to be able to get to your goal at the

345
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,269
end of the day so there's that's got a

346
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:15,049
lack of planning over the course of time

347
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:17,990
but we do run into some things here and

348
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:19,939
there this is a simple hoop house that's

349
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,909
up in Humboldt County but it what it has

350
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,770
is a manual depth system on the inside

351
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:27,110
that was rigged up by a handy greenhouse

352
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:28,879
installer and so along the way we do

353
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,070
find resourceful things that actually

354
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,049
are kind of the same concept of what we

355
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,000
used to use but really bring them

356
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:37,250
bringing it in to the next level I guess

357
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,259
you could say and so having a manual

358
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,269
interior depth system is really

359
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:43,429
important because of weather a lot of

360
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,069
the manual depth systems are from the

361
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:48,469
outside and the outside comes with a lot

362
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,180
of exposure and problems as well a lot

363
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:53,810
of them aren't as easy to permit in some

364
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:55,879
counties as well and so in California at

365
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:58,099
least and I believe in some other states

366
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:59,539
in California we have greenhouse rules

367
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,450
and we have what's called hoop house

368
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:04,189
rules and so there's code and non code

369
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,800
and so in some

370
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:09,890
for instance you might be able to build

371
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,839
a 20 by 48 under a thousand square foot

372
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:13,490
greenhouse with no electricity and it

373
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,019
can be exempt you don't need a building

374
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,570
permit but it's legal to grow cannabis

375
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:19,159
in no electricity so you can't put fans

376
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,600
or lights or anything in it so it's

377
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:23,329
almost like an outdoor grow with a

378
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,250
little protection or a little ability to

379
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,259
do some light death or whatever and so a

380
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,389
lot of people look for those you know

381
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:32,539
ways around things some people will put

382
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:34,279
14 10 to 14 and you know under a

383
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,599
thousand square foot hoop houses all

384
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,389
over their property to get to their

385
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,460
10,000 square foot license which seems

386
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:43,610
kind of crazy and a lot of work but you

387
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,930
know it is but at the same time you know

388
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,330
especially in the Emerald triangle

389
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:48,889
that's all there was to offer the next

390
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,520
step that we got into where the Gothic

391
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,350
frames

392
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,970
I actually was lucky enough to sell one

393
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,550
of the first green houses in Pueblo

394
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,470
Colorado which was one of these gothics

395
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:59,479
before it really turned into Pueblo back

396
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:03,529
in the day we had sold one of these

397
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,000
greenhouses to a dispensary and so we

398
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,079
were kind of the first Bond scene for a

399
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,960
lot of things in a lot of different

400
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,330
places but Pueblo has really turned into

401
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,129
you know the mega structures now versus

402
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,860
a lot of these things but again it was

403
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:17,600
many years ago here's just another side

404
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,950
view of the gothic frame the gothic

405
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,350
frame is a little bit like I'd like to

406
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,660
call midtech compared to the lower tech

407
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,970
of the hoop house they can be more

408
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:27,740
engineered to be permitted and they can

409
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,810
also have the interior automated light

410
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,000
def system they also can be engineered

411
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:33,679
to handle more snow and wind than hoop

412
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,049
houses that's why there's also hoop

413
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,519
house rules one of the guidelines for

414
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:39,949
the hoop house rules is that you take

415
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,319
the skin off in the wintertime so if

416
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,140
you're in Trinity County or even humble

417
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,879
for that matter they recommend or

418
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:48,309
to rule even that you take the skin off

419
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,439
so that if it snows there's no chance of

420
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:52,419
it collapsing or anything like that but

421
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,550
if you want to go to grow year-round and

422
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,259
and not take the skin off then you jump

423
00:15:54,549 --> 00:16:00,120
to the next graph at a greenhouse which

424
00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:02,439
would be possibly the Gothic shape frame

425
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,750
here's some gut here's a gothic frame

426
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,519
that's 144 feet long so the single

427
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,899
structures got to be really popular then

428
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:09,669
there's also the gutter connected

429
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:12,759
structures the gutter connected gothic

430
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:16,389
frames also are kind of the midtech of

431
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,950
together connectible greenhouses they

432
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:20,860
typically come in a four and A six foot

433
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:23,170
on center and they can't go everywhere

434
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,970
they also make good places to give

435
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:26,979
education we did a lot of green house a

436
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,350
lot of classes inside these greenhouses

437
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,909
because we didn't grow in one of them it

438
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,889
was a demo greenhouse and so it actually

439
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:35,469
provided us a great classroom if we did

440
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:38,049
it in the spring and the fall because it

441
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,209
would get too hot or too cold to cram

442
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:41,979
everybody in there this was the first

443
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,419
like that green house that we ever did

444
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,970
we actually did this with a company

445
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,649
called Agrotech Agrotech worked with

446
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,509
those many years ago and no other green

447
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:50,769
house companies would and that's

448
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,778
something that we've really come a long

449
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:54,220
way with as far as you know it took an

450
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:57,220
eagle is a ssin for green house

451
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,620
companies to even recognize us I guess

452
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,899
you could say and so you know many years

453
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,119
ago there was only a select few green

454
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:06,338
house companies that would even mess

455
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,289
with the suppliers of cannabis companies

456
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:10,208
and we couldn't really get the things

457
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:11,798
that we needed or learn some of the

458
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,169
things that we wanted to learn because

459
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:15,970
there was just so much differences

460
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:17,799
between you know cannabis and non

461
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:21,610
cannabis related businesses and things

462
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:23,509
and so once we did get this like that

463
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:26,448
system installed and done

464
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:28,309
it kind of became the fuse for all the

465
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:32,930
other greenhouse companies to copy and

466
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:34,250
to use and to basically mimic I guess

467
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,019
you could say we were the first company

468
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,119
to use a triple-layer breathable

469
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:41,480
blackout material most companies reason

470
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:44,179
single air for whatever other crops they

471
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,430
use for light deprivation other crops

472
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,269
might be poinsettias most commonly

473
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,330
people know of

474
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:53,210
also the Forestry Service uses them to

475
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:54,919
put pine trees into dormancy to make

476
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,840
seed so there's a lot of different

477
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,640
reasons but they all use one layer now

478
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:00,139
we're finding that two layers is okay

479
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,880
because we're using light meters to

480
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,140
quantify how much light there is we're

481
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,580
not going it over oh I see a light leak

482
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,950
you know like we're actually able to use

483
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:12,289
things and go okay yeah there's no light

484
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,059
here it's safe and so by doing that

485
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:16,490
we've actually saved a couple bucks and

486
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:19,069
so from the suppliers that they told me

487
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:21,470
is that most of Canada is 100% double

488
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:23,809
air and America's 50-50 on the double to

489
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:26,329
triple there but again it does save a

490
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:28,369
couple bucks here's what it looks like

491
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:29,629
with an exterior deprivation system on

492
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:31,489
the outside of the greenhouse it's

493
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,530
closing a little bit but you can see

494
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,799
that it does cast quite a bit of a

495
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:40,369
shadow and so interior systems are

496
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,559
really better to work with a long run

497
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,419
but at the end of the day you know the

498
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,019
cost is what really drove people to go

499
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,970
into some of the exterior ones but again

500
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:52,129
once the false apart-er becomes non code

501
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,170
when compliance comes in there's no

502
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,030
savings there either and so this is

503
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,590
considered a rack and pinion system it's

504
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:59,299
pretty standard in all the greenhouses

505
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:01,369
with all the companies and it's not that

506
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:02,809
we even invented the rack and pinion

507
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:05,449
system the green house companies already

508
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:08,569
utilized these and we just added our you

509
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,660
know specific curtains and special

510
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:11,339
flashings and

511
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,120
corners and seals and things that they

512
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:17,939
didn't originally have before

513
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:20,519
and so this is what some cannabis

514
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,380
growing inside of a gothic looks like in

515
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,879
California this is actually the second

516
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,270
and third place winner of the Emerald

517
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,910
cup right here it's I forget the name of

518
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:33,059
the farm he goes by grandpa everybody

519
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:37,200
calls him grandpa and his string is

520
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:38,879
called this is the [ __ ] it's got an

521
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,980
abbreviation but I don't really use the

522
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,540
abbreviation because it's offensive

523
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:48,029
sometimes people never glass there's a

524
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:50,789
lot of fans in there it's it's it's a

525
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:52,950
great greenhouse for grandpa for sure

526
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,389
let me get into the a-frame greenhouses

527
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,130
there's quite a few different green

528
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,880
a-frames but nevertheless most

529
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:01,970
greenhouse manufacturers use have a hoop

530
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,300
house have a Gothic and have an a-frame

531
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,450
choice

532
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:09,389
and so here's inside with the rolling

533
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,279
benches those ones were next-gen this

534
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,380
one's another Agrotech greenhouse this

535
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,149
one's actually I like this one a lot

536
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,430
it's impressive to me because it's not

537
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:20,490
using exhaust fans and intakes it's a

538
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,720
passively ventilated a-frame a lot of

539
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,460
people kind of on the fence between

540
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,049
mechanical ventilation passive

541
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,940
ventilation which is better negative

542
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:29,309
pressure positive pressure we can go

543
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,170
over all that stuff later but using a

544
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:33,480
passively ventilated large-scale

545
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,820
greenhouse like this I think it's pretty

546
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,279
cool with the ridge vent sides roll up

547
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:41,490
the ends roll up and it's only using

548
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:44,519
circulation fans on the inside and so I

549
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:47,640
really dig that greenhouse a lot this

550
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:48,900
greenhouse is a agro tech it doesn't

551
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,360
have any fans yet it's still under

552
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,830
construction but these a-frames are

553
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,619
configured in so many different ways

554
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:57,599
that it really makes it kind of user

555
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:59,250
friendly in the sense that you can you

556
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,079
know pretty much get what you want into

557
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,970
one magnet facility here's another

558
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,859
greenhouse the difference with this one

559
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,860
compared to

560
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:07,969
a frame is positive-pressure you

561
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:09,979
wouldn't be able to see that from the

562
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,440
outside but the noteworthy part of this

563
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,150
picture is the airlock right there you

564
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,009
drive into that chamber with a piece of

565
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,860
equipment or a forklift and it actually

566
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:20,298
is an airlock before you enter the rest

567
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:22,939
of the greenhouse and so it's really

568
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:23,629
great for contamination purposes and

569
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,370
things like that

570
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,559
other industries have bigger problems

571
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:29,569
than we do and so they go to great

572
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:31,490
measures even though we can go to those

573
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:32,990
it's maybe I don't know we can talk

574
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:37,789
about whether it's necessary all the

575
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:40,579
time or not but nevertheless there are

576
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:42,470
all kinds of like I said extraordinary

577
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:44,329
measures you can go to probably try to

578
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,950
prevent bugs and pathogens about those

579
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:47,689
things like that here's what it looks

580
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,850
like inside that same greenhouse with

581
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,340
those big ducting tubes going across the

582
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:53,899
top so for those of you that aren't

583
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:55,609
familiar with negative and positive

584
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,040
pressure and negative pressures with the

585
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:59,750
exhaust fans at one end in Texas the

586
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:01,279
other the air gets pulled through the

587
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,410
greenhouse and out the other side that's

588
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,789
a negative pressure this is positive

589
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,160
pressure so they're turning the fans

590
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:09,069
around and blowing the air in and so it

591
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,240
can be fresh air it can recycle the air

592
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:12,918
one thing to know about positive

593
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,808
pressure greenhouses is that not all

594
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,390
companies doing the same do them the

595
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:18,859
same and so it's always good to work

596
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,840
with a reputable company that really

597
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:23,928
knows what they're doing when you're

598
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,939
doing positive pressure anyway oh here's

599
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:27,919
a negative pressure greenhouse but it's

600
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,240
also got a corridor down the center a

601
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,429
little different than the

602
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,839
the beginning of the a-frames but again

603
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:35,090
there's a lot of ways to do these

604
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:39,398
greenhouses with these corridors head

605
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:39,398
houses and so on

606
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:47,470
here's another a-frame little more

607
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:47,469
outfitted

608
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,839
just didn't in flowering it's go time

609
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:06,939
this is another a-frame actually it's a

610
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:09,219
Gothic but it looks like an a-frame

611
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,410
because on the inside it's just huge and

612
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,269
vast but there's a lot of existing

613
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,009
greenhouses in the Salinas Valley so

614
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:17,589
unlike public Colorado where it's all

615
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:20,019
new construction California had a lot of

616
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:21,519
existing greenhouses and so all those

617
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:23,230
existing greenhouses needed to

618
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,660
tremendous amount of work and so between

619
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:27,190
Santa Barbara County and Salinas Valley

620
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,250
and Monterey County

621
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:32,590
there's just a lot of Barry hoops

622
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:34,150
existing a-frames Gotham frames big

623
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:35,740
gutter connected structures and things

624
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:38,490
like that so they were for other

625
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,900
industries like cut flowers and

626
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:44,349
vegetable starts and things like that so

627
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:46,150
they do come with you know this degree

628
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:48,159
of retrofit that is needed and a lot of

629
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,660
people don't know what the metric is for

630
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,009
where do we begin they know where to

631
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,110
begin but they don't know where to stop

632
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:55,629
a lot of times we don't know necessarily

633
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:57,609
what it takes or people have this other

634
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,559
idea that if we go this far we'll grow

635
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:01,298
the best cannabis and a lot of times we

636
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,160
go so farther we spend so much money

637
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:04,960
that is really hard to crawl out of

638
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,808
these holes and so I always look at the

639
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,669
retrofits as a you know a great way to

640
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:11,168
get into something but at the same time

641
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:13,690
if you're not practical and have good

642
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:15,520
planning of what you need to retrofit at

643
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,980
what specific time in order to get some

644
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,990
crops going and get a return it can

645
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,900
actually be a huge money drain even

646
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:24,970
though it looks like a great you know

647
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,860
investment at the beginning setting up

648
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,650
new greenhouses can be pretty expensive

649
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:31,539
but also like I said these retrofits can

650
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,460
go pretty haywire - I've seen people

651
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:35,379
where they move in lose their ass

652
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,940
another person moves in they lose their

653
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,919
ass and the third person moves in and

654
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,630
it's like oh we're kind of set a lot of

655
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:42,880
these greenhouses are leased - so the

656
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,360
landowner is really the one that's

657
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,160
coming out

658
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,539
here's some glass structures a lot of

659
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,370
people think that the glass structures

660
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:52,349
might be the Leapfrog to greatness but

661
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:54,209
it's not necessarily true in my opinion

662
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:56,490
there's a lot of debate out there

663
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:59,730
between glass and polycarbonates with

664
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,380
the clear and the diffused I really have

665
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:03,890
been around cannabis my whole life like

666
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:07,800
I was saying earlier since I was 18 and

667
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:09,780
you know I just see a lot more than THC

668
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,460
and just CBD and so you know the

669
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:13,019
cannabinoids the the amount of

670
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,970
cannabinoids there are as well as

671
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:16,920
terpenes you're really important to make

672
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:19,500
a full spectrum or a you know a complete

673
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,420
medicine in my opinion and so a lot of

674
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,299
times we can get down the road of

675
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:26,700
chasing THC or even chasing CBD and the

676
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:29,309
new thing is CPG it seems like and so a

677
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,410
lot of people will say we only get these

678
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:33,690
characteristics as we grow certain ways

679
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:36,000
and I don't think we're ready to lump

680
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,470
everybody into that that category and

681
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,329
there's just not enough research out

682
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:41,370
there the research that I've been doing

683
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:43,799
with labs has been showing a lot of

684
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:46,559
times that over exposure causes plants

685
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:48,930
to overheat sweat and actually lose some

686
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,299
of that production whereas a supported

687
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:53,220
plant actually living to its fullest

688
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,289
potential can give us more benefits and

689
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,660
so like I said a lot of people will like

690
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:59,460
the controlled environment I'm looking

691
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,310
for a more supportive environment the

692
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,960
control where it really gets kind of

693
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:05,339
well you know used a little bit crazy in

694
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,710
this idea that we're going to control

695
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:09,419
things to the degree of you know the

696
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,910
planet makes no choices on its own

697
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,850
anymore but a lot of times the plant is

698
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:17,490
what dictates everything and it's not

699
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:19,589
necessarily us one of the tests that I

700
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:22,799
did with a lab was doing some og cush

701
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:25,589
that typically is a high THC we did it

702
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,908
outside so it was of course high THC but

703
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:29,368
under the greenhouse

704
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:32,460
we were experimenting with especially

705
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:35,069
the diffuse we had 7% CBD in an OG Kush

706
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,739
so it was pretty ironic to see you know

707
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:39,928
the full Sun not developed some of the

708
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:42,389
same characteristics that the more

709
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:43,710
supported plant was in the greenhouse

710
00:26:42,388 --> 00:26:45,598
you know the heels are a little

711
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,358
different too that can go back and forth

712
00:26:45,598 --> 00:26:50,339
but again you know blast a lot of times

713
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:52,918
was really great for some of the Dutch

714
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:54,478
cut flower and things like that but

715
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,099
their plants act a lot different than

716
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:58,710
cannabis a lot of times they'll say a

717
00:26:56,098 --> 00:27:00,450
plant is a plant you know a plant is a

718
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,129
plant you know they keep saying those

719
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,409
kind of things but it's not necessarily

720
00:27:02,128 --> 00:27:06,089
true a lot of the other plants don't

721
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:08,340
have all these terpenes and cannabinoids

722
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:10,199
that we're trying to procure in the

723
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:10,829
first place and maybe extract and save

724
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,629
for later

725
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:14,368
you know if you can take cannabis and

726
00:27:12,628 --> 00:27:16,618
dry it out too much and lose the smell

727
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:19,199
you can't bring it back a lot of times

728
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:21,089
once it turns the hey it's hey so we can

729
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,950
do that in the growing process - it

730
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:25,108
doesn't take just the drying process to

731
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,879
screw things up and so it's kind of a

732
00:27:25,108 --> 00:27:29,069
hand-in-hand process and so over the

733
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:31,019
course of time you know we learned also

734
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:32,908
that you know this was a big deal in

735
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:34,470
California and actually a lot of places

736
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:36,659
I see there I've read the headlines and

737
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:38,489
see the recalls and different states and

738
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:41,070
places like that and so cannabis doesn't

739
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:43,229
let you slide because it's a dynamic and

740
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:44,999
bio accumulator it's going to clean up

741
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:46,409
the soil and the air around it and any

742
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:48,899
of the little sneaky things that people

743
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:51,179
try to pull into maybe save the day and

744
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:53,038
you know because cannabis is heavily

745
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,440
tested and regulated we can see all

746
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,058
these things have not so much you know

747
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,859
people are starting to do their due

748
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:01,229
diligence on the smoke little flower for

749
00:27:58,858 --> 00:28:03,449
him to see if they have heavy metals and

750
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:05,159
certain contaminants but I mean I don't

751
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,409
see a lot of tests out there on the

752
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:10,379
smokeable flower and it makes me nervous

753
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:12,179
just because like I said we had a tough

754
00:28:10,378 --> 00:28:14,488
time in California keeping it clean and

755
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:17,038
it isn't just the farming practices the

756
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:18,730
drift is real I mean at the end of the

757
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,230
day when you go to some of these valley

758
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,720
in Salinas and Monterey counties

759
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:24,430
surrounded by strawberries grapes you

760
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,380
know lettuces and things that are being

761
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:29,860
sprayed it's not uncommon to pop for

762
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:31,420
some of these some of these things up

763
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:32,740
north a lot of people were popping for

764
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,910
lead elephant you know it's like the

765
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,490
elephant in the room where do the heavy

766
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,779
metals come from you know it's tough I

767
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,759
mean a lot of minerals and

768
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:43,990
micronutrients can have heavy metals in

769
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:46,480
them the you know chicken chicken betty

770
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:49,420
has arsenic in it and so organic chicken

771
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,610
manure compost garden hoses that have

772
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,289
you know made from different countries

773
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:55,089
if they're not real rubber hoses they

774
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:56,710
actually have little warning signs and

775
00:28:55,089 --> 00:28:59,139
so they don't drink out of the hose and

776
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:01,620
so that is the stuff that you know

777
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:03,490
really contributes a lot to this

778
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:06,549
contamination level that were running

779
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:08,319
into the plant material passes a lot

780
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:10,180
I see plant material pass all the time

781
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,189
take that to concentration and that's

782
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:14,529
where we find all the goodies

783
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,720
luckily for most people remediation does

784
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:18,399
exist but you know now we're relying on

785
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,500
our extractors to make sure that they do

786
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,880
the right job and give us the return

787
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,019
that we need and they'll go out we've

788
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,520
lost a lot of that one they like really

789
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:29,680
hostile environments really this is what

790
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,109
creates you know the slide before having

791
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,210
these problems gets us to may be either

792
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:37,629
a learn how to farm better or B pull out

793
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:42,069
the you know pull out the tricks to try

794
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:44,410
to stop this stuff pests are really you

795
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:46,089
know a big problem cross-contamination

796
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:48,160
is easy to do a lot of these big

797
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:50,589
facilities I see a lot of people walking

798
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,890
by with trays and clowns right past the

799
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:55,480
harvesting you know trays or carts going

800
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,120
by the harvested material and things

801
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,420
like that mold is a big one everywhere a

802
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:03,239
lot of times multi you know just in some

803
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,190
of these other states that we're dealing

804
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,079
I know people in Oklahoma more super

805
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:10,140
feel fearful of mold on their outdoor

806
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:12,869
crops we dealt with that powdery mildew

807
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:15,059
is usually you know a big one for a lot

808
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:17,549
of people and a lot of times it can be

809
00:30:15,058 --> 00:30:19,710
corrected even in the growing medium

810
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:21,539
most people I spent 10 years chasing

811
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:23,100
environments around I forgot it down

812
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:24,240
below there's an environment - if you

813
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:25,740
don't get out and right

814
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,829
you're not going to correct any of this

815
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,720
stuff it's kind of hand in hand and so

816
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:33,299
that's what greenhouse planning is super

817
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,039
important I've been dealing with that

818
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,509
for a long time just in the idea that

819
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,579
it's cannabis and we're using them in

820
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:41,039
the summertime and not all these places

821
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:43,139
work well for some of the systems that

822
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,558
are there that are allowed or available

823
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:49,140
I'm not a lot of a label when you get

824
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,700
into the ventilation systems a lot of

825
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,380
people looking for cooling but a lot of

826
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,519
times I'm just trying to avoid the solar

827
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:58,080
game you know you can't use these wet

828
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:59,549
long cooling systems but again they

829
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,740
don't work everywhere they were greatly

830
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:03,480
Pueblo they work great where it's really

831
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,460
hot and dry there's places in Southern

832
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,990
California they work really good I was

833
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,808
at the greenhouse one time and Death

834
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,579
Valley of all places and it was 114

835
00:31:09,808 --> 00:31:13,799
degrees outside but they have the

836
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:15,869
greenhouse at 85 degrees inside really

837
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,789
great they struggled when it rained

838
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:19,709
outside in the monsoon season this came

839
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:21,119
and so that's why I always like you know

840
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,860
think about it there say you know the

841
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:25,799
greenhouses you're only as controllable

842
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:27,389
as the weather outside sometimes you

843
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:28,470
know the variables and changes in the

844
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,910
weather are going to change the

845
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,190
greenhouse environment and how it

846
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,960
actually operates and how it works it's

847
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,580
really you know hard to hear people say

848
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,410
I'm gonna get a hybrid greenhouse and

849
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:40,139
really it's almost like an indoor grow

850
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,550
room with some free Sun that also can be

851
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,900
kind of expensive I've had to tell

852
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:45,990
people they're better off just growing

853
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:48,900
indoors and rather than trying the

854
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:50,400
higher greenhouse thing transpiration is

855
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,890
the number one reason that we have

856
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,269
condensation in greenhouses and so a lot

857
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:56,130
of times when people talk to me about

858
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:57,269
humidity in their greenhouses they want

859
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:00,030
me to go up to them and say I'll just

860
00:31:57,269 --> 00:32:02,190
plug this in you know that'll take care

861
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:04,539
of all your problems you know I can ship

862
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,190
it to you tomorrow and really what it is

863
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:08,740
getting people to understand their

864
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,809
plants a little bit but better you know

865
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,370
sometimes we have not a complete

866
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:13,599
understanding of farming and what we're

867
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:16,000
doing when we're getting into these

868
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,559
greenhouses into the summertime create

869
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,150
these hostile environments and then we

870
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:21,339
have plants that are just like us

871
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,830
they sweat worst part is called

872
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:26,819
perspiration right plants are called

873
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:29,470
transpiration and so on a plant sweats

874
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,849
it gives off moisture just like we do

875
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,860
even though it doesn't drip down its

876
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:34,480
forehead it sticks to the roof of the

877
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:37,059
greenhouse and wants to drip back down

878
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,069
and so a lot of times condensation is a

879
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:41,710
result of plant sweat first and foremost

880
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:43,599
and how do we deal with that well my

881
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,309
people would say default to a cooling

882
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,839
system to get up and saying this whole

883
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:49,149
time the cooling systems don't always

884
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:51,639
work and so one of the ways to deal with

885
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:54,460
it a is avoid solar gain we don't need

886
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,320
the greenhouse effect and B is using

887
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,779
diffusion whether it's in a climate

888
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:00,669
screen also known as the shade cloth or

889
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:02,289
through the greenhouse covers the

890
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,250
greenhouse covers can actually do

891
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:05,889
amazing things

892
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,630
you know diffusion you know also the

893
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,920
greenhouse manufacturers nothing the

894
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:11,500
manufacturers themselves the people to

895
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,570
make these covers the glass and the fuse

896
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,329
people kind of go head-to-head the glass

897
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:18,490
people will say you know 1% light is 1%

898
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:20,289
growth the diffusions people say well

899
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,870
I'm split like splitting light particles

900
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:24,430
in half and we're gathering more

901
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:27,879
particles even on a cloudy day than I

902
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:29,560
would if I was directly outside and so I

903
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,420
find that to be true a lot of times

904
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:33,399
because through the testing that we've

905
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,440
done on the cannabis from inside outside

906
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,480
we can see some of these delicate

907
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,759
properties or you know these terpenes

908
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,349
and these cannabinoids show up and they

909
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,670
normally would get zapped and burned

910
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:46,279
away the Sun can be real

911
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:48,019
intense a lot of times the colors that

912
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:50,269
we use in the greenhouse also can affect

913
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:51,559
how the greenhouse is growing and so

914
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:53,389
this part of the video isn't is

915
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:54,829
important but when you get over here and

916
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:57,590
some of my favorite tools of the

917
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:59,089
greenhouse to tell you a lot 103 degrees

918
00:33:57,589 --> 00:34:01,399
I move it over three inches and it's

919
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:02,959
down to 86 degrees that was just the

920
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,180
colors that I use in the greenhouse it's

921
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,549
really why we see a lot of tan grow bags

922
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,230
and white ground cover people were

923
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:10,849
historically using black ground cover

924
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,369
because that's what the stores sold

925
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:14,929
black plastic pots because that's what

926
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:16,969
they had even the smart pots were all

927
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:18,559
black for a long time eventually we

928
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:20,928
started seeing these lighter colors and

929
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:23,659
these other options come around because

930
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:25,250
I really started pushing them and using

931
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:27,470
this thing all the time telling me all

932
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,059
these things and so when you see you

933
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:32,029
know your root system in a black

934
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:33,559
container up to 130 degrees even if the

935
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,600
air temperature isn't that high we

936
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,549
already running into a problem water

937
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,949
conservation in California was super

938
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:41,539
huge and so that was another reason that

939
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:43,069
we were trying to understand some of

940
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:47,239
these things in the water usage so you

941
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:49,159
can see full Sun under the diffused no

942
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,199
ground cover so it does drop the

943
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,148
temperatures you know it actually made

944
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,699
the temperatures drop even more by using

945
00:34:53,148 --> 00:34:57,889
the white ground cover the brown dirt

946
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:00,199
still absorbs or stores some energy and

947
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:02,359
heat compared to the to the white ground

948
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:04,789
cover and so am I supposed to do a Q&amp;A

949
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:07,490
towards the inner is this the end no no

950
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:09,230
if you end here in a couple minutes what

951
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:10,779
ten minutes we have 10 minutes for Q&amp;A

952
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:15,070
okay

953
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:18,430
and you can see more of this stuff on my

954
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:19,809
Instagram let's see oh it's on this

955
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:21,940
slide right here because we're gonna do

956
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:24,789
a QA and so if you go to my Instagram

957
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:26,590
account like DEP greenhouse you'll see a

958
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,029
lot more videos that I've posted over

959
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,880
the course of time on some of these

960
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:32,590
concepts because I have people in

961
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,200
Oklahoma that were really fearful of

962
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:36,910
heat and humidity I also have people in

963
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,129
other states that just want to do proof

964
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:40,539
of concept and so one of the things that

965
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:42,220
I tell people especially in the

966
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:44,050
greenhouse class that I teach in

967
00:35:42,219 --> 00:35:46,509
Oaksterdam University is proof of

968
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,950
concept can be pretty simple as far as

969
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,660
getting a hoop house standing on a

970
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:51,460
ladder and pulling tarps for two months

971
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:53,980
you can really learn a lot about the

972
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,599
plant the business how things are really

973
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,760
going to go the genetics that you're

974
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,009
gonna run in a small two month window

975
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,660
and pulling tarps yourself I mean you

976
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,340
can't beat it and in some cases

977
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,019
depending on the hoop house you get you

978
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,420
can get it for a couple thousand bucks

979
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:10,059
and it's really cheap I see people going

980
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:12,039
really big and really expensive just on

981
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:14,110
the idea of things and they haven't

982
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:16,000
really ironed out a lot of the details

983
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:17,950
so in order to stay in business and get

984
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,170
the most bang for your buck I always

985
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:21,789
recommend trying something out I mean a

986
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,769
lot of times depending if even in

987
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:26,860
California we can legally do six plants

988
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:28,960
you can get a 16 by 12 foot hoop pull of

989
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:32,980
tarp two months if you blow it you still

990
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,030
learn a lot Q&amp;A yeah let's do it all

991
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:40,719
right if you have a question raise your

992
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:43,000
hand so see a big money interest you

993
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,828
know it's bring together say our data

994
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,309
room your technology

995
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:50,048
a C and you know to create these super

996
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:52,749
hyper greenhouses in places like

997
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:54,849
Michigan I'm still not sold you know

998
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:56,199
like you have the heat load that you're

999
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:57,880
going to be carrying through the winter

1000
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:59,739
there not to mention the engineering is

1001
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,599
going to go into that facility snow load

1002
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:04,929
and then you have the steel grow

1003
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,309
environment in a place where you know

1004
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:08,919
and that they're claiming to me like

1005
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:10,690
well still on these cloudy days and you

1006
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,338
know northern Michigan you still getting

1007
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,719
three or four hundred micro moles on the

1008
00:37:12,338 --> 00:37:16,028
cloudy days and you have your stuff

1009
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:17,409
we're gonna like that I'm still the sole

1010
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:19,208
I'm just wondering if you've done the

1011
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:21,728
reading here you know anybody the calves

1012
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:23,440
in those northern latitudes where they

1013
00:37:21,728 --> 00:37:24,879
just don't have a lot of sunshine but

1014
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,650
yet people are still trying to sell

1015
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,180
these very hybrid well I mean you know

1016
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,950
again greenhouses weren't invented for

1017
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:34,808
wintertime so they'll do good throughout

1018
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:36,548
the winter is the summertime where I see

1019
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:37,930
them have the most problems and so most

1020
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:39,458
people like I said with their year-round

1021
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:41,798
greenhouse we're trying to grow in the

1022
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:44,318
summer and then yes getting these fancy

1023
00:37:41,798 --> 00:37:46,630
expensive using other people's money to

1024
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:48,489
you know get these things going big

1025
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,680
investments you know a lot of a lot of

1026
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:52,869
finance going on for big facilities and

1027
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:55,028
big dreams but again a lot of people

1028
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:56,858
have some variables and learning curves

1029
00:37:55,028 --> 00:37:59,739
to go through them that's why you know

1030
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:01,778
yeah it needs to be a little bit pump

1031
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:04,329
the breaks and do this in sections a

1032
00:38:01,778 --> 00:38:06,548
little bit smaller faces I always look

1033
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:08,619
for phase one and phase two upgrades if

1034
00:38:06,548 --> 00:38:10,179
possible you know all those things but a

1035
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,369
lot of people have big money want to go

1036
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:14,948
in and make a splash make a name we're

1037
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:16,119
setting the bar you know they're like

1038
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:18,099
we're setting the bar we're going to be

1039
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,048
the ones you know you always hear that

1040
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:21,729
we're gonna be that we're the first you

1041
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:23,318
know that kind of stuff and so a lot of

1042
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:23,879
people are cool with spending a bunch of

1043
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:25,048
money

1044
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,420
bunch of things they don't know how to

1045
00:38:25,048 --> 00:38:29,969
run create a bunch of you know data

1046
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,798
that's only maybe to them and not share

1047
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:33,598
it because a lot of it's you know not so

1048
00:38:31,798 --> 00:38:36,298
great to share the first year or so and

1049
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,190
so unfortunately I get hired to go

1050
00:38:36,298 --> 00:38:41,159
around and deal with a lot of these

1051
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,568
experiments and try to sort out you know

1052
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:47,038
what to do about making them work

1053
00:38:42,568 --> 00:38:48,389
efficiently and and you know I mean some

1054
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,740
of them will work fine but it's gonna

1055
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:51,058
take and I've seen this in a couple

1056
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:55,768
other facilities it's a five-year

1057
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:57,660
learning curve I actually have two

1058
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:59,578
questions for you we have a greenhouse

1059
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:01,219
here in Colorado and the glazing that we

1060
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:04,710
went with originated with the solar soft

1061
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:05,969
85/100 diffusion we were pretty shocked

1062
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,909
to see the reduction in transmission

1063
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:10,739
that was Compton Bank glazing so we're

1064
00:39:08,909 --> 00:39:13,018
looking at potentially reglazing and we

1065
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:15,179
need to be glazed with different solar

1066
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:17,578
south to solar south maybe 40%

1067
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:19,500
transmission what would be the first bus

1068
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:21,990
is evolving your ideal ratio

1069
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,239
transmission first infusion the second

1070
00:39:21,989 --> 00:39:26,399
question is heavier experimented with

1071
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:29,608
any earth the air conditioning systems

1072
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,349
for green eyes yeah the first part of

1073
00:39:29,608 --> 00:39:32,969
the question and if I forget the second

1074
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:36,720
part is remind me a short time when we

1075
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:39,449
lost the first part of the question is a

1076
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,588
lot we to use solar soft 85 but you know

1077
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:41,788
I work with a lot of greenhouse

1078
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:42,559
companies too and there's a lot of

1079
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:43,880
different

1080
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:45,860
there and what's coming back from these

1081
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,990
farms and whether they should switch go

1082
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:50,090
to clear single or double you know I was

1083
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:51,889
into discussion with a greenhouse

1084
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:53,930
manufacturer right outside here about

1085
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,730
this particular topic and like I was

1086
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:59,239
saying I always benefited from solar

1087
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:00,860
soft 85 single wall corrugated but in

1088
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:02,269
the wintertime it can get kind of drippy

1089
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,370
so you know it kind of gets tough

1090
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:06,079
because I'm on a double wall diffuse

1091
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:09,109
typically though of manufacturers will

1092
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,000
say transmits 74 to 79 percent light and

1093
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:13,550
on the single wall I'll say transmits

1094
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,050
eight up to 85% light and so while the

1095
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,150
transmission is important I think the

1096
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:19,100
diffusion is just as important too

1097
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,420
and so it's really you know tough to get

1098
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:22,789
our cake and eat it too but they are

1099
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,440
coming out with more things over the

1100
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:26,509
course of time being in Colorado you're

1101
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,789
closer to the Sun too so I always see

1102
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:30,740
you know closer higher up the intensity

1103
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:32,329
I'm not always worried about the shading

1104
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:34,579
as much but one of the things that needs

1105
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:36,559
to happen is that our metric back in the

1106
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:38,630
day still to this day is that we need to

1107
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,549
get 50 pounds per thousand square feet

1108
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:42,860
you know that was our minimum average

1109
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:44,810
harvest 50 pounds and a thousand square

1110
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,430
feet if we weren't hitting that we had a

1111
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:48,559
problem when we hit that plenty of times

1112
00:40:46,429 --> 00:40:50,960
with diffused you know so it wasn't a

1113
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,099
matter of yields or whatever that we

1114
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,380
weren't getting from some of these

1115
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:56,119
greenhouse covers a lot of times it had

1116
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,800
to do with the control you know that

1117
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:59,779
were controlled with the support of the

1118
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,519
greenhouse in the summertime we get a

1119
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,560
lot of condensation because the plants

1120
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,509
overheat we got to deploy shade cloth

1121
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:07,549
deploying shade cloth restricts light

1122
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:09,650
you know turning on the cooling systems

1123
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:12,440
also helps but sometimes it was a combo

1124
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:14,210
of all shade cooling you know some now

1125
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,490
are diffused but we're restricting light

1126
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:18,619
rather than diffuse splitting light and

1127
00:41:16,489 --> 00:41:20,899
creating more light you know that's what

1128
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:23,089
they say is the diffusion can restrict

1129
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,250
and diffusion can you know split light

1130
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:26,809
particles and create make more so that's

1131
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,730
why I always say the diffusion is almost

1132
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:30,679
like magic because it's creating more

1133
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:32,090
light but again you know there are

1134
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:34,489
people starting to split the hairs a

1135
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:36,440
little bit like you're saying and so you

1136
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:38,809
know I don't know to say you should do

1137
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,280
this but you know that's kind of what

1138
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:41,869
I'm you know knowing right now

1139
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,600
then as far as the cooling or heating

1140
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:47,059
systems the natural ones like the God or

1141
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:48,799
the you know geothermal type stuff it

1142
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:50,929
can be done but I see that it's like a

1143
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,550
dreamy part of the project and so you

1144
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:54,739
want to make sure that that's affordable

1145
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:56,269
and that somebody's done it before and

1146
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:57,619
it's really gonna work because I see a

1147
00:41:56,269 --> 00:42:00,710
lot of people that want to do you follow

1148
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:02,089
the dreams on the first go and it can be

1149
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,320
kind of expensive because we kind of

1150
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:05,750
need to get the business up and running

1151
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,820
with what works and it's affordable and

1152
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,260
so sometimes you know if it's affordable

1153
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,750
you got a good person that knows how to

1154
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,220
do it then by all means do it but I come

1155
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:14,599
from the background of a lot of people

1156
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:16,309
that come up and go yeah I know how to

1157
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:18,019
do that for some reason they get hired

1158
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:19,549
and they don't really know how to do

1159
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:22,400
these things you know and it costs more

1160
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:23,960
money time to get this stuff working and

1161
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,570
then maybe it does or doesn't work and

1162
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,190
so time and money is really important in

1163
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:30,080
cannabis to get up and running right now

1164
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:32,240
and get a return on investment so that's

1165
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,309
why I was kind of go was simple in what

1166
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,229
works get some return going and then

1167
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:45,949
start following the dreams a little bit

1168
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:48,199
if that makes sense for one more so I

1169
00:42:45,949 --> 00:42:52,279
just following up on one who's asking as

1170
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:53,719
far as like this solar soft 85 we were

1171
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,980
just kind of shocked because we're doing

1172
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:57,889
some spot measurements

1173
00:42:54,980 --> 00:43:00,829
or finding basically by the time things

1174
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:04,039
hit the canopy about a 75% reduction

1175
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:06,858
apart and right up next to lay some

1176
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:08,090
material more like a 50% and so we're

1177
00:43:06,858 --> 00:43:09,409
gonna get it analyzed because there's

1178
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,630
some confusion over whether or not it

1179
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:13,129
was actually that material and I was

1180
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,260
just curious if you've done measurements

1181
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,849
you know I'm like big make very sunny

1182
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,320
day with that material what kind of

1183
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:19,909
reduction in intensity you're seeing

1184
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,140
because obviously there's gonna be some

1185
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:22,489
as it's coming through the material and

1186
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:24,379
then the diffusion may change things a

1187
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:26,539
little bit too but just follow sometimes

1188
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:29,890
the power meter is kind of full near the

1189
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:32,690
power meters on my favor wave of

1190
00:43:29,889 --> 00:43:35,989
metering light a lot of times for me I

1191
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:37,940
use a lux meter and try to find out you

1192
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:39,529
know not necessarily the sun's intensity

1193
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:42,139
through par but the amount of light

1194
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:44,090
that's available and so play around with

1195
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:46,159
a lux meter you can even get one an app

1196
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:48,619
on your iphone to kind of see how bright

1197
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:50,299
things are from inside to outside I was

1198
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:52,039
at a greenhouse facility that was kind

1199
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,960
of in a cloudy day the other day and

1200
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:55,429
they really rely on their give me the

1201
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,599
lights like they're just all about the

1202
00:43:55,429 --> 00:43:58,279
lights in the winter and keep the

1203
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:01,519
blackout closed kind of run it like an

1204
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,920
indoor I pulled out my lux meter we had

1205
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,960
like you know it was like 1,200 bucks

1206
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,490
under the kavita's and then when he

1207
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,699
opened the curtain turn off the lights

1208
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:12,949
we were over 13,000 at that point so I

1209
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:14,899
mean in a lot of ways he was doing self

1210
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:16,519
a disservice by relying on the lights

1211
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,889
and not getting some of the free Sun

1212
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:20,570
because of the sun's intensity but again

1213
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:23,358
I wasn't using a par meter to kind of

1214
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:25,910
quantify its intensity but again I'm not

1215
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:27,619
a huge power person even though I know

1216
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:29,089
it's important to some people I just

1217
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:31,070
from my background I've seen a lot of

1218
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:33,230
big cannabis grows and a lot of we come

1219
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,999
out of these greenhouses and a lot of

1220
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,648
them have been the

1221
00:44:33,998 --> 00:44:37,538
used but now we're kind of in this new

1222
00:44:35,648 --> 00:44:39,788
era where people are you know maybe

1223
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:43,059
producing less and I don't always equate

1224
00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:46,560
it to the green house skins red on who

1225
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:49,800
let's uh let's hear it for Eric Branstad

1226
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,799
[Applause]

1227
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,309
you
