1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
let me talk sure talk me through this

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:14,518
okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm just

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:17,820
gonna create a timeline this is a skunk

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,800
from 1981 I received it from an

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,449
individual who had it in a library and

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,070
ended going into flowering from stress

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,510
the reason why I wanted to show the vid

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,460
was one to just show the plant because

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,590
it's crisis anxious and the show that

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,480
the earth Fox technology it's wonderful

11
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,250
for recovering older genetics because

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,230
once you set this up the plant basically

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,390
balances out in its biology and its

14
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:38,369
uptake it normals out in the wave grows

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,989
morphologically and from here the

16
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:41,218
cuttings are beautiful to start working

17
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:42,839
the thing that occurred back in the

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,000
eighties all through the 90s forward was

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,129
we had beautiful cannabis and as we went

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,750
into indoor cultivation we had problems

21
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:50,339
controlling the smell and lo and behold

22
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,899
we got rid of a lot of these cannabis

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,059
varieties that are exceptionally unique

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,460
and the problem is is that we're trying

25
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:57,929
to assume that it was terpenes only that

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,189
made those smells and actually we

27
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:02,039
starting to understand now that it was

28
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:04,500
esters a plant alcohols and those are

29
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,510
unique to the plant and so you can't

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,400
really breed and reproduce some of these

31
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,840
odors with the modern varieties because

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,240
they're not carrying these esters

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,430
forward it's not just Terps alone that

34
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,339
make it tastes and trends change over

35
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,290
time and what was popular in the 80s was

36
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,478
not popular in the 90s and subscales we

37
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,299
popular in 2000's the direction that it

38
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,969
was taken makes it sometimes difficult

39
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,180
to go back to a location so if we were

40
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,978
seeking only fruity floral skunks for

41
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,770
years then it would be very difficult

42
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,929
now to go find these heavily burnt few

43
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:38,548
rubber skunks of the past and so that's

44
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,618
why these are these older plants are so

45
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,710
important that we can use them to bring

46
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:45,719
us back into a range of genetics that

47
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:47,459
reflect more what occurred at that time

48
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,009
period and then now we can make the

49
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:52,709
decisions as to what's really attractive

50
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,140
currently today using that population

51
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:57,059
and so these these older varieties are

52
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,829
crucial in cannabis for what we do

53
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,899
because it's there's no way to get back

54
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:02,188
into what was trendy in the past what

55
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,680
was really the foundation of the modern

56
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,938
cannabis lines and a lot of times we

57
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,920
realize that we went in the wrong

58
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:09,008
direction and so hopefully I can tap

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,590
into this and see

60
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,539
many many different directions to go in

61
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,310
flavor and chemo type in terms of high

62
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:17,679
but hopefully we're able to find some of

63
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,269
those rare alcohol esters that that

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,459
create some of these unbelievably

65
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:22,989
pungent funky smells the reason why you

66
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:24,519
knew a skunk was a skunk was it was

67
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:26,459
because it was an ester it was almost

68
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,860
instantly volatize and had it had

69
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,150
instantaneous aroma through the space

70
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,190
exceptionally difficult to capture it

71
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,569
because it's bonded so lightly but

72
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:37,359
that's what we want now is he's

73
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:39,578
incredibly loud bright explosive strains

74
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:41,319
the signature isn't an issue or legally

75
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:43,030
grown in the state if we work within our

76
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:45,458
boundaries these kind of cannabis

77
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,469
varieties are the new market this 81 I

78
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,060
have one from the 90s the hogs breath

79
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:51,009
and then a Grass Valley skunk that I

80
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,870
picked up through those four female

81
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:54,280
Praja Nader's and then the male skunks

82
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,959
that I'm sifting through now to go into

83
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,280
it hopefully over the next couple years

84
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,079
we really be able to start to pull out

85
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,848
some of the stuff from the past that

86
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,889
that really got most of us in the

87
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:16,000
cannabis and give us a lot more choices

88
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:18,459
and options than what we have today out

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,889
there just have visuals not to see you

90
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:22,930
just continuously talk and having the

91
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:25,750
map would be close and this timeline

92
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,629
gives you a reflection of from 1968 to

93
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,669
2017 so 68 was basically when you

94
00:03:28,628 --> 00:03:32,560
started to have the huge influx of the

95
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:35,590
back to land movement the reclamation

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,989
people into Humble County by 81 we had a

97
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,280
full-blown outdoor situation that was

98
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:40,628
unparalleled this is where the

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,299
reputation of Humboldt was really built

100
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:48,780
by 1983 this is camp and it radically

101
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:50,980
changed canvas from this point forward

102
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,329
from this point forward we went into

103
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:54,158
cannabis that was no longer so

104
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:56,739
attractive it was more of a stealth type

105
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:59,439
cannabis and so as we went forward this

106
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:02,620
time you know 10 20 30 plus years 35

107
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,870
years we changed what cannabis was from

108
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,079
here and so if I breathe something from

109
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:12,158
this point or say from here I was

110
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,030
reflecting spittle populations and so in

111
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:14,799
order for me to get

112
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,930
back all the way into the past of these

113
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,660
varieties here I have to actually find a

114
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:23,079
plant from the past to bring this ripple

115
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,820
or I have to do a population so big you

116
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,459
know twenty thousand thirty thousand

117
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:29,560
plants of this size so that I can find

118
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:31,689
here or it's just easy to find the plant

119
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,089
and go here so we have a choice it's

120
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:37,300
bigger populations or go back in time to

121
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:39,069
find the plants that were taken so what

122
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,460
people realize is when you when you when

123
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:44,800
you have a line and when you take the X

124
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:48,069
Y and we cross somebody to do our F one

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,370
we have many potential progeny we can go

126
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:52,930
in any of these directions in skunks we

127
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,418
went this way with the with the more

128
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:58,060
floral and flute frooties lower smell

129
00:04:55,418 --> 00:05:00,370
lower ester I just want to go back down

130
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,959
this line and go across the board and

131
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,149
start to pull out some of these things

132
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:06,219
that were so unbelievably attractive in

133
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:07,989
my memory and then resurrect them this

134
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,850
way and that's the whole point of the

135
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,280
skunk project is to come back out of the

136
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,919
floral fruits and go back in time enough

137
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,929
to get the gene pool so we can f2 f3 f4

138
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:18,519
and try to get it into more stable line

139
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,168
and now that we have the ability to do

140
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:24,289
this outside once again really what I'm

141
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:33,068
doing is I'm replicating 1968 to 1981

142
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:33,069
