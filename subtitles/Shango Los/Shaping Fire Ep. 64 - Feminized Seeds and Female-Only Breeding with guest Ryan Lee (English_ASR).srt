2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,638
as more and more people begin to grow

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,279
their own cannabis the popularity of

4
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,959
feminized seeds has risen remarkably as

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,198
new growers come to understand the

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,600
inconveniences associated with using

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,279
regular male female seeds feminized

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,800
seeds have become an increasingly

9
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,640
attractive option

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,800
if you are a listener unfamiliar with

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,118
feminized seeds these are the three most

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,079
common reasons people choose feminized

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,920
seeds number one in most cases a patient

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,679
is legally limited to how many plants

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,520
they can grow so each plant is

16
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,439
exceptionally valuable generally

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,120
speaking cannabis seeds will germinate

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,439
and become plants that are fifty percent

19
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,119
male and fifty percent female so when

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,920
you pop your regular seeds you should

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,878
expect about half to be female however

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,039
that 50 50 only plays out statistically

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,119
over thousands of seeds so it is

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,439
entirely possible for you to pop six

25
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,839
seeds and have four or five of them be

26
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,759
male it is exceptionally disheartening

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,840
for a patient to discover that so many

28
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,759
of their plants are male when they need

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,960
female plants to make their medicine and

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,359
get relief

31
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,199
after all of the soil and nutrients and

32
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,519
care and love the patient has given the

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,079
plant it is a significant disappointment

34
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,920
to have to destroy it because of this

35
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,200
many patients love feminized seeds

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,600
because it removes the risk of

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,719
cultivating plants that end in wasted

38
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,959
effort

39
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,200
number two cultivators who are growing

40
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,359
more plants than a patient but less than

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,200
a commercial cultivator often need to

42
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,519
make clones to extend what they can do

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,520
with a small number of seeds this often

44
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:38,078
means going through the arduous process

45
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,239
of popping the seed letting it grow

46
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,000
taking clones flowering a clone to

47
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,158
determine the sex of the plant and then

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,478
planting the clones that prove female

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,479
while calling the males that process

50
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,879
takes some time it is far more

51
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,879
convenient to pop a female seed and just

52
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,199
start cloning confident that the new

53
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,759
clones are all female

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,399
number three commercial scale growers

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,399
are now embracing feminized seeds too

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,280
commercial cultivators have a choice of

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,200
either to use clones or feminized seeds

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,118
femme seeds are easier to store and have

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,120
that vigor that comes with a seed

60
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,039
instead of a clone for now though

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,159
feminized seeds are a bit more variable

62
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:18,079
than clones so many still use clones

63
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,400
no doubt there are plenty of great

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,959
reasons to grow male female regular

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,039
seeds this episode is focusing on the

66
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,840
benefits and challenges of feminized

67
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,679
seeds and female only breeding though so

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,479
we won't be talking about the reasons we

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,560
like rags this is an episode exalting

140
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,800
today we're going to talk about the

141
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,879
creation and genetic makeup of feminized

142
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
seeds and we're gonna gonna do a dive

143
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,360
into female only breeding too which is

144
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,439
super interesting stick around

145
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,199
welcome to the show ryan

146
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,719
thanks shango uh really appreciate you

147
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,280
having me on excellent glad to have you

148
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,479
here so let's start with some vocabulary

149
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,319
right because

150
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,038
we're going to go through a lot of the

151
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,199
various myths around feminized seeds

152
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,599
today but one of the first things is

153
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,960
like pretty much a a comprehensive

154
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,879
confusion between the the vocabulary of

155
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:30,959
feminized seeds and self seeds so will

156
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:33,759
you clarify and tease those apart for us

157
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,599
yeah okay so feminized seeds uh is a

158
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,360
word that really i think was kind of

159
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,199
coined or made up in the cannabis

160
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,120
industry it's not a word that we use in

161
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,038
botany

162
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,879
but what it really means is

163
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,680
seeds that you plant and they grow out

164
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,360
to be all females

165
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,519
and you know this discussion is really

166
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,720
going to come into

167
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,279
some words that people might have heard

168
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,440
when talking about buying seeds uh

169
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,478
different cannabis seed types so we have

170
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,478
monitious seeds or dioecious seeds

171
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,399
and hemp tends to be monowitious which

172
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,038
means that um

173
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,719
we have both male and female flowers on

174
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,639
the same plant

175
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,560
um and drug cannabis is kind of at the

176
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,400
other end of the spectrum where

177
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,240
we have uh male and female plants uh

178
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,799
occurring on on separate individual

179
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,038
plants

180
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,319
and that comes from the root word the

181
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:29,279
the greek word oikos which means home

182
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,600
and uh so meniscus means

183
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,559
both of the sexes reside in one home

184
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,319
whereas dioecius means the sexes reside

185
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,720
in two separate homes

186
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,160
um the word feminized really is a um

187
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,880
kind of a more

188
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,280
user-friendly term for what botanist

189
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,240
called gynoisius which means

190
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,318
uh the female house or all the seeds

191
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,079
in the population being from the female

192
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,240
gender

193
00:06:54,079 --> 00:07:00,318
wow that's actually really cool

194
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,840
so so so if if if feminized seeds are

195
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,120
gynoecious

196
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,239
where in that model do does a self seed

197
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,560
live

198
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,079
yeah so a self seed is a specific type

199
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,598
of

200
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,399
feminized seed

201
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,360
where

202
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:17,279
the pollen donor and the

203
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,960
plant that actually holds the seed which

204
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,959
we call the seed mother

205
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,359
are the this are genetically the same

206
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,359
plant

207
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,519
and so it's the most severe form of

208
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,079
inbreeding one can do

209
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,079
on any given species and it's something

210
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,240
that's quite unnatural for cannabis

211
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,279
cannabis in its natural state

212
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,038
of of dioeci where we have

213
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,119
you know if you if you if if you were to

214
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,120
come across a wild stand of cannabis in

215
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,918
the uh somewhere walking through the

216
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,680
valley you know a valley in

217
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,359
tibet or somewhere

218
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,038
approximately half of the plants would

219
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,840
be female and half of the plants would

220
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,240
be me would be males so it's a natural

221
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,399
condition for

222
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,038
any plant to leave its offspring that it

223
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,598
has to have mate with another individual

224
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,519
of the same species kind of like humans

225
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,800
and that's really quite rare in the

226
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,918
plant world

227
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,720
um and it has a whole bunch of

228
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,399
consequences for on genetic diversity

229
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,759
and a whole bunch of other things that

230
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,359
we're going to talk about over the next

231
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,680
hour

232
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,120
but for example tomatoes

233
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,280
they naturally self-pollinate so

234
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,280
it's a natural state for

235
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,878
tomato to

236
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,799
you know for a bumble bee to come along

237
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,120
and and play with the flower on on the

238
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,038
tomato plant and that causes a self

239
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,519
fertilization where the male parts of

240
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:38,399
that individual flower interact with the

241
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,879
female parts or the bumble bee transfers

242
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,200
the pollen from one part to the other

243
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,919
and that creates a fruit in which

244
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,600
there's seeds growing

245
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,679
and so if you you know if you buy

246
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,120
heirloom tomato seeds off the internet

247
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,199
and the company sends you a package of

248
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,519
seeds and you take those seeds and grow

249
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
them into a full plant and you harvest

250
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,720
the tomatoes

251
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,800
and you take the seeds and you plant

252
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,560
them again the next year

253
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,240
the the plants from the next year and

254
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,439
the fruit from those plants from the

255
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,240
next year

256
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,000
will be near identical if not identical

257
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,919
to the the seeds that you grew out on

258
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,399
the first year and if you were to take

259
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,399
those seeds and continue continually

260
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,639
save them and plant them in your garden

261
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,480
over the next 10 to 15 years

262
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,759
you could expect that those tomatoes are

263
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,519
going to be the same every time

264
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,519
whereas you know we've come to see

265
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,360
that's not the case in cannabis and that

266
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,759
really has to do with this

267
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,800
natural state of breeding

268
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,958
where

269
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,120
every individual must interact with

270
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,119
another individual to create progeny

271
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,120
kind of like humans

272
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,320
um

273
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,959
so so are our self seeds all female

274
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,560
yes well not necessarily because you can

275
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,879
actually self

276
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,359
we have a little trick for making female

277
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,759
so maybe i should talk about first how

278
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
we me how a feminized seed is made

279
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,679
um

280
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,040
we have a

281
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,559
there's a a couple of different

282
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,078
chemicals but the one that's most

283
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,479
commonly used is a chemical called

284
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:07,439
silver thiosulfate and silver

285
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,000
thiosulfate blocks one of the five major

286
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,320
plant hormones and when that happens on

287
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,399
cannabis when you take a female cannabis

288
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,839
plant and you induce it to flower and

289
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,278
immediately spray it with silver

290
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,000
thiosulfate

291
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,278
the silver ion blocks the ethylene in

292
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,519
that

293
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,759
biological pathway that leads to female

294
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,679
flowers and the consequence is that this

295
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,159
female genetically female plant will

296
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:33,120
produce male flowers and thus they will

297
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:35,039
produce pollen so that's a trait of a

298
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,959
male plant to be able to produce pollen

299
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,199
and it's very atypical for a female

300
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,199
plant to be able to produce pollen

301
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,759
the difference being between male pollen

302
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,680
and female derived pollen is that the

303
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,958
female pollen has no y chromosomes it

304
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,239
has no

305
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,639
um

306
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,720
uniquely genetically male contributions

307
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,879
that are being passed on to the next

308
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,920
offspring and so what it allows us to do

309
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,559
is mate one female with another or in

310
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:03,759
the case of self seeds we can mate one

311
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:06,799
female plant with itself

312
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:09,120
and so self seeds are really um

313
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,479
we do see a little bit of a little bit

314
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,839
of them appearing on the commercial

315
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,278
market but it's really a breeder's tool

316
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,040
for

317
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,720
doing what we would call severe

318
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,679
inbreeding

319
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,278
right on so the only time that i have uh

320
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,000
come across

321
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:30,078
you know in my own hands s ones self

322
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,320
seeds are i'm a big fan of uh caleb over

323
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,679
at csi humbled and he was on the show

324
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,519
and and he said that one of the reasons

325
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:40,799
that he likes self seeds is because

326
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,799
it kind of gives you a decent snapshot

327
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,799
of

328
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,560
all many of the different phenos that

329
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,000
are in

330
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:54,799
the the parent plants so whereas with

331
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
with regular seeds when you get them um

332
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:00,958
you'll have a differentiation of phenos

333
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,480
but you may not get everything that's

334
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,119
to be to be kind of sloppy with my

335
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,759
vocabulary in the line of that of that

336
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,320
parent whereas when you have an s1 it

337
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,000
kind of creates normally we go for seeds

338
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,000
that are all the same right so that so

339
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,200
that all the seeds you get out of a pack

340
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,159
are are kind of similar and and similar

341
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,480
to

342
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,319
the the breeders cut right which for

343
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,000
many people would consider like the the

344
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,519
gold standard so you've got your

345
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,639
breeders cut and then you try to make

346
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:32,159
seeds that that exemplify the breeders

347
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,360
cut but ss1 self seeds people seem to

348
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,600
kind of go at it in a different

349
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,879
direction whereas like like i've got

350
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,278
i've got the skittles s1 that caleb made

351
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,759
and i know that that if i had enough

352
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,399
packs of that s1 i only have one but

353
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,720
let's say i had you know four or five i

354
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,679
would have kind of a snapshot of all the

355
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,079
variety that's in the skittles line

356
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:57,199
do i have a general under accurate

357
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,719
understanding of that that snapshot of

358
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,360
the genetic line

359
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,519
and if not where am i off

360
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,320
yeah well i'm going to say yes and no

361
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,480
okay fair enough and so

362
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,920
and s1 is what we call a recombinant

363
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,639
generation

364
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,559
um and and what that what that means is

365
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,159
you know i have to again i have to back

366
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,518
up a little bit and to try to explain

367
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,679
this

368
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,039
and and we'll use humans as a way to do

369
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,120
that because i think it's easier for

370
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,480
people to under to think about sex in

371
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,000
terms of humans you know everybody has a

372
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,200
mother and a father and

373
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,078
a lot of people have a brother or sister

374
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,320
so

375
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,638
if we imagine that the mother is the

376
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:39,040
ideal type or as you call the breeders

377
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:41,198
cut our our our idea is that we want to

378
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,519
make we want to mate her

379
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,958
and have the progeny end up being like

380
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,959
her right

381
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,958
and so in plant breeding and really in

382
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,159
all breeding we have this basic tenant

383
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,559
which is

384
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,278
like begets like and all that that means

385
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,039
is

386
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,958
if you take a plant that has you know

387
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,639
blue petals it's more likely that the

388
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,239
offspring of that plant will also have

389
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,120
blue petals

390
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,959
okay

391
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,320
but as we know from

392
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,838
you know our experience with humans

393
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,839
you don't look like your mother or

394
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,440
father you might have some of their

395
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,079
traits but you're not an identical

396
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,279
replication of of the mother

397
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,000
right

398
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,000
um and

399
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,120
so typically when people have made

400
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,278
cannabis seeds what they do is they look

401
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,799
through a population of any type maybe

402
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,559
it's a land race maybe it's the seed

403
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:31,599
pack they bought from holland or

404
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:34,719
california and they grow these seeds out

405
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,680
and you select an ideal plant that is

406
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,560
you know

407
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:41,120
excellent or good on a whole series of

408
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,159
of combinations and if a breeder wants

409
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,720
to then

410
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,399
make seeds from that plant you have to

411
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,759
go looking for a pollen source or

412
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,679
traditionally you've had to go looking

413
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,399
for a pollen source and so what people

414
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,559
do is they take their own favorite lion

415
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,720
and they use that plant to pollinate

416
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,319
their new selected mother plant well the

417
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,480
problem is is that you know following

418
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,839
the like begets like tenet that i

419
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,159
mentioned earlier

420
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,959
we're now introducing traits from a

421
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,719
father type that might not be identical

422
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,599
to the mother type

423
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,440
and

424
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,480
there's one you know the the easiest

425
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,839
plant

426
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,839
the the most

427
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,360
the the plant that would be most like

428
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,040
the mother plant would be the mother

429
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,278
plant itself if we could find a way to

430
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,240
produce it or to make that plant produce

431
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,078
pollen

432
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,320
and so we use this chemical trick where

433
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,919
we spray this ethylene blocker on the

434
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,199
female plant when it's entering

435
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:33,120
flowering

436
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:34,159
and that allows the plant to produce

437
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,919
um

438
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,000
male flowers from which we can harvest

439
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,519
the pollen and then self-pollinate the

440
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,440
plant

441
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,198
um

442
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,720
but but still

443
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,599
we have to remember that that mother

444
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,399
plant came herself as a hybrid from two

445
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,399
different plants

446
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,239
maybe those plants were were almost

447
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,440
identical and if they were almost

448
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,839
identical if we self the plant

449
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,120
that's those self seeds would be

450
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,800
very similar

451
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,360
right they might they might even all be

452
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,439
identical to the mother plant but if the

453
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,680
if the mother plant that we're using is

454
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,199
herself a hybrid

455
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,198
meaning she has

456
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,159
you know genetics from two different

457
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,719
types

458
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,480
when we when we self that plant it's

459
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,240
going to expose all of the genetic

460
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,800
combinations that exist within her

461
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,720
genome and that's exciting right if you

462
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,758
if you're a pheno hunter you know if

463
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,360
you're looking for unique traits um that

464
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,759
sounds exciting now if you're looking

465
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,800
for consistency in seeds well then you'd

466
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,399
want the first version but the idea of

467
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:41,439
being able to

468
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:43,440
see all of the um wonderful uh varieties

469
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,639
uh also sounds fun depending on what

470
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,360
your goal is

471
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,120
it really is and typically traditionally

472
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,278
in the plant breeding world

473
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,799
that you know that pheno hunt is that

474
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,559
you're talking about

475
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,198
it really has been the goal of the

476
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,000
breeder the the breeder's goal is to put

477
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,559
out

478
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,320
you know as as a commercial seed buyer

479
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,679
you want all the plants to look the same

480
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,519
or i would think that you want all

481
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,798
plants to look the same you know you

482
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,078
might be interested in looking at the

483
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:09,359
variation

484
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,359
but i think for most people that are

485
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,078
buying commercial seeds they expect like

486
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,719
you said a representation of a of a

487
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,879
described plant aka the breeders yeah if

488
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,600
most people want consistency or what a

489
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,839
lot of people call a stable line right

490
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,438
whereas whereas people will say oh no

491
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,359
this is a breeders pack because there's

492
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,880
a lot of variety for you to final hunt

493
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,038
in

494
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,240
yeah and that's kind of i think that

495
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,400
honestly breeders have been able to hide

496
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,919
behind that fat that

497
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,400
type of marketing

498
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,000
for you know the last 30 years

499
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,759
and breeders have typically sold the

500
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,319
variation as

501
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:49,599
a positive when i think that really it's

502
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,279
a feature not a flaw

503
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,519
exactly and that's i think you know

504
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,879
that's partly the part of the reason is

505
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,000
that a lot of the people working with

506
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,880
cannabis

507
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,919
are unlike caleb are not real plant

508
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,160
breeders um they're just people making

509
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,038
seeds to sell for money

510
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,880
um

511
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,440
and those and that you know plant

512
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,160
breeding is a skill and it's um

513
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,200
there's an education to it and

514
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,600
um

515
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,679
you have to learn the laws of how plant

516
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,279
breeding and biology and meiosis work in

517
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,120
order to be able to

518
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,079
uh use them as tools to your advantage

519
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:26,399
in creating a true breeding line and so

520
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,159
self seeds are a way to get to that true

521
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,360
breeding line but they in the they in

522
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,000
and of themselves may not be

523
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:35,519
um a good a good way to produce stable

524
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,400
seeds that doesn't mean that they don't

525
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,160
have their use but i i you know to me

526
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,640
selfing is a tool and a breeder's

527
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,880
toolbox it's not

528
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,120
the end result it's not the end result

529
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,000
fair enough fair enough so let's talk

530
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:52,399
about uh the mechanics of using silver

531
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,200
theosulfate one of the things i like

532
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,120
about our conversations before today

533
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,038
is that uh you know you've got the

534
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,558
education and you are a scientist and um

535
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,240
you know in my experience you describe

536
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,918
things pretty well so

537
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,240
would you take us through um the process

538
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,400
of of using silver theosulfate to

539
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,120
actually make a feminized seed i know

540
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,519
this may seem um awfully basic for for

541
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,599
you but but most of us can't get a good

542
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,160
description anywhere because people

543
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,558
describe things kind of kind of

544
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,480
sloppily you know even even caleb right

545
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,720
and who you and i both agree

546
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,880
is a great breeder when he was on the

547
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,038
show he's all like he's like man i kind

548
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,200
of just do it you know and fair enough

549
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,599
right so his his expertise is making

550
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,558
seeds not necessarily you know teaching

551
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:44,319
it but but i'm gonna put that on you so

552
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:47,279
so so like like once we've scored some

553
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:48,319
silver theo sulfate um you know also

554
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,960
what you know people call it

555
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,119
feminization spray sometimes like what

556
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,400
do you actually do with it

557
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,079
okay well i think it's under it's

558
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,400
important to understand how it works so

559
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,879
this if you don't need to use the silver

560
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,320
thiosulfate the thiosulfate

561
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,400
component

562
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,480
is kind of like a buffer

563
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,159
or a transporter to help bring the

564
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,480
silver into the plant

565
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,320
um when the the first researchers were

566
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,319
looking at these things like i guess

567
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,119
it's important to say too there's five

568
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,960
major plant hormones um in humans you

569
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,719
know obviously we have many many more

570
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,600
but in plants there's about five

571
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,000
hormones that regulate most of the

572
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,079
the dance of life of the plant

573
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,400
and one of those hormones is ethylene i

574
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,639
think most people

575
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,559
know the consequences of ethylene by

576
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,799
taking a green banana and putting it in

577
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:39,038
a paper bag and kind of cinching it

578
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,759
closed and the banana will go yellow the

579
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:44,798
reason is is the paper bag is trapping

580
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:48,000
that ethylene gas

581
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:51,200
which in the case of bananas and and

582
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,839
many types of fruit it causes ripening

583
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,279
um in flowers it causes flowers to stay

584
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,759
open so

585
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,038
in the cut flower industry you you'll

586
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,839
actually see

587
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,440
um flower producers typically you know

588
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,959
all over the world but they you know if

589
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,759
they're shipping flowers from say costa

590
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,240
rica to california for the market

591
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,640
um one of the tricks to slow down the

592
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,679
ripening process is to spray

593
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,159
silver thiosulfate on the freshly

594
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,080
harvested flower buds and that blocks

595
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,760
the action of ethylene

596
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,639
and stops the ripening or slows the

597
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,599
ripening process allowing for a longer

598
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,679
um

599
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,000
harvest window you might say or a longer

600
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,480
transportation window

601
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,880
it just provides shelf life stability so

602
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,079
plant people spray these types of

603
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,799
chemicals on on plants

604
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:43,119
and i guess a researcher was trying to

605
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,319
look at the effect of silver nitrate

606
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,319
which is very much like silver

607
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,399
thiosulfate and they sprayed it on the

608
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,519
cannabis plants and they realized that

609
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,240
this action would turn female plants

610
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:57,960
uh phenotypically male the female plants

611
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,960
would produce male flowers

612
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,038
and it does that by

613
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:05,519
blocking the action of ethylene at this

614
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:08,558
ethylene receptor much like you know

615
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,798
much like narcan does with um

616
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,119
the opioid or the opioid rescue drug it

617
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,119
blocks the receptor and stops the action

618
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:17,199
of the fentanyl of the heroin and

619
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,759
essentially revives the person so silver

620
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,159
thiosulfate does much of the same thing

621
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,919
except the end result is that

622
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,679
the plant about two to three weeks later

623
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,440
will start producing male flowers rather

624
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,600
than female flowers

625
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,400
and we then harvest that pollen or we

626
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:34,480
put that plant in the same room or a

627
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,240
pollination chamber with

628
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,038
you know either another clone of the

629
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,720
same

630
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,038
the genetically the same plant for

631
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,000
making self seeds

632
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,839
or we could put a another plant of a

633
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,279
different genotype in the same chamber

634
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:52,399
as well to make hybrid feminized seeds

635
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:54,798
so you put another female in with your

636
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,840
female that you are applying the silver

637
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:59,599
thiosulfate to yeah the the

638
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,079
we call that plant the donor plant and

639
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,639
so the donor plant essentially becomes

640
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,240
your you know air quote males your air

641
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,120
quote male plant or your pollen donor

642
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,720
plant

643
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,239
and any other plants that you want to

644
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,240
receive that pollen you essentially put

645
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,200
them in the same chamber the same grow

646
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,279
chamber

647
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,798
and they will also be pollinated from

648
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,038
that one

649
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,038
pollen donor plant and and so you can

650
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,038
you can make self seeds and you can make

651
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,440
hybrid seeds at the same time

652
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,960
for for home growers who may not who

653
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,120
want to give this a whirl but they may

654
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,000
not have you know dedicated

655
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,199
uh

656
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,558
seed chambers um and and enough room for

657
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,120
multiple plants would it be legit to

658
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:42,000
uh spray the silver

659
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,879
thiosulfate on say for example lower

660
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,359
branches and then just let the you know

661
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,400
have a fan in there so that the pollen

662
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:54,079
goes around the tent and then

663
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,720
self pollinates the female flowers that

664
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:59,119
are up higher in the plant yeah you can

665
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,480
do it that way um i think most people

666
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:02,558
that are playing with around with

667
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,720
breeding at home they don't really need

668
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,879
i mean that could potentially produce

669
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,038
many hundreds or even thousands of seeds

670
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,919
i think for most home growers

671
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:11,919
you know

672
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,520
20 or 30 or 40 seeds is probably

673
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,520
sufficient to play with

674
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,200
um so yeah you you could do it you could

675
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:18,720
spray one branch if you wanted to but

676
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,600
then you risk pollinating the whole

677
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,558
plant it's probably wiser to

678
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,240
um spray a small clone

679
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:27,839
that you can isolate from the rest of

680
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,400
the plants and then you then you can

681
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,879
collect the pollen from that that newly

682
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,038
mail plant or the pollen donor plant and

683
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,720
then you can just take that pollen and

684
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,000
either apply it by hand or with a paint

685
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,200
brush to

686
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,599
the the lower branches of your choice

687
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,679
is the only downside to pollinating the

688
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,439
entire plant just that it's going to

689
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,038
decrease the potency of the smokeable

690
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,480
flower because as far as i'm concerned

691
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,798
if i was going to go to all this

692
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,278
freaking trouble i would want to

693
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,359
pollinate that whole donor plant

694
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,519
so that it makes the most seeds possible

695
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,359
for the labor that i'm putting in

696
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,879
yeah you can but it's again it's not a

697
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,759
very you might want it you know in a

698
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,400
given in a small plant with say four or

699
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,440
five large main colas you could really

700
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,679
produce

701
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,120
a few hundred seeds of four different

702
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,759
types right if you put a different

703
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:19,199
pollen donor on every branch

704
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:21,440
so i again i think for most home

705
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,759
home growers it would be more efficient

706
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,759
to just pollinate single branches rather

707
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,278
than the full plant because even if you

708
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,319
just wanted to you know if you say

709
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,798
you're growing a couple of plants

710
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,839
outside you could just pollinate one

711
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,599
branch by creating a small pollen

712
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,558
uh we call them pollen bags they're

713
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,959
essentially just little parchment paper

714
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:43,200
satchels but you can put pollen in that

715
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,679
and then tape over you know tape the end

716
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,480
the open end over a bag and it's white

717
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,000
so

718
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,159
light still gets through it because it's

719
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,079
parchment paper it still breathes and

720
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,039
that way you can actually create seeds

721
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,960
on one plant

722
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,119
or sorry on one branch of one pollen

723
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,200
type without pollinating the rest of

724
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,719
your plant let's let's talk about that

725
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,600
let's talk about that pollen bag for a

726
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,839
second um i'm familiar with uh taking

727
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,918
the pollen and painting it on with a

728
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,000
with a small uh

729
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,360
paintbrush right and that's that's fun

730
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,839
and uh easy to do these pollen bags so

731
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,558
if the pollen is in the bag the pollen

732
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,839
can't go through the the the parchment

733
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:23,599
that's good and you're gonna you're

734
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,918
gonna put it over the branch and you're

735
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,879
probably gonna tape it off to close the

736
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,840
seal on the far end what do you do like

737
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,440
shake shake the bag once a day um how

738
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,599
how because i'm just imagining the

739
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,440
pollen sitting in the in the lower part

740
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:39,119
of the bag

741
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,400
well the lower yeah it's when you make

742
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,158
the bag it's in the lower part of the

743
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,400
bag but you turn the bag upside down as

744
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,320
you put it on the plant

745
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,080
right so it kind of comes you know i

746
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:51,038
would think of it like a sock being put

747
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,639
over a branch sure right the the pollens

748
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:54,319
down at the toes when you're starting

749
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,799
when you're when you're creating the bag

750
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,480
you're making it but when you put the

751
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,480
sock on the

752
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,240
the branch so to speak the bottom

753
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,319
becomes the top and you just cinch it

754
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,159
with a zap strap or an elastic bag or a

755
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,079
tie or whatever you want to do but you'd

756
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,760
still want to you'd still want to like

757
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:13,038
jostle the bag occasionally to kind of

758
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:15,359
re-remove the pollen around right so you

759
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,839
get more chances of the pollinate after

760
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,759
the very first attempt right you can

761
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:20,480
it's probably not necessary i mean when

762
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:22,240
you're

763
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,159
you'd be surprised how many pollens fit

764
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,880
or how many pollen grains fit into a you

765
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,159
know for example a teaspoon of pollen so

766
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,520
if you were to create one of these bags

767
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,360
and put a teaspoon of pollen in it

768
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,519
there's more than enough pollen to

769
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,879
saturate the entire branch

770
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,519
there's a great picture of these

771
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,120
actually on rob clark's book marijuana

772
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,359
botany you can anybody can find that

773
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:43,918
picture online from the front cover and

774
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:46,719
one of the four corners there's a

775
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,399
a a picture of a cannabis plant with you

776
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,558
know four or five different branches on

777
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:51,759
it with the pollen bags

778
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:55,678
okay so

779
00:27:51,759 --> 00:28:00,319
if we follow this uh strategy of using

780
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:03,519
sts this silver thiosulfate

781
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:06,319
what are our percentages of success like

782
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,879
like what's the likelihood of there

783
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,480
being a male seed produced in this is i

784
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,559
mean it's it's less than a hundred

785
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,319
percent right

786
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,639
yeah i think the true answer to that

787
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:20,000
shanghai is is that we don't really know

788
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,840
i would i would argue that 99.99

789
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,319
of the seeds that are produced from

790
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,599
these combinations are

791
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:29,359
going to be

792
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:31,359
genetic and phenotypically female

793
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,359
now we all know that there's anomalies

794
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:34,558
in gender expression

795
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,479
that's a big

796
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,558
topic about today whether men are men

797
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,159
and women or men or whatever but there's

798
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:41,759
definitely a small subset of the

799
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,640
population

800
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,158
where

801
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,200
the genetics just don't match the

802
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,440
phenotype for whatever reason

803
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,120
and those things can but yeah they

804
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,000
probably can happen but i think that

805
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:55,359
it's much more likely when you find

806
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,200
a male

807
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:02,158
seed in the in a female in an all-female

808
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,840
seed lot or a gyneconosis or feminized

809
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,159
seed seed lot

810
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,398
it's more likely that that male is

811
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,440
derived from a pollen contamination

812
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:11,599
event

813
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,798
back when the seed was making seeds or

814
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:16,959
the plant was making seeds rather than

815
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:19,440
a female

816
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,519
female breeding resulting in a male seed

817
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,679
that right that right there is some good

818
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,079
insight i mean you're in the scene you

819
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,320
know how often um i mean it's not like

820
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,798
it's incredibly often but it happens

821
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,278
often enough that somebody plants a a

822
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,359
feminized seed and they get a male and

823
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,200
they totally lose their [ __ ] and it ends

824
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,918
up being blamed on the you know

825
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,640
feminized seeds at a hole when really

826
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:46,320
it's probably an accidental pollen part

827
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,480
a pollen particle that that contaminated

828
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,960
you know in the breeding room it's it's

829
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,360
much more likely and like you know and

830
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,120
like i said there there are anomalies

831
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,599
everywhere in the

832
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,439
in in nature right i was in i was in

833
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,119
morocco with rob clark a few years ago

834
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,120
and we were walking through these fields

835
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,678
with thousands of plants in them and we

836
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,278
found a plant that had male female it

837
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,960
had male flowers

838
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:10,880
but for every other

839
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,720
discernible characteristic this plant

840
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,720
could have been a female like it

841
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,079
it was what we would what we called a

842
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,120
very

843
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,839
female male or it was a heavily female

844
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,519
trait male

845
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:25,199
plant there are some subtle differences

846
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,038
between males and females you know for

847
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,558
example

848
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,798
often and this is not that doesn't

849
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,639
always hold true but often

850
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,398
when plants go into if you grow regular

851
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,038
seeds at diocese seeds and you put them

852
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:39,119
into flowering often the males will

853
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,038
they they become taller right before you

854
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,798
go into flowering and you can think of

855
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,798
that like an evolutionary trait kind of

856
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,879
like corn you know corn the tassel that

857
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,519
drops the pollen is at the top of the

858
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,200
plant right so when that pollen falls

859
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,918
it's falling towards the female

860
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,240
reproductive organs below

861
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,038
and so what cannabis does is it it

862
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,038
shoots up maybe an extra foot and so

863
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,240
that the male flowers

864
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,240
are

865
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,558
physically above their female

866
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,480
counterparts and when they open the male

867
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:10,398
flowers and the pollen falls down and

868
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,440
yeah it's caught by the wind but it's

869
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:15,119
still blowing slightly downward right so

870
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,278
it's an evolutionary advantage of for

871
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:19,119
the males to be slightly taller

872
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,119
and and also

873
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,839
that stretchiness that allows the male

874
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,479
to stretch out and become taller also

875
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,839
the same aspect happens to the flowers

876
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,480
and so

877
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,720
a tight floral cluster really becomes

878
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,038
much more loose and open with male

879
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,360
plants than the female counterparts and

880
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,798
that allows the the male

881
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,240
they kind of look like little grapes

882
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,158
when they come out of a male when they

883
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,880
come out of the

884
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,559
their pre-flower state and they drop and

885
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,720
open and that

886
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,558
that loose it's called a like a a

887
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,079
panicle and that loose

888
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,398
floral structure

889
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,240
it kind of gives freedom for the feet

890
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:57,759
for the male plants to swing around and

891
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,839
be captured by the

892
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:01,278
the wind which jostles them and releases

893
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:02,558
the pollen

894
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:05,278
when you

895
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:07,200
spray sts on a female plant

896
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,880
you'll notice that the plants don't look

897
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,798
like they like even though they're male

898
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,120
flowers rather than female flowers on

899
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:16,000
the plant the rest of the stature is

900
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,439
quite stocky and short and unlike a

901
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,798
natural male

902
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,798
so you might have to

903
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,759
you might have to break up the female

904
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:28,398
or the male flowers by hand for example

905
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:31,200
and to release the pollen

906
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,959
wow all right so um i've got a much

907
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,600
better understanding of how to use

908
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,360
silver thiosulfate to actually make the

909
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:40,158
feminized seeds and what my strategy

910
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:44,079
would look like before we start talking

911
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,399
about um accidental stress causing a

912
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:49,119
female plant to

913
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,918
produce male flowers that have pollen in

914
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:51,278
them

915
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,038
um you know

916
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:54,480
people have told me that oh there's

917
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,519
there's lots of different ways to make

918
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,759
feminized seeds but what you know in my

919
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,798
research i pretty much find there be

920
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:06,960
there is silver thiosulfate and then a

921
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:10,639
bunch of rumor so so is there another

922
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:14,319
scientifically reliable method to create

923
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,000
feminized seeds other than using sts

924
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,558
there yes there are other hormone

925
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,880
blockers sds works the best i think what

926
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,240
you're really referencing is

927
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,480
there's a couple of techniques one of

928
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,319
them was called rotalization which is

929
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,640
really not a good technique

930
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:31,200
and dutch passion who first

931
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,440
commercialized the feminized seeds also

932
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,640
used a pretty suspect technique when

933
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,159
creating

934
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,919
the first feminized seeds that really

935
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,159
led to feminized seeds having a bad

936
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,919
reputation

937
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,519
if you remember before i said like

938
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,399
begets like

939
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,919
um

940
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,759
and that all that means is that if you

941
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,519
take a plant then it has any given set

942
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,278
of traits those those traits are going

943
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,960
to be likely to be represented in the

944
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,119
offspring or more likely to be

945
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,480
represented in the offspring

946
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,398
and so the way that the initial

947
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,558
companies made these feminized seeds is

948
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:03,119
they took plants that would say normally

949
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,759
flower in eight to ten weeks and they

950
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,199
flowered them for 12 to 14 weeks and

951
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,320
when plants get

952
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,280
way

953
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,760
past

954
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,800
sexual maturity some of them

955
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,000
will start producing male flowers

956
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,599
and so

957
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,440
that those male flowers obviously you

958
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,079
can harvest that pollen and then also

959
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,480
use that pollen to create

960
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,879
new female seeds but the problem is is

961
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,719
that those plants

962
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:32,480
were you know some people would call

963
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,759
them unstable we i call them intersex so

964
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,838
remember at the beginning of the episode

965
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,159
we talked about diocese-ness versus

966
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,078
moniciousness where you either have

967
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,679
plants that have separate sexes on

968
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,480
separate plants

969
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,878
or

970
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,519
we have the other end of the spectrum as

971
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,759
both sexes on one plant and so i would

972
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,119
think of that like like a spectrum or a

973
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,839
continuum

974
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,879
where that one end we have

975
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:59,440
complete intersexuality or monitious

976
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,358
plants like hemp that are you know they

977
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,920
they produce many many male and many

978
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,679
many female flowers

979
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,358
and that doesn't matter because we you

980
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:08,879
know with hemp we want it to be seeded

981
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:11,358
usually they're harvesting the seeds to

982
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,358
be sold

983
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,400
but that trait in in a drug cannabis

984
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:18,159
plant is really not a good

985
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,920
characteristic because

986
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,598
you can have a plant spontaneously

987
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,440
produce male flowers and pollinate the

988
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,240
entire crop or at least that region of

989
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,800
your greenhouse or grow room and

990
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:30,399
that really obviously devalues the

991
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,160
the selling price of the cannabis if

992
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,358
it's full of seed

993
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,199
um

994
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:36,719
so

995
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,399
what these dutch companies are

996
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,919
prominently dutch companies did is they

997
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,519
used plants that would naturally produce

998
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,760
this is this to keep in mind this is

999
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:48,320
before people realize that you could use

1000
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,000
silver thiosulfate and so

1001
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,920
these plant breeders would harvest the

1002
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,320
pollen from these intersex plants and

1003
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,039
use that to fertilize their fema their

1004
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,838
females or to pollinate their females

1005
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:59,920
and

1006
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:03,920
those plants would then inherit that

1007
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,720
intersex or hermaphrodite characteristic

1008
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,480
um

1009
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,480
and so the first feminized seeds that

1010
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,960
were available on the market we had a

1011
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,440
lot of reports of

1012
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,679
of you know hermes or more appropriately

1013
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,599
intersex plants in the in this in the

1014
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:19,279
seed lots and i think that that's one of

1015
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,800
the real reasons that feminized seeds

1016
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,119
kind of have a bad reputation on the

1017
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,800
market is because those

1018
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,838
early lessons they left a deep

1019
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,839
impression in the culture

1020
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,358
and and the truth is when you're taking

1021
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,440
a plant and you're selfing it you're

1022
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:35,759
reinforcing any characteristic that is

1023
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,679
it within the plant so if your if your

1024
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,119
chosen mother plant has a slight

1025
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:42,078
tendency

1026
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:45,519
to be intersex or to go intersex you

1027
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,200
know on a on a given set of stresses ph

1028
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,719
life cycle

1029
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:50,719
you know what it whatever it is

1030
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,400
those stresses are likely to create a

1031
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,240
trigger right to induce those male

1032
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,559
flowers to appear

1033
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,919
and uh you really don't want to use when

1034
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,320
you're when you're solving a plant you

1035
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,599
don't want to reinforce that type of

1036
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,079
trait

1037
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,359
wow yeah totally and so this is so

1038
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,760
interesting because this actually

1039
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,920
answers my next question i was gonna go

1040
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,599
to because as as we know

1041
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,119
um some

1042
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:22,960
cultivars when you put them under stress

1043
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,599
um they will throw male flowers and

1044
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,000
you know that for most of us that's a

1045
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,920
negative uh happenstance we don't want

1046
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,039
our our female plants to throw male

1047
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,039
flowers

1048
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,679
um but then but then some people are

1049
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,440
like oh sweet you know i was hoping to

1050
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:38,159
get these flowers

1051
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,760
to

1052
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:44,639
to smoke um but but now they're

1053
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,320
feminized seeds so now they've got this

1054
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,279
different value and i was going to ask

1055
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,079
you are those feminized seeds you know

1056
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,599
equally as valuable as the kind that we

1057
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,920
make using

1058
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,559
uh sts and i think the answer would be

1059
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,480
no is because they're much less valuable

1060
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,078
but much less stable and they're gonna

1061
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,519
they're gonna include that likelihood

1062
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,599
that they will

1063
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,838
her me or go intersex on you if it gets

1064
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,838
any kind of stress

1065
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:12,239
maybe not even a lot of stress

1066
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:14,400
yeah and you know again

1067
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,078
i think the argument could be made that

1068
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,200
for a plant breeder

1069
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,680
maybe using an sts technique or or that

1070
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,279
type of pollination technique

1071
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,118
is actually a good way to remove the

1072
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,480
intersex plants because if you you know

1073
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,880
if you took a plant that had slight

1074
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,119
intersex tendencies and you salt it and

1075
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,960
you grow the next generation

1076
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,760
any of the plants in the next generation

1077
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,440
that don't have that tendency

1078
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,839
you know it's possible that those plants

1079
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,200
have have removed that given trait from

1080
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:42,719
the mother plant

1081
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,159
so you know

1082
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,118
again in plant breeding there's no

1083
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,719
hardened set rules but you definitely

1084
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,720
don't want to be releasing seeds like

1085
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,480
that onto the marketplace where a grower

1086
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,078
is get then going to grow them

1087
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,559
expecting that they're all going to be

1088
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,160
100 female yeah and that's that's one of

1089
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,480
the challenges too right with the seed

1090
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,960
market as it is right now it's so easy

1091
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,199
for people to make money selling seeds

1092
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,838
that you know you get folks that they

1093
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:09,838
they they take their their their you

1094
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:11,679
know favorite strain and they hit it to

1095
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,400
a bunch of hype strains and then they

1096
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,480
put the seeds out whereas you know more

1097
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,800
of the breeders that i respect they're

1098
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,280
actually going to work

1099
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,320
that seed group to

1100
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,280
to you know stress them and pull those

1101
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,119
out so those traits are less likely to

1102
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,680
exist and i think that's probably the

1103
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,880
real big difference between

1104
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:37,358
you know pollen chuckers and and people

1105
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,920
who i give like that you know

1106
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:42,639
the capital b breeder to is whether or

1107
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,720
not they put that extra effort in to

1108
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:46,639
really stabilize and pull out a lot of

1109
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,319
those unwanted traits

1110
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,319
yeah well and that's you know that's

1111
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,760
just something that again because of the

1112
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,400
you know plant breeding is typically

1113
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,760
done by nerds and greenhouses it's not

1114
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,920
it's not really a celebrity

1115
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,000
um seeking

1116
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,838
kind of job but it's for some reason in

1117
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,880
cannabis it is right

1118
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:06,239
um

1119
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,160
and that that's kind of a weird little

1120
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:08,959
commentary on on the cannabis industry

1121
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:10,799
but

1122
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,318
you know in in the real plant breeding

1123
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,760
world

1124
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:16,239
as much as

1125
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,560
75 percent or maybe even 90

1126
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:21,118
of the crosses that you make

1127
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:23,440
don't aren't they're not successes

1128
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,760
right or they're not the the ideal with

1129
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,200
plant breeding really in my mind should

1130
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,520
be well i guess there's different goals

1131
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:32,239
in plant breeding like you said one goal

1132
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,639
might be to replicate the breeders

1133
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,479
idiot type or the ideal expression or

1134
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,400
the breeder's opinion of what that

1135
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,639
ideal expression is and you want to

1136
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,160
capture that in the seed

1137
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:43,920
right but

1138
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,078
there's different you know you might

1139
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,639
have an ideal plant like

1140
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,720
i don't know let's just choose one

1141
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,719
the girl scout cookies for example i

1142
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,559
mean it's a great plant it's super it's

1143
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:55,919
a variety

1144
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,759
it's it's

1145
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,599
really high thc content it's got a

1146
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,440
lovely flavor profile but it's not very

1147
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,359
big so you might want to breed that

1148
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,960
plant to produce about twice as much as

1149
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,679
it does

1150
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,039
and that takes time and effort and a lot

1151
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,598
of crosses

1152
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,480
and experimentation and realistically 90

1153
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,599
of those

1154
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,039
uh those those breeding experiments are

1155
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,800
going to be dead ends they're not going

1156
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,358
to lead to that

1157
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,200
next generation or what we would call an

1158
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:24,880
elite plant where

1159
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,598
you know you're you're raising the

1160
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,920
quality to the to the to the producer

1161
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,318
not only the consumer

1162
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,639
right it it produces more it's more mold

1163
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:37,279
resistant whatever whatever the the fix

1164
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:39,199
is for that particular line

1165
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,800
so before we go to our first commercial

1166
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:43,759
break i want to go on a quick little

1167
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:47,680
fishing expedition with you um

1168
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:50,000
so at uh last emerald cup um i was uh i

1169
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,919
was hanging out in the dragonfly earth

1170
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,039
medicine tent and they were talking

1171
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,079
about how

1172
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,679
um on their farm up in canada they make

1173
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,760
they have some plants that produce

1174
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,078
female-only seeds

1175
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,680
without sts because they were saying at

1176
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,079
the time that they're they're not fans

1177
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,639
of using that chemical uh for whatever

1178
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,160
reason and and i'm all like so so how do

1179
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,440
you have

1180
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,719
female

1181
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:18,159
seeds naturally coming off a plant and

1182
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:19,279
they said that their best guess is that

1183
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,399
they

1184
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,160
heavily

1185
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,119
green mulch

1186
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,719
with

1187
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,480
nettle

1188
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,358
which is high

1189
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,119
in

1190
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:34,239
hormones and that when this plant breaks

1191
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,358
down and it gets watered in

1192
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:40,239
that

1193
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:40,239
at the very least the lower branches

1194
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,480
self-pollinate i guess is the idea and

1195
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,400
and and then the the plant produces

1196
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,639
only female

1197
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,720
um seeds so

1198
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,719
i'm curious to know does this does this

1199
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:59,039
hit any triggers and and and i want to

1200
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:01,519
apologize in advance to dragonfly if i

1201
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:02,880
if i screwed up their story um because

1202
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:05,119
maybe maybe they don't produce male

1203
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,039
flowers maybe the seeds just come out as

1204
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,680
female but but i guess

1205
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:12,239
the point i'm trying to ask about is is

1206
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:15,039
there a way that adding hormones to the

1207
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:20,719
root structure should um

1208
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:21,759
to change the the gender of the seeds

1209
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:24,559
um

1210
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,079
i love josh and kelly

1211
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,000
they're they're great really super nice

1212
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,318
people but as a scientist i kind of that

1213
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,239
that does trigger me a little bit

1214
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,559
um yeah i don't think that that's i

1215
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,639
don't think that's likely i mean

1216
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:39,119
it's a it's we we have listen in the in

1217
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,799
the cannabis industry we have this um

1218
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,960
long history of

1219
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,880
speculating and

1220
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,720
coming up with really lavish ideas i

1221
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,200
mean you know people were driving stakes

1222
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:50,879
through the stems of plants and stuff

1223
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,799
30 years ago to try and increase the

1224
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,800
resin content we've humans have done all

1225
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,839
sorts of crazy things

1226
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,440
um but i i think that scientifically

1227
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:01,679
there'd be there's a pretty big gap

1228
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,838
between saying if we put these

1229
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,519
hormones on the root system they get

1230
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,358
absorbed by the plant and they only have

1231
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:10,079
an effect within

1232
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:11,440
you know however far of the of the of

1233
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,599
the root zone

1234
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,159
well that that's too bad ryan you know

1235
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,880
because i really like the idea of us

1236
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:19,679
being able to make feminized seeds in a

1237
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,838
more

1238
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:24,239
you know natural way than using the

1239
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:26,000
chemical right i really liked that idea

1240
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:27,759
and um and

1241
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,760
i'm disappointed

1242
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,520
we can do that right and the way that we

1243
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,880
do that is is like i said the way those

1244
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:35,599
early dutch seed producers the

1245
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,119
rotalization style yeah yeah and those

1246
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,880
you know what there's hemp lines that

1247
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,760
also produce that there's a

1248
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,079
there's a

1249
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,160
a hemp breeder who's now passed but it

1250
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,480
was a hungarian hemp breeder named ivan

1251
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,440
boshka and he came up with what he

1252
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,880
called a unisex line

1253
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,119
that produced

1254
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,760
nearly all female plants we're talking

1255
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,559
you know 990 out of a thousand kind of

1256
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,960
thing

1257
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:01,519
um and he had this method for going and

1258
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,679
selecting intersex plants but only the

1259
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:06,318
very right intersex plants like he had a

1260
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:08,078
subset of plants that that he chose and

1261
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,079
when you use those plants to breed with

1262
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,440
regular female plants

1263
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,039
they were

1264
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,838
they were you know

1265
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:18,159
air quote gyno gynoisia seeds they're

1266
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,679
all female seeds they weren't all female

1267
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,199
seeds they were feminized seeds with a

1268
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,919
small percentage of

1269
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:26,799
intersex plants um so you can do that

1270
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,800
stuff naturally

1271
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:31,118
you know i don't think that we need to

1272
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,519
be scared of chemicals like

1273
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,760
silver nitrate i mean we we feed all

1274
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:37,519
sorts of nitrates to our plants

1275
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,880
as food it's just silver and nitrogen

1276
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:40,639
and oxygen

1277
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,559
um

1278
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,400
and i you know i think if you're careful

1279
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,799
with it you don't spray it on yourself

1280
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,599
there's really very very very lit

1281
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,880
minimal risk associated with doing that

1282
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,960
but i think it's more of a lifestyle

1283
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,960
choice to say hey we're gonna

1284
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,318
we're not gonna use chemicals like that

1285
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,400
but i think that the the trade-off

1286
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,920
if we're truly looking for plants that

1287
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,519
are

1288
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,760
sexually stable and aren't going to

1289
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:08,318
throw intersex plants we're better to

1290
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,000
rely on the chemicals rather than going

1291
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:12,159
and selecting four plants that are

1292
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
likely to produce pollen under any given

1293
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:16,318
number of triggers be it low light

1294
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,159
conditions or like we said before

1295
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:23,039
ph or certain feeding regimens right

1296
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,358
so um i would not i would not do it that

1297
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:28,480
way right let me i want to push one more

1298
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:31,838
on the on the silver thiosulfate is this

1299
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,599
is is this does uh this occur in nature

1300
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:36,719
like is it a is it an

1301
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,640
a man-made chemical or or are we just

1302
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,639
taking something in nature and applying

1303
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:44,318
it to the plant uh what i'm getting at

1304
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,759
is i'm trying to understand for myself

1305
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:48,559
you know i mean certainly it's not

1306
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,240
something as far out as like genetically

1307
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:51,599
modified organisms we're not we're not

1308
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,000
doing you know

1309
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,838
like you know genetic line changes or

1310
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,318
anything we're we're at we're we're

1311
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:00,559
pushing the plant to to do something

1312
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,639
with a chemical and many chemicals are

1313
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:05,838
natural i'm trying to decide how

1314
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:08,639
unnatural if you will using sts is i

1315
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:10,960
mean is this is this a bastardization of

1316
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,960
nature or or is this just a a cool

1317
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,039
natural trick i don't think it's a

1318
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,400
bastardization of nature but also keep

1319
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:19,519
in mind that i'm

1320
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,000
you know i i am pro responsible use of

1321
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,599
genetic modifications because you know

1322
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,440
technology you've heard me say this

1323
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,440
before at the emerald cup but you know

1324
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,599
technologies like tailin and crispr are

1325
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,079
going to change they they are changing

1326
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,760
the face of plant breeding and allowing

1327
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,119
us to do things that we could never have

1328
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,480
done in the past

1329
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:40,800
you know in terms of our gynuitius seeds

1330
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,960
natural absolutely not

1331
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,039
you know there's no all-female seeds in

1332
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,159
nature there's there's monowish's seeds

1333
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:47,599
which are

1334
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,838
i think it's important to say again here

1335
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,359
monoisha seeds they're really all female

1336
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:55,519
seeds but that have an intersex trait so

1337
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:57,920
if you look at them genetically

1338
00:47:55,519 --> 00:48:00,639
um they don't have y chromosomes but

1339
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:03,039
they're heavily intersex plants right so

1340
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:05,440
technically you know on a genetic level

1341
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,039
they're they are female plants

1342
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,519
are all female plants but they're all

1343
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:11,440
female and intersex which makes them

1344
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,440
phenotypically monitors

1345
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,358
right

1346
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,358
so yeah if you want to be

1347
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,319
hippie-minded and only doing things that

1348
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,318
are found without the help of man

1349
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,079
feminized seeds are not for you

1350
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,400
right on that is very interesting and

1351
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,640
i'm super grateful to kelly for you know

1352
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,240
uh suggesting this possibility in the

1353
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,239
tent so that i could go down this path i

1354
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:36,159
mean hell here we are we're like a year

1355
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:38,078
later and i'm still i'm still talking

1356
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,920
about it because um it's such an

1357
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,839
interesting idea um all right well we've

1358
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,559
had a super long first set let's go

1359
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:46,318
ahead and and take our first short break

1360
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,079
and be right back you're listening to

1361
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:51,679
shaping fire and my guest today is

1362
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:53,359
cannabis biologist ryan lee

1363
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,719
while i love growing under the sun

1364
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:56,719
there's a lot of good reasons to grow

1365
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,399
indoors and if you're like most folks

1366
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:00,159
you want a lighting source that grows

1367
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,880
high yielding healthy plants without

1368
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:04,879
using excessive amounts of electricity

1369
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,640
bios lighting creates biological

1370
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,720
lighting solutions that brings the

1371
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:10,159
natural brilliance of the outdoors into

1372
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:12,239
your grow room

1373
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,920
bios lighting has the attributes that i

1374
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:14,879
look for in a horticultural lighting

1375
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,720
solution

1376
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,240
i've bought those cheap lights online

1377
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:22,159
and they're difficult to work with and

1378
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:24,159
fail in no time in contrast my bios led

1379
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:27,519
light is industrial grade to last a long

1380
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:29,838
time it is ip66 wet rated so little

1381
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:31,920
foliar overspray won't harm it it is

1382
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:34,000
easy to clean without taking it down and

1383
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,318
of course the most important aspect it

1384
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,800
is built for the exact light spectrum i

1385
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:40,558
want for great yielding healthy cannabis

1386
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,119
plants and it doesn't hurt that their

1387
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,359
lighting rigs look badass too

1388
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,960
many horticultural led lighting systems

1389
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:48,960
are based on irrelevant performance

1390
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,358
metrics and people love to argue online

1391
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,679
about these numbers i prefer to judge on

1392
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:56,239
par photon efficiency and how happy my

1393
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:58,558
plants are and the bios lights exceed my

1394
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:00,879
expectations in these categories

1395
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,200
bios lights have an optimized broad

1396
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,440
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis

1397
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:08,159
and plant growth while also providing

1398
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,000
the ideal conditions for superior par

1399
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,399
efficacy and a comfortable visual

1400
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,199
experience i also love their attentive

1401
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,440
and over-educated customer service folks

1402
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:19,358
bios starts with a team of biologists

1403
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,440
before getting the electrical engineers

1404
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:23,759
involved they have studied how light

1405
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,318
impacts cannabis plants and devised an

1406
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,760
overall strategy that works i encourage

1407
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:31,039

1417
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:54,400
that you are very particular about the

1418

inputs you use for growing

1419
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,880
people like us painstakingly

1420
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,358
self-educate on cannabis nutrients and

1421
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,559
techniques so we can cultivate the best

1422
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:06,000
tasting and cleanest flowers possible

1423
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,000
and when we go to purchase those

1424
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,239
nutrients we want to be sure that our

1425
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,719
supplier shares our values and is

1426
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,679

1440
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,480
available he goes deep to personally vet

1441

each product for quality and determine

1442
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,559
that there isn't a better version of the

1465
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,318
for years organic cultivators have been

1466
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,719
looking for a replacement for using peat

1467
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:46,558
moss peat moss has long been the go-to

1468
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,639
soil amendment for water retention and

1469
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,880
container growing but organic growers

1470
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:52,879
know that peat moss is an unsustainable

1471
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,559
resource and the mining of peat bogs

1472
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,960
destroys habitat and releases

1473
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,880
sequestered carbon but peat moss works

1474
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,559
so well that many have continued to use

1475
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,720
it but now there's finally a

1476
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,720
revolutionary replacement for peat moss

1477
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:06,239
that shares the same benefits while also

1478
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:09,279
being sustainable

1479
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:11,279
pit moss sounds an axe like peat moss

1480
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,280
but instead of being mined from fragile

1481
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,079
ecosystems it actually is made from

1482
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,000
upcycled organic paper and tree bark pit

1483
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,839
moss is excellent at retaining water in

1484
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,679
your substrate and creating air pockets

1485
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:24,558
and tiny living environments for

1486
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:27,118
microbes pit moss instantly increases

1487
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,720
aeration nutrient absorption and water

1488
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,039
conservation too

1489
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:32,959
carefully and locally sourced pit moss

1490
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:35,838
is the result of decades-long research

1491
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,159
into the use of recycled paper fibers

1492
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:40,799
pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat

1493
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:43,440
moss and handles exactly the same and

1494
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,280
like peat moss pit moss is inert so it

1495
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,119
won't change your ph

1496
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,440
available in a range of preparations

1497
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:52,318
including a nutrient enhanced blend a

1498
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,960

welcome back you are listening to

1508
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,480
shaping fire i'm your host shango los

1509
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,480
and our guest this week is cannabis

1510
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,480
biologist ryan lee

1511
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,760
so in the second set we're going to talk

1512
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,920
a lot more about feminized seed myths

1513
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,480
and and and figure out which ones might

1514
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,720
hold some water and which ones are just

1515
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,800
are just you know holdovers from the

1516
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:35,118
early days of feminized seeds when when

1517
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,599
they were made with rotalization so so

1518
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,559
ryan we talked a little bit already

1519
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,680
about

1520
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:43,839
um

1521
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:47,679
about how poorly tested seeds

1522
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:47,679
poorly tested feminized seeds

1523
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:53,039
can

1524
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,319
you know go intersex when put under

1525
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:57,039
stresses

1526
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:59,119
and you know really high-end i'm not

1527
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:03,039
even really high-end like properly made

1528
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:05,920
feminized seeds don't do that and so i

1529
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:08,400
guess my question for you is is is if

1530
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,880
the goal when making feminized seeds is

1531
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,680
that there are not going to be males and

1532
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,798
that

1533
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,838
they will not be throwing male botanical

1534
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:18,639
parts

1535
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:20,480
what can we do when producing feminized

1536
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:22,000
seeds so that doesn't happen because you

1537
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,679
know we have to cop to the fact that

1538
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,400
sometimes that does happen i mean we see

1539
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:28,078
the pictures on instagram but the idea

1540
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,559
to say yeah that was it that's an

1541
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:33,359
untested plant that's a good position to

1542
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,880
take but then what's that testing look

1543
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:39,598
like so that you're not making feminized

1544
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,200
seeds that crack under stress

1545
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,240
yeah so i mean there's all these

1546
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:46,480
conditions that under which even regular

1547
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:48,000
cannabis females that are created

1548
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,039
through regular matings with males and

1549
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,798
females

1550
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:53,358
they also throw intersect what we call

1551
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:55,679
intersex characteristics or you know as

1552
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:58,318
they're colloquial colloquially sorry

1553
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,480
colloquially known as

1554
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:01,358
uh hermes which is really not a very

1555
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,920
good

1556
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,880
description for them but these intersex

1557
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,880
plants

1558
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,640
they they pop up occasionally it's just

1559
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,480
a factor of cannabis it's part of the

1560
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:13,039
cannabis genome

1561
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,880
um and it's present to to a degree or

1562
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:18,159
less in in different in different

1563
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,039
cultivars and different varieties

1564
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:21,358
so

1565
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:24,159
typically what you do is is you if you

1566
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:26,400
take if you expect a plant is going to

1567
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:29,679
go undergo this

1568
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,838
stress phenotype of intersexuality

1569
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:34,798
you expose it to those conditions that

1570
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:37,679
might under that that might trigger this

1571
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:39,039
that intersexuality to come about so you

1572
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:41,118
know if you flick the lights in the

1573
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:42,960
middle of the night and um give them

1574
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,798
periods of inter or you essentially

1575
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,838
interrupt their dark period

1576
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:51,039
that can sometimes cause uh stress

1577
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:53,119
and in some plants will become intersex

1578
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:55,119
and some plants won't well the ones that

1579
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:57,358
become intersex they're probably not

1580
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,119
good breeding candidates because they're

1581
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:01,440
going to be triggered by

1582
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:04,318
you know light interruption the plants

1583
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,159
that are resistant to becoming intersex

1584
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:09,039
and those in that condition they might

1585
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,318
be a better candidate to be part of a

1586
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:12,960
female

1587
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:15,920
female female breeding program

1588
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,679
um and so same goes for you know

1589
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,920
temperature fluctuations or ph

1590
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:21,199
fluctuations in the root zone and a lot

1591
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,280
of these

1592
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:24,798
stresses that might trigger again we

1593
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,119
look for the plants that are triggered

1594
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:29,358
and we select against those plants using

1595
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:32,000
the principle of like begets like you

1596
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:33,598
know anything that that has that trigger

1597
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,440
we want to remove those plants from our

1598
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:38,240
breeding population so that those traits

1599
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,559
aren't passed on

1600
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:43,279
and i think that any really any plant

1601
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:45,200
that is made to

1602
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,359
be part of a female breeding program or

1603
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:49,439
a self that that those seeds should be

1604
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:51,119
examined before they're sold you know

1605
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,400
they should be grown out by the breeder

1606
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,079
and and

1607
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,838
and confirm that they don't have

1608
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,440
intersexuality that's one of the things

1609
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:59,679
that we do when we

1610
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,240
especially when we use self seeds

1611
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:03,919
is you're not just giving you know

1612
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:05,919
when you use a regular breeding program

1613
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,159
and you take a plant that might have a

1614
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,519
an iffy characteristic it's 50 50

1615
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:11,039
whether that characteristic is going to

1616
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,719
get passed on

1617
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:14,880
because it's you know

1618
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:16,639
there's there's pollen there's genetic

1619
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,160
contributions coming from another

1620
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:20,159
individual which is also going to

1621
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:23,598
influence the progeny but when you're

1622
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:26,879
selfing seeds or yourselfing plants

1623
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,480
those resulting seed lines

1624
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,920
they kind of get a double dose of

1625
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:33,679
whatever good or whatever bad traits

1626
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,760
the the plant might hold and so we

1627
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:38,000
really have to go through and do a

1628
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,160
subsequent screen and make sure that

1629
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,679
that plant isn't passing on bad

1630
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:44,078
characteristics

1631
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:47,358
when you're doing your breeding programs

1632
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:49,599
um what do you choose to do to the

1633
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:51,679
plants to stress them out like you know

1634
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:54,480
it's it's it's it's funny to hear people

1635
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:56,879
joke on instagram about the the crazy

1636
00:58:54,480 --> 00:59:00,318
obstacles and torture they put their

1637
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:02,480
plants under um to try to weed out the

1638
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:05,119
strongest plants but so far you've

1639
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:08,079
mentioned interruption of light cycle

1640
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,640
and temperature swings in the root zone

1641
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:13,440
so other than that what other you know

1642
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:15,759
trials would you put plants through

1643
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:20,159
to make sure that when they're under

1644
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:22,000
stress they're not going to go intersex

1645
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:23,279
well i mean just normal grow room

1646
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,280
stresses

1647
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,880
the problem is is that you know i try to

1648
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,640
i try to create an environment that the

1649
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,318
plants are going to grow in for the

1650
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:32,159
breeding you really want to select the

1651
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:34,000
plants under the same environments that

1652
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:36,719
they're going to be growing in

1653
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,639
and so yeah you can torture plants and i

1654
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:41,519
i expect that there's a certain degree

1655
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:44,879
of torture that plants do go through

1656
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:47,119
being grown in home gardens by

1657
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,640
inexperienced growners growers in little

1658
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,838
tents and stuff

1659
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:51,838
um

1660
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:54,078
you can't you i mean i guess you can try

1661
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:56,239
to build a bulletproof plant but really

1662
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:57,760
i just do selections in greenhouses and

1663
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:01,639
expose them to the normal everyday

1664
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,640
stresses that they might get

1665
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,760
so it's kind of a it's kind of a i don't

1666
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,519
really don't torture test too much i

1667
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,119
mean our torture test is using the

1668
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:11,280
plants in production

1669
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,960
typically i don't use plants

1670
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,400
unless it's for a very small breeding

1671
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,480
program that doesn't become a commercial

1672
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,519
release you know something to do with

1673
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:21,599
like an obscure chemistry like thcv for

1674
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:22,559
example

1675
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,640
really

1676
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,559
a lot of the breeding becomes focused on

1677
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:28,400
plants that are

1678
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:31,040
accepted in the market accepted by the

1679
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,639
marketplace right so you want to take

1680
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:35,759
the blue dreams and the cookies of the

1681
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:37,519
world and the og's and make them better

1682
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,599
right um

1683
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:41,199
because i i think that all those plants

1684
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,519
you know we go through this kind of

1685
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:44,879
fashion thing with with cannabis

1686
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:46,639
you know one one plant that's

1687
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,240
fashionable one day

1688
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:49,358
seven years down the road nobody wants

1689
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:50,719
to smoke it

1690
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:52,159
but you know if you wait another seven

1691
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:54,318
years it's like bell bottoms they'll

1692
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:56,399
come back

1693
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:59,039
well in addition to the you know the

1694
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:02,000
belief that feminized seeds are more

1695
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:04,719
likely to go intersex uh another

1696
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,838
uh belief of folks is that that

1697
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:10,719
feminized seeds are less vigorous or

1698
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:12,798
produce plants that are smaller in size

1699
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:15,838
and you know i have produced smaller

1700
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:18,079
plants from feminized seeds i've also

1701
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:20,078
produced monster plants from feminized

1702
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:23,519
seeds and i've kind of put that more on

1703
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:25,920
me and my inconsistent growing so from

1704
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:28,239
the scientific background are feminized

1705
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:31,039
seeds less vigorous or smaller in size

1706
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:32,558
than a true reg seed well no they don't

1707
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:35,358
have to be because again you could make

1708
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:38,319
an f1 hybrid feminized seedline by

1709
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:40,400
taking two stable true breeding uh

1710
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:42,880
females and crossing them together

1711
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,480
right and so the plant would be

1712
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,920
that you know that plant would be an f1

1713
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,318
hybrid so that's you know those are

1714
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,480
typically very high very high in vigor

1715
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:53,679
um selfing though

1716
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:56,000
again it it we get a double dose of any

1717
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:57,679
trace any any you have an opportunity to

1718
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,838
get a double dose of any traits that are

1719
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:01,038
in the parent plant and so any plants

1720
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:03,679
that are for

1721
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:05,520
diminion of stature they kind of yeah we

1722
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:07,440
do see and sell seeds that you have this

1723
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:08,880
wide range of

1724
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,480
of plants that you know some that are

1725
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,480
very vigorous some that might not be so

1726
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,838
vigorous some that are very small with

1727
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,000
tiny leaves

1728
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:18,239
and some that are normal looking and

1729
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,559
that's part of the breeder's goal is to

1730
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:23,439
select for or against those traits

1731
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,720
depending on what the uh the end goal is

1732
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,400
but that has nothing to do with the

1733
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:28,078
actual fact that they're female seeds

1734
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,119
that that's just like straight-up

1735
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,880
breeding

1736
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,880
yeah and i think that that's really

1737
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,720
maybe one of the most important

1738
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,640
take-homes that we can that people can

1739
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:38,000
have coming out of this conversation is

1740
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:39,759
that

1741
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,358
you know what what happened so when

1742
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,880
people started selfing seeds they would

1743
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:44,318
take these plants and they'd spray them

1744
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,318
with sts and then they would grow the

1745
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:48,960
resulting s1 seeds

1746
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:50,960
and maybe 50 of the plants were smaller

1747
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,559
50 of the plants were intersex like we

1748
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,838
were saying before

1749
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,798
you know

1750
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:58,880
and the assumption is oh well i use this

1751
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:00,798
new breeding technique that's probably

1752
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,119
what caused the problem whereas the

1753
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:04,239
truth is is that that the breeding

1754
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,318
technique

1755
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:08,399
exposed a genetic weakness that was

1756
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:10,239
unseen in the plant

1757
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,760
right and we have to be able to tease

1758
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:13,759
apart

1759
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,760
the cause of the

1760
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,359
the cause and effect of the consequences

1761
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,000
that we're seeing right like was it

1762
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:21,920
really the sts that we sprayed on the

1763
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,119
plant that made the plants in the next

1764
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,920
generation

1765
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:27,599
subpar or maybe it was those plants that

1766
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,440
were generated

1767
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,280
they just inherited inherited some

1768
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,159
subpar genetics that were buried in the

1769
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:37,440
plant which is not only possible that's

1770
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:41,038
in fact what we expect from selfie

1771
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:43,519
um outcrossing species like cannabis

1772
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:46,240
and in some ways it's it can be seen as

1773
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:48,880
an attractive attribute because if you

1774
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:51,279
are a serious breeder and you really

1775
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,440
want to pull all of these less than

1776
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,599
attractive attributes out

1777
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,679
well you know

1778
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:59,359
creating feminized seeds and being able

1779
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:00,399
to see all of the stuff that's actually

1780
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:02,159
a win

1781
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,798
if you don't want to put out stuff with

1782
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:06,558
this these attributes hidden

1783
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:08,159
yeah it might be a condition that you

1784
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,440
know for example

1785
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:11,519
you know there's some plants that if you

1786
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,599
cross a white flower with a p with a red

1787
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,159
flower you get a pink flower but when

1788
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:18,720
you try to breed that pink flower the

1789
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:20,000
next generation produces 25 white

1790
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:23,759
flowers

1791
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:27,199
25 red flowers and 50 pink flowers right

1792
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:29,680
so it's like you the if you want to have

1793
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:31,358
all of the flowers come out pink you

1794
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:33,199
have to cross the

1795
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:34,880
the red and the white types together to

1796
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:36,318
get pink well you might not like the red

1797
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,680
of the white types

1798
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:41,358
right but they become an e a means to an

1799
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:44,399
end for example

1800
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:46,558
um and a lot of these traits that we see

1801
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:49,440
as favorable in

1802
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:51,200
uh elite cannabis plants are are as a

1803
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,880
result of

1804
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:55,199
what we call heterosis which is a

1805
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:58,240
condition where the plant has two

1806
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:59,519
separate chromosomes um from from

1807
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:00,318
diverse

1808
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:02,318
and

1809
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:04,719
disparate parents that are very

1810
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:06,798
genetically unrelated and so you kind of

1811
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:08,798
have to go to the ugly before you can

1812
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:11,119
breed the beautiful right it's like one

1813
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:13,119
is one is a means to the other

1814
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,640
and uh they they kind of exist in a

1815
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:16,559
balance you can't have one without the

1816
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:19,440
other that's like dying to be a meme

1817
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:22,640
dude you have to go with the ugly before

1818
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:25,440
you can breed the beautiful

1819
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:28,318
in a way it's true right we don't

1820
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,760
i don't know it's uh

1821
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:31,038
i don't know there's all these cross

1822
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,480
analogies that we could use but when you

1823
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,880
start talking about breeding humans

1824
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,639
people get upset about it so yeah well

1825
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,000
let's just let's move it right on from

1826
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:40,239
there but i do want to hit on something

1827
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,440
before we go to the next potential myth

1828
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:44,719
to bust um you know uh

1829
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,039
you came up to the point where you're

1830
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:49,199
talking about like you know you you take

1831
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,400
the pink flowered plant and then when

1832
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:53,358
you breed that

1833
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,119
you know only 25 of them or or some

1834
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:56,558
percentage are going to be the pink and

1835
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,440
then maybe the rest are going to be

1836
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,240
white

1837
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:03,200
um you know i don't know a lot about

1838
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:06,078
breeding myself at the at a fine you

1839
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:08,798
know level but i you know i have studied

1840
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,480
a little bit of genetic trait charts and

1841
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:13,038
how they're passed on

1842
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,838
and um do you have a book

1843
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:18,799
that you would recommend to people who

1844
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:21,519
have not studied this at the university

1845
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:23,440
level who are just like regular cannabis

1846
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,920
folk like i am

1847
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:29,119
that would be a good read that would

1848
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:32,400
would explain like the next level of

1849
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:35,838
cannabis breeding but without burying me

1850
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,920
in scientific you know jargon that i i

1851
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:39,038
may not have the education to you know

1852
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,039
follow

1853
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:42,720
yeah i mean it's an old one and it's not

1854
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,160
very advanced techniques it doesn't

1855
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,480
really discuss suffering or anything

1856
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:48,798
like that but rob clark's book on

1857
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,559
uh marijuana botany

1858
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:52,880
uh like is the propagation of

1859
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,798
distinctive cannabis marijuana botany is

1860
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,079
just an incredible it's it's a classic

1861
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:58,000
you know you can't

1862
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:00,318
even even though some parts of it are a

1863
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,318
little dated it's still like worth every

1864
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:04,480
for everybody to read

1865
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,838
yeah that one the only other one from

1866
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,719
the cannabis industry that i would

1867
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:10,798
really recommend is uh as

1868
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:12,480
um jorge cervantes marijuana

1869
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:14,719
horticulture it was a green book and i

1870
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,519
think they called it the the medical

1871
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:19,038
growers bible or something like that

1872
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:20,679
i actually wrote the breeding chapter

1873
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:23,760
for that back in

1874
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:24,639
2004 or 2005.

1875
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,880
um

1876
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:29,159
and i i tried to lay it out in a very

1877
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:32,640
simple

1878
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:33,598
goal-oriented way of breeding that

1879
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:35,598
you know

1880
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,119
it was i had hoped that it was easy for

1881
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,318
the consumer to understand and it was a

1882
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,640
little different

1883
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:42,960
than most um

1884
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:44,798
most breeding segments in these cannabis

1885
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,318
books had been presented in the past so

1886
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:48,960
that would be one worth checking out and

1887
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:51,599
then as as far as anything else

1888
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:54,159
and really trying to understand the

1889
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:56,400
the meiosis and the the genetic dance

1890
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:58,399
that goes on behind that's really the

1891
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,639
foundation of all plant breeding

1892
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,480
you know a plant breeding for dummies or

1893
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,480
genetics for dummies something like that

1894
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,639
is uh would be really

1895
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:09,280
great and they're you know 10 15 bucks

1896
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:11,118
online i'm sure people could find it

1897
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,720
yeah they give you a nice broad base

1898
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,240
it's not going to be cannabis specific

1899
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:15,838
but you're going to learn a lot from it

1900
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:18,559
yeah that makes sense i think that you'd

1901
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:20,000
learn more than you would from learning

1902
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,560
learning from a cannabis book to be

1903
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,560
perfectly honest more principles that

1904
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,480
really lay the foundation of the science

1905
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,480
of like you were talking about punnett

1906
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:29,519
squares and you know all that kind of

1907
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,039
stuff it really gives you a

1908
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,520
visualization

1909
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:35,439
yeah actually maybe maybe read the the

1910
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,520
breeding for dummies version of the book

1911
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:39,198
and then go read rob's book so you've

1912
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,279
got you already have a basket of

1913
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:44,238
knowledge with which to read rob's book

1914
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:46,560
when i i was very early in you know in

1915
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:48,399
my cannabis life when i read rob's book

1916
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,839
and it was like over my head i would

1917
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:51,519
probably actually do way better if i

1918
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:53,198
read it now yeah if you went back and

1919
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,319
you read it now you you'd get a lot of

1920
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:56,000
that out of it

1921
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,759
everybody has to remember too that was

1922
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,640
that book was written almost 40 years

1923
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:02,319
ago now it's 1981 it was published so

1924
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,239
it's not it's not going to be all full

1925
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:05,679
of stories of og and blue dream or

1926
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:07,678
cookies but

1927
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:09,039
it does really a beautiful job of

1928
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:11,279
talking about all the different land

1929
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:13,359
race varieties and it gets into some

1930
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:15,600
basic trait breeding

1931
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,679
it just across my mind i'm like 81 i

1932
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,520
mean wow that knowledge is as old as

1933
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:21,920
when i was listening to van halen that's

1934
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,480
a long ass time ago

1935
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:26,399
so uh so the the next belief about femme

1936
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:28,238
seeds i want to hit is you know a lot of

1937
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,639
people will say that feminized seeds may

1938
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,798
be great to grow for your own pleasure

1939
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:35,279
for your smoke or for your medicine

1940
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:37,359
and it's certainly great uh for patients

1941
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:39,279
because they don't have to deal with uh

1942
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:41,920
you know male plants because there's

1943
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:45,679
nothing quite as sad as a patient that's

1944
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:47,279
growing you know six plants for you know

1945
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:50,239
themselves medical and then they end up

1946
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:52,480
with four males oh that's so sad because

1947
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:54,718
not only are patients usually really

1948
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:56,319
emotionally attached to each plant but

1949
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,600
that really decreases the amount of

1950
01:09:56,319 --> 01:09:59,359
medicine you've got for your years so

1951
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,400
that's a drag but but a lot of people

1952
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:04,158
say that

1953
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:06,639
using feminized seeds to breed is a bad

1954
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:08,719
idea or so so since we've been talking a

1955
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,880
lot about cookies let's say like okay

1956
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:13,359
you know you get some girl scout cookies

1957
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:16,480
feminized seeds somebody would say yeah

1958
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:19,439
if you want to breed with cookies you

1959
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:21,039
need to go and pheno hunt

1960
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:24,079
you know some cookies seeds that are

1961
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:26,719
regular or get yourself a regular clone

1962
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:30,238
and breed with that you don't want to

1963
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:32,880
breed with the feminized seed because

1964
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:36,559
there is something at its very basis

1965
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:38,800
that is you know more easily corruptable

1966
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,120
than using regular seeds what are your

1967
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,400
thoughts yeah i think that's nonsense i

1968
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:43,519
think that that

1969
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:47,198
you know we try to look at it

1970
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:50,239
scientifically again if you look back

1971
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:51,678
there's that for me if a plant is good

1972
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:54,238
enough to use

1973
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:56,319
as a female breeder like if the plant is

1974
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:59,359
good enough for me as a breeder to say

1975
01:10:56,319 --> 01:11:02,000
okay this plant is is uniform it's

1976
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:03,198
stable it's it doesn't have intersex

1977
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,198
offspring

1978
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:07,039
it doesn't have go intersex when the

1979
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:10,158
lights get flicked on at night or the ph

1980
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:11,920
of the soil is too low i'm i'm confident

1981
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:13,679
that this plant is a reliable solid

1982
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,520
breeding candidate

1983
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:17,359
for me that plant is good enough to

1984
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,480
either be a pollen donor or a pollen

1985
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:22,158
recipient there's no difference

1986
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:24,479
but i think that a lot of people in the

1987
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:27,119
scene believe that

1988
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:29,919
the sts creates some kind of chromosomal

1989
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:31,519
unstability in fact i heard a a

1990
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,039
a plant breeder say that at the emerald

1991
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,719
cup last year

1992
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,319
and there's just no evidence that that

1993
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:38,319
happens i mean theoretically i guess

1994
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:41,279
it's possible that somehow the silver

1995
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:43,279
damages the dna but there's never been

1996
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:46,079
any kind of scientific confirmation that

1997
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:48,238
that happens and we got to remember that

1998
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:50,640
these techniques are used widely in

1999
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:53,678
other crops right that's like all your

2000
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:57,039
cucumbers are pretty much feminized or

2001
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:58,800
got gynoisious lots as well because

2002
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:01,519
it's not efficient for farmers to be

2003
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,760
growing acres and acres of plants when

2004
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,120
25 of the plants are

2005
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,800
are male and they're not going to

2006
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:09,840
produce cucumbers right like that's a

2007
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:12,560
huge waste of time and space

2008
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,159
um so if you're if you're a grower

2009
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,679
if you're a grower you want them to be

2010
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:18,000
you want to fill your plot with

2011
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:19,840
everything that you need

2012
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,198
i don't think that we've you know i

2013
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,880
don't think that people have been able

2014
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:24,960
to tease apart

2015
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,880
again it's like we said before how much

2016
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,679
of the the damage how much of the

2017
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:32,560
problem are we seeing is a result of a

2018
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:34,960
bad selection of a parental plant versus

2019
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:37,920
the breeding technique that was

2020
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:40,158
used to create that the the generation

2021
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:43,119
right yeah and for me i just don't

2022
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:44,399
believe i i haven't seen

2023
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:46,719
um

2024
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:47,759
enough detriment across the board to say

2025
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:49,439
yes

2026
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,039
i i think that this is a result of the

2027
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:53,039
technique and not the plants that were

2028
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:55,920
chosen i think that you can attribute

2029
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:57,920
all the negative consequences of selfing

2030
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,520
from genetic weaknesses that are

2031
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,719
contained within the plants themselves

2032
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,800
that were solved

2033
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:04,480
right on all right so last question

2034
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,640
before we go to our second break you

2035
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:08,879
know um i know this is going to be kind

2036
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,960
of a vague question so i'm going to need

2037
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:14,159
you to work with me here um but i want

2038
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:16,880
to ask you it because i see it so

2039
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:19,920
commonly just kind of thrown out there

2040
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:22,400
on cannabis forums by people who are

2041
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:25,520
hating on feminized seeds and they will

2042
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:28,399
say some version of you shouldn't use

2043
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:31,040
feminized seeds because growing or

2044
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:34,639
breeding with feminized seeds limits the

2045
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:38,319
size of the overall cannabis gene pool

2046
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:40,480
and it's bad for the future of cannabis

2047
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:41,279
as a whole

2048
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:43,119
yeah

2049
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:45,519
it's a funny statement

2050
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:47,119
and there is a there is a bit of a truth

2051
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,679
to it i wouldn't say that there's truth

2052
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:52,479
with it pertaining to feminized seeds

2053
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:56,480
everybody has to remember any seed or

2054
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:59,599
any child can only have two parents

2055
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:01,198
right so the the the act of taking two

2056
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,079
plants and putting them together or

2057
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:03,839
taking

2058
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:05,439
a thousand males or a thousand females

2059
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,279
and putting them together

2060
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:09,119
they both result in in the same

2061
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:10,479
consequence that every seed came from

2062
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:12,559
two parents

2063
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:14,238
right so if you're taking two female

2064
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:17,199
plants and mating them together or

2065
01:14:14,238 --> 01:14:19,198
you're taking one female plant and one

2066
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:20,719
male plant and mating them together

2067
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:22,399
you're still doing what i call a

2068
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:25,520
one-to-one mating

2069
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:27,359
right and so yes one-to-one matings

2070
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,960
create a genetic bottleneck you're

2071
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:32,000
narrowing

2072
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,198
the genetic possibilities that are being

2073
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,920
passed on

2074
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:37,119
um sometimes as a plant breeder you need

2075
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,039
to do that

2076
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:39,920
right because you do need to purge when

2077
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:42,560
you're when you're trying to create

2078
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,560
something new you have to remove all the

2079
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,320
traits that you don't want and sometimes

2080
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,320
the way you do that is by creating a

2081
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:50,399
tight bottleneck

2082
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:53,359
you can always take that bottleneck

2083
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:55,519
population and backcross it to

2084
01:14:53,359 --> 01:14:56,559
the more diverse family

2085
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,520
but

2086
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,840
i think trying to assign the blame of

2087
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:04,159
genetic bottlenecking to feminize seeds

2088
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,920
really isn't accurate because that's

2089
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:07,599
what plant breeders cannabis plant

2090
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,920
breeders have been doing

2091
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,679
since dawn memorial i mean essentially

2092
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,279
that's that's the goal right if we're

2093
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:16,158
trying to create

2094
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:18,800
consistency in our seeds so that when

2095
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:21,519
you plant the seed you get the plant

2096
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,440
you're ideally looking for

2097
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,760
that's actually what happens with then

2098
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:27,519
regular seeds as well it's it's a honing

2099
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,920
process it's like it's like sculpture

2100
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,320
it's removing the parts you don't want

2101
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,880
now now if everybody did that with all

2102
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:36,960
of cannabis at the same time

2103
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:40,000
well all right that that may limit the

2104
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:42,560
gene pool theoretically but since that's

2105
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,880
not actually what happens and we can

2106
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,520
always outcross

2107
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:50,159
the the realistic experience we have is

2108
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:52,239
not actually a decrease in the gene pool

2109
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:53,839
yeah i just i don't think i mean i i do

2110
01:15:52,238 --> 01:15:56,079
think that we do need to be careful with

2111
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:58,000
genetic preservation all crops are going

2112
01:15:56,079 --> 01:16:00,319
through this massive narrowing

2113
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,238
but i think um attributing it

2114
01:16:00,319 --> 01:16:04,399
attributing that problem solely to

2115
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:07,119
something with feminized seeds is a bit

2116
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:08,960
of a false like dichotomy right now fair

2117
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:10,479
enough all right so let's go ahead and

2118
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,640
take our last short break and be right

2119
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:15,039
back you are listening to shaping fire

2120
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:17,199
my guest today is canvas biologist ryan

2121
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:18,960
lee

2122
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:20,559
in times like these when so many

2123
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:23,039
cannabis companies are growing their

2124
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,440
flower in gigantic warehouses and fields

2125
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:27,519
using synthetic nutrients it is good to

2126
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:29,919
know that there are authentic california

2127
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,159
heritage growers using natural farming

2128
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,399
techniques and sunshine to cultivate

2129
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:35,839
cannabis flowers for you

2130
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:37,679
california has produced the best

2131
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:40,000
cannabis in the world for generations

2132
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:42,158
and the idea that massively scaled

2133
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,279
industrial cannabis production could

2134
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:47,920
produce the same quality as small batch

2135
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:49,198
lovingly cultivated flowers is just

2136
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,960
silly

2137
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:53,198
moon time medicinals is located in

2138
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,279
humboldt county on the lush south fork

2139
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:57,198
of the eel river watershed in the

2140
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:58,399
epicenter of the american cannabis

2141
01:16:57,198 --> 01:17:00,879
heartland

2142
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:03,679
moon time medicinals grows under bright

2143
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,359
california sun in greenhouses using only

2144
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:08,319
natural farming techniques like

2145
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:11,679
hugelkultur compost teas whole food

2146
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:13,439
fertilizers and fermented plant juices

2147
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:15,760
every part of their growing process

2148
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:18,399
plays its own part in nature and nothing

2149
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,880
synthetic is injected into the process

2150
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:23,039
the result is big beautiful cannabis

2151
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:25,760

01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:00,080
biologist ryan lee

2278
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:02,399
so ryan in this third set i am hoping

2279
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:05,920
that you can take us all down this path

2280
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:08,079
of female only breeding and honestly i

2281
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:10,158
do not know a lot about this i only have

2282
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:13,279
two friends that practice female only

2283
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:15,839
breeding but my god are they like

2284
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:19,198
excited about it and and they really

2285
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:21,679
find it as like kind of like uh being

2286
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:23,759
way more immediate and successful more

2287
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:25,920
quickly and i don't really understand

2288
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:28,400
why so i figure since we're doing a show

2289
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,158
all about uh female seeds and the

2290
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:32,238
producing of them the breeding with them

2291
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:34,079
let's go ahead and talk about female

2292
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:36,079
breeding and kind of you know bring

2293
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:37,920
everybody up to the state of the art so

2294
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:41,920
so why don't you start generally with

2295
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:44,399
just what is female only breeding

2296
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,480
well so really it's exactly what it

2297
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:48,799
sounds like it's it's breeding without

2298
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:51,519
using any male plants and

2299
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,440
it's a it's a breeding tool or technique

2300
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,760
that is really

2301
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:59,198
incredibly well suited to

2302
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:01,039
breeding specifically for drug cannabis

2303
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:03,359
when you're breeding because drug

2304
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:04,880
cannabis is the experience is so based

2305
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:08,158
on the chemistry of the plant really

2306
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:10,239
what we're doing is trying to create

2307
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:11,679
a a special chemistry both in the

2308
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:13,279
cannabinoids and the terpenes and

2309
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:15,359
terpenoids

2310
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:16,960
and all these other chemical chemicals

2311
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:19,198
that the plant produces

2312
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,560
to create a user

2313
01:23:19,198 --> 01:23:22,238
experience

2314
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,920
or a plant with the user experience that

2315
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:26,718
we find enjoyable

2316
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,880
and when we use traditional breeding

2317
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:31,679
techniques where we use a male cannabis

2318
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:33,279
plant and a female cannabis plant it's

2319
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,359
really easy to choose the female

2320
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:38,000
cannabis plant because we can use a

2321
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:40,559
laboratory or we can use our nose or the

2322
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,319
way that the the smoked flowers make us

2323
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,199
feel as a guide

2324
01:23:42,319 --> 01:23:45,599
to

2325
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:48,399
which individual female plant is the

2326
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:50,159
best or better than all the others where

2327
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:52,238
we can't do that with male plants

2328
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:54,158
because you don't smoke the female you

2329
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:56,158
don't smoke the flowers of the male

2330
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:57,599
plants the smell the male plants really

2331
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:00,158
don't produce

2332
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,079
a spokeable flower

2333
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:03,839
and because they don't produce a flower

2334
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:06,079
we can't or they're sorry a flower that

2335
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:08,480
produces a lot of resin glands

2336
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:10,238
we can't really use the same laboratory

2337
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:12,559
techniques that we use in the laboratory

2338
01:24:10,238 --> 01:24:14,000
i mean i suppose we could but

2339
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,120
it would only give you a little bit of a

2340
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,800
hint

2341
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:19,519
as what the plant would look like if it

2342
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:22,000
was a female plant whereas if we choose

2343
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:24,320
female plants based on their bud and

2344
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,639
their flower characteristics

2345
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:28,960
we can kind of do

2346
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:30,400
what i call positive selection on both

2347
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,960
sides of the cross

2348
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:34,960
we can find a pollen donor plant that

2349
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:37,359
has traits of interest and we can have a

2350
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,119
seed mother plant that has

2351
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:40,960
maybe the same traits of interest or

2352
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:42,639
different traits of interest

2353
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,880
and that way we're doing positive

2354
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:46,239
selection on both sides of the cross

2355
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,400
whereas if we were trying to breed a

2356
01:24:46,238 --> 01:24:50,000
male with a female we could you know we

2357
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:51,679
could understand

2358
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,760
everything that that plant genetically

2359
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:55,920
contributes to the female flower on the

2360
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,760
female side but on the male side we're

2361
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,760
kind of shooting in the dark

2362
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,679
so so what what i'm what i'm picturing

2363
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,360
in my head is i'm going to take one

2364
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:07,039
female plant

2365
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:09,198
spray her with sts to cause her to give

2366
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:12,719
off male pollen and then i'm going to

2367
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:15,119
pollinate that to a second female

2368
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:17,520
and so both of these female plants have

2369
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:20,000
got traits that i'm interested in and so

2370
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:23,679
hopefully the seeds from that second

2371
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:26,560
female plant when i grow them will

2372
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:29,399
carry the phenotypes and the traits that

2373
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:33,840
i want from both plants and then i will

2374
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:36,079
secondarily choose from those

2375
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,440
yeah more or less

2376
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:39,439
yeah

2377
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:40,799
all right so so if it's more or less

2378
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:42,319
what we'll clean clean it up right

2379
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,079
because because people are listening and

2380
01:25:42,319 --> 01:25:45,119
they're going to want to do this

2381
01:25:44,079 --> 01:25:46,639
yeah so

2382
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:49,119
if you're listening at home

2383
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:52,400
um i always recommend that we treat our

2384
01:25:49,119 --> 01:25:54,399
donor plants as if they're on a about a

2385
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:55,439
three to four week schedule ahead of the

2386
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:57,198
of your

2387
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:59,119
your female target plant so you always

2388
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:01,359
want to take your donor plant and

2389
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:04,000
trigger it into 1212 or trigger into

2390
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:06,559
flower by putting it in darkness um or

2391
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,800
you know 12 hours of darkness and on the

2392
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,719
first day of doing that you spray the

2393
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,079
plant with sts which becomes an

2394
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:14,000
application that i

2395
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:15,760
usually do weekly until their third or

2396
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,079
fourth week

2397
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:20,639
we then wait two to three weeks for our

2398
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:23,760
target plants until we move them into

2399
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:26,159
the flowering chamber because the sds it

2400
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:28,320
does slow the plant down a little bit

2401
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:30,879
but i'm not sure why it does that but

2402
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:32,559
there seems to be a delay or there's no

2403
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,760
synchronicity in their flowering periods

2404
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,760
if you don't

2405
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,520
uh trigger the pollen

2406
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,920
plants before

2407
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:42,159
um but yeah it's really about

2408
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:45,119
it's really about selecting plants on

2409
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:47,119
both sides that you find interesting and

2410
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:48,639
bringing them together through this sts

2411
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:50,639
process

2412
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:53,199
and there's a lot of benefits to it one

2413
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:54,000
as you said shango you get

2414
01:26:53,198 --> 01:26:56,158
you're

2415
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,600
more quickly able to move towards your

2416
01:26:56,158 --> 01:26:59,198
breeding goal

2417
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,440
because again you're doing positive

2418
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:02,399
selection on both parents not just the

2419
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:05,039
one

2420
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:07,359
um but secondly every time you want to

2421
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:08,158
grow out those populations that you're

2422
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:09,039
you're

2423
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:10,559
um

2424
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:12,960
you're experimenting with your test

2425
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,000
crosses if you're using male female

2426
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,920
breeding

2427
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,800
50 of those plants that you have to

2428
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:20,560
spend you know time energy nutrients

2429
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,679
water soil

2430
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,120
um

2431
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,319
taking care of and bringing them to

2432
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:26,079
maturity

2433
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:27,519
only to find that they're males is

2434
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:29,760
really

2435
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,960
it's kind of a drag in fact it's a real

2436
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:33,199
pain in the ass if you're trying to do

2437
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:35,119
it on any any type of scale

2438
01:27:33,198 --> 01:27:36,960
um whereas

2439
01:27:35,119 --> 01:27:39,119
when you're using all female breeding

2440
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,439
again one of the benefits is that you're

2441
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:43,039
that you're receiving gynosis seeds out

2442
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:45,198
of the end

2443
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:46,719
and therefore every seed that you plant

2444
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:48,399
is going to be a potential breeding

2445
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:50,158
candidate or a

2446
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:52,238
winner you know a plant that you can

2447
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:54,000
look at it's not just taking up space

2448
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:56,238
until you feel you find out that it's a

2449
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,039
male

2450
01:27:56,238 --> 01:27:58,879
so

2451
01:27:57,039 --> 01:28:02,079
that's that's one real benefit but i

2452
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:04,079
think the the benefit of being able to

2453
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:05,920
really look at the chemistry of both

2454
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:07,840
plants before you bring them together is

2455
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:10,239
is a huge um

2456
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:12,400
a huge boon and you know in our in our

2457
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:15,039
work in april we really

2458
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:17,599
uh we we showed that that was a really

2459
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:19,920
fast way to to make progress when you're

2460
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,480
breeding for specific chemical types

2461
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:25,039
even though i i do like the process of

2462
01:28:22,479 --> 01:28:28,158
choosing male plants um

2463
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:30,880
compared to actually using a female

2464
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:34,000
plant that is directly displaying the

2465
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:35,119
traits that i want it makes talking

2466
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,238
about

2467
01:28:35,119 --> 01:28:39,439
tight internal spacing and rubbing the

2468
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:41,759
stem of a

2469
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:43,919
of a male plant to guess what the

2470
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:46,960
terpene profile would be like it makes

2471
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:49,520
it seem like caveman like prehistoric

2472
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,520
well it really is it is really cavemen

2473
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:53,040
style and you know when i when i do that

2474
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:55,040
type of reading and it's not to say that

2475
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:57,279
i never use males in breeding projects

2476
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:59,359
but typically when i do use males i

2477
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:00,880
won't use a single male i'll collect

2478
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:03,839
pollen from

2479
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:06,079
you know 10 to 15 plants or maybe more

2480
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,000
but you you only select say 10 to 15

2481
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:10,719
percent of the of the plants that you're

2482
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,520
growing and you're really looking at at

2483
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:15,439
a whole set of characteristics you know

2484
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:17,360
resistance some molds and mildews and

2485
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:19,919
that kind of stuff and all that you know

2486
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:21,679
like you said the leaf shape and the

2487
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,600
the inner node distance and the the

2488
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:26,079
floral structure you can kind of get an

2489
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,840
idea of what you're looking at

2490
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:30,079
and use that as a loose criteria to

2491
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,679
select away 80 percent of the plants but

2492
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:33,679
i still use

2493
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:35,679
the remaining 20 so i'll collect them

2494
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:37,199
all and mix all their pollen together

2495
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,800
because like like we were talking about

2496
01:29:37,198 --> 01:29:40,559
earlier that provides some level of

2497
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,400
genetic diversity

2498
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,239
but if we're really trying to get you

2499
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:46,719
know tight down and dirty with one

2500
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:48,000
specific chemotype or one specific smell

2501
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:49,920
profile

2502
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,639
it's a lot easier to take two plants

2503
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,399
that already have that smell profile you

2504
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:56,880
know either as determined by the lab or

2505
01:29:54,399 --> 01:29:58,799
by your nose and using those plants to

2506
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,760
mate together and you'll see

2507
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,679
that um the end results are vastly

2508
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:05,679
different so you much more quickly

2509
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:08,639
approach your goal if you're using

2510
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:11,840
females on both sides i can totally see

2511
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:15,039
how uh positive selection right choosing

2512
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:17,440
the traits i want in the two females to

2513
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:19,198
get there more efficiently that makes

2514
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:22,000
total sense to me

2515
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:25,039
but i know that there's a whole bunch of

2516
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:28,719
folks out there who are going oh no man

2517
01:30:25,039 --> 01:30:31,279
like i absolutely need to use a male or

2518
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:33,198
it's not just not right so let though if

2519
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:36,800
we were to science that up a little bit

2520
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:38,559
you know is there anything lost by not

2521
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,719
using a male

2522
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,920
there is there's a y chromosome that's

2523
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:43,840
lost

2524
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,760
um and it's not lost i mean we can

2525
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:48,159
preserve y chromosomes and a handful of

2526
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:49,199
seeds in the fridge for you know 20 30

2527
01:30:48,158 --> 01:30:50,799
years

2528
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:52,719
so that it's not like we were in any

2529
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:55,039
fear of actually losing the existence of

2530
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:56,800
the wild chromosome but the truth is is

2531
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:58,639
even when we're growing those regular

2532
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,679
seed lots or what we call regular seed

2533
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:01,920
lots

2534
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:03,440
those male plants don't fall into our

2535
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:05,520
[Music]

2536
01:31:03,439 --> 01:31:07,039
marijuana production right we don't into

2537
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,800
the production of cannabis flowers we

2538
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:12,639
just don't use them males are

2539
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:12,639
essentially irrelevant to that process

2540
01:31:13,359 --> 01:31:17,279
otherwise

2541
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:20,079
you know cannabis has in its genome

2542
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:22,319
cannabis has ten chromosome pairs nine

2543
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:23,760
pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex

2544
01:31:22,319 --> 01:31:25,679
chromosomes

2545
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,960
um

2546
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:28,719
so

2547
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:30,158
when we're using you know when we're

2548
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:32,239
really what we're doing we're breeding

2549
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:34,158
is we're just shuffling copies of those

2550
01:31:32,238 --> 01:31:36,158
10 chromosomes

2551
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:37,519
um but when we again when we look at

2552
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:40,079
marijuana production we're only

2553
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:43,280
concerned with the variation present on

2554
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:44,719
the nine chromosomes and what's on the x

2555
01:31:43,279 --> 01:31:46,719
chromosome because what's on the y

2556
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:48,480
chromosome is really

2557
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:50,239
kind of irrelevant for can for drug

2558
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:52,559
cannabis production

2559
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:55,039
um there is something called crossing

2560
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:57,280
over in which y chromosomes and x

2561
01:31:55,039 --> 01:31:58,719
chromosomes exchange these little pieces

2562
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:00,158
of dna

2563
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:01,960
and there's something on the male

2564
01:32:00,158 --> 01:32:04,399
chromosome called the su the

2565
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:06,399
pseudo-autosomal region and all that

2566
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:08,879
means is that that there's part of the y

2567
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:10,000
chromosome that actually does exchange

2568
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:12,400
genetic

2569
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,760
information with the y or with the x

2570
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:15,439
chromosome

2571
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:17,039
but um

2572
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:19,919
i don't think that we're truly

2573
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:22,158
eliminating anything of value to

2574
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:24,639
drug cannabis growers by creating

2575
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:27,679
feminized seeds without y chromosomes

2576
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:29,600
right on fair enough um all right so

2577
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:31,920
um i've got one more i'm gonna ask you a

2578
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:35,199
question about about sourcing sts but

2579
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:36,960
before we move on off of this um i'm

2580
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:39,439
gonna i guess we'll call this another

2581
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,520
fishing expedition you know

2582
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:43,359
when i have people on this show that

2583
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:45,600
have got a level of technical knowledge

2584
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:48,238
that i may not know i like to ask this

2585
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:50,880
question which is um what am i not

2586
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:53,439
asking you about female only breeding

2587
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:55,279
that people want to know right um you

2588
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:57,198
know i really only you know i'm learning

2589
01:32:55,279 --> 01:33:00,079
about it as you're telling me about it

2590
01:32:57,198 --> 01:33:01,919
and and and so but you you are very

2591
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:04,399
experienced with it and and you know

2592
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:06,719
what tends to get people excited so

2593
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:10,000
so so what else is there what what what

2594
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:11,439
is another female only breeding

2595
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,800
data point or something that you think

2596
01:33:11,439 --> 01:33:14,238
is important and relevant that people

2597
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,760
would want to know

2598
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:17,439
i don't know i think that we've touched

2599
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,679
on most of them i think the important

2600
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:21,919
things to realize is that the two real

2601
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:23,600
take-homes that i really want people to

2602
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:25,920
to think about are

2603
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:30,079
what blame are we putting on the process

2604
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:32,800
of sts that really should be

2605
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:35,119
seen as blame of bad selection of plants

2606
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:37,279
or plants that had negative traits and i

2607
01:33:35,119 --> 01:33:40,079
think i think the community really

2608
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:42,399
assumes that the process of creating

2609
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:43,920
feminized seeds

2610
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:45,759
does something to the genetics of the

2611
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:49,359
plant and that really hasn't been shown

2612
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:49,360
in any type of research anywhere

2613
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,840
i think

2614
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:54,719
you know

2615
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:57,199
i think that as breeders we need to do

2616
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,800
a better job of testing the seeds and

2617
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:00,559
being open

2618
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,239
about the techniques that were used to

2619
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,600
produce the products that people are

2620
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:06,238
buying

2621
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:08,560
um and give the consumers as much

2622
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:10,718
information as possible but we also have

2623
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,880
to educate the consumers so they know

2624
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:13,600
how to deal with that information you

2625
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,600
know

2626
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,440
it's you know it's enough to say hey we

2627
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,600
have these are s1 seeds but if you don't

2628
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:21,439
know what an s1 seed is

2629
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,719
i don't think that information is really

2630
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:23,919
too too helpful

2631
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:25,840
right

2632
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,440
so uh so

2633
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,639
so you know there's chances are that

2634
01:34:27,439 --> 01:34:31,678
there's a lot of people who are going to

2635
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:34,560
be all hot to get some silver thio

2636
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:36,239
sulfate now and and for me if i were to

2637
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:38,239
do a breeding program like this i'd

2638
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:41,279
probably just uh you know call up matt

2639
01:34:38,238 --> 01:34:44,000
riot and and and buy a bottle of his

2640
01:34:41,279 --> 01:34:47,759
uh you know feminizing spray which is

2641
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:50,158
sts um but but i don't really know a lot

2642
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:52,480
about this chemical is there like like

2643
01:34:50,158 --> 01:34:55,118
how do we know about the veracity of the

2644
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:57,198
sts that we're using it you know do they

2645
01:34:55,118 --> 01:34:59,519
do they sell it at uh you know

2646
01:34:57,198 --> 01:35:01,439
scientific supplies or do we need to

2647
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:04,239
find somebody in the cannabis scene that

2648
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:06,638
has you know made a batch like what's

2649
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:07,599
the nature of this chemical and getting

2650
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,440
it

2651
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,960
yeah so typically when you're buying it

2652
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:12,079
you can buy if so if you want to mix

2653
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,679
your own

2654
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:15,679
there's recipes for it online and

2655
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:17,679
there's all sites there are all sorts of

2656
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:19,679
different types of recipes for it

2657
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:20,639
um there's typically two components that

2658
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:22,800
you need

2659
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:24,800
silver nitrate which is a

2660
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:27,039
crystalline chemical you can buy for

2661
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,800
about i don't know it's about 20 25 for

2662
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:30,800
a gram or so

2663
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:34,000
um and and then there's sodium

2664
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:36,320
thiosulfate which comes in two forms

2665
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,840
which complicates the recipe because

2666
01:35:36,319 --> 01:35:40,719
there's sodium

2667
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:43,039
pentaho sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate

2668
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:45,039
which essentially has water molecules

2669
01:35:43,039 --> 01:35:46,880
built into the crystal and then you can

2670
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:48,238
get it without and the molecular weights

2671
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:50,480
are slightly different so you have to

2672
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:51,359
know which one you're working with if

2673
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:53,759
you

2674
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:55,759
if you're trying to mix your own

2675
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:57,920
typically what what is done is you make

2676
01:35:55,760 --> 01:36:00,320
you measure out a given weight of each

2677
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,600
of the crystallized

2678
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:04,000
uh

2679
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:06,639
substances and you mix them into a set

2680
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,639
amount of water and those that now you

2681
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:11,520
have two stock solution which you then

2682
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:12,960
mix together and you have to pour one of

2683
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:16,239
them into the other and not the other

2684
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:18,239
way around otherwise they react uh in a

2685
01:36:16,238 --> 01:36:19,678
in a very negative way not a negative or

2686
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:21,919
dangerous way but

2687
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:22,880
the the the compounds don't come out as

2688
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,399
needed

2689
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,679
that all said for most people that

2690
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:27,279
aren't playing around with it you're

2691
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:28,239
probably better off to just order it

2692
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:30,319
online

2693
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:32,879
um i noticed there's a couple of

2694
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:35,359
outfits now selling spray bottles on it

2695
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:36,800
on amazon.com and if you're in the

2696
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:38,399
united states there's a company called

2697
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,679
hybrid attack

2698
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:41,359
um

2699
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:43,359
who's a plant breeder friend of ours

2700
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:45,279
from oregon that is

2701
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:46,719
uh likes to be crowded as the first

2702
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:48,479
person that kind of

2703
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:50,000
created the swell of

2704
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:51,198
feminized seeds

2705
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,600
even though he wasn't really the first

2706
01:36:51,198 --> 01:36:55,839
person to create the the product he he

2707
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:58,079
did independently develop it

2708
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:59,920
and he's doing great work too uh he came

2709
01:36:58,079 --> 01:37:02,800
up during the that same show i referred

2710
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:04,239
to earlier with caleb from csi humboldt

2711
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:06,880
they are

2712
01:37:04,238 --> 01:37:08,799
they send best practices back and forth

2713
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:10,960
yeah hybe is well we've always known him

2714
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:13,119
as high but he's a he's a really

2715
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:15,039
he's an educated plant breeder he really

2716
01:37:13,118 --> 01:37:17,279
knows what he's talking about and

2717
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:19,519
he thinks about plant breeding

2718
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:21,118
as a plant breeder but not as if someone

2719
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:23,119
that is trying to make money off of sees

2720
01:37:21,118 --> 01:37:24,719
this so anyway the bottom line is that

2721
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:26,000
he sells it and it's

2722
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:27,359
it's you know it's probably more

2723
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,039
expensive than you need to pay for it

2724
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:30,559
but it's a ready-to-use formula that you

2725
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:32,319
can just order and it comes in the mail

2726
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:35,119
in a little spray bottle and you can

2727
01:37:32,319 --> 01:37:37,279
just spray that on your plants and

2728
01:37:35,118 --> 01:37:38,559
you know i think

2729
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:40,800
if you don't know how to mix lab

2730
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,000
chemicals it's probably that that type

2731
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,039
of product is right up your alley

2732
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:47,118
because it is sts is an oxidizer and

2733
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:48,880
you know it's

2734
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:49,599
you don't want to be breaking bottles

2735
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,960
and

2736
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:53,440
putting your hands in it or any of that

2737
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:54,639
kind of stuff it stains really badly if

2738
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:56,399
you if you

2739
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:58,239
uh you know knock it over on a wood

2740
01:37:56,399 --> 01:38:00,000
table or a white table for example it's

2741
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:01,759
going to it's going to stain it

2742
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,439
for the for the especially nerdy folks

2743
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,280
who want to make their own you mentioned

2744
01:38:03,439 --> 01:38:08,638
that there were different types of

2745
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:10,960
recipes out there um do you have a uh

2746
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:13,039
you know a keyword that you want to drop

2747
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:16,399
so that that people could use to find a

2748
01:38:13,039 --> 01:38:19,039
recipe that that you find is reliable if

2749
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:20,559
you type sodium thiosulfate cannabis

2750
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:22,000
into google you're going to find a whole

2751
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:24,000
bunch of recipes

2752
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:27,600
um i would mix it a little stronger than

2753
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:29,520
most people are making it

2754
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:32,639
just concentrate it a little bit more

2755
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,639
don't put as much water in

2756
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:36,319
obviously you know use gloves long

2757
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:38,000
sleeves

2758
01:38:36,319 --> 01:38:41,118
uh you know goggles all that kind of

2759
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,118
stuff when you're spraying it

2760
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:46,560
just just use common sense and uh

2761
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:49,039
yeah you'll be able to find the

2762
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,719
components online usually from uh

2763
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:53,279
sometimes they sell them at the photo

2764
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:54,719
formularies like places for developing

2765
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:56,880
um

2766
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:59,279
film like old camera film

2767
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,960
anybody remembers what that is

2768
01:38:59,279 --> 01:39:03,198
uh so earlier when you were talking

2769
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,719
about uh the breeding aspect you said

2770
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:06,879
well you know you you

2771
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:10,079
you set the flower or you set the plant

2772
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:12,480
to 12 12 it starts to flower and from

2773
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:13,439
from the day that you

2774
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:17,279
um

2775
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:20,158
uh flip to 12 12 you start spraying the

2776
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:22,960
plant once a week for the first five or

2777
01:39:20,158 --> 01:39:24,799
six weeks do i repeat that correctly

2778
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,719
four to five weeks usually by that point

2779
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:29,360
in time it's dropping pollen yeah or

2780
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:32,079
it's or the the the male flowers are

2781
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:32,880
well towards development

2782
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:34,880
um

2783
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:36,719
the the key there is that you want to

2784
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,159
you want to have so i call i have two

2785
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:40,319
groups what we call the the target

2786
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:41,839
plants and the donor plants the donor

2787
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:42,960
plants are the plants that get treated

2788
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:45,199
they're the ones that are going to

2789
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:47,840
become the pollen donors and so we put

2790
01:39:45,198 --> 01:39:50,638
the pollen donors into flower

2791
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,880
two to three weeks before we put the

2792
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:55,039
target plants in the flower

2793
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:58,560
and that just gives those plants enough

2794
01:39:55,039 --> 01:40:01,600
time to get well into their

2795
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:03,360
male flower development period so that

2796
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:05,679
by the time that they're ready to open

2797
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:09,118
and release that pollen your female

2798
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:11,199
plants are then ready to receive pollen

2799
01:40:09,118 --> 01:40:13,279
um or your your target plants are ready

2800
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:15,279
to sieve pollen so that we leave like a

2801
01:40:13,279 --> 01:40:17,920
two to three week window

2802
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:20,079
in between you know when we induce the

2803
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:22,800
donor plants to flower and then when we

2804
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:23,760
induce the target plants to flower

2805
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:27,360
um

2806
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:29,600
how much sts do we spray on i'm one of

2807
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:31,118
those people who tends to think more is

2808
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,039
better and i'm since i've gotten

2809
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:35,279
involved in learning korean natural

2810
01:40:33,039 --> 01:40:37,920
farming i'm like teaching myself to not

2811
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:39,599
think more is better all the time but

2812
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,039
but with this can you can you just give

2813
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,199
us some kind of rule of thumb of how

2814
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:45,920
much to spray like do we we probably

2815
01:40:43,198 --> 01:40:48,399
don't want it damp but we also probably

2816
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:51,199
need it uniform

2817
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:53,599
yeah it's it's a little more um

2818
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:56,079
coloring with crayons than doing

2819
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:58,239
intricate science this is

2820
01:40:56,079 --> 01:41:00,079
you can just kind of spray it i wouldn't

2821
01:40:58,238 --> 01:41:03,039
necessarily encourage people to spray it

2822
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:05,840
onto the actual leaves of the plant um

2823
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:07,198
the sun leaves are

2824
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,480
you know you could they will absorb the

2825
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:10,158
chemical but it's

2826
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:12,238
this this chemical can be a little bit

2827
01:41:10,158 --> 01:41:14,799
photo toxic so when they get exposed to

2828
01:41:12,238 --> 01:41:17,279
subsequent light it can damage them

2829
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:20,320
um we want to spray what i call the

2830
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:23,198
crotches of the plant so the junction

2831
01:41:20,319 --> 01:41:25,599
where the leaf petiole or the stem of

2832
01:41:23,198 --> 01:41:28,319
the leaf meets the bran meets the either

2833
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:30,719
the branch or the main stock

2834
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:32,238
and that area is where the new flowers

2835
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:33,520
are going to grow from so essentially

2836
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:35,439
anywhere that you think you would see

2837
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:38,000
you know see a bud site on a female

2838
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:40,158
plant spray that bud site

2839
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,158
or the tip of the of the chute at that

2840
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:44,079
bud site but don't necessarily worry

2841
01:41:42,158 --> 01:41:45,198
about the sun leaf itself it's more

2842
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:46,960
about

2843
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:49,198
spraying the ethylene

2844
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,880
blocker on the area where those flowers

2845
01:41:49,198 --> 01:41:52,399
are going to produce rather than on the

2846
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:54,159
leaf

2847
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:55,920
i'm glad we hit that because in my head

2848
01:41:54,158 --> 01:41:57,279
i was actually picturing a pre-existing

2849
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:59,199
flower but that's right if you're going

2850
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:01,439
to start this at 12 12 you're not

2851
01:41:59,198 --> 01:42:04,479
actually spraying it on flowers you are

2852
01:42:01,439 --> 01:42:06,399
spraying it on future sites so you're

2853
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:08,559
you're really spread you're actually

2854
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:12,319
probably trying to

2855
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:15,520
you know spray branches at the

2856
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:16,960
at bud sites but before they're there so

2857
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:18,639
it takes a little bit of experience to

2858
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:20,880
know where those are going to be

2859
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:22,800
yeah a little bit and it becomes obvious

2860
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:24,079
you know after you after you plant the

2861
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,840
or after you the plants have been in

2862
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:27,039
flowering for about a week or 10 days

2863
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:28,480
you're going to start to see little

2864
01:42:27,039 --> 01:42:29,840
tufts of flowers

2865
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:31,198
and at that point in time yeah you

2866
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:33,600
switch to spraying the flowers

2867
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:35,439
themselves

2868
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:38,000
because we want the the whole point of

2869
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:40,238
the action is for the ethylene to act at

2870
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,359
that flower site and we want to shut

2871
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:45,519
down the production of female flowers

2872
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:47,759
and in turn have the plant produce male

2873
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:50,320
flowers so the plant will still grow

2874
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:52,079
little buds but the idea is that those

2875
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:54,000
little buds are now made up of male

2876
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:56,960
flowers and not female

2877
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,800
clusters or colas right yeah

2878
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:00,880
right on cool well ryan thank you so

2879
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:03,360
much you know uh you know i love

2880
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:06,480
cannabis in general but as somebody who

2881
01:43:03,359 --> 01:43:07,439
talks about and and helps patients

2882
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:10,479
source

2883
01:43:07,439 --> 01:43:12,638
uh female seeds and and as somebody who

2884
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:14,718
grows feminized seeds it's always been

2885
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:16,800
kind of a mystery how these how these

2886
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:19,198
plants or how these seeds are produced

2887
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:21,840
and i just kind of went on faith right

2888
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:24,479
um but i feel a lot more i don't know

2889
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:27,279
empowered understanding what's going on

2890
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:29,839
behind the secret sauce and also to know

2891
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:31,198
that you know it's not feminized seeds

2892
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:33,360
that that

2893
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:35,118
are often bad it's it's actually poor

2894
01:43:33,359 --> 01:43:38,319
growing which actually makes or excuse

2895
01:43:35,118 --> 01:43:40,399
me poor selection which makes a lot more

2896
01:43:38,319 --> 01:43:42,880
sense to me so so thanks for sharing

2897
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:45,118
