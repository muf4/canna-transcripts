2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,240
happy New Year it's been so cold over

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,638
the entire country this week here on

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,118
Bashon Island where I live windchill got

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,559
well below zero and some of the Southern

6
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:23,439
States had windchill of like -40 and

7
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:26,159
-60Â° fhe that's ridiculous when it gets

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,439
this cold my old house is miserable the

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,240
poor insulation here just lets the cold

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,200
right through and I have to bundle up

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,600
and keep moving until the weather

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,120
changes several parts of the country are

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,160
without power too cold and no

14
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,320
electricity makes life dangerous and

15
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:43,279
unbearable the parts of my Island that

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,000
have no power have put their freezer

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,679
foods outside in the icy cold to stay

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,519
fresh some folks are grilling their

19
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:53,600
defrosting expensive meat and seafood so

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,879
they can enjoy eating them before losing

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,600
them in case the weather warms before

22
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:01,000
the electricity comes back some folks

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,679
are even leaving town to stay with

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,719
relatives and believe it or not this is

25
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,478
the theme of today's shaping Fire

26
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:11,079
episode just like humans get miserable

27
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,599
and crappy weather so does the microb

28
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:15,719
life in your cannabis soil too much

29
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:18,319
water too little water not enough

30
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,759
Sunshine Too Much Sunshine Too Little

31
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:25,519
carbon too much carbon too hot too cold

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,118
Frozen yikes I imagine the microbes also

33
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,599
putting all their little Foods out in

34
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,959
the front yard and having the

35
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:33,519
neighborhood over for a big freezing

36
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,798
barbecue yeah that's right get ready for

37
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:38,679
a lot of anthropomorphizing of microbes

38
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:41,040
today because microbes are people

39
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,600
too if you want to learn about cannabis

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,359
Health cultivation and technique

41
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,599
efficiently and with good cheer I

53
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:08,038
fire and I am your host Shango Los

54
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:11,239
welcome to

55
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:13,238
episode2 my guest today is Michael Deli

56
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,519
Michael Deli earned his masters from

57
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,920
Colorado State University's

58
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:18,840
Horticultural Department in 2020 where

59
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,238
he researched different facets of plant

60
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,200
microb interactions including nematode

61
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,920
biocont control methods microbial

62
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,039
legacies resulting from replanting

63
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:30,359
Fields And even the caterpillar gut

64
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:33,159
microbiome now serving as the director

65
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,200
of microbiology at impello biosciences

66
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,959
his research surrounds the overlap

67
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,039
between biological and biochemical

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,560
agricultural inputs targeted towards

69
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,318
both crop and soil Health properties

70
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,560
Cannabis sativa is one of their model

71
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:47,439
organisms for agriculture research and

72
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,360
one of Michael's projects is to examine

73
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,479
the functional bacterial species

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,280
recruited by Cannabis sativa in the

75
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,280
rizosphere during the first set today we

76
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,318
will discuss bio stimulants and plant

77
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,919
growth regulators and how to approach

78
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,039
them as regenerative cannabis

79
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,399
cultivators in the second set we will

80
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,719
discuss the care and tending of

81
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,760
microlife in the rizosphere and during

82
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:10,080
the third set we will choose companion

83
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,560
plants for soil diversity and finish the

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,879
episode with an indictment of the

85
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,318
24-hour light strategy welcome to

86
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:17,479
shaping fire

87
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:19,039
Michael hi sheno thank you so much for

88
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:20,479
having me I'm very grateful to be here

89
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,840
awesome really glad that you made time

90
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,479
for us so let's get right into it you

91
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,680
know um cannabis farmers are always

92
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:30,679
looking for like a leg up something

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,719
winning to add to their recipe and um a

94
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,599
lot of us look for different things that

95
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,359
could be determined to be bio stimulants

96
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,639
and then a subsection of those people

97
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,319
are are people mostly who follow this

98
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,958
show who are uh regeneratively minded

99
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,958
Farmers so so they're they're they're

100
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,000
looking for natural bio stimulants

101
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,920
versus synthetic ones let's start out

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,039
the show by talking about what bios

103
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,878
stimulants are generally and then we'll

104
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:57,959
start to tease apart the synthetic ones

105
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:00,239
from natural ones so so that's my first

106
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,878
question for you um what are bio

107
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,560
stimulants and um and what are the kind

108
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,438
of kinds of attributes that we look for

109
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,360
them to impart on our cannabis

110
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:11,078
plants absolutely yeah um so I mean I

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,400
like to think of biostimulants as a

112
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,319
really large umbrella term with several

113
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,280
different kind of facets of of products

114
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:18,639
or inputs that people can use or they

115
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,958
can take advantage of that might be in a

116
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,160
natural system um but I guess in essence

117
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,759
you know they are they're very much

118
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,840
performance enhancers for plant growth

119
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,360
and

120
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,359
metabolism is how I kind of Define bio

121
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,000
stimulus so when so when we say

122
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,199
performance um um are we talking about

123
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,519
specifically like the the um the

124
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,478
Gathering of nutrition the processing of

125
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:45,599
nutrition uh improved photosynthesis

126
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:48,560
essentially all of the plants um

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,919
biological systems get get kind of like

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,759
tweaked up the governor is turned up on

129
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:55,279
all of them so they're running either

130
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,240
more efficiently or faster is that's the

131
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,559
idea yeah I think that's a really good

132
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,240
way to put it and you know different

133
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,918
parts of Bio stimulant will uh

134
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,280
upregulate different parts of the plant

135
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:08,639
metabolism or or growth uh rates and

136
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,918
things like that um but yeah I think uh

137
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,720
the uh primarily I look at these as you

138
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:15,599
know biological products things like

139
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,280
microorganisms and and biochemicals um

140
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,199
things that are usually plant derived or

141
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,079
discovered in nature and then used uh um

142
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,879
to upregulate the plant metabolism

143
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:28,519
whether that's with hormones or um amino

144
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:31,399
acids fulvic acids things like that I

145
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:33,000
like this term up regulate um uh I've

146
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:36,038
heard it before but I don't use it

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,160
regularly and um I like it both for the

148
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:40,719
biology conversation but it also sounds

149
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,919
like a great um euphemism for getting

150
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,759
high like like oh man I need to go up

151
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:49,439
regulate that's awesome I like that a

152
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,960
lot so so let's let's let's tease apart

153
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,839
now the synthetic and the and the

154
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,239
natural bio stimulants because we're

155
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,198
we're mostly going to be talking about

156
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,360
um natural bio stimulants today um so

157
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,360
what

158
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,759
when I discuss bio natural bio

159
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,879
stimulants with other regenerative

160
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:10,479
Growers we're usually talking about um

161
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:13,800
you know this or that plant that we are

162
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:17,000
going to you know do a a tea of or an

163
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,319
extract of or or a or a you know a top

164
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,680
dress of something like that because we

165
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,598
want uh some U naturally occurring

166
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,199
biochemical that's in the plant we want

167
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:29,519
that to seep into our biosphere and then

168
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,759
when at the conventions when I talk with

169
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,359
the synthetic bio stimulant sales guys

170
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,879
their products have always got these

171
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:41,400
like multi- cabic names that that um

172
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:43,159
sound very scientific and sometimes

173
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,439
they've you know they've also been named

174
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,520
at some marketing name and so they have

175
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,800
got a a real different vibe to them um

176
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,478
perhaps they're perhaps the natural ones

177
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,720
and the synthetic ones are both trying

178
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:57,719
to do the same things but I'm I'm

179
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,039
guessing they have got different

180
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,720
attributes that that you can share with

181
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:04,719
us yeah absolutely so I I would think

182
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,919
like um a lot of times when I when I

183
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,599
think about synthetic bio stimulants

184
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:10,918
whether that's something that is you

185
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:13,000
know uh discovered through a natural

186
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:14,918
process and then you know one compound

187
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,959
is isolated it really seems a lot to me

188
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:18,878
like the pharmaceutical industry we find

189
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,758
one active ingredient we purify it you

190
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,560
know it shows in a lab and on the bench

191
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,680
that this is effective at whatever we're

192
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,439
trying to uh alleviate um and then all

193
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,759
of the uh you know medicine is built off

194
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,439
of that compound um and that's kind of

195
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,840
how I look at like the synthetic aspect

196
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,279
of that where potentially there's a

197
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,959
there's a chance of missing some other

198
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,399
minor chemicals or you know metabolites

199
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:42,159
that might be from a natural product

200
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:44,198
extract um that would be missed uh when

201
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,280
things are just synthesized in a lab

202
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,439
versus uh extracted through a natural

203
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:51,638
process like making it compost tea or or

204
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:54,439
breaking down other um forms of of

205
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,240
organic inputs like uh fish waste or

206
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:58,759
even you know corn waste things like

207
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,560
that hearing you describe it it actually

208
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,840
reminds me a lot of how we talk about

209
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,000
the Entourage effect and the difference

210
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:08,079
between isolates and whole plant it

211
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,959
sounds a lot like the synthetic um the

212
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:13,038
synthetic bio stimulants are often like

213
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,839
isolates they are an isolated

214
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:17,560
biochemical that we're going to apply

215
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,839
the plant one way or another versus the

216
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,120
compost tea kind of flavor that's more

217
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,799
like taking a whole plant medicine

218
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,759
because we're getting all these these

219
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,598
random uh plant constituents that um

220
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,278
that we may not have even researched yet

221
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:35,080
but we know that as a symphony they they

222
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:37,838
interact really well with the human body

223
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,919
um what do you think about that yeah I

224
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,440
would agree with that I think it's

225
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,559
really similar to how people talk about

226
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,279
the Entourage effect of of cannabis and

227
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,958
you know turboid and things like that um

228
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,519
the same thing goes for you know whether

229
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,879
these these compounds whether a

230
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,799
synthetic or natural bio stimulant is is

231
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,519
directly influencing the plant there's a

232
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,679
there's a good chance it is it's also

233
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,600
really helping out like the soil

234
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:01,039
microbiome most likely uh things like

235
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,879
you know the upper regulation of theism

236
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,838
can be a factor of uh an increased rate

237
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:07,799
of you know soil respiration or soil

238
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,240
organic matter or just general

239
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:12,879
beneficial soil ecological components um

240
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,519
you know things like amino acids uh of

241
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,919
the things or one of the um smaller

242
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,759
terms underneath the larger bio

243
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,838
stimulant umbrella can become building

244
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,838
blocks for protein synthesis in both

245
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,760
plants and microbes um so by providing

246
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,320
that source that might be you know

247
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,399
deficient in the soil or um you know out

248
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,440
competed by other mic Gres if a a grower

249
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,159
can add that in there um whether that's

250
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,279
helping the plant directly or the soil

251
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,000
ecology the whole system is benefited at

252
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:41,320
least um from what we've

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,799
seen so um you know I I re I do

254
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,879
recognize that I've got a certain amount

255
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,599
of prejudice against synthetic bio

256
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:50,519
stimulant simply because they are

257
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,560
synthetic and I know that um that is

258
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:57,320
often unfair of me just to uh discount

259
00:09:54,559 --> 00:10:00,679
things because they're synthetic um you

260
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:04,720
know outside of the fact that just on

261
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:06,799
its face I prefer organic gardening and

262
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,000
organic food and organic seeds because I

263
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:13,919
like to um you know have my garden be as

264
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,399
close to Nature as possible um is there

265
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:21,719
really any you know a priori reason to

266
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,919
discount or not include synthetic bio

267
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,759
stimulants um and and what what I'm

268
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,439
going to compare it to is you know we

269
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,720
often talk about you know B bottled salt

270
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,519
fertilizer on this show about how they

271
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,800
kind of force feed nutrition to cannabis

272
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,720
plants and by doing that um you know you

273
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,359
might get a robust plant but you're also

274
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,720
getting a plant that is out of balance

275
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,720
and over the long term is more

276
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,480
susceptible to plants and can have all

277
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,240
sorts of other problems because you're

278
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,320
you're forcing it right now um is there

279
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,360
is are there any mechanisms like that

280
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,480
with synthetic bio stimulants that are a

281
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,159
reason to reject them because of how

282
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,200
they function instead instead of just me

283
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,278
being Prejudice because they are not

284
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,839
organic no I understand where you're

285
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:07,639
coming from with the um the synthetic

286
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,480
Prejudice and I I kind of adapt similar

287
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,839
principles like in my own gardening and

288
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,278
and things like that um I guess I want

289
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,399
to ask you a question about uh what

290
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,439
might be considered I guess synthetic to

291
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,399
take a step back here um I'm familiar

292
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,800
with a process uh for an amino acid

293
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,200
product that is um taking waste from the

294
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,879
fishing industry so lots of shrimp

295
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,480
shells and and crab shells and things

296
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,720
like that and then they're put into a

297
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,000
reactor uh a couple enzymes are added to

298
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,079
break down the the fish waste or the you

299
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,278
know the crustacean waste um and then

300
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:37,479
the end product is both uh you know

301
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,838
amino acids and and kiten and other

302
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,920
things like that um so that is you know

303
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,920
synthetically the the breakdown process

304
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,639
is synthetically increased with these

305
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,599
enzymes in the reaction um but if you

306
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,399
were to kind of slowly compost you know

307
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,560
shrimp and crab shells and and things

308
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,839
like that in your soil you might have a

309
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,838
similar uh endpoint product or you know

310
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,800
beneficial effect of the soil system um

311
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,240
so I guess how do you feel about that

312
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,519
kind of process is that would you call

313
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,278
that more synthetic kind of Towing the

314
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,839
line between the two of them or just is

315
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:08,240
that purely synthetic cuz you know lab

316
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,519
equipment and bioreactors are involved

317
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,839
yeah it's an interesting question to

318
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,440
kind of tease the definition um uh

319
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,160
definitely at at from the top I'll say

320
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,199
the word synthetic is a messy term cuz

321
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,159
it it's it's kind of like a it's it's

322
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:23,159
it's a bucket of ideas that are

323
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:26,439
different to pretty much everybody who

324
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:30,039
hears the word and it is best applied on

325
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,040
a on a Case by case basis based on what

326
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:35,599
you are you know based on this little

327
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:39,599
example though um it sounds like that is

328
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,600
a um a a

329
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:44,359
non It's Tricky right yeah it is tricky

330
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,959
it sounds like it's a natural process

331
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,480
right it's it sounds like you're you're

332
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,679
just processing by adding other natural

333
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,639
processes so it's you've got you've got

334
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:56,039
natural natural naturally occurring

335
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,278
product a and you're adding naturally

336
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,958
occurring products B and C and you know

337
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,159
you put them together and it causes the

338
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:06,319
breakdown to happen into a you know a

339
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:08,838
usable nutrition faster um you know if

340
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,639
we were to if we were to go long on this

341
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,079
and make it the you know the the brunt

342
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,959
of the show I would probably have to ask

343
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,159
a bunch of questions about what are the

344
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:20,399
natures of the inputs and and where that

345
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:24,838
line might be drawn between um you know

346
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:27,639
adding adding inputs that that um either

347
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,480
inhibit natural reactions or create

348
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,759
non-natural reactions

349
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,680
to get whatever you're trying to you

350
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,240
know produce produce but but um that's a

351
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,159
slippery slope right there of course

352
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,560
right absolutely yeah um and yeah I

353
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:43,360
think I mean you know the processes

354
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,159
would would uh you know um theoretically

355
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,199
occur in nature just a little bit longer

356
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,679
time for those enzymes to unlock some of

357
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:53,000
the the polymers like things in you know

358
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,879
the exoskeletons of crustaceans um but

359
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,759
yeah we are synthetically or you know in

360
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,039
this type of process development uh

361
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,440
somebody would be synthetically

362
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,958
upregulating or increasing the rate of

363
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,720
decom to make these things um you know

364
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,239
in a more plant usable form that way the

365
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,120
plants and the soil microbes have to

366
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,320
expend less energy um on breaking down

367
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,159
things and they can just be you know

368
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,399
slurped up and used uh efficiently um so

369
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:16,519
yeah I think it kind of tells the line

370
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,559
between synthetic and natural but one

371
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,679
thing that is is kind of cool in

372
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,198
processes such as these um I know

373
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:26,359
there's similar ones for corn and soy uh

374
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:28,039
based bio stimulants um they do put a a

375
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,839
use an end use product to things that

376
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,439
might be considered waste material prior

377
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,320
to um these types of

378
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,440
reactions and I guess we just want to

379
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,560
make sure that that waste material is

380
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,720
handled in a responsible way if if we're

381
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,159
going to produce it at all absolutely

382
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,440
and you know when it is not waste

383
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,078
material when it's you know host

384
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,800
material for a a crustacean farmer or a

385
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,078
corn or sore farmer we want to make sure

386
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:52,879
that uh those plants or or animals are

387
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,838
being treated and uh you know uh the

388
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,838
management practices of cultivating

389
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,000
those are also not going to influence

390
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,160
the inputs that we want to feed our

391
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,799
plants later MH mhm so um so let's talk

392
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:06,240
a little bit about um some of the the

393
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:09,639
natural bio stimulants that come up uh

394
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,159
the most often in cannabis cultivation

395
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,720
I'm thinking uh humic and fulvic acids

396
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:17,078
seaweed extracts uh different types of

397
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,519
microbial inoculants and then amino

398
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:22,198
acids which you've already mentioned um

399
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,799
are these all are are these different

400
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:29,679
types of natural bio stimulants working

401
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:32,519
on um different um uh bi iCal systems of

402
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,838
the cannabis plant or are they all

403
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,240
essentially acting on the same system

404
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,519
but in different

405
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,560
ways yeah they would definitely um act

406
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,318
on you know the same system as a whole

407
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,239
the plant the soil the microbes and

408
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,679
whatnot but every every part everything

409
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,079
you just mentioned has a slightly

410
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,919
different uh effect on the biome from

411
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:52,719
what I understand um you know humix and

412
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:54,919
fvix can be great sources of organic

413
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,240
matter for both the plant and the soil

414
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:58,799
microbes to use as inputs uh whereas

415
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,360
things like seaweed extracts often

416
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:05,958
contain plant hormones like cyto content

417
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:08,800
and um um I think some phosphorus or

418
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:10,439
potassium as well um so we get a little

419
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,318
bit of Plant Nutrition from there as

420
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,399
well as some you know plant hormones

421
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:16,519
applied outside of the plant body rather

422
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,240
than being produced within it um

423
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,799
microbial inoculants I think these guys

424
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,560
uh really depends on your soil and the

425
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,000
history of that that system or your

426
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,159
indoor cultivation system um but those

427
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,278
were primarily you know uh if they're

428
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:30,600
administered in a drench be uh

429
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:31,919
benefiting the root systems of the

430
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,759
plants as well as the neighboring

431
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,000
microbes that might already be there and

432
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,120
then we have you know foler spray

433
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,519
microba inoculants too that help um out

434
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,519
compete things that might be negative to

435
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,959
plant performances like molds and stuff

436
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,159
like that um so yeah it it really is a

437
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:49,799
whole system of of uh effects you know

438
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:52,679
different different building blocks U

439
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,000
from the bio stimulant world will help

440
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,519
different areas of the plant as you

441
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,600
mentioned and um yeah it's it's it's a

442
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,720
fun big umbrella term because there's so

443
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,040
much going on underneath the the

444
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,038
umbrella that is bio stimulant mhm it's

445
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:08,078
also sounds like it's a very fine line

446
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:10,038
between bio stimulant and nutrition um

447
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,599
because some of the you know some of the

448
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:15,959
positive attributes that you mentioned

449
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:17,399
from seaweed extracts are different um

450
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,759
you know

451
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,360
nutritive um substances is is there a

452
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:25,759
line is there a scientific line between

453
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,798
nutrition and bio stimulants or or do

454
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,240
they kind of like SE into each other a

455
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,558
lot of times

456
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,960
I think the line is maybe dotted as

457
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:35,519
opposed to uh you know less of a

458
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,038
gradient less of a firm line um where

459
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,558
that where a lot of biostimulant

460
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:42,200
compounds can have some form of NPK or

461
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,599
even micronutrients in there um but then

462
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,480
when we look at Plant Nutrition those

463
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,119
are products with NPK is almost the

464
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,200
biggest number on the label besides the

465
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,798
product name for the most part um so

466
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,558
that's kind of how I see the separation

467
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,119
between you know nutritional inputs

468
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,960
versus bio stimulant based inputs but it

469
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,479
is kind of a gray area or a gradient

470
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,798
where you have some trickling effect of

471
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,000
of the um you know amino acid type bio

472
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:07,038
stimulants having some some form of NP

473
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,640
or K in them as well yeah at using that

474
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:12,640
definition it bio stimulant becomes

475
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,720
really really close to

476
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,559
um like like Trace nutrients and trace

477
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,400
minerals it's like oh if if you're not

478
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:21,960
talking about NPK and you're just

479
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,000
talking about everything else you're

480
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,919
you're talking about you know bio

481
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,038
stimulants um including things that we

482
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:34,679
don't get in in you know kind of

483
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:37,400
targeted generic fertilizers that we add

484
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:42,038
because we want to round out the ri the

485
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:45,120
risos spere with with um essential

486
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,679
micros yeah absolutely and um one other

487
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,918
thing to mention too is is you know

488
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,480
whether or not uh well another another

489
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,559
reason I guess that the the line between

490
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,519
nutrition and bio stimulation is maybe a

491
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,240
little bit more blurry at this point in

492
00:18:54,519 --> 00:19:00,000
science uh is because things like um

493
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,839
certain bacteria have enzymes to unlock

494
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,759
uh unavailable forms of phosphorus such

495
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,839
as calcium phosphate so unavailable for

496
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,079
plant uptake um so you know there's no

497
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,439
nutrition in in that type of bacterial

498
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,879
product but it can help unlock nutrition

499
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,360
that might already be in your soil um

500
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,960
things like mizal products too I think

501
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:21,158
from what I've seen um also sometimes

502
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,759
have a a phosphorus content as well so

503
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,159
um you know somebody might apply a micro

504
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,919
risal product for the first time and see

505
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,919
a really great uh you know flowering

506
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,759
boost in their cannabis plants and it's

507
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,360
hard to attribute that to the mic rizy

508
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,759
being present or the The increased

509
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:35,678
amount of phosphorus being also

510
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,400
available for the plant or or probably

511
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,000
both yeah I wish that when we tried a

512
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,960
whole bunch of new things at the same

513
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,079
time and we get good results we could

514
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,679
just straight up ask the plant which one

515
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,000
caused it my

516
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,159
friend that would be amazing and yeah I

517
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,640
want I want to talk to the soil

518
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:53,440
microbiome as well I'm looking forward

519
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,840
to those developments maybe with AI

520
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,519
there we go so uh before we move on from

521
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:02,038
bio stimulants um Let's uh let's bring

522
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,119
this conversation and make it like real

523
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:07,599
um real rubber hits the road so for for

524
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,119
the cultivators who are listening um who

525
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,558
are like okay I understand the

526
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,558
difference between the synthetic and the

527
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,279
bio stimulants as much as we can get to

528
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,440
definitionally I like the idea of

529
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,038
offering natural bio stimulants to my

530
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,759
plants um what are some that you

531
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:26,279
recommend from the natural world that

532
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:28,519
regenerative farmers can um use at home

533
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,678
that will have you know reliably good

534
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:32,639
effects you know some of some of the

535
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,640
stuff is so obscure and its impact is so

536
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,038
small that you can have a debate about

537
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,919
whether some of these did anything at

538
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:40,240
all in particular but but what are a

539
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,640
couple like tried and true naturally

540
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,400
occurring bio stimulants that um that

541
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,600
our listeners can um you know explore

542
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,960
for for pretty assured benefit yeah I

543
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:51,079
mean I think a lot of it really depends

544
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,798
on where your plants are going to be

545
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:54,960
going if it's going into a hydroponic or

546
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,839
controlled environmental system um

547
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,759
versus a soil system um you know plays a

548
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,639
role but but I am biased to the the soil

549
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,119
microbes and the root adhering microbes

550
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,559
or the plant growth promoting microbes

551
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,879
so we're we he at shaping fire so yeah

552
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:09,480
absolutely uh so yeah I mean from what

553
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,960
from what I've seen in both research and

554
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,759
at home cultivation uh the sooner

555
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,400
microbes get introduced to a plant rout

556
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,359
um I like to think about it as a really

557
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,320
good protective and enhancing form uh

558
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,240
one of my favorite analogies here is

559
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:24,879
think of that that radical that that

560
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,558
firstly emerged plant root from your

561
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,400
seed or your clone um being like an

562
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:33,000
empty seat at a table with you know

563
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,120
let's say 100 seats um the the plant is

564
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,960
going to be exuding root exibits all

565
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,359
over that table and um through the roots

566
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,519
and those are basically like adding

567
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,079
different types of food sources to the

568
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,278
the table here um the sooner that those

569
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,480
seats of the table can be colonized with

570
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,919
plant benefiting or soil ecology

571
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,038
benefiting or even just free living uh

572
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:54,480
microorganisms um maybe not colonized

573
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,400
but present and taking up space and

574
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,159
competing for resources the more likely

575
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,679
um the cultiv Ator uh would be you know

576
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,278
not seeing things like plant disease um

577
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,480
the if the seats can be full filled with

578
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:09,400
things like plant- benefiting

579
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,960
microorganisms um whether they're from a

580
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,200
compost system living soil uh indigenous

581
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,038
microorganism cultivating uh or even a

582
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,558
biological inoculant you can buy on a

583
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:21,519
shelf I think that is probably the best

584
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:24,359
way to really Prime young or new plants

585
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,798
for uh you know a successful Harvest

586
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:29,079
cycle um filling those seats up with the

587
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,639
table uh allowing resources to be used

588
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:32,240
by things that are maybe symbiotic or

589
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,038
mutualist with the plants to you know

590
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,880
the benefit is is a feedback loop um

591
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,480
whereas a pathogen might only you know

592
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,000
consume a root exit it until it can get

593
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,558
in high enough numbers to penetrate the

594
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,240
plant cell and then become pathogenic uh

595
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,359
the less seats at that table that are

596
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,200
for things like fusarium or phyo or

597
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:51,918
pythium um the less likely uh you know

598
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,319
that plant is going to have a negative

599
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,240
effect I really like that seats at a

600
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:59,720
table uh um example that I can really

601
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:03,480
Envision that and so so your first

602
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:07,278
answer is to you know add a bunch of uh

603
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,759
you know of of indigenous microbes um so

604
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:12,079
that the seats of the table can get

605
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:15,599
filled with um with probiotic folks

606
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:17,839
before anything pathogenic shows up and

607
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,678
um you uh and there's a you know there's

608
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,038
a there's a there's a range of ways that

609
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,559
we talk about on this show to add

610
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,640
microbes and and and you're like just

611
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:31,839
you know add them add them right away as

612
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,799
soon as as soon as the plant starts um

613
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,278
for the second one is there something

614
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:38,798
that might be more nutrition based

615
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:41,159
instead of like having good neighbors

616
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:44,038
based like microbes that you would also

617
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:46,720
recommend as a um naturally occurring

618
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:48,558
bio stimulant yeah so I think my my bias

619
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,120
is really going to show with this answer

620
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:51,480
but um uh you know I talked about the

621
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:53,000
probiotics right I also think the

622
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,720
prebiotics are just as important

623
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,880
especially in in soilless systems or or

624
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,880
you know uh near sterile systems right

625
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,400
Hydroponics and things like that um

626
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,520
plants evolve roots with their

627
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,840
relationships with microbes uh Dr White

628
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:08,119
and all of his research surrounding

629
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,879
riseof Fiji has really been a beneficial

630
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:12,759
disruption in in agricultural research

631
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,120
and I think that uh a lot of Growers

632
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:15,879
have tried really hard to maintain a

633
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,158
sterile system which you know your

634
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,760
plants don't want sterile systems

635
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,919
they're often you know exuding uh cakes

636
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,640
and cookies sugars and carbon into the

637
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,038
the surrounding soils to try to get

638
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,600
microbes to colonize there so uh a long

639
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,960
way to answer your question I think like

640
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:33,240
prebiotics things like organic materials

641
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,240
humic fulvic acids um we know what those

642
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,200
can do to benefit the plant and and how

643
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,640
they are benefiting the soil microbiome

644
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,720
and how that's benefiting the plant is

645
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,919
still being kind of flushed out um but I

646
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,480
do think that uh your plants are going

647
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:47,759
to benefit from these compounds that

648
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,839
you're applying whether or not they're

649
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,158
for the plant or the bacteria and uh

650
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,278
usually the application rates from

651
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,679
things whether you're whipping up a

652
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:58,440
compost tea or doing like a a plant

653
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,440
extract or purchasing something um

654
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,240
there's enough to go around for both the

655
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,519
plants and the microbes fantastic I love

656
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,200
that when we keep on coming back to you

657
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:11,440
know grab plants that are already in

658
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:14,120
your yard and let them um decay in water

659
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,840
you know spin that for 36 hours and then

660
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:18,959
pour that back on your plants I love

661
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,599
that cycle bringing back um you know

662
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,880
what's already in your yard the plants

663
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:25,319
the grass clippings the forest Duff

664
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,360
whatever it is incubate it for a little

665
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:28,879
bit to make those microbes super

666
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,918
abundant and then just pour it back on

667
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,399
your

668
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,278
plants yes absolutely yeah I mean that

669
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:37,000
and it's it's always you know a fun term

670
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:40,759
is like kind of bioprospecting being out

671
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,440
um in in soil in the woods in the forest

672
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:44,319
or anywhere that you know it's okay to

673
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,679
kind of I'm going to use the word sample

674
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,839
from um I know you guys have talked

675
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:52,759
about indigenous microorganisms here um

676
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:56,158
but yeah like the the ability to kind of

677
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:59,960
collect some microbial diversity um from

678
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,120
maybe a forest or uh somebody with a

679
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,159
better historical soil Health practice

680
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:05,639
than maybe the plot you inherited um is

681
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,840
also a great way to you know add that

682
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,278
microbial diversity um if you you know

683
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,319
we have these like Notions of of plant

684
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,000
micro symbiosis uh in science where you

685
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,398
know we want to look at a really happy

686
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,079
cannabis plant and then collect some

687
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:20,558
soil microbes from its roots and then

688
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,000
take that home and apply it to our

689
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:23,918
cannabis plants so they do well too um

690
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,798
but there's a lot of functional

691
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,200
redundancy in the the risos spere

692
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:30,960
microbiome World whether that's a tree

693
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,600
or a cannabis plant or some grass um so

694
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,640
you might even be able to get some type

695
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:36,558
of beneficial microbial function from

696
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,960
sampling something like grass uh and

697
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,440
applying it to your to your home grow or

698
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,038
you know making a compost tea out of it

699
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,000
or a soil slurry right on so uh so dear

700
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:49,240
listener if you're very interested in in

701
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,398
moving uh these microbes around um sit

702
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,960
tight because we're going to be coming

703
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:55,479
back to this topic again with set two or

704
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,519
in set two so Michael um I want to move

705
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,200
us on past bio stimulants now uh to what

706
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:03,359
I consider one of their cousins that I

707
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,000
know less about which is uh plant growth

708
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:09,319
regulators and you know I I first got

709
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,960
turned on to uh plant growth Regulators

710
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:16,439
kind of as a as a slur as a disc when I

711
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,840
would come across like really rock hard

712
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,600
um indoor rockwool Buds and that that

713
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:25,038
you know I I would squeeze them and as a

714
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:27,038
you know as a as a lifelong outdoor

715
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,879
grower when you squeeze my flowers

716
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,079
there's there's some give to them

717
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,278
whereas these were like like literally

718
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:35,558
rocks and I was all like what what kind

719
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:38,079
of cannabis is this right and people are

720
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:40,960
like you know because I tend to hang out

721
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:43,119
with you know organic farmers they'd say

722
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,640
something like ah it's those pgrs that

723
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,239
they use you know and I'm like I don't

724
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,360
know what those are but but I I

725
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,599
certainly don't want any part of that

726
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:53,678
and and over time I realize it's true

727
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:55,719
that synthetic pgrs and and what they

728
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,200
have a tendency to do to the plant are

729
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,519
not something that I'm normally going

730
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,000
for but then I started to realize um

731
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:06,440
while while studying the soil food web

732
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,319
that there are actually naturally

733
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,960
occurring um biochemicals in plants that

734
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:17,079
um you know that we can Wildcraft that

735
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,840
also are pro um plant growth Regulators

736
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:22,599
so that maybe you can get you know

737
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:25,119
harder flowers that have got a a market

738
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:28,119
attraction and an aesthetic attraction

739
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:30,000
in ways that don't also um

740
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:31,759
you know injure the plant and make it

741
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,558
you know need to be grown in a sterile

742
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,038
environment instead of the yard so so so

743
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:37,839
I'm going to ask you number one would

744
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:41,679
you would you would you explain for us

745
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:45,519
what plant growth Regulators are and um

746
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:48,278
where we may find them in uh the natural

747
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,720
world yeah um so the way I kind of

748
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:53,398
understand plant growth Regulators would

749
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,159
be just kind of um hormones uh the the

750
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,719
plant hormones things like oxin

751
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,399
gibberellins cyto canines and uh you

752
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,600
know natural sources of those things

753
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:08,239
like seaweed is a really U common input

754
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:09,199
used for cyto in uh pgrs um I think um

755
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,240
like we talked about a little bit

756
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,278
earlier uh you know when you do the

757
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,038
wildcrafting and you do the natural Pro

758
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:17,119
uh process and and take your plant

759
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:19,319
inputs or get materials and do the

760
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,599
extraction yourself you are likely

761
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:23,480
getting things that might be missed as

762
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,398
opposed to when an oxin is purified in a

763
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,038
lab and dried out into a powder and then

764
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:30,119
you know mailed to you in a tube to dip

765
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,919
your plant roots in before rooting them

766
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:34,558
um yeah I mean the way I kind of see

767
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,559
them would just be plant hormones uh

768
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,240
whether they're natural or synthetic I

769
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:40,038
think they can be helpful for Growers

770
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,480
and you know helpful for making uh

771
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:43,000
deadlines and yield improvements and

772
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,960
quality improvements and things like

773
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,839
that um but uh yeah I I still kind of am

774
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,558
in the school of thought of you know

775
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:54,959
these these natural processes like

776
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:56,158
breaking down uh organic inputs um would

777
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,319
we're probably missing something when

778
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,480
we're applying just the pure com

779
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:02,240
compound but uh further you know science

780
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,240
needs to prove that so so for talking

781
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,200
about you know getting these oxin and

782
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,278
cyto and gibin and and and putting them

783
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,319
on and they we're getting them from

784
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:13,079
Plants it sounds awful lot like we're

785
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,278
talking about bio stimulants again and

786
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:17,798
and and and perhaps there is an argument

787
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:21,278
to be made that plant growth regulators

788
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:25,278
and natural bio stimulants are all in

789
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:27,839
the bucket of plants that have got

790
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:30,599
chemicals hormones and Nutri

791
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,839
that are also used by the cannabis plant

792
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:34,480
that we just want to Wildcraft or what's

793
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:36,798
that term you used

794
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,759
bioprospect um you know on our

795
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:42,480
properties and and then just allow them

796
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:45,879
to either degrade in their basic form or

797
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,720
incubate them with you know oxygen and

798
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,799
then apply them to our plants it it

799
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,720
sounds like it's the same system just

800
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,319
using different vocabulary yeah I would

801
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,759
agree with you on that I do think like

802
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:59,558
you know the pgr term fits fits nicely

803
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,839
underneath the umbrella term that is bio

804
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:03,798
stimulants in my world um and maybe the

805
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:08,839
world uh but yeah you know you think

806
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:11,079
about um how these compounds

807
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:12,599
um mainly you know the plant is

808
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:14,678
naturally producing these things when it

809
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:17,079
needs Roots there's oxin being produced

810
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:20,240
inside the plant um to to Signal those

811
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:22,918
Mar stem cells to turn into Roots um but

812
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,359
having you know furthered science in

813
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:26,919
agriculture we as Growers can can use

814
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,278
these things to get effects that we want

815
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,600
to I know um in a lot of the ornamental

816
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:33,240
crop industry things like uh anti-

817
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,879
gibberellins are sprayed on you know

818
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,319
flowers to keep them like tight and uh

819
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,679
you know not too laggy or stretched out

820
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,839
from the pot that way they make a nice

821
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,919
compact bushy you know poinsetta or

822
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,439
Zenia or something like that um so yeah

823
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,919
it's interesting to think about the use

824
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,600
of pgrs in products that are going to be

825
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,759
consumed by people rather than just

826
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,319
enjoyed by uh like aesthetically like

827
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,158
flowers and and things like that um and

828
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,000
I think

829
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,200
um I need to do more reading on on you

830
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,960
know the the the uh the consumption of

831
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,798
things that might be residual on flour

832
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,480
if the plant wasn't able to use all them

833
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:12,038
and or even just surfactants to get them

834
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,240
to spread as well so when I had talked

835
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:18,079
with other regenerative Farmers about

836
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,159
the naturally occurring pgrs that they

837
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:23,558
use I only have ever gotten one response

838
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,080
either either the farmers don't think of

839
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:27,879
them in that way and so they're just

840
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:31,558
using degraded plant you know compost

841
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,679
teas or or spun erated teas so they

842
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:35,440
they'll either say nothing they don't

843
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,919
they don't use one intentionally or they

844
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,759
will say banana peels and so so um are

845
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,320
is there any oh this is kind of a nice

846
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:48,398
pun is there any lwh hanging fruit that

847
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:51,200
you recommend where where we can go for

848
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:53,439
um the the hormones that have the effect

849
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,880
on the cannabis plant that we're looking

850
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,200
for so we don't have to go to synthetics

851
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,799
for example if if we want tighter

852
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,080
flowers and a more compact overall plant

853
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:05,918
uh do we want to go to a banana peel or

854
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,278
are there things that we may have access

855
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,000
to that you think might be um you know

856
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:12,679
better for us to go after yeah I think

857
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,558
ultimately I don't have any sort of

858
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:15,960
materials off the top of my head on on

859
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,480
things like anti- gibberellins I know

860
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,319
seaweed is a good one for cytokinin um I

861
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,599
think people have used uh you know

862
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,000
Honeys for for auxins whether that's I'm

863
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:26,000
not sure if that's actually a root

864
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,880
increaser or if it's just a good

865
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,278
antimicrobial for or uh you know

866
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,278
pathogens that might infect the plant

867
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:35,398
before it can root um but yeah I mean I

868
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:37,880
I'm a huge composter um and I'm a big

869
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:39,158
fan of vermac compost as well yeah um so

870
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,200
I think you know doing that stuff in the

871
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:43,000
backyard when space allows uh there's

872
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,480
indoor systems that are really great too

873
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,159
I have a a friend that did like a three

874
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,200
bucket stack system where the worms were

875
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,519
in the the bottom the new food waste

876
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,240
went in the top and when they ran out of

877
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,200
food they would kind of dig up and kind

878
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,079
of make it a closed loop system so there

879
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,240
are ways to kind of get those organic

880
00:33:55,079 --> 00:34:00,480
materials broken down depending on um

881
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,319
the space you might have um yeah I you

882
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,919
know the other kind of school of thought

883
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,439
too is when I was a lot younger I I was

884
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,119
always told you know dig a whole six or

885
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,320
seven feet underground bury a couple

886
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,800
dead fish there and that's where we'll

887
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,879
plant our cannabis plants the following

888
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,760
Spring right in the fall uh and it's

889
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:17,440
been cool to kind of enter more of the

890
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,079
sciency realm of this kind of stuff and

891
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,440
seeing like oh well yeah the fish breaks

892
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:25,399
down into ammonium or some form of nh4

893
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,918
or 3 um and the emulsions and you know

894
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:29,000
they they provide nutrition from those

895
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:30,239
break down products um so I just just

896
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,878
one thing that I love about the Cannabis

897
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,918
science Industry is or just cannabis

898
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:37,799
science in general is kind of seeing um

899
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:40,799
you know old school of thought Growers

900
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:43,119
with these really wise practices that we

901
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,159
are just now starting to understand uh

902
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,919
and can be measured scientifically with

903
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,280
with you know how does a fish break down

904
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,039
in the soil and what types of plant

905
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:54,359
inputs does it turn into yeah all all of

906
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:56,239
this old school um cultivation magic you

907
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:58,440
know eventually science catches up with

908
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,199
it and it's like oh oh yeah I guess I

909
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,920
guess you know the old hippies were

910
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:03,759
right in what they were doing absolutely

911
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,880
it's like yeah yeah everything old is

912
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,480
new again so right on well uh let's

913
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,320
let's wrap up this first set here um

914
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,199
we're going to take a short break and be

915
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,680
right back you are listening to shaping

916
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,139
fire and my guest today is

917
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,719
microbiologist Michael

918
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:21,319
[Music]

919
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,959
Deli revenue is tight for cannabis

920
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,960
businesses right now there is no

921
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,119
question about it and when Revenue

922
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,559
tightens businesses need to spend and

923
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,480
smarter on Advertising instead of

924
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:33,400
throwing obscene money at Hanging your

925
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,838
company's logo from the rafters at your

926
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,559
next convention perhaps consider placing

927
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:40,639
commercials on shaping fire and if you

928
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,519
are a very small business there is

929
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,078
simply no better bang for your buck than

930
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:46,679
commercials on shaping fire especially

931
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,960
if your products are for regeneratively

932
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:50,318
minded

933
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,119
cultivators advertising on this show

934
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:54,559
allows us time to talk about your

935
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,160
product service or brand in a way that

936
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,759
really lets people know what sets your

937
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,679
company apart from the others bold

938
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,319
people who own companies know that

939
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:04,919
getting into relationship with their

940
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:07,519
customers is essential that is what we

941
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,240
offer we will explain your service or

942
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,119
product what sets it apart as desirable

943
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,559
and help our audience get in contact

944
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,000
with you it's pretty simple really

945
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:18,880
advertising does not have to be all

946
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,318
whizbang smoke and mirrors nowadays I

947
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,318
find that people prefer just to be

948
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:25,559
spoken to calmly accurately and with

949
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:28,239
good intentions if you want to make your

950
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,279
own commercial spot you can do that too

951
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,000

952
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,119
reach your customers in the privacy of

953
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,079
their headphones right now and will

972
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,640
more as cannabis regulations become more

973
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,880
demanding and consumers become more

974
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,598
educated it is increasingly important to

975
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,119
avoid the use of chemical pesticides

976
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,079
when cultivating cannabis beneficial

977
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,039
insects have been used for decades by

978
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,519
the greenhouse vegetable and ornamental

979
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,279
plant industry and today many cannabis

980
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,800
cultivators are moving from sprays and

981
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,960
chemicals to beneficial insects copert

air distribution units you need to

985
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,159
partner with nature to defend your

00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,119
garden whether you manage Acres of

canopy or have a simple grow tent in

1014
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:56,960
today there are so many seed banks

1015
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,480
nowadays that you really really have

1016
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,400
options in who to choose not only that

1017
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,800
if you pick the wrong seed bank you

1018
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,760
could be in for a really sketchy ride

1019
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,440
and that's only one of the reasons I

1020

recommend Gas Lamp seeds to my friends

00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:07,799
shaping fire I am your host Shango Los

1066
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,240
and my guest today is microbiologist

1067
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,760
Michael Deli so during the first set we

1068
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:15,959
talked all about um bio stimulant and

1069
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:18,400
where to find them and nature as well as

1070
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,639
um the idea of plant growth regulators

1071
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,760
and we kept on coming back to this idea

1072
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:25,960
that um what we want to do to help um

1073
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,800
our cannabis plants the most is to help

1074
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,400
the isosphere to make sure that the

1075
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,960
nutrition and variety of microbes are

1076
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:37,240
incredibly varied um are are indigenous

1077
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,280
so that they survive in our local

1078
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:42,759
natural environment and that we can

1079
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,280
bioprospect them all over our own

1080
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,760
property and near us uh by just going to

1081
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,839
other plants that we already have

1082
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,680
locally and um not only does that save

1083
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:52,920
us money but we know that these plants

1084
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:55,679
that are already surviving locally are

1085
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,159
already covered in um indigenous

1086
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,639
microorganisms M so saves US money and

1087
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:03,480
is exactly the tool for the job to help

1088
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:05,318
you have your best grow ever so here in

1089
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,519
set two we're going to talk about the

1090
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:09,800
care and tending of the microbe

1091
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:12,559
Community that's in your rizosphere

1092
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:15,400
right so these are these are um all of

1093
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:18,880
the residents of the rizosphere the root

1094
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:21,680
Zone um that make up the the the the

1095
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,480
soil food web that is within the soil as

1096
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,440
we all know the the soil food web also

1097
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,400
is above the soil and it also takes

1098
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,440
place in water but specifically we're

1099
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,559
talking about this this neighborhood of

1100
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:38,920
the roots of the cannabis plant so when

1101
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:41,920
I was listening to Michael delie on um

1102
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:44,159
our friend Leighton Morrison's show um

1103
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,639
um uh he and I guess I guess I'm talking

1104
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,358
to the audience Michael and to you kind

1105
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:53,879
of third person you you were talking on

1106
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:57,519
leighton's show um about your um uh uh

1107
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:00,960
love of of bi bio which we're big fans

1108
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:03,679
of on the show as well and and um and

1109
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,679
and I really liked how you kind of

1110
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:09,078
anthropomorphized uh the microbes CU you

1111
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:11,358
were talking about how um uh how biochar

1112
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:13,760
has got all these like you know ridges

1113
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:16,199
and places to live and and they've got

1114
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,160
these um these these environments that

1115
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:21,439
the the microbes can set up housing and

1116
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:23,118
and and where their nutrition grows and

1117
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,599
and how it just kind of makes like for

1118
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,280
this perfect neighborhood and and I

1119
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:31,160
always like to think about my pots that

1120
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:33,040
way too or or you know the soil that

1121
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:36,318
that I want to make a good neighborhood

1122
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:39,358
for my plants to grow EV been as well so

1123
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,519
so so you you and I clearly enjoy

1124
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:44,279
anthropomorphizing microbes which which

1125
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:46,440
I can support um let's go ahead and

1126
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,400
start just kind of generally with this

1127
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,760
idea of of creating neighborhoods that

1128
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,480
have got the kinds of attributes in the

1129
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:59,000
soil that um that these neighborhoods

1130
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:02,719
can build on what is the nature of soil

1131
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,159
structure that makes good rizosphere

1132
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:08,399
I think a good balance of um sand silt

1133
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,039
and Clay obviously is is a great way to

1134
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,400
you know that definition of soil makes a

1135
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:13,119
good structure for the microbes to

1136
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,400
colonize but I think a really important

1137
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,119
thing that is often overlooked uh would

1138
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,358
be things that we call Max Mac

1139
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,880
microbially forms of accessible carbon

1140
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:24,159
or microb accessible carbon um your

1141
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,720
plants are you know constantly

1142
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:28,440
depositing these things into the soil

1143
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:30,838
through Ro exits uh as well as you know

1144
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,920
any organic matter um and different

1145
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:35,119
types of breakdown processes in soil or

1146
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,400
other systems um can provide these forms

1147
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,079
of Max uh carbon sources food sources

1148
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:42,160
for the microbes to be in there um you

1149
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,000
know biochar being carbon based is a

1150
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:47,719
really great form of this other things

1151
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,920
like full urines and um um different

1152
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:50,399
like you know cellulous breakdown

1153
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,680
products are another great way to kind

1154
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:57,639
of feed microbes in the

1155
00:44:53,679 --> 00:45:01,039
soil so um so is the

1156
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:03,159
primary uh is the primary I'll say the

1157
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:04,558
first not the only but is the primary

1158
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:06,920
attribute of creating a good

1159
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:08,720
neighborhood making sure that there's

1160
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,039
lots of these Max around so there's

1161
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,759
always high quality carbon for them to

1162
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,159
eat like at the top of the list I would

1163
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,200
I would put that at the top of the list

1164
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:19,399
just because uh if you apply something

1165
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:21,118
like a biological to a a near sterile

1166
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,160
system I I'll never call a hydroponic

1167
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,720
system sterile um just because there's

1168
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:27,719
microbes everywhere microbial ubiquity

1169
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:29,519
uh but we do have you know the the

1170
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:32,318
notion of a lot of that stuff can be

1171
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,759
wasted if there's not food sources to to

1172
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:35,679
feed the microbes you know you hear

1173
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,880
about with your gut and gut health

1174
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:39,558
prebiotics with probiotics um that's you

1175
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,440
know feeding also the things that might

1176
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,400
be resonant to your system whether or

1177
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,679
not they're applied uh from a bottle or

1178
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:50,599
from uh indigenous microorganism

1179
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:53,318
hunting so so what are um sources of

1180
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:55,079
these Macs that we can Wildcraft and and

1181
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:58,039
how do we how do we process them into it

1182
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,079
I mean the you know the biochar um you

1183
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:02,719
know we can use as a soil amendment and

1184
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:05,000
some people like to crush it up and and

1185
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:07,118
um and you know top dress it into their

1186
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,280
water so it slowly Works their way in

1187
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,079
but give us give us some more idea of

1188
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,200
how to think about these Macs and and

1189
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:16,400
where we can bioprospect them into our

1190
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:18,679
cultivation absolutely yeah I mean I

1191
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,240
think um I'm going to do a call back to

1192
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:22,519
bio stimulants right there's a lots of

1193
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:24,879
Max uh in different tiers of BIOS

1194
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:27,079
stimulant products or or uh things that

1195
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,358
you can get or proc naturally with

1196
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:32,599
wildcrafting um and essentially you know

1197
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:34,799
the uh the plant is also feeding your

1198
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:36,359
microbes so as long as your plants are

1199
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,760
Health uh maintained Optimal Health and

1200
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:40,159
nutrition there's going to be some

1201
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,720
source of of Max in the system from the

1202
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:44,480
roote exodites too um but you will you

1203
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,239
know plants also can re-uptake root

1204
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,960
exodites uh so there is a degree of

1205
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:49,879
plant microbe competition for these food

1206
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:53,318
sources um but going back to that kind

1207
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:55,480
of old uh wisdom cultivation uh you know

1208
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:57,159
thinking um people that I hear a lot of

1209
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,159
people have really strong opinions about

1210
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:02,719
applying molasses as a as a input and

1211
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,000
during flower um and I've always kind of

1212
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,799
understood that as we're feeding the

1213
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,480
soil microbes rather than we're you know

1214
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,039
giving sugar to help increase flour

1215
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,519
synthesis or something like that yeah

1216
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,358
yeah we've we've talked on the show many

1217
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:17,159
times how you know the adding of

1218
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:20,759
molasses into the pot um what you're

1219
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:22,558
doing is throwing your your um your pot

1220
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,839
out of balance what you want to do is if

1221
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,559
you're going to use the Molasses is feed

1222
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:30,279
the feed the micro in your in your air

1223
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:32,920
rated compros Brewer let them eat the

1224
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,559
Molasses there and incubate them so now

1225
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,400
you have a whole bunch of them and then

1226
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:41,920
put that compost tea That's not hot

1227
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:43,599
anymore into your your rizosphere is is

1228
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,159
that the are those the steps that you're

1229
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,119
referring to yeah yeah I think that that

1230
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,879
is probably the best practice to do it

1231
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:51,838
um for those who you know aren't able to

1232
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,599
kind of have the lead time to brew up a

1233
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:55,838
compost tea and and feed it sugar and

1234
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,760
whatnot I think um just a very diluted

1235
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:59,400
form an irrigation solution can also

1236
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,000
kind of benefit those those microbes

1237
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,200
that might be in your roots right on I

1238
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
want to push you a little bit on

1239
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:06,759
specificity because you said that there

1240
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,599
are um you know various plants that we

1241
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:13,920
can Wildcraft where we can get the max

1242
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:15,720
from um just for examples to get us

1243
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,200
started because we all know that we can

1244
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:20,879
like you know Google it or ask GPT or

1245
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:24,118
something but from you will you give us

1246
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,318
three Mac Rich plants that we might be

1247
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:28,039
able to Wildcraft just so you know

1248
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:30,558
people who just want to jump on it know

1249
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:30,558
what where to

1250
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:35,199
start you know I think um I'm always

1251
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,119
going to go back to compost and those

1252
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:40,199
breakdown processes um I I would when I

1253
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:41,318
say you know you ask for specific plants

1254
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:43,799
I don't know that I have any of those

1255
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:46,719
off the top of my list but um I I think

1256
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:49,880
you know carbon and nitrogen sources uh

1257
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:52,558
essentially um can help increase

1258
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,079
available Max uh whether whether or not

1259
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,960
they are being added to your system or

1260
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,119
the nutrients you know the compost pile

1261
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,920
or something like that provided um but

1262
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:01,519
in terms of kind of going out and and

1263
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,039
foraging up a bunch of plants and making

1264
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:04,798
a tea out of that I uh I would have to

1265
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:06,880
do somewh research right on you know

1266
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:09,519
your your hesitation kind of like

1267
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,400
suddenly Rec contextualized everything

1268
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:15,039
for me is is it potentially the answer

1269
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,720
to the question I asked that um these

1270
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:19,558
Macs are in everything because carbon is

1271
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:23,519
a building block so so long as I'm

1272
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:26,040
starting with a a local healthy thriving

1273
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:28,679
plant it's going to have Max in it

1274
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:31,119
so just use whatever I have a lot of

1275
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:33,598
around me and use a variety of plants

1276
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,280
that are around me and then if I want to

1277
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:39,359
up it will then go ahead and do some

1278
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:42,760
online research and find out the types

1279
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:44,480
of plants that are more rich in Mac but

1280
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,599
it it I'm starting to get the idea since

1281
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,358
we keep on coming back to compost that

1282
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:52,039
the Macs are everywhere and and so just

1283
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:54,119
use whatever you have yeah yeah I would

1284
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:55,759
agree with that thank you um and another

1285
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:57,680
kind of way to put it you know is or

1286
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,160
another I guess using whatever you have

1287
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:00,639
should should be used with caution a

1288
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:02,759
little bit as as a lot of people know

1289
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:04,719
you know if you look for broken down

1290
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,000
dried out plant material um you want to

1291
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:07,919
make sure that didn't come from anything

1292
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,719
diseased uh obviously you know you'd

1293
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,318
want that to be fully broken down in a

1294
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:14,598
composting system or a heat breakdown

1295
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:16,119
type of format uh before you add

1296
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:18,359
something that might be you know

1297
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:20,079
degraded a you know a leaf loss due to a

1298
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:21,279
zanth theonis bacteria in the leaf or

1299
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,280
something like that right we don't want

1300
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,079
to reintroduce that to our system but um

1301
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,440
you know plant health is very important

1302
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,240
too when you're when you're kind of

1303
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,079
wildcrafting right on all that to say

1304
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:33,919
all right so so when we're talking about

1305
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,079
the care intending of microbes obviously

1306
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:39,599
we want to include a lot of these Macs

1307
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:43,798
so that there there's a a varied Buffet

1308
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:46,720
all through the rizosphere um for for um

1309
00:50:43,798 --> 00:50:51,000
uh for all the varieties of of of

1310
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:51,919
residents to eat so so let's go um so so

1311
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,440
long as you think we've covered that

1312
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,838
well enough let's go beyond the

1313
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,798
nutrition for the microbes eating the

1314
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:02,440
carbon and let's talk about some of the

1315
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:06,599
other um attributes of soil structure

1316
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:10,079
that might also be um um beneficial to

1317
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:13,760
to the risos spere and and again I might

1318
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:16,359
be over anthropomorphizing here but in

1319
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:20,079
my notes I put like shelter reproduction

1320
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:24,000
space you know you know um uh noncarbon

1321
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:27,240
nutrition like like the idea of shelter

1322
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,400
may not actually exist exists in soil in

1323
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:33,838
the rizosphere but but it seems like it

1324
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,240
should exist there because you have got

1325
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:38,599
more more Predator residence in the

1326
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:42,639
biosphere and more passive residents in

1327
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:44,798
the biosphere and and you know normally

1328
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,879
life forms need to take shelter when

1329
00:51:44,798 --> 00:51:50,119
they reproduce and so you know I I'm

1330
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:53,280
very willing to be very wrong on this

1331
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:56,039
right but but is it tell us a little bit

1332
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,680
about how the community interacts

1333
00:51:56,039 --> 00:52:00,719
and if there are attributes of our soil

1334
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:02,598
and amendments that that potentially

1335
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:04,959
provide more of this shelter and

1336
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:07,798
reproduction space and non-carbon

1337
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,318
nutrition absolutely yeah I mean I think

1338
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:11,559
uh the best place for plants to

1339
00:52:09,318 --> 00:52:13,199
overwinter um in terms of seasonal

1340
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:15,119
changes would be in the roots and in the

1341
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:17,159
in the kind of sketi plant bodies that

1342
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,079
are no longer actively growing um that's

1343
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:21,358
a great place for microbes to overwinter

1344
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:22,480
and be ready to uh be introduced to your

1345
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:23,880
plants when you're planting them in the

1346
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,679
springtime and then I just do want to

1347
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,720
Circle back a little bit on the ma stuff

1348
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:30,000
and say one more thing um I want to go

1349
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:31,798
back to I want to quote Dr elain Ingam

1350
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,440
from the soil food web and say you know

1351
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:36,079
what do microbes love uh sugars right

1352
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,920
and that's why the cakes and cookies

1353
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:39,680
that are the root exodites are really

1354
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,639
kind of you know being deposited by the

1355
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:44,118
plants in theory to to colonize or

1356
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:45,400
recruit microbes to the to the root Zone

1357
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,358
um the other thing that I wanted to

1358
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:50,639
mention was going back to that that big

1359
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:52,880
Open Table analogy with empty seats um

1360
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:56,318
another kind of enhancement of this

1361
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:59,280
theory is is like uh if that table is

1362
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:01,039
being catered and and there is only you

1363
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,559
know slabs of meat being put on that

1364
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:04,880
table only only uh you know carnivore

1365
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:06,798
type people are going to be sitting down

1366
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,640
there to consume that stuff right so we

1367
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:12,039
also want to provide a lot of diverse

1368
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:14,440
inputs of of Max whether that is uh

1369
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:16,558
different types of compost tea or sugar

1370
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,318
sugars like molasses or you know just

1371
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,440
comp uh broken down leaves and pine

1372
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:22,159
straw and stuff like that um but the

1373
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,960
important thing is by providing a lot of

1374
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:26,440
different forms of microbial accessible

1375
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,159
carbon we're feeding uh lots of

1376
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:31,318
different functional microbes in the

1377
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:33,239
soil right so if if there's um if that

1378
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:34,838
table's being catered with vegetables

1379
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:36,558
meat and a little bit of both we're

1380
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:38,639
going to have omnivores vegetarians

1381
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:41,119
vegans and and carnivores all sitting at

1382
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,400
that table uh the same applies in my in

1383
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,400
my head at least to the plant roots

1384
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,000
right so if the the Tomato root is only

1385
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:50,119
exuding the the same compounds tomato

1386
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,480
plants exude then only a few types of

1387
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:52,798
microbes or functional microbes are

1388
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,679
going to be able to use those food

1389
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:57,960
sources um so the grower can kind of

1390
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:59,719
apply different forms of Max molasses

1391
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:02,240
compost stuff like that or even

1392
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:04,558
companion planting um to provide a lot

1393
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,199
of different food sources because uh the

1394
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,680
general thinking in microbiome science

1395
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:11,879
is uh health is very closely associated

1396
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:14,118
with high diversity in a

1397
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:17,079
microbiome all right so with my next

1398
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:20,200
question I'm going to set up a little um

1399
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:23,039
a little example first about EM1 and you

1400
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:25,439
know uh a lot of folks like to use EM1

1401
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:27,960
and um the idea is like okay you can by

1402
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,240
EM1 which is a a blend of microbes and

1403
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,079
you can add it to your plants and your

1404
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:34,639
plants will love it and if you want to

1405
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:37,079
expand the bottle so your your your

1406
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:39,000
bottle lasts longer there's uh usually

1407
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:43,720
instructions on the back of how you can

1408
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:47,679
do a um a a simple air rated tea so that

1409
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:49,838
you can expand what's in your bottle but

1410
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:52,919
but eventually if you just keep on

1411
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:55,920
Brewing it and Brewing it um the the

1412
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,480
microbes that are differently aggressive

1413
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,159
and competitive the balance that is in

1414
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,199
the actual EM1 balance that they

1415
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:04,759
recommend it'll eventually get out of

1416
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,719
balance and so you have to go and you

1417
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:09,000
know get a new bottle of EM1 and start

1418
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:12,598
over with the the actual balanced

1419
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:17,358
product um so so using that as the

1420
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:20,359
example um if we are grabbing uh lots of

1421
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:24,679
different plants that are local to our

1422
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:27,358
area that are thriving and we are um

1423
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:29,919
either degrading them or extracting them

1424
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:33,440
into some sort of extract or irated

1425
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:38,000
compost tea is there any um awareness we

1426
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:40,079
should have about the balance of those

1427
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,159
microbes and nutrition that we're

1428
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:47,440
actually putting into the pot if if if

1429
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:51,358
if we do want to have our um rizosphere

1430
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:53,920
life to be in balance and we influence

1431
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:57,558
that balance by what we're adding from

1432
00:55:53,920 --> 00:56:00,200
our compost pile as a t do we need to be

1433
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:02,559
worried about throwing off the balance

1434
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:03,719
of the residence of the of the

1435
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,798
rizosphere

1436
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:08,598
because we are feeding out of balanced

1437
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:11,280
uh

1438
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:13,280
teas uh yeah actually that is that is a

1439
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,839
major concern and um it's cool that that

1440
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,559
a product like that has those types of

1441
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:19,000
instructions for kind of increase you

1442
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,880
know bang for your buck um but yes I

1443
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,480
think uh my best advice and this is

1444
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,519
maybe my opinion but based on some

1445
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,159
science um would be when you're making

1446
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:28,719
those types of products try to use them

1447
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:31,358
up um you know do do your research and

1448
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:33,919
say you you've found a lot of sources to

1449
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:36,199
say 48 hours is the ideal incubation or

1450
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,599
irration time for a compost tea try to

1451
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:40,519
use that up uh pretty pretty quickly uh

1452
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:43,798
after it's ready to go um and I think

1453
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:45,880
that is based on the thinking that um

1454
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:48,000
all types of microbes whether there's

1455
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:50,000
one thing in a bottle or a thousand

1456
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,719
things from a sample of compost have

1457
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,079
different uh growth and Metabolism rates

1458
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:57,558
so um when things are grown together the

1459
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:59,160
term is like co-cultured um the faster

1460
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:01,359
Growers are always going to be able to

1461
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:03,719
have that Advantage towards the other

1462
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:06,639
members of that you know biome um

1463
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:08,879
because they are just uh genetically

1464
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:10,558
advantaged to eat faster and divide

1465
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,760
faster and break down faster right so

1466
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:15,240
you can see things like um if you let a

1467
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,640
compost te sit for two weeks uh maybe if

1468
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:19,279
it's aerated um as opposed to one week I

1469
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:21,078
bet that that microbiome completely

1470
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,240
shifts just based on the ability for

1471
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:24,960
those faster Growers to become dominant

1472
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,838
and I think you know the diversity with

1473
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,559
probably the highest within the first 72

1474
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:31,159
hours of brewing a compost tea and that

1475
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,599
starts to probably taper off just based

1476
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:35,679
on the way microbial microb ecology kind

1477
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:39,160
of works in that system um there's only

1478
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:40,919
so much food around right and uh if the

1479
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:42,358
fastest eaters are you know kind of

1480
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,639
throwing their elbows at the other ones

1481
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:45,159
and and eating it faster they're going

1482
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:46,199
to become dominant and maybe those

1483
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:47,519
aren't the plant growth promoting

1484
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:48,679
microbes that you're in search for maybe

1485
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:52,239
they're just really good at eating those

1486
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:55,239
Max M I like that idea that that as

1487
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:57,118
you're as you're Brewing it for 36 to 48

1488
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:59,959
hours and you're and you're pulling it

1489
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:03,440
out of the bucket right then you have

1490
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:05,519
got so many aerated microbes and they've

1491
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,358
all just been getting all the Iration

1492
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:10,759
and nutrition that they could possibly

1493
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:12,759
want which just means like everybody is

1494
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,000
fed and thriving and at the starting

1495
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,960
line and that's when we want to give it

1496
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,679
to our plants but the longer we get away

1497
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,880
from that starting line and let that

1498
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:24,519
compost tea sit for one day two day

1499
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,440
they're all they're all already racing

1500
00:58:24,519 --> 00:58:29,119
in competing and beating each other up

1501
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:31,679
and eating each other and so by day you

1502
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,079
know three or four you you're fully at

1503
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:37,000
survival of the fittest at that point

1504
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:40,359
and you're not providing a nice even

1505
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,280
balanced array of nutrition and

1506
00:58:40,358 --> 00:58:45,038
microbiology you're actually providing

1507
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,680
them something imbalan that's going to

1508
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:50,200
have some sort of effect on your um on

1509
00:58:48,679 --> 00:58:52,399
your soil environment does that sound

1510
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:54,480
about right absolutely yeah I mean and

1511
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,079
the way to say that is in microbiome

1512
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,920
science we use a term called Alpha

1513
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,559
diversity um so if I have a basket of

1514
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,920
fruit and there's 10 pieces of fruit in

1515
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:02,480
there and nine of them are apples and

1516
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,559
one of them is an orange I have really

1517
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,119
low Alpha diversity but if I have 10

1518
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,720
pieces of fruit in a basket and one's an

1519
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:09,240
apple one's a grape one's a banana

1520
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:11,118
blueberry everything is a different

1521
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:12,598
thing um the parts of a hole are all

1522
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,200
different that is really high alpha

1523
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:16,760
diversity so the longer something like a

1524
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:18,919
compost tea might sit um it's likely

1525
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:20,559
that you'd be lowering your Alpha

1526
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,838
diversity where those fast Growers or

1527
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,839
good eaters are going to become dominant

1528
00:59:22,838 --> 00:59:26,318
um right on that's that is super

1529
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:27,960
interesting and because I want to look

1530
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:31,358
this up after the show are you saying

1531
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:33,119
Alpha a p ha that is correct yes all

1532
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:35,480
right cool that's very interesting idea

1533
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,358
that is new to me on compost te's as

1534
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,599
well um I I collaborated on something

1535
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:41,759
when I was in school uh where a

1536
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,318
colleague was making Verma compost tea

1537
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,039
from worm castings and finished compost

1538
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:49,679
um and this person was able to uh grow

1539
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:51,079
it up I think they did a 48 hour Iration

1540
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:52,798
um and then they boiled half of it and

1541
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:54,960
then they applied the other half

1542
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,519
untreated and they actually found that I

1543
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,880
think it was a basil host or a tomato

1544
00:59:56,519 --> 01:00:01,519
host um those plants benefited more from

1545
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,838
The Boiled compost tea um so this is not

1546
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:05,159
me suggesting that everybody should be

1547
01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:07,679
boiling their compost tea but maybe on

1548
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:10,078
their Iration time they were able to you

1549
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,078
know increase the populations of things

1550
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,599
that might not directly benefit plants

1551
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,798
and actually compete for plants for

1552
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:18,599
those beneficial parts that get released

1553
01:00:15,798 --> 01:00:19,759
when we make a compost tea um so it was

1554
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:21,280
kind of interesting to think about you

1555
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,280
know boiling or trying to get the

1556
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,760
microbes out of a compost tea the ones

1557
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,240
that can't survive boiling uh actually

1558
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:31,240
made the plants do better um presumably

1559
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:32,639
from A reduced uh amount of microb

1560
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:34,118
competition for the same things the

1561
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:36,400
plant Woods that kind of get released

1562
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:38,798
from the irration process in compost tea

1563
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,200
wow man boiling compost you just kind of

1564
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:43,000
blew my mind there um I'm going to have

1565
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:46,318
to think a lot about that but but what I

1566
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,280
think about it immediately is that if if

1567
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:51,798
if we've talked constantly throughout

1568
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:54,880
this episode so far about um the

1569
01:00:51,798 --> 01:00:56,679
biodiversity of the teas and you know of

1570
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,440
the carbons and of the plant sources

1571
01:00:56,679 --> 01:01:01,358
that we continually pour into our plants

1572
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,760
that if I'm going to make air rated

1573
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:04,880
compost teas and I'm also going to do

1574
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:09,520
cold

1575
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:12,640
extracted uh teas like I don't see any

1576
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:15,798
reason why uh having a big pot of boiled

1577
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:17,679
plants that I then let cool and then

1578
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:20,599
apply to the plants CU I'm going to get

1579
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:23,000
a whole a whole different um cast of

1580
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:25,359
characters in that and all I'm doing is

1581
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,318
increasing my diversity by using all

1582
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:29,880
three different types of teas I would

1583
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:31,719
agree with that yeah definitely you know

1584
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,838
the the the non-boiled compost tea and

1585
01:01:31,719 --> 01:01:35,798
the study I'm referring to is is kind of

1586
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:38,759
a balance of both probiotic or just

1587
01:01:35,798 --> 01:01:40,480
bacterial members and prebiotics whereas

1588
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,880
likely after it was boiled you know it

1589
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,199
wasn't measured chemically but that was

1590
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,119
probably just more uh I'm going to use

1591
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:47,598
the term Prebiotic but just uh kind of

1592
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:50,079
the the metabolites that are released

1593
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:51,960
from the compost T Brewing process um

1594
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,839
ready for the the plant to slurp right

1595
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,000
up rather than kind of have to share

1596
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:57,759
with the microb

1597
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,239
right on all right so um before we move

1598
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,559
on to our next topic I want to hit

1599
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:05,759
something one more time because um you

1600
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:07,278
know um I've heard you kind of allude to

1601
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,720
the fact that one of the good things

1602
01:02:07,278 --> 01:02:13,480
that biochar does in the soil structure

1603
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:16,199
is to you know not only provide um you

1604
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:18,440
know the carbon for food but also um

1605
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:19,759
it's like a unique housing structure if

1606
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,760
you will cuz it's got all these nooks

1607
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,960
and crevices um is is there anything and

1608
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,799
the answer may be no but I'm going to

1609
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:27,599
try to squeeze you on this anyway is is

1610
01:02:25,798 --> 01:02:31,960
there anything else that we should

1611
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:34,960
consider adding as an amendment to our

1612
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:37,199
soil that is less about nutrition and

1613
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,159
having it break down to provide you know

1614
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:42,679
foods which is what most of the stuff we

1615
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:45,838
do um is for but instead is something

1616
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:49,798
that we are going to amend the soil

1617
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:52,838
because it actually provides um a

1618
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:54,880
physical mechanism that is good for the

1619
01:02:52,838 --> 01:02:57,278
micro life

1620
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,240
yeah uh I for that I think you know the

1621
01:02:57,278 --> 01:03:00,798
the biochars are a really good approach

1622
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:02,399
to that and I think I'll always

1623
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:04,278
recommend if people aren't already doing

1624
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,278
this to get a starting soil test before

1625
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:08,838
you start applying your inoculant or or

1626
01:03:06,278 --> 01:03:10,318
inputs to that as well um but I think in

1627
01:03:08,838 --> 01:03:12,078
terms of kind of like housing the

1628
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:14,838
microbes are giving them like a nice

1629
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:17,278
place to live um you

1630
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:19,000
know again I'm biased towards the soil

1631
01:03:17,278 --> 01:03:21,239
systems as opposed to like a hydroponic

1632
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,920
system but when we think about no till

1633
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:25,919
um not only is that really kind of

1634
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,838
maintaining uh soil you know Carbon

1635
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,680
that's stored from those plants um but

1636
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:31,318
that's also keeping those those houses

1637
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:34,399
for the microbes dormant in the plant

1638
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:35,798
roots ready to be uh you know introduced

1639
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,079
to the fresh roots that would be kind of

1640
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:40,358
germinating in the same soils so like my

1641
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:42,318
me personally um I have one of my

1642
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:44,358
experimental you know garden beds in my

1643
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:46,038
backyard that I I've never ched for and

1644
01:03:44,358 --> 01:03:48,239
I'll plant seeds or directly transplant

1645
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:50,400
things there and it seems to be um you

1646
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:53,558
know speculative that those plants get a

1647
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,519
little bit of a boost uh because the you

1648
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:56,440
know I I do apply heavy compost and

1649
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:57,838
things like that there's a lot of

1650
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,240
factors we're not considering but I

1651
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:00,960
think a big thing is you know those

1652
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:02,439
microbes have overwintering structures

1653
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,159
and they were evolved with the plant to

1654
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:07,318
survive through these these uh you know

1655
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:10,318
cold temperatures and hot

1656
01:04:07,318 --> 01:04:12,278
temperatures um so yeah I think uh

1657
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:14,558
people should maybe experiment more with

1658
01:04:12,278 --> 01:04:16,278
notil or you know companion planting and

1659
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,960
things along those lines yeah that

1660
01:04:16,278 --> 01:04:20,639
certainly makes sense uh regarding our

1661
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:22,358
experience with noil every year the soil

1662
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:24,480
just gets more mature and it lasts

1663
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,960
better through the winter and the the

1664
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,920
the the following Year's plants are

1665
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:30,519
thriving it's always hardest that first

1666
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:33,039
year when people are using like you know

1667
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:35,559
immature bagged soil without a lot of

1668
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:38,960
mycelium and you know they get kind of

1669
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:41,798
mediocre plants um and then and then the

1670
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:45,000
longer they go no till the more you know

1671
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:47,400
beefy the plants get yeah yeah it's like

1672
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
a a a bettering you know I think there's

1673
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,440
probably a limit to it year three year

1674
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,119
four or something like that everybody's

1675
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,798
system is different but yeah the more

1676
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:55,318
the more organic material and different

1677
01:04:53,798 --> 01:04:57,559
types of plant materials and you know

1678
01:04:55,318 --> 01:04:59,038
their root exits stuff like that you can

1679
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:01,039
get in that system you're adding that

1680
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:03,400
diversity which is you know really

1681
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,960
correlated with plant and microb health

1682
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:09,318
rotating and amending you know no till

1683
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:12,240
soil every you know let's say four years

1684
01:05:09,318 --> 01:05:14,759
um you know it that is such a massive

1685
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:16,798
Improvement then the idea of you know

1686
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:19,680
kind of old school where every year you

1687
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:21,639
start with new fresh clean soil that

1688
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:22,960
doesn't have any pathogens in it and

1689
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:25,879
while yeah we want to avoid the

1690
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,838
pathogens um but the the best way to

1691
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:30,318
actually keep pathogens at Bay is to

1692
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:32,519
have a vigorous soil that's already aged

1693
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:34,798
and I always I always feel bad for

1694
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:37,519
people who are very much set on the new

1695
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:39,798
season new soil tip because it it just

1696
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:42,079
it just makes things hard every year

1697
01:05:39,798 --> 01:05:45,639
instead of year three and four being

1698
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:47,278
like easy yeah to me the the that kind

1699
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:49,519
of feels like a scorched earth type of

1700
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:51,519
approach um and and I like that you

1701
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:53,480
mentioned you know the diversity uh in

1702
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:57,480
what you just said um you know we've

1703
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:59,480
seen uh things like fusarium uh species

1704
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:02,880
highly present you know 10 the 6 10 the

1705
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:06,079
eth cells per gram of soil um in a in a

1706
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:08,039
plant Rises spere sample um but it's you

1707
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,680
know very far along into flower

1708
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:11,559
maturation and there's no signs or

1709
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:14,399
symptoms of the fusarium attacking the

1710
01:06:11,559 --> 01:06:16,519
plant um so it's like this the fusarium

1711
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,920
is taking one seat at the seat the table

1712
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:20,759
with 100 seats and the other 99 seats

1713
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,760
are plant benefiting things or soil

1714
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,799
benefiting things so you know pathogens

1715
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,319
can be present without becoming fent and

1716
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:28,440
it all comes back to soil microbial

1717
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:32,239
diversity you know out competing

1718
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:34,720
fusarium is the only potential solution

1719
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:37,159
that I see that there is other than just

1720
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:38,879
dumping the soil um you know we we've

1721
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:41,558
talked about fusarium I've had fusarium

1722
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:43,760
Specialists on this on the on the um

1723
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:46,200
program and and usually their answer is

1724
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:49,278
like throw the soil away and I get that

1725
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:51,439
um but um but it's interesting to

1726
01:06:49,278 --> 01:06:53,079
realize that as a preventative since

1727
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,599
fusarium is everywhere it's not like

1728
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:57,680
it's not going to be in your soil um

1729
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:00,400
just make sure you keep on you know

1730
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:03,598
adding microbes incubating microbes

1731
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:05,240
adding indigenous microbes and fusarium

1732
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,640
will never get a good

1733
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:08,879
foothold yeah I mean you know never is a

1734
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:11,078
strong word but I

1735
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,119
think differently from you know adding

1736
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:14,318
all the microbes and really

1737
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:15,960
intentionally applying you know diverse

1738
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:17,358
forms of microbes whether they're from

1739
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,119
you know your wildcrafting or input

1740
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,920
somebody could buy I think the other

1741
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:22,160
thing is you know soil Health practices

1742
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,240
really is where a lot of this soil

1743
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,639
microbial diversity preservation can

1744
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:28,719
start um so those things like the

1745
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:31,278
prebiotics and the organic inputs and

1746
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:33,759
companion planting uh crop rotation no

1747
01:07:31,278 --> 01:07:35,440
till uh soil health I think maybe even I

1748
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,240
would put higher on the list than uh

1749
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,039
microbial accessible carbon from the the

1750
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:41,159
previous question but they're related

1751
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:43,240
right yeah yeah yeah all right cool so

1752
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:46,598
the last topic I want to hit uh during

1753
01:07:43,239 --> 01:07:49,118
here during the set two here is um you

1754
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:51,079
know so so far this uh this set we've

1755
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:55,000
been talking about the things that we

1756
01:07:51,079 --> 01:07:57,960
can do to make the living environment

1757
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:01,599
for the microb life and in the

1758
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:03,639
rizosphere as diverse and beneficial as

1759
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:06,079
possible and and why that's kind of

1760
01:08:03,639 --> 01:08:07,920
everything right it it we keep on coming

1761
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:10,278
back to the same answer and it's because

1762
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,440
the answer is is kind of the only thing

1763
01:08:10,278 --> 01:08:16,399
that we need to be doing as regenerative

1764
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:18,480
Farmers is is adding um adding diversity

1765
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:21,879
into the soil and then and let nature do

1766
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:24,639
the rest so so that's great um I also am

1767
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:28,960
very attracted to the idea that the pl

1768
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:32,359
is also um trying to help itself as well

1769
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:36,039
by by putting out you know exudates that

1770
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:37,719
that encourage particular microbes or or

1771
01:08:36,039 --> 01:08:39,960
um or different residents in the

1772
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:43,000
rizosphere where they're kind of

1773
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,480
curating uh who they are attracting to

1774
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,838
them and I've heard you talk before

1775
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:52,238
about um recruitment that that cannabis

1776
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:54,679
plants will recruit bacteria that that

1777
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:56,718
they find beneficial and and I'm

1778
01:08:54,679 --> 01:08:59,838
unfamiliar with this idea but it but

1779
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:01,439
just the idea of it is fascinating so so

1780
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:02,679
I I don't know the right question to ask

1781
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:05,079
you on it so I'm just going to kind of

1782
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:07,880
hand you the mic and say will you tell

1783
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:11,318
us about how cannabis plants recruit

1784
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:13,759
beneficial bacteria itself kind of like

1785
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:15,719
intentionally yeah absolutely thank you

1786
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:17,238
um I think you know there's a lot of uh

1787
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:19,679
literature from the past five or six

1788
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:21,519
years that show photosensitive photo

1789
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,880
period sensitive plants or plants that

1790
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,400
you know have major changes in

1791
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:27,400
development um also changed their root

1792
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:29,759
exited profiles so I think it was first

1793
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:32,719
you know learned about in a rabids wild

1794
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,479
wild mustard model um a plant that has a

1795
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:36,119
rosette stage and then it bolts and then

1796
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:38,559
it makes flowers and those flowers make

1797
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:40,439
seeds um at each one of those stages uh

1798
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:43,440
it was seen that the the root exited

1799
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:44,879
profiles change um you know the early

1800
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:48,238
growth and development there was just a

1801
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:50,119
ton of sugar and later in the uh the

1802
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:51,879
flowering and maturation there was a lot

1803
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:53,719
of you know organic acids and things

1804
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,279
that are uh can be harsh to certain

1805
01:09:53,719 --> 01:09:57,000
microbes whereas sugar is like a really

1806
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:58,599
broad food source so the kind of

1807
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,800
thinking from the authors of that paper

1808
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:04,159
were um and I'll get to cannabis too I

1809
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,840
promise were about um you know the

1810
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:07,559
developmental needs of the plant are

1811
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,440
changing you know more nitrogen in the

1812
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,239
beginning more phosphorus and potassium

1813
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,678
later and you know those micronutrients

1814
01:10:11,238 --> 01:10:15,639
trickled throughout um and we know that

1815
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:18,119
the microbes help plants uptake these

1816
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:20,199
things so you know let's wonder if the

1817
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:22,800
plant is actually I'm going to use the

1818
01:10:20,198 --> 01:10:24,238
term uh intentionally uh signaling for

1819
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,400
different things as it goes on through

1820
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:28,559
growth and development so I mean being a

1821
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:30,559
cannabis Enthusiast seeing that study I

1822
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,480
was like wow you know what's the most

1823
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,120
popular photosensitive photop period

1824
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:38,359
sensitive plant that we use you know

1825
01:10:34,119 --> 01:10:40,519
hampen cannabis right um uh so it

1826
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:42,960
was I'm not sure if root exit at work

1827
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:46,400
has been done um but we've done some

1828
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:48,279
work on the um the vegetative versus the

1829
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:49,879
transition so you know maybe a couple

1830
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:51,359
weeks after flower on set after the

1831
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,640
solstice and the days get short in an

1832
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:55,599
outdoor system um as well as the hard

1833
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:58,520
Harvest uh you know functional

1834
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,880
microbiome of cannabis and we see that

1835
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:05,400
um regardless

1836
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:08,119
of the you know specific species of

1837
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:11,198
cannabis uh or strain uh whether it's

1838
01:11:08,119 --> 01:11:12,719
hamper cannabis 3% THC producers are

1839
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:15,279
higher

1840
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:17,198
um the same functions or at least the

1841
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:19,800
same bacterial Genera are occurring in

1842
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:21,599
in a many different uh types of soil

1843
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:23,679
environments um we're using like the

1844
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:26,440
USDA climatic zones for that but

1845
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:28,440
basically um cannabis being as as

1846
01:11:26,439 --> 01:11:32,319
nutritionally

1847
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:35,479
uh needy compared to some other plants

1848
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:38,519
um you know we we see uh really strong

1849
01:11:35,479 --> 01:11:40,519
associations with the bacteria um based

1850
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,960
on development so when we use the term

1851
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:45,960
like recruit it's it's kind of like the

1852
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:47,920
um the cannabis plant is sending these

1853
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:50,520
signals into the risos phere to likely

1854
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,399
get some type of risos feric function by

1855
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,520
the bacterial or fungal or just anybody

1856
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:57,198
in the soil microbiome um and these

1857
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:59,880
needs are pretty standard from you know

1858
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:02,479
the genus or the the the Cannabis sativa

1859
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:04,719
plants uh whether you they are

1860
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:06,359
classified as hamper marijuana uh you

1861
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:09,039
know depending on the the amount of

1862
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:11,719
metabol it produces right um all that to

1863
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:15,238
say is plants really want microbes um

1864
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:16,760
and if we can kind of provide microbes

1865
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:21,359
uh that the plant can't search for in

1866
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:24,119
indoor systems um or in really you know

1867
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:25,920
low Alpha diversity 10year monocultured

1868
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:27,079
cornfield soils where there's lots

1869
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:31,239
there's like five different types of

1870
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:34,319
microbes I'm exaggerating um then we can

1871
01:12:31,238 --> 01:12:36,039
kind of benefit the plant uh in a way

1872
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:37,519
that it would in its natural environment

1873
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:39,279
and the wild type relatives and the

1874
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,719
progenitors might have you know kind of

1875
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:44,119
evolved to

1876
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:45,880
do so it sounds like um if I'm

1877
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:48,639
understanding you correctly the main

1878
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:51,960
point is that over the life cycle of the

1879
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:55,480
plant the plants uh the the the dominant

1880
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:57,520
bacterias in the rizosphere changes and

1881
01:12:55,479 --> 01:12:59,919
we know the mechanism or or at least

1882
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,800
we're pretty sure that the mechanism of

1883
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,840
why it changes is because the plant

1884
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,279
wants different types of bacteria and so

1885
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,840
it's putting the plant is putting out

1886
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:11,719
different types of exudates to encourage

1887
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:16,279
different types of bacteria and so um

1888
01:13:11,719 --> 01:13:19,639
the best thing that we can do is to um

1889
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:24,079
you know a let the plant do its job and

1890
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:29,239
then B do our part by um offering

1891
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:32,319
um varieties of other um nutritions and

1892
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:33,879
and probiotic bacterias and such that

1893
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:35,799
that the plant can't produce and it

1894
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:38,039
needs to get its environment so that

1895
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:40,480
between the partnership between us and

1896
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:42,319
the plant The Roots have just got

1897
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:45,319
everything it could possibly desire to

1898
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:47,119
express itself most fully yes that a

1899
01:13:45,319 --> 01:13:49,679
perfect distillation thank you and I

1900
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:51,519
think um you know most importantly the

1901
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:54,039
uh I'm going to sound like a broken

1902
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,800
record but soil Health right the soil

1903
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:57,399
health is is maintained then we are

1904
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:59,199
going to assume and you know we've

1905
01:13:57,399 --> 01:14:00,719
proven like the science has proven

1906
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:02,519
there's lots of alpha diversity

1907
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:05,920
microbial diversity in a very healthy

1908
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:07,239
soil um so whether or not the microbe

1909
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,880
that's present during the vegetative

1910
01:14:07,238 --> 01:14:14,079
growth period uh of your Canabis plants

1911
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:15,840
life cycle is recruited by the plant um

1912
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:17,840
during that time if you maintain that

1913
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,360
soil Health it's likely there will still

1914
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,079
be those microbes in low enough cell

1915
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:24,119
numbers and then when the plant changes

1916
01:14:21,079 --> 01:14:27,479
its root exitation compounds presumably

1917
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:29,639
to attract microbes to uh help it meet

1918
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:32,479
its nutritional needs based on

1919
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:34,400
development um then you know soil Health

1920
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:35,839
maintains microbial diversity those bugs

1921
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:38,119
are hanging around when your plant is

1922
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:40,440
flowering and and in need of those types

1923
01:14:38,119 --> 01:14:42,359
of uh functions hell yeah that's

1924
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:45,158
actually really exciting I like that

1925
01:14:42,359 --> 01:14:49,439
summary a lot it's like uh it's it's

1926
01:14:45,158 --> 01:14:52,519
very rare in uh discussing uh

1927
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:55,479
soil health and and you know soil

1928
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:57,320
maximalism if you will to actually have

1929
01:14:55,479 --> 01:15:00,439
uh that clear of a recipe for what we

1930
01:14:57,319 --> 01:15:02,880
need to do this season thank God so yeah

1931
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:04,359
right right on well good well well thank

1932
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:07,400
you for that Michael let's go ahead and

1933
01:15:04,359 --> 01:15:08,719
take our second uh commercial uh and be

1934
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:10,479
right back uh you're listening to

1935
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:13,039
shaping fire and my guest today is

1936
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:14,678
microbiologist Michael Deli and remember

1937
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:16,359
you know without these advertisers shape

1938
01:15:14,679 --> 01:15:18,079
and fire wouldn't happen so please

1939
01:15:16,359 --> 01:15:20,389
support them and let them know that you

1940
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:21,600
heard of them on shaping

1941
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:23,760
[Music]

1942
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,440
fire you've heard me talk about the

1943
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,360
award-winning cannabis seeds that come

1944
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:29,198
from the analytical breeding program of

1945
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:32,359
Seth and Eric Crawford who founded

1946
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:35,079
Oregon CBD seeds in fact Seth was a

1947
01:15:32,359 --> 01:15:38,000
guest on shaping fire in 2020 to talk

1948
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:40,439
about triploid genetics Seth and Eric

1949
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,840

cannabis growing is so valued by Farmers

2041
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:30,479
is because the melium networks in the

finish you know during the first set we

2092
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:35,840
talked all about bio stimulants and

2093
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:38,719
plant growth regulators and what we

2094
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,960
wanted to do as regenerative cultivators

2095
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:43,800
to make sure that we have the healthiest

2096
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:46,760
most biodiverse soil so the plant can do

2097
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:48,719
its job of growing in a healthy way that

resists pests and gives us awesome

yields and tpes during the second set we

2100
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:57,039
talked a bit more more about the care

2101
01:21:53,960 --> 01:22:00,600
intending of micro life specifically and

2102
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:02,600
and and not only how we can add U

2103
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,800
microbes and biodiversity like we were

2104
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:07,360
talking in the first set but also how we

2105
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:11,119
can help them Thrive and keep them

2106

01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:16,599
third set um we're just going to hit on

2108
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:19,079
um two more kind of miscellaneous uh

are really important and things that we

01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:27,159
have talked about uh prior on the conver

2113
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:30,000
on the on the program so the first of

2114
01:22:27,158 --> 01:22:32,559
the two is uh choosing companion plants

2115
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,198
to encourage biodiversity so Michael

2116
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:38,080
we've talked quite a bit today about uh

2117
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:41,399
plant exudates and how plants push out

2118
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:44,719
the exudates from the root structure um

2119
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:46,719
uh and and and attract different um um

2120
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:50,639
microbial life and life forms in the

2121
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:53,359
rizosphere um that that it wants to use

2122
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:56,880
as as different you know flavors of

2123
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:59,719
tools and and and I understand that like

2124
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:03,600
the plants that are planted near our

2125
01:22:59,719 --> 01:23:06,800
cannabis plants can influence the risos

2126
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:10,639
spere of our cannabis plant because it

2127
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:14,400
is also calling forth different types of

2128
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:18,920
nutrition and melium um to its uh root

2129
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:21,920
systems as well and um I understand um

2130
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:25,000
you know partly what you study is is um

2131
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:29,319
how these systems May interact and and

2132
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:32,479
how to choose companion plants that will

2133
01:23:29,319 --> 01:23:34,559
be a good neighbor for whatever the

2134
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:37,279
target plant that that we're looking to

2135
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:40,199
grow in in our case we're talking about

2136
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:42,279
cannabis and so will you kind of um Talk

2137
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:45,638
us through how to think about choosing

2138
01:23:42,279 --> 01:23:48,238
our companion plants and in in order to

2139
01:23:45,639 --> 01:23:50,119
encourage the the most biodiversity in

2140
01:23:48,238 --> 01:23:52,479
our

2141
01:23:50,119 --> 01:23:53,760
soil yeah absolutely and I think the

2142
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:55,759
reason that this isn't more you know

2143
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,079
widespread or adapted or adopted rather

2144
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,639
is is because of the um the scalability

2145
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:02,639
of this but I I would love to see it you

2146
01:23:59,639 --> 01:24:04,639
know on hundreds of Acres I think um two

2147
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:06,480
really cool examples that are new to me

2148
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:08,840
for kind of companion planting for

2149
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:10,919
cannabis would be um I had some friends

2150
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:14,319
do the three sisters but replace the

2151
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:15,960
corn with the um the cannabis plant as

2152
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:17,920
opposed to Corn um and for those who

2153
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:20,279
don't know the three sisters is corn

2154
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:23,158
beans and squash the corn serves as a

2155
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:26,000
trellis for the beans to grow up um the

2156
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:27,960
beans have a nitrogen fixing symbiotic

2157
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,119
bacterium called rium that live in their

2158
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:32,198
roots and that nitrogen can get leeched

2159
01:24:30,119 --> 01:24:34,279
out of their roots and be available for

2160
01:24:32,198 --> 01:24:36,000
both the corn and the Squash and then

2161
01:24:34,279 --> 01:24:37,759
the squash with their large leaves at

2162
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,600
the base of the plant they provide shade

2163
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:41,320
so soil States kind of cooler

2164
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,639
temperatures and doesn't get baked from

2165
01:24:41,319 --> 01:24:46,479
the Sun um so in this case uh they

2166
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:48,118
replace the corn with the the hemp

2167
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:50,198
plants and the cannabis plants to serve

2168
01:24:48,118 --> 01:24:52,839
as that trellis for the the beans to

2169
01:24:50,198 --> 01:24:56,559
climb up um and both you know the squash

2170
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:58,360
and the excuse me the hemp was able to

2171
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:01,039
benefit from the beans being present due

2172
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:03,359
to that rium bacterium being there um

2173
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:04,880
and also you know certain soil

2174
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:07,559
temperatures if they get too hot that

2175
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:10,079
can actually be detrimental to microbial

2176
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:12,159
um populations so having that cooling

2177
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:13,800
effect from the squash leaves uh

2178
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:16,000
depending on your grow environment

2179
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:18,480
Colorado we have 320 days of direct

2180
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,800
Sunshine that can help cool it down um

2181
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:22,678
to keep those soil temperatures uh happy

2182
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,840
for lots of different things to to keep

2183
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:26,840
growing rather than just uh you know the

2184
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:28,840
ones that are tolerant to warm soil

2185
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:31,159
before you move past hold on before you

2186
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:34,199
move past the three sisters I have got

2187
01:25:31,158 --> 01:25:38,000
to ask are you serious we want to have

2188
01:25:34,198 --> 01:25:40,479
beans climbing up our cannabis plants

2189
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,279
like that sounds awful like does that

2190
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:44,678
work do they I mean I'm imagine that the

2191
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:48,158
bean plants get all into the flowers and

2192
01:25:44,679 --> 01:25:50,840
then and how does that work I think it

2193
01:25:48,158 --> 01:25:52,319
might require a little bit more um uh

2194
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:53,800
maintenance from the cultivator than

2195
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:56,639
than than most people can do in a

2196
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:58,400
production system um but yeah so they

2197
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:00,880
would kind of climb up and and on the

2198
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:03,319
fan leaves and things along those lines

2199
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,960
um do the be beans are also the beans

2200
01:26:03,319 --> 01:26:07,039
stay closer to the stock cuz like

2201
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:09,439
normally the flowers are are you know

2202
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:11,719
kind of far away from the stock so so

2203
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:14,079
are the are the beans perhap perhaps

2204
01:26:11,719 --> 01:26:17,039
going to just like grow up the center of

2205
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:19,319
the plant and not grow out to the

2206
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:21,600
flowers or will the will the beans

2207
01:26:19,319 --> 01:26:22,920
eventually grow out the branch to the

2208
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,920
flowers

2209
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:26,840
the ones I the ones I saw in the system

2210
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,960
were were more so like the the tips of

2211
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:31,039
The Bean vines or you know yeah were

2212
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,840
kind of hanging out in the empty space

2213
01:26:31,039 --> 01:26:33,960
between fan leaves in the middle parts

2214
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,279
of the plant they didn't might quite

2215
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:38,920
make it up to that top Cola um and you

2216
01:26:36,279 --> 01:26:40,559
know this is a one one example right so

2217
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:41,960
um another approach to this though cuz I

2218
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,080
do hear what you're saying with you know

2219
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:47,158
beans could effectively act like a a

2220
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:49,800
bind weed um and pull plants down like

2221
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:51,559
that so I think um a bush bean or a

2222
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:53,960
different type of legume like a cow pea

2223
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:56,199
might be a better type of nitrogen fixer

2224
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:58,158
to get that you know diverse root exit

2225
01:26:56,198 --> 01:27:00,559
profile diverse microbiome from the root

2226
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:02,439
exodites and the nitrogen component to

2227
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,280
from the legume plants and so those

2228
01:27:02,439 --> 01:27:06,158
different those bush beans and and the

2229
01:27:04,279 --> 01:27:08,479
reason why those are better is because

2230
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:11,118
you would plant those at the foot of the

2231
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:13,359
cannabis plant and so their risos speres

2232
01:27:11,118 --> 01:27:15,880
could talk to each other but the plant

2233
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:18,279
is not a climbing bean and so you'll

2234
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:20,520
just have like Bean Shrubbery at the

2235
01:27:18,279 --> 01:27:23,198
bottom of your cannabis plant which is

2236
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:25,159
fine um it just won't climb the plant is

2237
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:26,638
that where where that goes yes

2238
01:27:25,158 --> 01:27:28,638
absolutely and so like that rizosphere

2239
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,039
becomes representative of at least you

2240
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:31,800
know two to three different types of

2241
01:27:30,039 --> 01:27:33,439
plant species with your your Vining

2242
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,679
squash you know your fruits should be

2243
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:36,158
okay because they'll be far away from

2244
01:27:34,679 --> 01:27:38,239
the rest of the beans that are kind of

2245
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:39,719
bushing at the base um but if you have

2246
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:41,158
all those roots kind of in the same root

2247
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:43,439
ball as long as there's adequate

2248
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:45,238
nutrition and organic material um that

2249
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:47,479
will be like a very healthy diverse

2250
01:27:45,238 --> 01:27:49,718
microbiome uh as a factor of just having

2251
01:27:47,479 --> 01:27:51,678
three different hosts yeah I like that a

2252
01:27:49,719 --> 01:27:54,399
lot and um we've talked on the show

2253
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:57,199
before too that people who uh who grow

2254
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:59,799
in berms that are heavy built up with uh

2255
01:27:57,198 --> 01:28:02,198
compost and you know grass clippings and

2256
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,920
and other agricultural clippings um it's

2257
01:28:02,198 --> 01:28:05,479
very popular to grow potatoes in that

2258
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,079
too so you know you've got your potatoes

2259
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:09,359
and your beans and your squash kind of

2260
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:12,479
trailing off down the down the line of

2261
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:14,920
plants um i' I've always loved the idea

2262
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:17,599
of of growing food crops with the

2263
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:20,520
Cannabis so that you can feed yourself

2264
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:23,320
as well as you know smoke and save your

2265
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:25,480
soul if you will absolutely Ely yeah

2266
01:28:23,319 --> 01:28:27,158
okay so now that I've pushed you on that

2267
01:28:25,479 --> 01:28:29,479
what other what other strategies or

2268
01:28:27,158 --> 01:28:33,960
plans do you have in mind for um

2269
01:28:29,479 --> 01:28:35,879
creating a um diverse rizosphere well

2270
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:37,399
this was something that was kind of um

2271
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:39,760
new to me that I read about I didn't get

2272
01:28:37,399 --> 01:28:43,238
to see this one in in in action but it

2273
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:45,280
was a farm that had been co-planting um

2274
01:28:43,238 --> 01:28:48,359
um a plant with a mushroom so they were

2275
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:50,639
kind of using myceliated uh beds of a

2276
01:28:48,359 --> 01:28:52,479
winec cap mushroom to get um both

2277
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:54,880
Harvest of winec cap fungi edible

2278
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:57,718
mushrooms at the base of the soil and

2279
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:59,760
the uh the hemp was able to grow um and

2280
01:28:57,719 --> 01:29:02,719
flow at the top so it was kind of

2281
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:06,039
getting um both you know that fungal

2282
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:08,000
microbiome benefit uh as well as the the

2283
01:29:06,039 --> 01:29:09,479
plant roots there too so not directly

2284
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,118
you know plant-to-plant signaling like

2285
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:14,118
we're seeing with like the three sisters

2286
01:29:11,118 --> 01:29:17,359
we just discussed um but something along

2287
01:29:14,118 --> 01:29:18,759
the lines of you know trying to have uh

2288
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:20,359
more bang for your book in terms of

2289
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:23,159
square footage for harvesting and things

2290
01:29:20,359 --> 01:29:24,599
like that and wine mushroom is one of my

2291
01:29:23,158 --> 01:29:26,839
favorite eating mushrooms they're

2292
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:28,719
absolutely delicious I I tried to do

2293
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:31,279
that in my indoor and it didn't work out

2294
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:34,719
because the the humidity for mushrooms

2295
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:36,599
seems to be a little higher um than we

2296
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:38,158
want it to be in an indoor setting it

2297
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,560
seems to work well

2298
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:42,759
Outdoors um so long as you've got good

2299
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:46,119
plant coverage because uh normally we

2300
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:48,560
want our plants in direct sunlight right

2301
01:29:46,118 --> 01:29:49,960
but the mushrooms don't want to be in

2302
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,199
the direct sunlight so you got to make

2303
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:54,079
sure that you're growing plants that are

2304
01:29:51,198 --> 01:29:56,198
going to be big enough to um create that

2305
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:58,439
shadow underneath that allows the the

2306
01:29:56,198 --> 01:30:00,238
wine caps to exist yeah maintain that

2307
01:29:58,439 --> 01:30:02,399
humid microclimate underneath the plant

2308
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:03,638
canopy that is super ideal for mushrooms

2309
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:04,920
oh and the Squash will help with that

2310
01:30:03,639 --> 01:30:08,920
too that you're talking

2311
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:11,359
about those big leaves yeah all right um

2312
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:14,480
do you have any more on that before uh

2313
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:16,198
before I move on uh I think just

2314
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:18,879
companion planting is really really

2315
01:30:16,198 --> 01:30:21,079
excellent and I think there is a um you

2316
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:22,800
know go back to the literature and and

2317
01:30:21,079 --> 01:30:25,000
look out you know if you deer eating

2318
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,639
your your hemp merry Golds can be

2319
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,560
deterrence for deer right I think

2320
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:31,039
there's a different different plant for

2321
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,840
a different need um and just always

2322
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:34,760
going back to the more diverse roots and

2323
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:36,279
host in the in the soil would you know

2324
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:38,360
increase your soil health and microbial

2325
01:30:36,279 --> 01:30:40,439
diversity there so so I actually was

2326
01:30:38,359 --> 01:30:42,639
planning on doing um big pots of

2327
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:45,479
marigolds uh next to the plants for the

2328
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:47,440
first time this year um because we do

2329
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:49,559
have a lot of deer pressure and luckily

2330
01:30:47,439 --> 01:30:51,719
I got some um some deer fencing this

2331
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:54,679
year so hopefully that'll help too but

2332
01:30:51,719 --> 01:30:58,920
um is it is it as effective that if the

2333
01:30:54,679 --> 01:31:00,399
um the marigolds are are not in the pot

2334
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:03,600
with the canos or in the ground next to

2335
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:05,799
it but like are beside it that the smell

2336
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,920
of the maragold is enough to keep the

2337
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:11,039
deer off or will the deer just come over

2338
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:13,719
and browse the weed and and just ignore

2339
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:15,319
the marrow gold I'll be ful honest with

2340
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:17,520
you uh when I when I tried to use Mar

2341
01:31:15,319 --> 01:31:19,479
Golds as a a deterrent crop in in

2342
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:22,920
Maryland I I watched a deer chew one

2343
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:25,439
down before so you know that's like your

2344
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,319
mileage may vary right yeah you know

2345
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:28,919
like uh kind of like different different

2346
01:31:27,319 --> 01:31:30,679
strains of cannabis might have different

2347
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:32,600
turpenoid or cannabinoid profiles

2348
01:31:30,679 --> 01:31:34,039
different species of marigolds you know

2349
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,920
they have the multicolored ones have

2350
01:31:34,039 --> 01:31:37,479
different uh type of phytochemical

2351
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:40,319
profiles or you know those volatile

2352
01:31:37,479 --> 01:31:42,879
organic compounds that smell icky a deer

2353
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:45,439
um um so I I don't know a variety off

2354
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:47,319
the top of my head but I imagine that um

2355
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:49,118
you know it's very species specific r on

2356
01:31:47,319 --> 01:31:51,039
well thank you I app I appreciate your

2357
01:31:49,118 --> 01:31:53,439
uh your honesty in that and you know if

2358
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:55,158
we're really going to go for it um you

2359
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:57,960
know these bioions have got different

2360
01:31:55,158 --> 01:31:59,679
deer right so different deer could be um

2361
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:02,319
accustomed to browsing different types

2362
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:06,079
of plants whereas whereas Mar Maryland

2363
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:09,158
deer don't like marigolds but or or no

2364
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:12,399
do like they do like Mar Golds and and

2365
01:32:09,158 --> 01:32:14,920
maybe you know my West Coast deer um are

2366
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:16,799
more um snoody and they don't want marro

2367
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:19,800
Golds you know right or something like

2368
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:21,480
that so all right um but before we leave

2369
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,920
the companion planning topic I just want

2370
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:28,839
to ask are there any um plants that are

2371
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:30,960
um obviously um U poor neighbors um the

2372
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:32,560
the the name for it is is escaping me at

2373
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:34,239
the moment but but there's there are

2374
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:36,440
often plants that you don't want to

2375
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:38,158
plant near other plants because they

2376
01:32:36,439 --> 01:32:40,919
they they will they might poison each

2377
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:42,960
other or or or be toxic to the other

2378
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:45,359
person's or the other plants rizosphere

2379
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,760
are you aware of any of those yeah there

2380
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:48,839
is one that's jumping off the top of my

2381
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:52,280
head although I know there's you know a

2382
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:53,840
lot of examples um black walnut uh trees

2383
01:32:52,279 --> 01:32:55,920
for example you know not specifically

2384
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:57,319
related or cultivated for a regular

2385
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,639
Harvest like we're talking about with

2386
01:32:57,319 --> 01:33:03,359
cannabis or vegetables um but those

2387
01:32:59,639 --> 01:33:06,319
those guys uh have a a root exit it um

2388
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:08,719
that is under the nature of aathy uh so

2389
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:10,920
they are actually able to shoot a

2390
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:13,118
compound into the soil that makes it

2391
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:16,239
pretty inhospitable for anything but its

2392
01:33:13,118 --> 01:33:17,759
Offspring to grow um and to counter that

2393
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:20,238
there's also plants I think certain

2394
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:22,560
trees as well that you know don't want

2395
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:24,118
its own offspring to to compete with the

2396
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,800
you know the mom plant uh for the

2397
01:33:24,118 --> 01:33:27,319
resources there so they'll they'll send

2398
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:29,639
signals into the soil that make it

2399
01:33:27,319 --> 01:33:33,000
inhospitable for the plants of the same

2400
01:33:29,639 --> 01:33:34,719
species to grow um to try to uh you know

2401
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,840
preserve its own nutrients that might be

2402
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:38,880
in the soil right on that's that's

2403
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,840
that's good to say and I'm going to

2404
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:43,118
throw in my two even though some people

2405
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:45,600
like these um you know I always make

2406
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:48,519
sure that any any plants that I consider

2407
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:52,000
for a companion plant um does not give

2408
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:54,280
off floating seeds like dandelions I

2409
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,719
personally really love uh Pink

2410
01:33:54,279 --> 01:33:58,359
dandelions and I and I and I encourage

2411
01:33:56,719 --> 01:34:02,239
them in my yard actually CU they look

2412
01:33:58,359 --> 01:34:04,920
really trippy um and so but but before

2413
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:06,439
they go to seed um you know I've got a

2414
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:08,079
different seed crop at a different

2415
01:34:06,439 --> 01:34:10,198
property but but like I have to make

2416
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:11,600
sure you know I grab those because I

2417
01:34:10,198 --> 01:34:14,879
don't want all those like little fuzzy

2418
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:16,920
puff balls in my resinous flowers right

2419
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:20,679
that is definitely a party fowl and so

2420
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:24,039
any plant that gives off um you know uh

2421
01:34:20,679 --> 01:34:25,719
fluffy seed that are going to be wind uh

2422
01:34:24,039 --> 01:34:27,600
distributed you want to be careful of

2423
01:34:25,719 --> 01:34:30,239
those and then even though a lot of

2424
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:32,679
people like uh red clover I personally

2425
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:35,559
caution people from the red clover

2426
01:34:32,679 --> 01:34:37,760
because the red flower shoots up and if

2427
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:40,119
you don't grow monster plants if you're

2428
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:44,480
growing plants that are only you know 3

2429
01:34:40,118 --> 01:34:47,079
feet and not 10 ft uh 3 feet the Clover

2430
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:48,959
could totally grow up into and start

2431
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:50,600
interacting with your resin and and we

2432
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:53,359
don't want that either so the last

2433
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:56,600
question here is is is one that uh I

2434
01:34:53,359 --> 01:34:59,000
talk about sometimes on um on shaping

2435
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:01,760
fire but but mostly it the the

2436
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:04,920
discussion has has happened on the

2437
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:09,159
shaping fire YouTube channel where um I

2438
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:12,359
posted a a video with a microbiologist

2439
01:35:09,158 --> 01:35:16,039
that had was a specialist in in plant

2440
01:35:12,359 --> 01:35:20,519
microbe interaction talking about how um

2441
01:35:16,039 --> 01:35:24,000
the 24hour light strategy is is bad for

2442
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:29,480
cannabis and and I fully believe this to

2443
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:34,118
be the case because um you know uh photo

2444
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:36,399
synthetic plants have a have uh evolved

2445
01:35:34,118 --> 01:35:39,158
processes that happen during the dark

2446
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:41,479
cycle so so if the plant is naturally

2447
01:35:39,158 --> 01:35:43,079
growing Outdoors it gets a day cycle

2448
01:35:41,479 --> 01:35:44,399
gets a night cycle during the night

2449
01:35:43,079 --> 01:35:46,679
cycle the

2450
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:49,599
photosynthesizing um stops and other

2451
01:35:46,679 --> 01:35:53,639
processes happen and that's how you keep

2452
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:55,960
a strong rambunctious plant but we know

2453
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:58,600
from experiments indoor plants when

2454
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:02,359
you're supplementing with light that if

2455
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:04,119
you grow the plant at 24 hours um it's

2456
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:06,000
it's like giving the plant cocaine or

2457
01:36:04,118 --> 01:36:08,719
something like where the plants just go

2458
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,760
go go go and constantly photosynthesize

2459
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:13,840
constantly process these sugars go ra

2460
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:16,440
and and like and so it will it will make

2461
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:18,880
your your your your seed germinate

2462
01:36:16,439 --> 01:36:22,359
faster it will make the young plant move

2463
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:24,600
faster it will bring it into be becoming

2464
01:36:22,359 --> 01:36:27,118
you know a ready to flower teenage plant

2465
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:28,800
faster and then in the flowering some

2466
01:36:27,118 --> 01:36:31,799
people find that they reach maturity of

2467
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:34,400
the flower faster to such a degree that

2468
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:36,800
they can you know knock a week off of

2469
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:39,319
flowering sometimes and they're all like

2470
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:41,679
listen if if if if if I do that with

2471
01:36:39,319 --> 01:36:43,880
every cycle my whole year I can actually

2472
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:46,960
squeeze in another cycle a year and

2473
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:49,319
that's real money and so because of that

2474
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:53,198
the case for a 24-hour light cycle is

2475
01:36:49,319 --> 01:36:56,639
made and I take every opportunity I can

2476
01:36:53,198 --> 01:37:00,479
to try to teach that the the dark cycle

2477
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:02,118
is necessary for plant health and um you

2478
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:04,559
Michael you know you're you're the front

2479
01:37:02,118 --> 01:37:06,599
line of this debate as a microbiologist

2480
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:09,280
you know these Cycles

2481
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:11,760
intimately and and you know what happens

2482
01:37:09,279 --> 01:37:13,599
in the you know what happens in the dark

2483
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:16,600
and so so I'm going to kind of throw

2484
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:19,679
myself up um hopefully um hopefully I'm

2485
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:21,880
not wrong in your eyes but um I'd like

2486
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:25,840
to hear you speak to this idea of the

2487
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:28,199
24-hour light strategy and um and how

2488
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:30,920
that that might impact uh the

2489
01:37:28,198 --> 01:37:32,960
plant yeah absolutely I think um you

2490
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:34,760
know that's got to be one of the most uh

2491
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:37,880
nutritionally expensive types of

2492
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:40,440
cultivation practices I would think um

2493
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:44,880
that could be done uh I I wonder what

2494
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:46,279
types of um you know nutrient usage uh

2495
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,639
rates people are going through if

2496
01:37:46,279 --> 01:37:50,639
they're uh doing this practice with

2497
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:53,279
24-hour light cycles um because I would

2498
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:55,359
imagine that with 24 hours of daylight

2499
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:57,439
without any types of resting period um

2500
01:37:55,359 --> 01:37:58,839
that the plant is going to be constantly

2501
01:37:57,439 --> 01:38:00,638
uh requiring extremely high

2502
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:03,119
concentrations of nitrogen phosphorus

2503
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:05,440
and potassium um essential processes

2504
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:09,158
like the kreb cycle happen uh at

2505
01:38:05,439 --> 01:38:11,039
nighttime um plants also do these um

2506
01:38:09,158 --> 01:38:12,759
things called like gation where there

2507
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:15,079
might be air bubbles in the plant

2508
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:16,880
vascular tissue which can be detrimental

2509
01:38:15,079 --> 01:38:18,840
um but at night time they can push those

2510
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:23,199
out um you know they also close their

2511
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:25,639
stamata and uh don't evaporate the water

2512
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:28,598
out of their bodies as as quickly so I

2513
01:38:25,639 --> 01:38:31,199
think primarily the

2514
01:38:28,599 --> 01:38:32,880
um the benefit to get another cycle

2515
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:34,598
might be missed by the amount of

2516
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:37,319
nutrients somebody might need from

2517
01:38:34,599 --> 01:38:39,199
trying to maintain the nutritional needs

2518
01:38:37,319 --> 01:38:41,000
of the cannabis plant uh by blasting

2519
01:38:39,198 --> 01:38:43,079
them with 24 hours of light right if

2520
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,479
you're going to be um you know basically

2521
01:38:43,079 --> 01:38:46,599
giving your plants cocaine and keeping

2522
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:48,559
them at high energy high growth optimal

2523
01:38:46,599 --> 01:38:50,159
fast growth rates and developments

2524
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:52,520
there's going to be a lot of energy

2525
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:53,719
spent for that um and in order to them

2526
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:55,520
for them to kind of account for that

2527
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:58,118
deficit there needs to be tons and tons

2528
01:38:55,520 --> 01:39:00,199
of available nutrient inputs there um

2529
01:38:58,118 --> 01:39:03,158
and I I don't know that one other cycle

2530
01:39:00,198 --> 01:39:05,279
might be uh beneficial enough to to to

2531
01:39:03,158 --> 01:39:07,118
have to add that much more fertigation

2532
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:09,319
in in my experience the people who are

2533
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:11,479
defending the 24-hour light cycle are

2534
01:39:09,319 --> 01:39:14,279
are usually people that are using you

2535
01:39:11,479 --> 01:39:15,718
know two-part bottled salt fertilizers

2536
01:39:14,279 --> 01:39:18,960
and so they're kind of like force

2537
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:21,319
feeding the plants uh nutrition anyway

2538
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:24,239
and uh you know it's it's pretty rare to

2539
01:39:21,319 --> 01:39:27,079
find a you know a bottled nutrients

2540
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:29,559
grower who isn't overfeeding anyway

2541
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:31,960
because if some is good more is better

2542
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:33,639
right and so and so that that's actually

2543
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:35,359
the answer that I get online when

2544
01:39:33,639 --> 01:39:37,400
discussing this with with these these

2545
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:39,319
cultivators are at that'll well if it

2546
01:39:37,399 --> 01:39:41,439
just makes the plant more hungry for

2547
01:39:39,319 --> 01:39:43,719
more nutrition I'll just pour more in

2548
01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:47,079
and I'm like Ah that's not really how it

2549
01:39:43,719 --> 01:39:48,520
works um but um for folks who aren't

2550
01:39:47,079 --> 01:39:50,880
familiar with it you mentioned that the

2551
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:52,599
KB cycle happens in the dark period we

2552
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:55,840
we will you explain what that

2553
01:39:52,599 --> 01:39:58,400
is well the um the plant starts to

2554
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:00,239
respire so it stops using the light um

2555
01:39:58,399 --> 01:40:02,719
or the photons from the sunlight or your

2556
01:40:00,238 --> 01:40:05,158
LEDs or any types of lighting you have

2557
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:07,480
as um kind of like the building blocks

2558
01:40:05,158 --> 01:40:09,079
to metabolism um and it starts to

2559
01:40:07,479 --> 01:40:11,439
respire basically it's getting its

2560
01:40:09,079 --> 01:40:12,840
energy from off gassing um things that

2561
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:16,039
might be in the there as opposed to

2562
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:17,920
using the light energy to um kind of

2563
01:40:16,039 --> 01:40:20,359
make more chloroplast and and things

2564
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:22,679
along those lines so when I'm when I'm

2565
01:40:20,359 --> 01:40:24,880
talking about uh this with folks who who

2566
01:40:22,679 --> 01:40:29,520
are very very

2567
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:30,719
um into the 24-hour light strategy um

2568
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,920
they come back to me and they're like

2569
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:33,719
they're like well you're telling me I

2570
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:35,679
can't do this but I do this all the time

2571
01:40:33,719 --> 01:40:39,800
and I get plants and I smoke them and I

2572
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:41,679
get high and it's great and and and to

2573
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:44,079
the best of my scientific knowledge I

2574
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:46,719
say to them I say yeah but you're you're

2575
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:48,118
getting a plant that isn't the best

2576
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:51,439
plant you could have

2577
01:40:48,118 --> 01:40:56,238
grown um if you if you need

2578
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:58,919
fast cheap styrofoam tasting flour

2579
01:40:56,238 --> 01:41:01,559
quickly okay that that might be an

2580
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:03,920
appropriate strategy to consider but

2581
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:08,639
since most of us are looking for a

2582
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:12,079
thriving plant which um you know also

2583
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:15,199
provides high quality Tarpin that just

2584
01:41:12,079 --> 01:41:18,000
like engage us and give us a better high

2585
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:21,399
and also creates pest resistance it

2586
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:24,359
seems to me that the 24-hour lightle

2587
01:41:21,399 --> 01:41:26,759
will slowly but surely degrade a

2588
01:41:24,359 --> 01:41:28,679
cannabis plant throughout its entire

2589
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:31,360
life cycle what what are your thoughts

2590
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:33,639
about that like is the is is the is the

2591
01:41:31,359 --> 01:41:35,960
life of the cannabis plant so short

2592
01:41:33,639 --> 01:41:40,000
where over where over that life cycle it

2593
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:43,359
doesn't matter if we starve the

2594
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,319
soil I I kind of am thinking that I it

2595
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:47,198
does matter you know the canopus plant

2596
01:41:45,319 --> 01:41:48,960
life cycle is a lot longer to to

2597
01:41:47,198 --> 01:41:50,359
maturation and harvest than a lot of

2598
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:52,039
other different crops that are kind of

2599
01:41:50,359 --> 01:41:54,839
following the school of thought and I

2600
01:41:52,039 --> 01:41:57,359
think that um you know speculatively

2601
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:59,119
there's a lot of uh things that happen

2602
01:41:57,359 --> 01:42:01,920
that are beneficial to the pl vascular

2603
01:41:59,118 --> 01:42:03,559
system during the rest period um pushing

2604
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:06,158
those air bubbles out closing those

2605
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:09,039
stamata uh and things along those lines

2606
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:10,439
that I would imagine play a role in the

2607
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:12,118
the synthesis of cannaboids and

2608
01:42:10,439 --> 01:42:15,079
terpenoids and other secondary

2609
01:42:12,118 --> 01:42:17,079
metabolites um so I think yeah it would

2610
01:42:15,079 --> 01:42:20,399
be interesting to do a side by side with

2611
01:42:17,079 --> 01:42:23,399
the same kind of cultivar or strain of

2612
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:26,799
of cannabis uh you know in a 24-hour

2613
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:27,799
cycle versus an 186 followed by a 1212

2614
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,320
um and then the other thing that I

2615
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:30,719
wanted to mention uh you were talking

2616
01:42:29,319 --> 01:42:32,359
about kind of the indoor Growers and

2617
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:34,279
having those you know two to one salts

2618
01:42:32,359 --> 01:42:37,439
readily available and probably slightly

2619
01:42:34,279 --> 01:42:38,960
over applied um it it would be cool to

2620
01:42:37,439 --> 01:42:40,638
to get to a point to where we can kind

2621
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:42,439
of start to supplement uh those

2622
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:44,639
conventional salt-based fertilizers with

2623
01:42:42,439 --> 01:42:46,519
more organic things um and maybe even

2624
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:50,199
get to the point uh and this is from Dr

2625
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:51,840
James White the rise ofy scientist um

2626
01:42:50,198 --> 01:42:54,118
using those salts that are easily

2627
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:56,079
slipped up and and you know immediately

2628
01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:59,319
used in in building blocks of the plant

2629
01:42:56,079 --> 01:43:00,880
body um kind of has like corrective uh

2630
01:42:59,319 --> 01:43:02,639
treatments and you notice the deficiency

2631
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:05,599
you apply a salt and then you start to

2632
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:07,760
kind of balance both your your salt and

2633
01:43:05,599 --> 01:43:10,039
your organic based of nutrition inputs

2634
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:12,360
not only will that benefit the plant um

2635
01:43:10,039 --> 01:43:14,319
but also same thing with the microbes um

2636
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:16,880
there's been studies showing the same

2637
01:43:14,319 --> 01:43:19,439
exact you know strain of of cannabis

2638
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:21,639
growing in living soil versus growing in

2639
01:43:19,439 --> 01:43:23,479
uh Hydroponics with Biologicals and the

2640
01:43:21,639 --> 01:43:24,840
tarpine and cannaboid profiles are you

2641
01:43:23,479 --> 01:43:26,519
know statistically different from one

2642
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:29,800
another and I think a lot of that has to

2643
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:32,840
do with the the Tera or the terar of the

2644
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:36,440
cannabis plant yeah yeah the idea of

2645
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:39,039
supplementing with uh with um salt on

2646
01:43:36,439 --> 01:43:41,079
its face I'm prejudiced against but as a

2647
01:43:39,039 --> 01:43:42,639
citizen scientist I want to learn more

2648
01:43:41,079 --> 01:43:45,238
you know what I mean so yeah I

2649
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:47,279
understand yeah yeah yeah yeah so anyway

2650
01:43:45,238 --> 01:43:50,198
well well thank you for for uh diving

2651
01:43:47,279 --> 01:43:52,279
into that topic for me um it's clearly

2652
01:43:50,198 --> 01:43:55,118
something that I am passionate about and

2653
01:43:52,279 --> 01:43:57,519
I get argued with sometimes and so

2654
01:43:55,118 --> 01:44:00,000
anytime I you know when I get a

2655
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:02,400
microbiologist like you willing to talk

2656
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,359
to me about it I always bang that drum

2657
01:44:02,399 --> 01:44:05,559
so thank

2658
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:06,960
you yeah absolutely I mean like just

2659
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:08,719
more on the microb side I think just

2660
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:10,279
like the the soil temperatures do cool

2661
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:11,719
or the root temp the root Zone risos

2662
01:44:10,279 --> 01:44:13,039
spere temperatures will also cool in the

2663
01:44:11,719 --> 01:44:15,118
dark so kind of factoring in the

2664
01:44:13,039 --> 01:44:16,560
microbiome um that's just allowing more

2665
01:44:15,118 --> 01:44:18,639
environmental changes to maintain

2666
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:20,639
different diversity and things like that

2667
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:22,239
um with the the darkness period because

2668
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:23,639
you know a grow room will cool off 10Â°

2669
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:25,319
when the lights are off and things like

2670
01:44:23,639 --> 01:44:27,079
that yeah right on yeah and I'm sure

2671
01:44:25,319 --> 01:44:29,079
there's different cycles that need a

2672
01:44:27,079 --> 01:44:30,399
cooler temperature to happen yeah but

2673
01:44:29,079 --> 01:44:32,760
I'm interested in in kind of learning

2674
01:44:30,399 --> 01:44:34,719
more about the effects in the microbiome

2675
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:36,320
you know with this 24-hour versus

2676
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:38,960
getting that rest period that plants you

2677
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:40,719
know were evolve to have yeah so awesome

2678
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:42,719
well Michael we are here at the end um

01:44:50,439 --> 01:44:56,079
it it I I I didn't expect uh uh so much

2684
01:44:54,279 --> 01:45:00,079
so many times for us to come back to the

2685
01:44:56,079 --> 01:45:02,960
answer being diverse micro teas but but

2686
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:05,359
really you know the the more I get into

2687
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:07,920
regenerative growing and really uh

2688
01:45:05,359 --> 01:45:12,079
growing in a way that's uh response to

2689
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:17,520
Nature the more I realize that um The

2690
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:20,679
Farmer's Only job is to create um Rich

2691
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:22,760
Nutri nutritive biologically diverse

2692
01:45:20,679 --> 01:45:25,440
soil and and so you're always going to

2693
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:27,360
come back to tea so so thank you very
