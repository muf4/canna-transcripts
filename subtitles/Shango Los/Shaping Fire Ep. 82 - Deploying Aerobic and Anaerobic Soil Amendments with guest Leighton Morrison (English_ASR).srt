[Music]

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000
the more we learn as students of living

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,399
soil

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,080
the more we uncover what we don't know

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,480
and desire to learn

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,118
we move from simple concepts to harder

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
ones

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,960
always building a bigger picture of the

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,839
world for ourselves

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,480
during shaping fire episode 79 with joey

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,640
burger

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,800
on creating soil amendments and natural

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,800
pesticides from local plants

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,239
i stumbled into a gap of my own

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,439
understanding right there during the

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,359
episode

17
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,399
joey was explaining the challenges to

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,719
using aerated compost teas on compacted

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,359
low

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,200
oxygen dirt and i realized that i really

21
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,238
didn't have a good context for what he

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559
was saying

23
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,359
i mean i learned on every shaping fire

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,519
episode

25
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,920
but in that moment i realized that while

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,160
i use aerated tea and could discuss

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
aerated versus anaerobic inputs on a

28
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,839
convention panel

29
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,320
that i really didn't have it solid in my

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,280
head from a regenerative perspective

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,118
how to use it as a regenerative tool i

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,280
laughed it off during the show and kept

33
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,438
going like i'm supposed to as a host

34
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,760
but when the show was over i immediately

35
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,239
got on the phone and called up my buddy

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,400
soil scientist leighton morrison and

37
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,798
interrogated him for an hour and a half

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,560
on aerobic and anaerobic inputs and

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,560
their uses

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,840
and at the end of that conversation i

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,759
realized how useful

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,079
and entertaining this information really

43
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,759
is and i figured you might get off on it

44
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,200

73
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,160
layton has joined us before for episode

74
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,959
59 on water and watering

75
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:28,479
and also for episode 54 on geology and

76

biomimicry in living soil cultivation

77
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,959
leighton is a lifelong enthusiast of

78
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,840
both aquaponics and living soil

79
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,759
his obsession with biosphere 2 led him

80
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,360
to set up aquaponics experiments at the

81
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,039
rodale institute

82
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,280
leighton has worked with world-renowned

83
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,759
soil biologist dr elaine ingham

84
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
blending his aquaculture insights with

85
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,639
traditional compost and compost tea

86
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,878
strategies

87
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,000
to prove that natural farming techniques

88
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:56,079
can replace modern synthetic agriculture

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,120
layton is currently founder of kingdom

90

project

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,199
leighton is a sought-after speaker and

95
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,199
past co-founder

96
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,280

cannabis cultivation conferences

98
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,199
today we're going to talk about aerobic

99
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,280
and anaerobic living soil environments

100
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,399
and how to effectively use each to build

101
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,519
your soil

102
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,120
welcome back to shaping fire leighton oh

103
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,640
it's great to be back shango it's always

104
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,400
a pleasure to chop it up with you

105
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,158
fabulous fabulous so let's get right

106
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,920
into it man so

107
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,560
um the discussion of the day is aerobic

108
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,559
versus

109
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,158
anaerobic growing environments for

110
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,719
cannabis and

111
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,840
you know it's kind of cheesy to start

112
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,799
off a discussion

113
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,519
with a you know a definition it's but

114
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,680
but you know

115
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,439
when it comes to it anaerobic and

116
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,040
aerobic environments

117
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:51,120
are just at the fringe of the science

118
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,318
that a lot of cannabis folks know

119
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,719
for for natural farmers and for

120
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,560
you know serious experienced cultivators

121
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,959
the idea of throwing around

122
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,719
you know aerobic and anaerobic as terms

123
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,039
is something that they do every day

124
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,479
but most consumers and probably a lot of

125
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,959
everybody else is not

126
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,919
going to be as readily uh comfortable

127
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,759
with those so

128
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,280
so let's start there would you define

129
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,598
the difference between

130
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,040
aerobic and anaerobic growing

131
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,519
environments

132
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,919
sure shane god be my honor um so

133
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,600
anaerobic means void of oxygen

134
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:29,758
so that would be zero parts per million

135
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,080
in aerobic to the best of our

136
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,319
scientific explanation at this point

137
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,959
would be eight parts per million or

138
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,159
greater

139
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:41,680
now there is a top end of that

140
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,439
which is problematic if you get to 12 to

141
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,800
15 parts per milliliter

142
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:49,199
in a parts per million of oxygen in a

143
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,560
aquatic environment you'll actually

144
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,600
start doing damage

145
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,240
to uh fish their eyeballs their

146
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
their slime there's you know the biofilm

147
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,840
on there

148
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,240
on their scales so there is definitely a

149
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,198
top end and i'll give you a quick short

150
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,439
story

151
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,478
um when i was down at rodale working

152
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,038
under a lane

153
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,279
she had a brewer that she was frustrated

154
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,120
with uh wasn't getting to work properly

155
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,478
and i saw she asked me to take a look at

156
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,399
it and i basically said well

157
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,478
your air pump is undersized that's why

158
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,198
you're having problems growing out

159
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,439
these organisms and it made me start to

160
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,400
think like oh man what if i brewed with

161
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,719
pure oxygen

162
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,439
what would happen so i got a tank of

163
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
oxygen

164
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,680
um and i figured out a way to cool it

165
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,359
because or warm it i should say so i

166
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,400
didn't subject the water or the

167
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,600
organisms to

168
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:40,638
you know ice cold liquid oxygen

169
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,960
and i started brewing with with oxygen

170
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,960
and i killed everything very quickly

171
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,240
so that's a fun little fact that yeah

172
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,439
there is there is a point of

173
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,478
too much so so we want to find this

174
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,038
particular

175
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,159
uh balance where our tiger our target

176
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,279
microbes can

177
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,039
can most survive or most thrive i this

178
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,079
this eight parts per million

179
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,719
uh threshold um where does that come

180
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,240
from

181
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,319
you know with most things in science

182
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,199
it's not usually just like put somewhere

183
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,680
randomly

184
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,240
does something happen at more or less

185
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,439
than

186
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,759
eight parts per million um of oxygen

187
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,439
that allows some process or disallows

188
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,240
some process why is that the threshold

189
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,160
point

190
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,319
you know that's a great question and i

191
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,720
think it probably comes from

192
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:32,240
um larger organisms not micros

193
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,319
not microbes um so fish

194
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,918
you know we've been studying animals and

195
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,439
uh mammals and

196
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:41,599
fish for a long time now and i think

197
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:45,600
that there was some realization

198
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,600
that you would not get certain species

199
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,759
of fish and again i'm staying in the

200
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,199
aquatic environment for right now

201
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,800
um that could live in lower than eight

202
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,680
parts per million in oxygen

203
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,280
so you know like uh trout or temperature

204
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,400
sensitive fish

205
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:05,279
for the most part would not do well

206
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,959
in less than eight parts per million so

207
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,879
i think that's kind of where

208
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:13,839
that boundary got set and it's

209
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,199
interesting because if you look at

210
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,318
swamps

211
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,840
where you have stagnant water and low

212
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,840
levels of oxygen

213
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:27,279
you end up with more reptiles turtles

214
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:30,399
snails salamanders snakes

215
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,239
so again i think that that science

216
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,198
decided that at

217
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,759
eight points or eight parts per million

218
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,520
was

219
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:42,879
the sweet spot for definition of aerobic

220
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,680
environment so um

221
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,959
you know i i my next question was going

222
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,120
to be like do we consider

223
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,680
aerobic environments to be living in

224
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,680
anaerobic environments to be dead

225
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,519
and i knew that i had a little bit of

226
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,240
problem with that definition because i'm

227
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,120
pretty sure

228
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,400
that the rice patties um well where they

229
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,959
grow rice

230
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,638
are anaerobic environments and yet they

231
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,239
look healthy and they grow things and

232
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,000
now you just named another

233
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,439
anaerobic environment a wetland that i

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,839
hadn't considered

235
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,560
and and they can be teeming with life

236
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,478
right

237
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:20,399
and so so would you give some examples

238
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,839
of anaerobic and aerobic environments

239
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,758
so that we can kind of picture them in

240
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,079
my head because i honestly the only

241
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,120
thing i pictured as an anaerobic

242
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:32,559
environment was just like you know

243
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,000
a sludgy pool of water

244
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,000
in some city concrete with filth right

245
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,559
but but but but i'm getting over this

246
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,320
idea that anaerobic does not

247
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,919
mean uh unalive it just might mean

248
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,839
off-putting to the human

249
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,639
palate and knows well said my friend

250
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,399
well said

251
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:57,360
so you know a lot of this stems from

252
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,879
the soil food web camp and the natural

253
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,839
farming camp

254
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,278
and it doesn't have to and i personally

255
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,440
try my best to

256
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,320
make everybody realize that it's all

257
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
life

258
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,080
and i don't care where it comes from and

259
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,799
you know the definition of

260
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,480
a ferment is basically the use of a

261
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,958
biological process

262
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,639
with zero oxygen so there's still

263
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,639
biology in there

264
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,000
and i'm sure we'll we'll go down that

265
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,439
rabbit hole deeper but

266
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,799
here's here's some things to think about

267
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,560
zero oxygen ice cold

268
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:36,879
no atmosphere um no gravity

269
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,000
and yet the tardigrade can live in outer

270
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,879
space

271
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,679
and they most recently harvested some

272
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,320
bacteria

273
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,679
off the outside of the international

274
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,519
space station

275
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,879
in a test that they started about three

276
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,278
years ago

277
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,720
and that biology was still alive so

278
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,759
there's a

279
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,399
extreme environment um here's here's the

280
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,278
even more extreme bottom of the sea

281
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,078
floor

282
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,000
under incredible pressure that would

283
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:07,519
just ex you know

284
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,639
compact a submarine off of these

285
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:14,159
volcanic vents so you've got

286
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:17,199
super hot super cold no light no oxygen

287
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,439
and yet you have organisms growing

288
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,440
that would be another prime example of

289
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,560
of an atmosphere

290
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,120
or a condition or environment that was

291
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,479
void of

292
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,720
everything that we think of as alive

293
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,480
so the obvious one is you know the other

294
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,079
end of the spectrum um and again i'm

295
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,560
going to stay in aquatic environments

296
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:36,879
because

297
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,399
you know the we're breathing air yeah

298
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,480
the examples are a little easier

299
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,159
in aquatic environments too and also

300
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
shout out to the to the tardy grade

301
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,958
right

302
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,120
water bears got a lot yeah i'm part of

303
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,799
the fan base

304
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,759
so so let me let me ask this in a

305
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:55,919
different way then because um

306
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,720
um if i so so my first time coming

307
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,879
across

308
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:04,000
a um a anaerobic

309
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,838
ferment was one of my friends here on

310
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,600
vashon trevor he's the first person

311
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,880
actually he's the first person for me to

312
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,639
really be aware of

313
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,799
trying natural farming here on the

314
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,439
island and he had these five gallon

315
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,240
buckets

316
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,880
that were you know filled halfway with

317
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,560
uh

318
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,958
invasive plant material from his

319
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,039
property and the rest with water

320
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,559
and then he had some aquarium bubblers

321
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,199
in a couple of them

322
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,159
and then he had most of them that were

323
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,600
just

324
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:34,958
in my eyes just rotting in the sun

325
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,879
and and they smelled really um

326
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,319
well i could be nice and say pungent but

327
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,078
they smelled like crap right

328
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,640
i didn't like how they smelled they were

329
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,719
off-putting right and so

330
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,679
i couldn't believe that he was gonna put

331
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,879
this stuff

332
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,559
in his um in his plants but his plants

333
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,958
always looked really good he's a he's a

334
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,919
very talented uh cultivator

335
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,879
and so i wonder to myself i wonder

336
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,599
myself now

337
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,000
if if it's inaccurate for me to say

338
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
anaerobic environments are dead

339
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,159
they are just maybe the ones that i

340
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,720
don't prefer is it possible that i

341
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,240
it's just because as a human i'm a

342
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,240
species that is

343
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:19,680
oxygen loving that i am naturally

344
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:22,079
um uh discouraged or pushed away from

345
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,199
anaerobic environments because they are

346
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,199
environments

347
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,320
like it's in a whole ecosystem that i

348
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,320
don't interact with

349
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,320
like i want less of that and more

350
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,839
aerobic because that's the kind of thing

351
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,278
that keeps me alive

352
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,160
um any does it make any sense to that

353
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,439
yeah yeah no you you actually touched on

354
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,759
something in the last

355
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,800
little uh comment about your nose

356
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:50,639
so humans have a natural defense

357
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,879
it's called their nose the nose nose so

358
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,000
we wouldn't eat something that would

359
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,039
make us sick

360
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,600
and so therefore we're naturally turned

361
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,599
off

362
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:05,120
or ratch or remove ourself

363
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,079
from places that do not smell aerobic

364
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,799
so it's it's a primordial defense and

365
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,359
and again

366
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,159
even in a ferment even in an environment

367
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,560
with with

368
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,719
zero oxygen it's still live there's

369
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,919
still biology that lives there

370
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,200
it's just again not something that we

371
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,639
would typically

372
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,759
want to stick our hands in put our nose

373
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,959
near

374
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:32,000
drink or eat because of that

375
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:35,599
primordial defense mechanism of you know

376
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,399
don't play with this because it smells

377
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,519
funny or smells bad i think that has

378
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,198
made me i mean like i'm

379
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,039
realizing it right now that i think that

380
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,679
this has made me prejudice against

381
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,319
anaerobic fermentations and inputs in

382
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,399
general

383
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,160
because they smell bad and so in my head

384
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,078
i'm like oh they smell bad that's death

385
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,919
i don't want to pour death on my plants

386
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,198
and that's that's just wrong that's

387
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,078
that's bro science

388
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,078
of the worst kind

389
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,000
well i love the way you said dead uh

390
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,039
because let's face

391
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,639
it when when life leaves the body

392
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:10,719
uh animal plant or or human um

393
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,399
generally there's not a very nice smell

394
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,040
for a period of time until

395
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,198
um the complete decaying process or

396
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,198
fermentation

397
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:24,719
is over and you know

398
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:29,039
when i first crash landed back here and

399
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:32,320
march 4th two days before the shutdown

400
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,799
2020 um i

401
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,920
i was you know looking around going oh

402
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,000
my god this place

403
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,519
you know oxnard is amazing you know

404
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,159
ventura county look at all these

405
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,720
different plants it's all tropical

406
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,439
then the lockdown hit and i really

407
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,800
didn't have

408
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,880
anything to do all my jobs dried up um

409
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,919
the whole world was reeling as to what

410
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,919
this meant and

411
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:58,159
what was gonna happen and so i decided i

412
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,599
was gonna you know at least continue my

413
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,198
work

414
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,199
and so i decided i was going to make a

415
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,399
compost pile the only problem was i

416
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,519
didn't have any inoculant

417
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,879
nor did i have any fish frass to

418
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,360
to get the pile going so what i did was

419
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,679
i

420
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,919
collected greens and browns scrounged

421
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,359
them again diversity diversity as much

422
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,919
different browns as many different

423
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,800
greens as i could clip

424
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,319
and i poured them and i put them in a

425
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,919
cylinder made out of

426
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:31,040
6x6 wire and some insect screen

427
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,719
and i wet them down and

428
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,078
then i went to the beach and i collected

429
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,639
some

430
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,838
kelp and again you know as many diverse

431
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,639
types as i could find

432
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,360
threw it in a 5 gallon compound bucket

433
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,519
and sat it in the sun for five days

434
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,639
and watched it and when it started to

435
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,278
foam um

436
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,039
i whipped out my microscope and took a

437
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:54,159
look at it and was like bam

438
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,519
look at the life in here and it had

439
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:59,278
just turned to a funk

440
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,560
it didn't smell putrid it didn't smell

441
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,519
like poop

442
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,278
but it didn't smell like it did when i

443
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,480
first collected it when it was not

444
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,078
anaerobic

445
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,399
and it smelled fresh now it was

446
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,679
something in between and i poured that

447
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,440
on my compost pile

448
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,319
and within two weeks it was some amazing

449
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,079
organisms

450
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,759
uh growing in there so

451
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:26,319
our our thought of that something bad

452
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,600
means automatically is dead is is

453
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,360
incorrect

454
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,759
you know there's still a lot of life

455
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,000
there as we've just discussed

456
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,039
so again it's you know a primordial

457
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,240
instinct

458
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:41,919
to reject something that does not smell

459
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,399
um like something we want to consume

460
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,278
but that doesn't mean that it's dead all

461
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,519
right so

462
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,078
so if we if we now understand the

463
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,440
difference between aerobic and anaerobic

464
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:56,159
environments and we get the idea

465
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,959
that you know generally one is not

466
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,240
necessarily

467
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,159
better than the other they're just

468
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,120
different expressions of

469
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,879
life um but we are talking about our

470
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,359
favorite plant cannabis

471
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,240
and so will you kind of like bring this

472
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,438
on home

473
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,000
and talk about um you know

474
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,360
what is the nature of the cannabis plant

475
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,318
in that

476
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,438
we as cannabis cultivators are trying to

477
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,318
create

478
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,038
aerobic environments because that's

479
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,399
where our

480
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:28,318
our cannabis plant thrives

481
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,240
ooh that's a good one all right let's

482
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,960
let's reel it back in

483
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,319
where were the original land races

484
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,319
coming from

485
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,319
they were coming from the jungle in

486
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,519
india and they were coming from

487
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,000
mountaintops in

488
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:42,558
afghanistan and pakistan with no

489
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,558
moisture

490
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,599
and the other was coming from extreme

491
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:47,678
moist

492
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,279
i mean the interesting thing about

493
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,200
perhaps let's let's go right to the

494
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,759
amazon the jungle

495
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,000
um if anyone's ever been there they'll

496
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:59,038
know exactly what i'm talking about

497
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,200
it's just such a weird place where

498
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:04,319
everything is rotting around you

499
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:08,240
so fast like the soil is just

500
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:11,839
teeming with death and life and the air

501
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:16,400
is is crisp with oxygen

502
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:18,639
um but you're living in a place where

503
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,720
in the soil everything is is going

504
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,440
through rapid decay

505
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,480
so that would be an anaerobic

506
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,519
environment or an anaerobic digester

507
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,240
and the absolute opposite is happening

508
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,879
in pakistan and afghanistan where you

509
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,400
have

510
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,600
zero humidity and very little rain

511
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,280
so this plant has proven

512
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,038
many different things to many different

513
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,079
people but her

514
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:49,519
ability to live

515
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:51,119
in an environment that is so hostile

516
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,558
it's not funny and i'm not even talking

517
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,879
about rudy alice

518
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,319
that's another one but each in the

519
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,480
cannabis family

520
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:01,678
but it triggers its own flowering

521
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,640
because it doesn't get the light cycles

522
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,798
so you know that's why i think that so

523
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,240
many of these different practices

524
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:13,519
from natural farming fermentation

525
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,079
to soil food web

526
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,319
growing in super soils that are super

527
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:23,279
aerated

528
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:23,279
both methods show efficacy

529
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:28,000
so so let's see here let's unpack that a

530
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,839
little bit you took that in a way that i

531
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,440
wasn't expecting because what i thought

532
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:35,279
you were gonna say

533
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,080
is that um the the

534
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,879
the microbe life the rhizosphere that

535
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,240
the cannabis

536
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,120
plant has evolved to interact with right

537
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,759
where

538
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,759
the cannabis plant is getting sunshine

539
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,879
it is

540
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:49,919
photosynthesizing that and turning it

541
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,000
into

542
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,960
exudates that come out of its root

543
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,119
structure

544
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,000
and feed the microbes and at the same

545
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,439
time

546
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,440
those microbes are living and excreting

547
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,038
nutrition that the plant needs and so

548
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,519
they've got this back and forth

549
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,038
i thought you were going to say that for

550
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:11,279
the cannabis plant

551
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:14,640
it it has that relationship with

552
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:17,519
oxygen loving microbes so cannabis is

553
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,720
always going to be best grown in aerated

554
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,000
soil

555
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,200
but it perhaps that is untrue

556
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,480
um will cannabis grow

557
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:34,000
just as effectively in an anaerobic soil

558
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,640
you had to go there

559
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,759
what i love about you shango ah no punch

560
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,600
is held

561
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,759
uh let's let's talk about alan atkins

562
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:45,279
work all right and the earth boxes

563
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:49,279
um kevin daughtry's got some

564
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:52,720
videos up documenting um the saving of a

565
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,480
um an old cultivar i believe it was a

566
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,000
skunk plant

567
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,440
and he used allen atkins anaerobic

568
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,839
let's let's get it right because alan's

569
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,200
great allen adkison

570
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:06,798
i'm horrible in that enunciation i can't

571
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,000
spell because i come from new england

572
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,599
and i can't announce either

573
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,279
well wait wait until you start saying

574
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,839
rio's sphere

575
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,558
horizon sphere yeah all right so go

576
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,599
ahead allen

577
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:20,399
all right so he he's proven um

578
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,439
that it is possible um and in some cases

579
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,640
you can actually

580
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,679
um hold back

581
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,480
uh viruses and or genetic drift from

582
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,440
continuing

583
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,079
in an anaerobic environment and i

584
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,720
remember

585
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,678
distinctly this was the first regen

586
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,798
conference

587
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:42,320
in humboldt

588
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:46,000
at beginnings and elaine

589
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:50,720
myself joshua went to see um

590
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,319
kev and kevin was excited to see lane

591
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,440
and right away this earth box came up

592
00:21:54,319 --> 00:22:00,798
and to be a fly on the wall and know how

593
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:05,038
much elaine preaches

594
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:07,440
of the horrors of anaerobic environments

595
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:08,640
i was just enamored that he was

596
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,120
explaining how

597
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,320
he had basically saved a plant i forget

598
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,678
the name of the virus

599
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:18,639
that that causes dudding

600
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,038
but had had stopped this or saved the

601
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,679
plant

602
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,798
stopped the dudding and was actually out

603
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,000
able to now

604
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:29,679
grow the plant out to some degree of

605
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,759
success by exposing it to full sun

606
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:37,440
and an anaerobic root base um it was

607
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,440
i thought elaine was going to fall over

608
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,279
but there's you know there's also um

609
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,038
sips

610
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:48,558
where you're using um anaerobic water

611
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:49,440
um underneath soil and having the roots

612
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,960
push through

613
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,240
and down into that anaerobic water and

614
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,360
there is some efficacy there so

615
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,679
you know again i think that you have to

616
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,439
look

617
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:06,480
at what cultivar you're growing

618
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,679
yeah because if you took a plant or a

619
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,480
cultivar with a

620
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,960
strong dominant history that came from

621
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,000
perhaps

622
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,798
afghanistan and through it in in a swamp

623
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,558
or

624
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:21,519
amazon i don't don't think that it would

625
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:24,319
perhaps do very well although you know

626
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,400
nature proves us wrong all the time

627
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,000
so you know in that environment i would

628
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,120
say that you know

629
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,839
again personally speaking

630
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:37,918
i i prefer the the middle ground um

631
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:41,119
biomimicry and we all know that

632
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,480
in nature you get extremes more so now

633
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:46,079
than ever

634
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,079
and so in a natural setting

635
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,119
um perhaps you would get a drought

636
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,558
during the summer

637
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:56,000
and a deluge deluge in spring and fall

638
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:58,480
so both in spring and fall you would be

639
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
thresholding on anaerobic and in the

640
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,038
summer you would be obviously

641
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,798
extremely aerobic as things dried out

642
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:09,759
now believe it or not but as the soil

643
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,240
structure dries out and the biofilm

644
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,158
cakes

645
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,000
and turns to flake soil structure can

646
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,799
easily collapse especially if it's

647
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,240
exposed

648
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:23,759
to pressure either from a foot

649
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,880
or from an extreme rain so that

650
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:30,640
aerobic summer soil all of a sudden gets

651
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,520
pounded by a deluge in the fall before

652
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,278
harvest

653
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,038
that soil structure is going to collapse

654
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,480
and now you're back in an anaerobic

655
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,200
environment and there's nothing you can

656
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,519
do to change that because over time

657
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,679
it will happen naturally but you're not

658
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,079
going to instantly turn

659
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,240
compacted soil into aggregates so what

660
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,038
do you do

661
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,880
if you follow suit now now's a good time

662
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:56,400
to start using your

663
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,440
fermented plant extracts to finish the

664
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,278
plant

665
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:05,360
even though its roots are basically

666
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:07,839
soggy and not in an aerobic environment

667
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:10,240
now something else that you need to take

668
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:13,278
into consideration too and that is that

669
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,759
the ability of that root and the

670
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,400
rhizosphere which is the coating around

671
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:21,440
it where all the magic happens

672
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:25,278
um interestingly enough can

673
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:29,278
produce organisms that eat

674
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:32,640
certain elements and excrete oxygen

675
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:35,440
and vice versa it can also

676
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,960
change the ph of the soil around the

677
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,679
rhizosphere

678
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,840
so there's a lot of magic happening in

679
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,000
this

680
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:48,399
microbial plant soil interaction

681
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,200
that science hasn't completely caught up

682
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,480
with i mean

683
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,159
yes we've identified these

684
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,278
five phosphate solubilizing bacteria but

685
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,960
in nature

686
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:02,720
they're in a community and there is

687
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,440
what i want to call biological

688
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,319
succession exactly like there's plant

689
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,120
succession

690
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,798
you go from the swamp zero oxygen or

691
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,798
very low oxygen

692
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,639
all the way up to the redwoods very

693
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:17,519
oxygenated highly fungal

694
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,400
the other the swamp is bacterial

695
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,319
dominant

696
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,640
same thing is happening in a in a

697
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,079
biological world you are you are moving

698
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,278
through succession

699
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:29,119
on a constant basis this the whole

700
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:32,319
system is in flux

701
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:36,000
never stops so in that

702
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:38,960
if we're taking that into consideration

703
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,798
i again don't think that there is a

704
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,840
right or wrong way

705
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:47,038
um but again i would i would

706
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:50,639
caution you to use common sense

707
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:53,759
and biomimicry and not just you know

708
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,440
waterboard your cannabis plant

709
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,119
definitely give it give it some time to

710
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,080
dry down if you're going to over water

711
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,199
it i mean i know

712
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:03,278
people that water stress and they have

713
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,080
good results

714
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,278
so again i think it's comfort level as

715
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,720
to what

716
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,480
you feel is your best methodology for

717
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,519
growing cannabis

718
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,599
but i've seen extremes and you know

719
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,240
they've shown efficacy now whether they

720
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,319
got full genetic potential

721
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,000
i don't know that's that would be have

722
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,480
to be done in a side by side

723
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,880
and every time i've tried to get a

724
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,120
cannabis cultivator to do a side by side

725
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,640
it starts out great but the

726
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,798
documentation at the end

727
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,759
never seems to quite happen yeah totally

728
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:37,759
there are there are

729
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,679
documentation challenges with citizen

730
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,599
science i may be a big fan of it but

731
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,240
even i don't like to document everything

732
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,918
so yeah it's a lot of work so i want to

733
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,278
talk about one more aspect before we go

734
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,399
to our first commercial break we're

735
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:49,599
going to when we come back from the

736
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:51,359
commercial break we're going to talk a

737
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,839
lot more about

738
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,639
taking your soil from an anaerobic

739
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,879
environment

740
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,480
to becoming aerobic and and how to

741
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,919
condition the soil and such so we're

742
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,759
going to hit that but

743
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,080
but the last thing i want to hit here is

744
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,599
you know in this first set

745
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,519
giving people a picture of what

746
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,798
anaerobic anaerobic environments are

747
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,319
looking like we just

748
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:14,639
pinged the extremes right um

749
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,439
that's not how most of us are farming

750
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,038
though

751
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,080
so most of us are farming with um

752
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:24,798
you know like maybe it's new young soil

753
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,879
or maybe it's last year's soil

754
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,158
but let's just say unless you just

755
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,360
bought a parcel

756
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,159
and and you are working on

757
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:36,639
terrible soil or if you just brought

758
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,039
your pots out of a dry garage and they

759
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,600
were all stacked on top of each other

760
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:43,440
so they're like dry hydrophobic and

761
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,839
compressed let's say like generally

762
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,360
people are using fluffy soil

763
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:52,879
and and even with these extremes

764
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:54,798
that which should be considered the

765
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,640
i don't know i guess i could say gold

766
00:28:54,798 --> 00:29:00,960
standard but our default setting

767
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,520
is to grow in aerobic environments with

768
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,759
a

769
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,839
with oxygen loving microbes because

770
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:06,240
we're growing an oxygen loving plant

771
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,079
right

772
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,679
i just want to like back up if we've

773
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,079
confused anybody because

774
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,919
we we kind of our examples were pulled

775
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,678
from extreme examples

776
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,520
and and i want to make sure people

777
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,080
understand you don't have to suddenly

778
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,440
start

779
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:24,000
growing in an anaerobic environment to

780
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,880
to have the plant thrive like these

781
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,119
we're

782
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,720
we're looking at the entire picture but

783
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,558
really we're still saying grow in

784
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,360
aerobic environments

785
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,720
correct um you know super soil or

786
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,678
soilless mediums are

787
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,440
by nature you know oxidative they're

788
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,880
they're very aerobic there's a lot of

789
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,840
pore space

790
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,360
we consider them low tension soil and by

791
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,158
tension i mean

792
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:50,158
the ability of water to hold pressure in

793
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,880
the soil

794
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,600
so yeah when you're pulling out those

795
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,960
pots

796
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:59,599
after been sitting in the winter

797
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,519
over the winter dry and with no plants

798
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:03,839
in them you are going to have

799
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,558
hydrophobic issues and so the question

800
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,558
is how

801
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:12,000
best to land a inoculant

802
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:15,200
on that material that can

803
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,319
hold and take uh take take

804
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:22,240
uh footing take hold to it and so

805
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:25,599
you know that's where your your best to

806
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,440
try to get a lot of the material back to

807
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,278
a hydrophilic state

808
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,798
so that you're not fat fighting it and

809
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:33,759
everything you pour on it

810
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,558
just runs over the top and off the side

811
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:35,679
and so

812
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:37,759
you know there's some there's some

813
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,038
tricks um there's

814
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:44,558
uh yucca extracts which is a

815
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:47,679
surfactant so it helps the water

816
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:50,480
uh coating or helps the water

817
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,038
coat instead of bead so we've all seen

818
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,038
you know

819
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:54,398
water droplets beat up on the on the

820
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,119
hood of your car

821
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,959
um but you've also seen when water just

822
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:02,398
glazes of something

823
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,880
and that's where these surfactants

824
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,319
really play a good role in you know

825
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,240
creating that

826
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:12,798
uh moisture bond to the material that

827
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,759
has basically has a coating of wax

828
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:15,918
around it

829
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:17,679
um so i think in the past shows we did

830
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,720
talk about

831
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:23,919
what that really means hydrophobic and

832
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,759
it's basically when the bacteria

833
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,120
are not in an environment where they're

834
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,839
they're happy

835
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:34,398
they will go into a cyst form or insist

836
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:36,480
and basically what that means is

837
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:37,839
they create a wax coating around the

838
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,519
outside of them

839
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,240
and that in turn because there's so much

840
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,159
of them and

841
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,159
there's obviously biofilm that biofilm

842
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,000
helps to insulate it for a period of

843
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,679
time although eventually that biofilm

844
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,880
will flake off

845
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:58,080
um but those organisms will have

846
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,440
by then prevented moisture

847
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:04,439
from getting into that material and so

848
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,480
therefore that's why you have that

849
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,720
hydrophobic uh condition

850

hydrophobic

852
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,079
problems until until you and i did the

854
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,759
and uh and i'm happy to say that the

855

856
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,679
i haven't had any issues with that but

god i it was it was at the top of my

858
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,038
list of

859
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,519
issues back in the day so so let's go

860
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,319
ahead

861
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,120
and take our uh short break and when we

00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,119
we'll talk about taking um you know

864
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,558
compressed

865
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,158
hydrophobic anaerobic soil and and bring

866
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,240
it towards

867
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,159
turn it away from the dark side and and

868
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,960
bring it to the um the aerobic

869
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,080
environment

870
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,558
and and for folks who uh uh uh

871
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,879
wanted to hear more of what alan

872
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:54,639
atkinson's experiments looked like

873
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,960
um you can go ahead and listen to

874
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,840

um and uh and alan and i discuss

878
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:10,319
um his earth box and and the

879
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,840
attractiveness of of lactobacterias and

880
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,079
he's actually a historian so you

881
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:18,000
actually get to hear about how

882
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:20,558
um labs and and and inoculated kashis

883
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,398
were used all the way back by uh roman

884
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:24,879
soldiers uh to help

885
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:26,079
calm them and when they came back from

886
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,559
war so that's all

887
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,558
incredibly interesting you are listening

888
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:31,759
to shaping fire and my guest today is

[Music]

892
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:38,879
for years organic cultivators have been

893
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,678
looking for a replacement for using peat

894
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,679
moss

895
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,200
peat moss has long been the go-to soil

896
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,240
amendment for water retention and

897
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,319
container growing

898
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,159
but organic growers know that peat moss

899
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,000
is an unsustainable resource

900
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,559
and the mining of peat bogs destroys

901
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,480
habitat and releases sequestered carbon

902
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,000
but peat moss works so well that many

903
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,000
have continued to use it

904
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,759
but now there's finally a revolutionary

905
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,798
replacement for peat moss that shares

906
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,759
the same benefits

907
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:05,119
while also being sustainable pit moss

908
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,278
sounds and axe like

909
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,878
peat moss but instead of being mined

910
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,480
from fragile ecosystems

911
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,398
it actually is made from upcycled

912
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,559
organic paper and tree bark

913
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:16,078
pit moss is excellent at retaining water

914
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,878
in your substrate and creating air

915
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,359
pockets and

916
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,078
tiny living environments for microbes

917
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,639
pit moss

918
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,280
instantly increases aeration nutrient

919
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,000
absorption

920
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,040
and water conservation too carefully and

921
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,039
locally sourced

922
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,358
pit moss is the result of decades-long

923
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:34,480
research into the use of recycled paper

924
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,279
fibers pit moss has the fluffy nature of

925
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,760
peat moss

926
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,639
and handles exactly the same and like

927
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,560
peat moss

928
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,919

00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,400
and cultivators know that these efforts

1021
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,920
show through in his seeds

1022
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,760
and night owl seeds really are

1023
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,880
extraordinary just take a look at the

1024
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,280
thousands of photos

1025
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,720
by fans on instagram the proof is there

1026
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,119
and obvious

1027
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,239
terpenes are complex and rich plants

1028
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,160
have vigor

1029
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,239
if you are a fan of mephisto genetics

1030
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,440
like i am you'll likely also love night

1031
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,439
owl seeds

1032
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,440
night owl founder daz worked with mitch

1033
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,000
mephisto to build the mephisto brand for

1034
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,320
years

1035
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,519
including breeding mephisto's much-loved

1036
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,920
sour stomper and cosmic queen cultivars

1037
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,920
i'm growing both night owl and mephisto

1038
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,599
this year because i want the best

1039
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,358
and night owl seeds knows how to

1040
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,838
cultivate community too

1041
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,440

1042
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:26,078
packaging for limited runs

1043
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,559
and desirable freebies he really draws

1044
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,800
you in if you love creative branding

1045
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:32,559
night owl even has the secret owl

1057
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:02,159
night owl seeds at several distributors

1058
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,960
including dc seed exchange insane seeds

1059
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,759
and hemorrhage genetics that's night owl

1060
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,519
seeds

1061
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,920
there's a difference because we're

1062
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:12,320
different welcome back you are listening

1063
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,880
to shaping fire i am your host shango

1064
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,240
los

1065
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,559
and our guest this week is soil

1066
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:18,799
biologist leighton morrison

1067
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,400
so here in second set we're going to

1068
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,359
kind of shift gears a little bit during

1069
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,639
the first set

1070
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,880
we all talked about the nature of

1071
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:29,440
anaerobic anaerobic environments

1072
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,440
some examples how to think about them

1073
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,119
they're extreme examples

1074
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,960
so you know so far you kind of got a

1075
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,680
good picture of of

1076
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,159
you know these different ways of growing

1077
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,759
um

1078
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:41,519
but the second set we're going to kind

1079
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,040
of go through um

1080
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,440
kind of a specific example of of working

1081
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,400
with

1082
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,358
your soil when you're coming from an

1083
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,599
anaerobic

1084
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:52,559
abused soil what most of us would call

1085
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,960
dirt right

1086
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,639
before before it's teeming with life

1087
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,720
it's compressed and

1088
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,159
and there's not much going on there and

1089
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,919
and most of us would call it dirt and

1090
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:04,480
then we build it in the soil

1091
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,079
but this all comes specifically from i

1092
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,440
think it was three episodes back

1093
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,519
i was interviewing um joey burger

1094
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,880
and i was using for an example about how

1095
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:15,920
i use these you know

1096
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,680
incredibly aerated teas in my garden

1097
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,318
every summer and and you know i love my

1098
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:20,480
brewer

1099
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:21,679
and and and and how i like you know

1100
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,000
bubble it up

1101
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:25,118
and then i go and i and i pour it both

1102
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,519
as a as a

1103
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,880
root drench and foliar leaf for most my

1104
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:30,559
plants you know you know food and

1105
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,280
medicinal plants

1106
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:34,000
and he pointed out something that blew

1107
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,839
my mind

1108
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,719
and he pointed out he's like well you

1109
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:42,960
know you are pouring

1110
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:46,000
your highly aerated compost tea

1111
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,440
full of oxygen

1112
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,719
loving microbes into

1113
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,119
a soil environment that's anaerobic

1114
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:55,439
because

1115
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,880
in this example the the soil was

1116
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,039
unhealthy

1117
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,039
and and he's all like those those you

1118
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,119
know those soil loving microbes or

1119
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,279
excuse me the oxygen loving microbes are

1120
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,318
going to have a rough time of it

1121
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,519
and it it really blew my mind because

1122
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:14,800
i really thought of um

1123
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:16,719
aerobic compost teas as kind of being

1124
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,640
the universal superhero

1125
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:22,799
perfect for any situation and when

1126
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:25,279
and and now i get the idea that oh when

1127
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,519
i when i pour it on this anaerobic

1128
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,519
environment i'm actually just creating a

1129
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,639
bunch of death and sludge in the area

1130
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:31,519
because these microbes are going to

1131
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,400
immediately die

1132
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:34,719
and then they're going to have to be

1133
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,680
removed from the you know from the

1134
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,358
rhizosphere

1135
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:42,000
and so and so i called you layton

1136
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,679
and so and so you explained to me the

1137
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,719
the subtleties

1138
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:51,279
about the type of aerated teas

1139
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,399
slash ferments that were that we need to

1140
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,960
use so

1141
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,039
so let's kind of go through that process

1142
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,480
if if you would with me leighton so

1143
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:03,119
so in our example um we

1144
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,000
have got ourselves an anaerobic dirt

1145
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,720
environment

1146
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,480
and i am happily about to dump a whole

1147
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,279
bunch of ultra aerated tea

1148
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,519
on it but there's a better way you know

1149
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,359
what is the better way

1150
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:17,759
all right well let's let's quantify some

1151
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,920
stuff here all right so

1152
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,800
one of the greatest spiritual lessons i

1153
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,680
ever learned

1154
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,000
from a friend of mine john at the lake

1155
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:28,960
yeah

1156
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,719
right to define something is right

1157
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,039
is to automatically define everything

1158
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,039
else is wrong

1159
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,400
and i think if you let that resonate in

1160
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:39,119
your head for a minute

1161
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,760
you'll understand more about what i'm

1162
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,800
trying to explain

1163
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,839
one of the greatest strengths

1164
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,880
that i've found in taking

1165
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:54,799
dirt and converting it into

1166
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:58,880
aerobic soil is the use of fish frass

1167
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,599
now i started this journey a long time

1168
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,920
ago

1169
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,240
as a kid um but later to pick it up

1170
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,599
after a divorce

1171
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:11,118
and at the time i was working with um

1172
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,680
aquaculture uh companies to harvest

1173
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,599
their

1174
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:17,039
fish manure and work with it and

1175
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,599
i want you to think about this for a

1176
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:21,759
minute so that manure went from

1177
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,880
aerobic as it came out of the body of

1178
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,240
the fish

1179
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,680
in a water column of 8 to 10 parts per

1180
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,318
million

1181
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:32,399
sank to the bottom where it started to

1182
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,639
go through

1183
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,240
an anaerobic digestion for lack of

1184
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:38,799
better words

1185
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,959
to a point where it was screened out

1186
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,359
through a filtration

1187
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,039
where it went a hundred percent

1188
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:48,159
anaerobic

1189
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:50,880
and then i would take this material and

1190
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:54,399
i would aerobically stabilize it

1191
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,200
until i had this sweet smell

1192
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,280
which i associated with certain biology

1193
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,279
because i was able to do the microscopy

1194
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,560
to verify it

1195
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,480
and if you think about that that went

1196
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,599
from aerobic to anaerobic back to

1197
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,838
aerobic

1198
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,039
so what type of organisms will be

1199
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:13,440
present

1200
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,039
and the answer is all of them because if

1201
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,400
the environment isn't right they will

1202
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:20,159
assist

1203
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:24,079
so now i have this incredible

1204
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:26,399
toolbox full of anaerobic aerobic

1205
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,079
and facultative or oxygen tolerant

1206
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:32,240
anaerobes as well as

1207
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:35,680
low oxygen uh tolerant aerobes

1208
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:39,598
and everything in between

1209
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:40,719
so in in my work here's a a great story

1210
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,039
an example

1211
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,239
a dear client of mine harvey hubbell

1212
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,599
whose father

1213
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:48,799
the telescope was named after called me

1214
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,200
about a

1215
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,200
cornfield that had been in production

1216
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:55,598
for 60 years

1217
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:58,000
and it was horribly beat up he had tried

1218
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,359
to convert it to a hayfield

1219
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,880
with little to no success called me and

1220
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:05,279
brought me in

1221
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,400
so first thing i did was obviously soil

1222
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,440
testing

1223
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:13,200
uh infiltration um

1224
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,880
deep the deep pit percolation test

1225
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:17,199
you know the deep pit was so i could map

1226
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,358
out the horizons

1227
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:20,480
chemistry saturated paste tests and

1228
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:22,799
obviously i put some under the

1229
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,079
microscope to take a look at it

1230
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,079
once i got all the test data back i took

1231
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,920
into consideration what it would cost

1232
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,400
to just zero this field chemistry wise

1233
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,880
uh

1234
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,559
it ended up that i would have to spend

1235
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,318
twenty four hundred dollars

1236
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:42,799
per acre to put the chemistry back

1237
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:43,440
in complete balance so that would been

1238
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,760
twenty four

1239
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,519
thousand dollars for a ten acre field to

1240
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,480
grow hay in it

1241
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:52,079
and i explained what i found to to

1242
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,920
harvey knowing clearly he wasn't going

1243
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,359
to spend that kind of money

1244
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:01,838
but it opened the door to allow me

1245
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:05,358
to do a little bit more experimentation

1246
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:08,799
and bottom line was i said okay

1247
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:11,679
obviously you've got sparse grass or

1248
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,960
hay you've got clumps and patches of

1249
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,759
dirt

1250
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,280
it's horribly compacted i you know took

1251
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,200
my finger out and i tried to press it

1252
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,160
into the soil i said look i can't do

1253
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:25,439
anything this is this is compacted

1254
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:28,719
so in my experience i'm going to use

1255
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:32,079
a not completely

1256
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,959
aerobically stabilized fish manure along

1257
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,880
with

1258
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:40,960
a slightly anaerobic compost

1259
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,400
to initially land the first round of

1260
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,760
soldiers

1261
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:49,200
to begin to convert this soil

1262
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,920
or dirt toward soil

1263
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:53,118
i also asked the farmer that was doing

1264
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,159
the hay

1265
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,200
to get a little bit more diversity in

1266
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:59,118
the seed mix like

1267
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:02,159
you know clovers and some flowers and

1268
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:04,160
stuff that would not hurt the uh

1269
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,559
the the consumers the cows and the

1270
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:10,078
horses and

1271
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:12,318
so we uh we did an application um

1272
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,119
actually i had him cover or seed the

1273
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:14,880
whole property

1274
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,599
see the ten acres and right after he

1275
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:21,358
seeded it i came in and applied this

1276
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:24,559
uh biological concoction or mayonnaise

1277
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:28,078
and then i uh

1278
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:30,000
asked that uh i

1279
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,280
have the ability to come back in in

1280
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,760
mid-summer

1281
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,200
and do just a biological food which is

1282
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,839
essentially a

1283
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:43,199
uh water molasses and kelp

1284
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:45,679
and that after the first cutting that i

1285
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:48,719
be allowed to come back again and apply

1286
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:51,919
a completely aerobically stabilized

1287
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:54,078
uh compost extract as well as the

1288
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,519
fish manure by the way that company is

1289
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,839
called fish brew

1290
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,838
on cape cod fishbrew.com if you guys

1291
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:00,480
want to get this product it's amazing i

1292
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:02,558
cannot

1293
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,000
speak highly enough about it because

1294
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,640
again what i said earlier you are

1295
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,440
getting

1296
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:09,199
a complete suite of biology both

1297
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,039
anaerobic aerobic and everything in

1298
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:14,799
between

1299
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:17,838
and needless to say i came back

1300
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,359
just before the second cutting and i

1301
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:21,440
brought harvey out into the middle of

1302
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:22,639
the road and i pointed him at the field

1303
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,079
that we treated

1304
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:25,279
and i said what do you see harvey he

1305
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,318
goes wow you know it really looks

1306
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,240
healthy you know the

1307
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:29,519
color's nice you know i like the

1308
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,838
diversity of the

1309
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:33,119
of the hay and i don't have any patchy

1310
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:35,440
spots and

1311
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,960
so i spun around to look at a field on

1312
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,159
the other side of the street that we did

1313
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,000
not treat

1314
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:41,679
and i said can you see the difference

1315
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,440
and he he looked

1316
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:44,719
and his jaw dropped and he spun his head

1317
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,519
back and looked at the field we treated

1318
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:49,199
he said oh my god that feels alive

1319
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,199
look at all the bugs look at all the

1320
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:54,799
birds that thing is

1321
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:57,759
teeming with life and i said exactly

1322
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,480
and that was three applications and that

1323
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,520
field

1324
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,079
is highly productive the people that

1325
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,838
purchased

1326
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:09,119
the hay requested the exact same hay

1327
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:11,199
uh in more of it from the farmer and i

1328
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,599
believe they've started the process

1329
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:15,358
of getting another feel going so that

1330
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,359
the same thing can happen

1331
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:18,960
but it goes to show once you put nature

1332
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:21,519
back in play

1333
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,280
it it just compounds it just gets better

1334
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:25,679
and better and better with age

1335
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,559
so let's focus in a second on the best

1336
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:28,799
practice there

1337
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,559
because the story is good but i think

1338
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,200
that the the part of it that i want to

1339
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,000
tease out

1340
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:35,519
seems to be this um this active point

1341
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,559
where

1342
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,719
where as i had suggested in my

1343
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,319
conversation with joey that we just put

1344
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:45,519
a super aerated tea

1345
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:48,639
on anything and it works for anything

1346
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:53,358
in this particular example you took

1347
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:56,838
a compressed and tired field of dirt

1348
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:59,838
and you put um

1349
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:03,679
partially aerated or

1350
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:06,239
somewhat oxygen loving microbes so

1351
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,639
so somewhere in the middle they they are

1352
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:11,598
they are

1353
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,558
i mean is there a middle ground between

1354
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,000
anaerobic

1355
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:18,400
and and aerobic is there like

1356
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,318
yeah we kind of like aerobic and we kind

1357
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,400
of like anaerobic i mean like do those

1358
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:23,759
microbes exist where those are the ones

1359
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,559
that you would incubate

1360
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,880
and i think you called it your your your

1361
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,599
first wave army or whatever into the

1362
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,240
field

1363
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:34,559
are those is that an actual array of

1364
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:36,639
microbes that you could go for

1365
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,559
absolutely and that's that's the beauty

1366
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:40,159
of fishberry tell us about that

1367
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,400
yeah that's that's that's fish proof

1368
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:43,358
that's because right because it went

1369
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,480
from aerobic

1370
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:49,679
to anaerobic and then back to aerobic

1371
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:52,400
based on my work toward it and

1372
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,118
and in this particular example i didn't

1373
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,960
i didn't

1374
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,119
fully stabilize it to eight parts per

1375
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,119
million i left it at about four

1376
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,640
so i was teasing out that whole middle

1377
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,119
ground that you're talking about which

1378
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:04,159
is

1379
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,800
from one part per million to seven parts

1380
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:07,358
per million

1381
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,359
so that's a big gray area and that's

1382
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:11,519
where all the magic happens and

1383
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:12,639
you remember this right you you talked

1384
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:14,960
about throwing your

1385
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:16,239
aerobic loving organisms in and and

1386
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,760
they're going to just die

1387
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,959
yeah well they're not going to die

1388
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,680
they're going to go into it's going to

1389
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,079
stop

1390
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,759
yeah i get it now or they're going to be

1391
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,880
consumed

1392
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:30,240
um and if if if you if you did

1393
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:33,280
actually kill them all so say you did

1394
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:35,199
or obviously some are going to die some

1395
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,319
are going to get into a situation where

1396
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,558
they can't cyst

1397
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:39,920
up fast enough and they're gonna they're

1398
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:43,119
gonna pop

1399
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:46,880
and they're gonna release nutrients so

1400
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:50,720
we call that a nutrient solution

1401
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:54,480
the goal of putting aerobic compost tea

1402
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:56,159
on soil is to inoculate the soil right

1403
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,280
you want these organisms to

1404
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:04,960
to grow out and thrive well

1405
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:07,839
in the case where you murdered them

1406
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,599
um you basically have created a nutrient

1407
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:12,000
solution that's plant available

1408
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,200
but it's mobile and that's the problem

1409
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,318
as soon as you water it

1410
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:19,358
all of that you know organ uh

1411
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:19,920
aminos all of those peptides all of

1412
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:22,000
those

1413
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,800
metabolites tertiary metabolites that

1414
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,039
are inside the ectoplasm of the cell

1415
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,318
which are all valuable sources of food

1416
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:30,480
for plants

1417
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:32,239
are now mobile and when you water

1418
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,199
they're going to wash beyond the roots

1419
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:35,199
or

1420
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:37,039
some of it is some of it will obviously

1421
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:40,318
be caught by the roots

1422
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:43,519
but not all of it so that's why we don't

1423
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:45,759
use um you know

1424
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:48,400
we don't make aerobic tea and then and

1425
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,880
then quickly turn it into an anaerobic

1426
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,880
so that

1427
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,920
so that we kill off the vast majority of

1428
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,519
them because now we're

1429
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,960
we're creating a mobile nutrient

1430
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:57,039
solution and that's

1431
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,159
the cause of all of the pollution that

1432
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,719
we have now

1433
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:01,358
in our environment is due to you know

1434
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,558
those

1435
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:05,279
mobile nutrients is it accurate to use

1436
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,160
the term

1437
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,519
uh uh folklotative when it comes to

1438
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:13,440
those

1439
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:17,119
partially oxygen loving and partially

1440
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,400
not oxygen level let's let's hit on that

1441
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,519
for a minute all right and

1442
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,160
remember science is going at light speed

1443
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:24,800
now

1444
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:25,440
and the document documentation of

1445
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,720
science

1446
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,920
is is at a crawl so what we're learning

1447
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:32,959
is so

1448
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,079
outpacing our ability to document it

1449
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:39,679
it's not funny so what we know

1450
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,318
is that the word facultative anaerobes

1451
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:43,279
has been thrown around for a long time i

1452
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:46,960
prefer the term

1453
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,240
oxygen tolerant anaerobes so these are

1454
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,280
anaerobes that live

1455
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:54,879
and thrive in zero parts per million

1456
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:58,680
but can function to some degree

1457
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:01,760
perhaps not thrive in a

1458
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:03,440
semi-aerobic environment and the same is

1459
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,240
true on the other end of the spectrum

1460
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,760
so you have anaerobes that thrive in

1461
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:10,159
aerobic environments

1462
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,119
that can still tolerate low oxygen

1463
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:12,639
environments

1464
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:15,200
so you gotta you gotta kind of like

1465
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:17,279
overlap these ideas of

1466
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:18,480
oh it's just an arrow or oh it's just an

1467
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,920
anaerobe no

1468
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,440
there's it's it's similar to the new

1469
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,720
understanding

1470
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:29,838
that the 80 percent of terrestrial

1471
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:30,719
biology can live in an aquatic

1472
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:33,838
environment

1473
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:35,439
and vice versa you know

1474
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:37,599
you got to just kind of wrap your head

1475
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,639
around how

1476
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:43,760
nature is has inherently

1477
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:46,960
created this ability to live and

1478
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:49,680
and work and grow in environments

1479
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,440
that are not necessarily the ones they

1480
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:56,399
are associated with

1481
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:59,519
all right so so if if our optimum

1482
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:03,039
natural expression is through

1483
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:03,440
um having both microbes that are that

1484
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:06,239
can

1485
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,798
succeed in in aerobic and anaerobic

1486
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:11,838
environment

1487
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:15,519
this is a big case for us to

1488
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:18,719
have as diverse soil as possible

1489
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:20,000
dumping a wide range of of microbes and

1490
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,719
nutrients and all this

1491
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,119
because really if the environment has

1492
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,959
both

1493
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:29,920
anaerobic and aerobic microbes

1494
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,960
whatever happens with the evolution of

1495
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,599
our pot

1496
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,480
even if it goes south and it goes

1497
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,160
anaerobic

1498
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,240
on us sure we're going to have like

1499
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:41,358
hydrophobic stuff to deal with

1500
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:44,879
but the plant would still be able to get

1501
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:48,078
into a nutritional relationship with the

1502
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:51,119
anaerobic microbes even though the

1503
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,920
aerobic microbes have cysted up is that

1504
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,280
true

1505
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:58,880
yeah yeah wow wow

1506
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,519
all right now you don't want to leave

1507
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,079
that

1508
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:02,880
plant in a sustained anaerobic

1509
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,880
environment right

1510
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,798
like this isn't the goal right but right

1511
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,119
but the diversification is going to

1512
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:09,679
totally backstop a failure on the plant

1513
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,400
if you

1514
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:14,239
screw it up oh man this is it this goes

1515
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:18,079
back to the horizontal soil system

1516
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:21,919
you know again these are methods to

1517
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:24,400
take the extremes out of the situation

1518
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,119
um so you did over water no problem it's

1519
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,440
stored down on the

1520
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,559
horizon as the top horizon dries out

1521
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,200
it'll pull the moisture back

1522
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,760
up via the a horizon and the same is

1523
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:34,000
true with

1524
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,880
with the work that i've been doing with

1525
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
microbes

1526
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:41,119
i mean that was that was the you know

1527
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,079
accidental amazement or amazing thing

1528
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,079
that happened

1529
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,280
when i started playing around with with

1530
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,559
fish manure

1531
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:51,760
was that i was by default catching

1532
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:52,480
this incredible suite of organisms that

1533
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,119
again

1534
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:57,199
eighty percent of them can survive in a

1535
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,599
terrestrial environment

1536
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:00,399
and they came from both aerobic

1537
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,599
anaerobic

1538
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,119
conditions and then i stabilized them

1539
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:08,318
back to aerobic

1540
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:12,559
but if i didn't they still worked

1541
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:16,159
so you know it's again using biomimicry

1542
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,880
in understanding perhaps bigger picture

1543
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:19,920
like

1544
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,599
before the great human expansion there

1545
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,639
was mass migrations

1546
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:27,838
and these migrations were you know

1547
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:28,239
thousands of ducks that darkened the sky

1548
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:30,480
that

1549
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:31,919
landed in that pond and ate and [ __ ] and

1550
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,240
thrashed in trash and then

1551
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,159
bailed out of there well they just

1552
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:39,279
turned this gorgeous beautiful clear

1553
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:42,639
water pond into a mucky nasty smelling

1554
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:45,359
anaerobic cauldron right

1555
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:46,798
but what happened that pond came back

1556
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:50,558
roaring back again

1557
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:54,000
and this this is on buffalo deer moose

1558
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:56,000
fish fish would come in and just thrash

1559
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,440
a harbor and then the prey fish would

1560
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,199
come in or the predator fish would come

1561
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,559
in and just thrash and trash and take a

1562
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:03,199
bite out of every fish and leave

1563
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,119
carcasses everywhere so this kind of

1564
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:08,159
anaerobic aerobic

1565
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:10,640
back and forth is part of nature

1566
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:11,199
it was part of the beauty of the garden

1567
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:13,519
of eden

1568
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:14,239
before we put an end to it through our

1569
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:18,480
mass

1570
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:21,679
expansion again biomimicry

1571
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:24,880
all right so i find it really

1572
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:26,960
interesting that the the

1573
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,640
the what did you call them oxygen

1574
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:32,720
tolerant microbes

1575
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:34,960
are um oxygen tolerant anaerobes

1576
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:36,558
anaerobes excuse me yeah and and i knew

1577
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,679
that didn't sound right

1578
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,960
that they're from the the water food for

1579
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:42,719
water food web

1580
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,240
primarily that you've just we've

1581
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,000
discussed so far and

1582
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:47,838
for anybody who's not familiar with the

1583
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,159
water food web you should go back and

1584
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:50,880
check

1585
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:51,759
shaping fire episode 52 with uh steve

1586
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,200
rasner

1587
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,040
and that was the first time like i've

1588
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:57,118
been in love with the soil food web ever

1589
00:58:55,039 --> 00:59:00,079
since i started really caring about

1590
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,519
cultivation of cannabis but to find out

1591
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:05,680
that there is a

1592
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:08,318
a an entirely uh different food web

1593
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:09,679
that takes place in water like you know

1594
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:12,239
it really blew my mind

1595
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:14,078
but but now you're talking about the

1596
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:17,759
water food web and bringing

1597
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,318
these oxygen tolerant anaerobes over to

1598
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,119
help us

1599
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:22,318
condition soil to bring it to take it

1600
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,119
from a zero

1601
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:27,039
oxygen to a medium oxygen so we can make

1602
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:29,680
it to a high oxygen and

1603
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:31,759
slowly but surely you know rejuvenate

1604
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:35,039
this soil

1605
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:38,480
most of these oxygen tolerant anaerobes

1606
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,759
in the water food web or are those just

1607
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:43,039
your preferred

1608
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:45,599
ones to use because of their ease of

1609
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:46,079
accessing them well that's a great

1610
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,240
question

1611
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,079
but the answer is um you ever made

1612
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:51,919
stinky compost

1613
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:53,280
i mean not intentionally if my compost

1614
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,480
stinks i failed

1615
00:59:53,280 --> 01:00:00,000
right but it happens so those are

1616
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:03,920
those are terrestrial biology that

1617
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,358
are um oxygen tolerant anaerobes

1618
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,920
right because they didn't just happen

1619
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:11,679
they they were there or present and they

1620
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:15,920
became

1621
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:19,279
uh active due to either lack of oxygen

1622
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:21,358
as it went down or vice versa as the

1623
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,960
oxygen went up as things started to

1624
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:26,000
break down and you moved from

1625
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,280
thermophilic to mesophilic they became

1626
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,440
active again

1627
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,200
so again you can't look at it like it

1628
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,200
only goes in one direction because it's

1629
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:34,798
constantly going back and forth well the

1630
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:35,358
bigger picture that i'm getting out of

1631
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:38,480
this

1632
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:41,880
is that so long as we're not working

1633
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:44,960
in a non-natural

1634
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:48,880
sterile-ish environment like

1635
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,798
um like uh synthetic hydroponic right

1636
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,079
where where you know places where worms

1637
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:55,838
can't live right

1638
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:59,920
so so long as we are are using

1639
01:00:55,838 --> 01:01:02,719
natural practices there will always be

1640
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:05,440
in all of the water all of the soil in

1641
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:08,558
every rhizosphere there are going to be

1642
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,880
both anaerobic and aerobic

1643
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,640
microbes because of the natural

1644
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,519
diversity of the soil

1645
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:17,358
and actually what we want to do is we

1646
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:20,400
want to move our soils

1647
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:24,239
from being compressed dirt

1648
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:27,838
like anaerobic to be increasingly

1649
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:31,358
aerobic but the goal is never to get rid

1650
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:33,920
of the anaerobic microbes we just want

1651
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:35,598
them to cyst up and hang out in case we

1652
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,880
screw up the pot and we need them as

1653
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:40,318
part of our save

1654
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:43,599
yep amen it's called a buffer

1655
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:44,000
and you know i think that there is there

1656
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,119
is

1657
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,838
a warning here that putting on

1658
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:53,920
an anaerobic stinky tee um

1659
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:58,960
in quantity on a

1660
01:01:53,920 --> 01:02:02,079
very aerobic and aerobically stabilized

1661
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:06,240
biology is that the

1662
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:09,200
primary nutrient cycle in the anaerobic

1663
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:10,318
world which is called the ciliate will

1664
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:12,960
buzz around

1665
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:13,759
and consume flagellates as well as

1666
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,798
bacteria

1667
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,440
now he is nutrient cycling on a scale

1668
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:19,838
that's

1669
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,880
mind boggling compared to amoeba and

1670
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:23,599
flagellates

1671
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,960
i mean he's he's he's nutrient cycling

1672
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:28,079
at

1673
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,920
10x of what they can do

1674
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,000
but if he's consuming all your

1675
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,358
flagellates it's going to take

1676
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,719
longer for that soil to rebound back

1677
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:40,159
because you have lost ground so that's

1678
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:43,118
why i

1679
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:43,920
never encourage anybody to use a high

1680
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,760
quantity

1681
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:51,200
of aerobic or anaerobic

1682
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:54,319
compost tea or ferments

1683
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:55,679
on a highly aerobic environment because

1684
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:57,920
you are going to step

1685
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:59,199
back at a point where you've lost a lot

1686
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,838
of your buffer

1687
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:03,679
now if you want to take a fermented

1688
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:05,719
plant juice

1689
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,960
which again is being fermented

1690
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:09,679
biologically

1691
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,519
therefore it is being loaded with

1692
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:13,358
anaerobic organisms

1693
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:14,880
but if you want to take some of that and

1694
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:18,000
dilute it out

1695
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,680
in the natural farming methodologies

1696
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,358
there's no problem whatsoever with that

1697
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:24,558
you're not landing

1698
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:27,038
billions of hostile ciliates

1699
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:29,039
are you getting a few sure i'm no doubt

1700
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:32,640
in my mind that there's going to be some

1701
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:36,160
um but again you know diversity is

1702
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:39,279
is a wonderful thing in nature um

1703
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:41,440
you don't see just one type of thing

1704
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,039
you always see you know diversity it's

1705
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,960
not like you're

1706
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:46,400
it's not like the soil even the most

1707
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,480
aerobic

1708
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,400
natural soils on the on the surface of

1709
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,679
the earth the living skin for lack of

1710
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,519
better words

1711
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:54,960
is not going to have anaerobes in it of

1712
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:56,159
course it's going to it's going to have

1713
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,400
anaerobic pockets

1714
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,558
i mean we see that even within

1715
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:03,920
aggregates so aggregates are

1716
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:07,359
basically a bacteria comes along

1717
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:09,358
and lands on a clay platelet divides

1718
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:11,199
grows out biofilm to protect him that

1719
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:14,318
biofilm touches a silt

1720
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:15,038
particle they keep expanding out now

1721
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:18,159
that

1722
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:19,200
now that biofilm is expanded onto a sand

1723
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:21,598
particle and

1724
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,798
this bacteria is growing kids dividing

1725
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,880
left and right

1726
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:26,159
and before you know it you have a micro

1727
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,160
aggregate well

1728
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:29,598
eventually that turns into a macro

1729
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,960
aggregate

1730
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,798
and this is something you and i have

1731
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,318
talked about in the past

1732
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:37,920
into a rhizos sheath which is the big

1733
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:40,159
clump that you pull up when you pull up

1734
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,680
a weed that's just a giant sheath

1735
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:45,199
inside of that sheath on a microscopic

1736
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:47,919
level there are going to be anaerobic

1737
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:51,519
pockets it's not going to all be 100

1738
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:54,559
aerobic and that's kind of the the

1739
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:57,038
the mythology of of um

1740
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:58,880
understanding you know the whole bigger

1741
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:02,319
picture of what's going on

1742
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:04,720
biologically in a soil system is that

1743
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:05,519
you know you are going to have anaerobes

1744
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:08,000
and you

1745
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:10,318
may actually really need them at certain

1746
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,880
times like over watering

1747
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:14,159
or underwatering you know where you have

1748
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,039
the arrows that are going to come out

1749
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:17,440
and do the

1750
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,799
you know the heavy lifting for you so

1751
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,960
it's again it's

1752
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:21,838
diversity diversity diversity and

1753
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,079
everything and

1754
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:24,960
everything i've heard you describe that

1755
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,599
um

1756
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,679
that bio film i don't know trajectory

1757
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:33,680
before and i've always liked it where

1758
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:36,960
if i get it correctly you described a

1759
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:39,838
a a microbe finally getting a good

1760
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,798
living environment and so it removes the

1761
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:43,679
hard

1762
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:45,838
cis protection of it and it starts to

1763
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:48,719
engage more with its environment

1764
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:51,038
it excretes a biofilm which is like a

1765
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:54,719
gooey substance that protects it from

1766
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:57,359
unwanted uh other microbes and sticks

1767
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:57,919
and sticks sticks and so it's sticky so

1768
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:00,639
so

1769
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,280
this one microbe like now is now

1770
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:03,838
bacteria

1771
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,039
bacteria thank you so it's one bacteria

1772
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:07,279
and now it's sticking to another

1773
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,520
bacteria and now maybe it's sticking to

1774
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,880
uh you know another life form and then

1775
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:13,759
maybe a food source

1776
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,559
and so um in my head this is how the

1777
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,480
where the word

1778
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:18,000
aggregate comes from which is like a

1779
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,480
collection of

1780
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,358
you know unrelated things that become a

1781
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,920
bigger thing as

1782
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:26,239
community right and so and so this is

1783
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:29,119
building a more and more complex life

1784
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:31,038
system of all these different bacterias

1785
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,000
and their biofilm and occasional food

1786
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,160
sources and

1787
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
i'm a guessing protozoa and amoeba and

1788
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:37,838
stuff in there and so it's making this

1789
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,838
big gooey sticky ball and then

1790
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:43,838
that aggregate atta attaches to another

1791
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:45,679
big aggregate of the same thing and so

1792
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:46,000
now they've doubled in size and so you

1793
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:48,239
can see

1794
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,679
how this is you know increasing at a

1795
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:52,558
geometric grate

1796
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:53,440
and that is what we want to do as soil

1797
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,160
builders and

1798
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,559
is that process that we just described

1799
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:00,159
is

1800
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:03,359
that the heart of building soil man

1801
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:05,679
and now that's not super soil because in

1802
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:08,000
a super soil or a soilless medium

1803
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:09,279
you don't have sand silt and clay so

1804
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,559
you're very limited

1805
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,960
for biofilm to actually occur it's only

1806
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:15,680
going to

1807
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:18,000
occur on each individual fiber so it

1808
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:19,038
can't really start to bond the fibers

1809
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
together to make

1810
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,960
aggregates you follow me yeah for sure

1811
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,599
well the funny thing is

1812
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,440
is in in my head i'm like well yeah who

1813
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:29,280
cares about the soilless medium

1814
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,200
but of course lots of people grow that

1815
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,920
way right well most people in

1816
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:34,558
pots do you know i mean since you did

1817
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,159
that

1818
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:40,160
uh or we did that podcast uh episode 54

1819
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:41,920
where you know the was the first time i

1820
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:44,318
didn't get laughed off a stage about

1821
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:46,480
talking about horizontal soil systems

1822
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:48,639
you know i've gotten incredible feedback

1823
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,719
on instagram thanking you know thanking

1824
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:52,558
and saying how great it works and

1825
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:54,879
you know it was you know it wasn't a

1826
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,519
great great idea it was just copying

1827
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,240
nature

1828
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:59,519
but you know traditional cannabis when

1829
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:01,838
it came

1830
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:03,119
you know when when camp came around and

1831
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:05,279
they were forced to go

1832
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,798
indoors or into containers and diesel

1833
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,798
grows

1834
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:11,038
they weren't lugging you know the

1835
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:12,400
natural soil into the container they

1836
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:14,640
started growing in pots

1837
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,680
and of course they didn't want to carry

1838
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:18,639
a 300

1839
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:20,399
pound pot down into this container

1840
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,640
buried underneath the ground

1841
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:24,479
or into their house and cave the floor

1842
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,798
in because the floor wasn't designed to

1843
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,838
take

1844
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:30,479
thousands of pounds of of soil

1845
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:30,960
so it was obvious they went to peat moss

1846
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,039
and

1847
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,880
koi or that was probably just peat moss

1848
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:37,920
and compost and

1849
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,640
and other aeration because of its light

1850
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,759
weight

1851
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:44,239
and then of course now you did not have

1852
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:47,359
that biological interaction

1853
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:48,399
so all of a sudden those um you know

1854
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:52,000
organic

1855
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:53,759
raw nutrient blends the stone dust and

1856
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,319
crab meal and oyster shell

1857
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,198
that no longer worked so they went to

1858
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:59,839
bottled noots

1859
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:01,198
and this this soil profile or soil

1860
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:03,759
system

1861
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:04,559
the soilless medium was a great way or a

1862
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:07,359
great

1863
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:09,279
medium to hold water and to hold

1864
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:11,120
nutrients so it didn't lose it

1865
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,199
and so that was like the natural

1866
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:18,000
progression into

1867
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:19,678
these soilless mediums was by default

1868
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,520
based on you know the government

1869
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:23,520
cracking down on on

1870
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,560
you know the free loving cannabis

1871
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,120
growers

1872
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,400
and so you know that's why i

1873
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:31,599
continuously use

1874
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:33,679
the term soilless medium or or super

1875
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,000
soil because there's still a tremendous

1876
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:37,119
amount

1877
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,399
of people out there using this and now

1878
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:41,679
they can go back

1879
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,399
to using meals and teas with their super

1880
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:44,719
soil

1881
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:47,439
although the originals were just growing

1882
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:49,359
in soil they really weren't amending

1883
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:51,759
the soil that much i mean they didn't

1884
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:53,520
want to haul bales of peat moss up into

1885
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:55,760
the hills to grow their cannabis so they

1886
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,320
just planted it in the ground

1887
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,560
so you know that's that's where all of

1888
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:00,559
this

1889
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:06,399
struggles come in uh in in understanding

1890
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:08,639
you know the difference between tension

1891
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:10,559
soil and low tension soil and the

1892
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,800
limitations of both

1893
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,000
um you know low tension soil has its

1894
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,159
limitations

1895
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,560
and regular soil has its limitations

1896
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:22,639
because you unless you fluff it up or

1897
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:24,000
unless you have a highly aggregated soil

1898
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,400
you're not going to get the plant to

1899
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,960
push like you want because those roots

1900
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:29,439
can't

1901
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,039
bind or pound their way through that

1902
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:33,359
compacted soil

1903
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:34,640
so that's where time takes place you

1904
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:37,679
have to

1905
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:40,880
cover crop you have to get that soil

1906
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:43,039
prepared for the the growth of the

1907
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:46,960
cannabis plant if you want to try to

1908
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:49,198
you know get your yields and get your um

1909
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:51,439
you know full genetic potential you

1910
01:10:49,198 --> 01:10:53,519
can't you can't be planting in hard

1911
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:55,039
compacted clay plants not going to do

1912
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,760
well that's the that's the

1913
01:10:55,039 --> 01:11:00,079
most cogent and generous description of

1914
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,400
soilless medium that i've ever heard

1915
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:04,319
you know like like you know sometimes

1916
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:05,839
i'll i get on my soapbox and i'm all

1917
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:07,759
like well you know i like the way that

1918
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,360
jeff lowenfels thinks about it where why

1919
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,840
would you want to grow in anything

1920
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:12,639
where where worms can't live right

1921
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,480
because that's

1922
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,239
that's at the you know the basis of so

1923
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:19,359
much biology

1924
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:19,759
but your description not only explains

1925
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:22,399
the

1926
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,360
you know the socioeconomic and political

1927
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:27,279
impacts that

1928
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:31,359
that caused the cocoa but the idea that

1929
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:34,719
you know using a a a non-soil cocoa

1930
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:38,319
blend is comparatively better

1931
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:39,359
than unbuilt soil you know just crappy

1932
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:41,439
dirt right

1933
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:42,639
you know but but then it takes more

1934
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:45,119
effort and

1935
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,679
natural farming techniques to really

1936
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:49,439
breathe

1937
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:52,560
life into compacted soil

1938
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:54,960
i see again how i can't make the uh like

1939
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:58,480
a wholesale claim like that because

1940
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:01,039
it really depends on where you are

1941
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:02,879
what resources do you have what natural

1942
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:04,238
inputs do you have what is the legal

1943
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,719
environment where you are

1944
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:07,678
how strong are you are you an immobile

1945
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:11,279
patient

1946
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:12,239
all of these speak to what is going to

1947
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:16,719
be best

1948
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:18,479
for you and i think that's very humbling

1949
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:20,640
and a good reminder

1950
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:22,879
you know when when so many of us want to

1951
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:25,199
judge folks for their growing style

1952
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,560
online you don't know their whole big

1953
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:28,559
picture so stop

1954
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,960
so stop thinking that we know better

1955
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,520
yeah it's again it goes back to defining

1956
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,399
something

1957
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,600
is right yeah even even if you never

1958
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:37,359
intended to

1959
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,039
to say that you're do someone else is

1960
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:41,119
doing it wrong you did

1961
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:43,119
by defining oh this is the best way to

1962
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:45,198
do it no there's

1963
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:46,479
everybody's situation and circumstances

1964
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:49,039
are different and like you

1965
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:50,639
so beautifully or eloquently put you

1966
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:54,158
could be a patient in a wheelchair

1967
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:57,520
you you could have no access to

1968
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:59,839
core or pit moss or or nutrients

1969
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,120
you know you may be forced to cover crop

1970
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,520
just because you don't have anything

1971
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:03,599
else

1972
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,840
you don't have the money to go out and

1973
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:09,039
and buy all these inputs

1974
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,840
so you know there's there's a method for

1975
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:11,439
everybody

1976
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,840
or maybe i should say there's a madness

1977
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:15,039
to the method of letting everybody grow

1978
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:19,119
in a manner that they

1979
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:21,760
are most comfortable or due to resources

1980
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:23,359
and then encourage them and find find

1981
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,480
ways to help them

1982
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:28,399
um to better achieve the end goal of

1983
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:29,198
growing uh you know some dank ass

1984
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:31,759
cannabis

1985
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:32,719
nice well said well let's go ahead and

1986
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,719
go to our uh

1987
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:36,480
second commercial break and when we come

1988
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:39,920
back we will talk about

1989
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:42,079
um corollary uh strategies for building

1990
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,000
the aerobic nature in your soil

1991
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:45,920
uh you are listening to shaping fire i

1992
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,679
am your host shango lofts and our guest

1993
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,390
this week is soil biologist

1994
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:51,359
leighton morrison

1995
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:53,440
[Music]

1996
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:55,599
for 20 years humboldt seed company has

1997
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:57,519
been family owned and providing reliable

1998
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,880
high yielding seeds originating in

1999
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,880
northern california

2000
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,520
while the current trend is to slap one

2001
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:05,520
super male into a line of hype strains

2002
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,880
humboldt seed company continues to breed

2003
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,679
with precision and care

2004
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:12,000
by doing large sifts and back crosses to

2005
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,440
emphasize the absolute best traits that

2006
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
a line has to offer

2007
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:17,599
this kind of breeding takes time talent

2008
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,439
and space to work

2009
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,719
no matter what kind of aroma you are

2010
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:22,479
particularly into

2011
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,319
humboldt seed will likely have something

2012
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:27,519
you'll love if you love fruit

2013
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:30,079
you can choose from banana mango apricot

2014
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:32,480

2053
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:54,079
let them know shango sent ya

2054
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:56,238
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

2055
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:58,319
growing is so valued by farmers

2056
01:15:56,238 --> 01:16:00,399
is because the mycelium networks in the

2057
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:01,279
soil remain established from year to

2058
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:03,039
year

2059
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:05,198
and we know these fungal networks are

2060
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:06,719
essential because they are the nutrient

2061
01:16:05,198 --> 01:16:08,960
super highways that extend

2062
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,239
far and wide in the substrate to feed

2063
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,239
your plants

2064
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:14,559
the trouble with growing in new living

2065
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:16,479
soils or blended cocoa substrates

2066
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,880
is that it takes most of the plant's

2067
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:20,399
life just to create these mycelium

2068
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:23,440
highways

2069
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:25,599
dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

2070
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:28,559
reduces that time and gets your plant

2071
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,560
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

2072
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:32,640
and it's three times the concentration

2073
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:35,840
of the other popular brand in the us

2074

2075
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:40,560

2076
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:42,319

2077
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,320

2085
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:00,799

2087

2175
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:00,159

01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:14,399
into an aerobic environment and

2181
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:17,439
we understood that the the key to this

2182
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:21,359
is is putting the right kind of

2183
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:24,319
of tea or ferment into

2184
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:26,000
the soil at the right stage so so as

2185
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,399
you're building your soil you're going

2186
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,198
to be

2187
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:30,879
changing the nature of of your root

2188
01:20:29,198 --> 01:20:32,719
drench as well

2189
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,159
well here we are in set three we're

2190
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:36,319
gonna talk about um

2191
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:38,158
some other well we're gonna talk about

2192
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:38,719
how to do that in a best practice but

2193
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:39,839
also

2194
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,600
we're gonna talk about some of the

2195
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,199
strategies for building the aerobic

2196
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:46,480
nature of your soil

2197
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:50,559
so so leighton let's start with um

2198
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:54,079
with with how to add or how to collect

2199
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:57,199
these oxygen tolerant anaerobes um

2200
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:59,359
and that we're going to put into our

2201
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:00,479
into our substrate now you've already

2202
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:02,399
plugged um

2203
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:03,839
a fish brew which i'm excited to learn

2204
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:06,079
more about but you know

2205
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:08,079
we continually push to get off the

2206
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:10,399
bottle here on shaping fire

2207
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:11,840
and and also to decrease costs by

2208
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:13,599
collecting this stuff on our own

2209
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,000
properties if we can

2210
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,960
so so teach us a little bit about

2211
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,399
collecting these

2212
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:22,158
facultative or um oxygen tolerant

2213
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:24,238
anaerobes in ways

2214
01:21:22,158 --> 01:21:26,000
um that we can do a natural farming

2215
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:27,919
style on our own parcels

2216
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,679
sure sure but i just wanted to clear up

2217
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:32,480
one thing real quick and that is

2218
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:33,840
i plug fishbrew.com for a reason because

2219
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:35,439
it is an inoculant

2220
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,600
so as long as you're not letting your

2221
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:39,678
pots completely dry out

2222
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,199
or you know if you're in a tent i always

2223
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:43,119
encourage people even though you're not

2224
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:45,678
growing there in the summer

2225
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:46,800
leave a house plants cover crops

2226
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:48,639
something in there

2227
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,920
periodically water it don't let it come

2228
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:51,199
completely dry

2229
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,760
if you do that then you're going to

2230
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:54,960
maintain that rich diverse microbial

2231
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,320
community

2232
01:21:54,960 --> 01:22:00,480
at are ready to go um so and again i i

2233
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:02,479
plugged him not because i want you to

2234
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:03,439
continuously use the product i just want

2235
01:22:02,479 --> 01:22:05,759
you to use it

2236
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:06,719
uh you know once or twice to really get

2237
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,000
that

2238
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:12,239
boost because those organisms

2239
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,359
are key to building those soil

2240
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:15,439
aggregates

2241
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:18,000
so let's talk about collecting our own

2242
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:20,879
or uh wild crafting

2243
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,319
so i already mentioned the kelp and one

2244
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,359
piece of the puzzle i did not

2245
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:29,039
mention is that when that kelp

2246
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:31,679
had that white foam on the top of it

2247
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:34,079
that was the key moment to use it it

2248
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:36,158
wasn't to let that foam crash

2249
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:37,279
which it would if you let it continue to

2250
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:39,679
sit out there

2251
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:41,840
it's going to get really nasty smelling

2252
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:44,480
and that is completely anaerobic

2253
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,880
so you're trying to catch it in the

2254
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:48,079
middle

2255
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:51,359
at a low oxygen so around four or five

2256
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:52,000
parts per million and at that point when

2257
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:55,279
you stick your

2258
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,198
nose in there you're going to smell it

2259
01:22:55,279 --> 01:22:59,359
and it's going to be just funky like an

2260
01:22:57,198 --> 01:23:02,319
old musty closet or something

2261
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:04,158
it's not going to smell horrible and

2262
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:06,639
when you stick your hand in there

2263
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:07,759
your hand is going to be covered with

2264
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:11,440
biofilm

2265
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:14,719
and that is the key to quickly turning

2266
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:18,238
plant matter into the composting

2267
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:20,880
process without going all thermophilic

2268
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:21,759
thermophilic is when the biology heats

2269
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,679
that pile

2270
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:26,639
up to a point where it kills the weed

2271
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:28,560
seeds um it basically kills the vast

2272
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:30,159
majority of the biology off because it's

2273
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,199
getting up to temperatures where

2274
01:23:30,158 --> 01:23:35,679
things just explode the cysts even even

2275
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:39,119
the strongest of these organisms cis

2276
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:41,359
can't handle temperatures at 160 degrees

2277
01:23:39,119 --> 01:23:42,880
so that's why it takes almost a year for

2278
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:44,479
that compost to come back

2279
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,639
to a point where you've got those

2280
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:47,678
diverse organisms because it's happening

2281
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:51,039
naturally

2282
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:51,920
through uh transf uh transference from

2283
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:53,920
air

2284
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,359
and from the soil that that's underneath

2285
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,199
the compost pile

2286
01:23:55,359 --> 01:23:58,719
so let's talk about inoculants so

2287
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,839
another another thing you can do you

2288
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:03,439
don't live

2289
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:06,880
near the ocean is go to a healthy

2290
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:10,479
pond or stream and

2291
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,600
look for aquatic plants algae is a great

2292
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:13,198
one

2293
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,520
there's other plants and again you know

2294
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:19,198
i i encourage you to

2295
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:21,360
wildcraft responsibly and with respect

2296
01:24:19,198 --> 01:24:22,319
so if you're going to go pull up you

2297
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:24,479
know

2298
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:25,599
some aquatic plants don't rip them out

2299
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:28,959
of the soil just

2300
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:31,360
cut them take small amounts don't take

2301
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:34,239
the entire plant

2302
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:34,639
perhaps bring something in as a blessing

2303
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:37,678
to

2304
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:39,119
to gaia bring a little seedling in and

2305
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:41,520
plant it right at the edge of where

2306
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:44,719
you've done your collecting

2307
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:45,600
you know do a kind act uh to the

2308
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:47,119
environment

2309
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,719
you know pick up trash on the way out

2310
01:24:47,119 --> 01:24:51,920
whatever whatever whatever

2311
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:54,480
feed your soul um but that's

2312
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:56,480
another method is to you know collect

2313
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:57,279
those aquatic plants i'm going to give

2314
01:24:56,479 --> 01:25:00,399
steve

2315
01:24:57,279 --> 01:25:03,119
raisner a plug from

2316
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:04,719
potentponics he came up with what he

2317
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:06,800
calls his sponge tech

2318
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:08,560
which is basically buy a clean natural

2319
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,719
sponge

2320
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:12,400
tie you know something to it that to

2321
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:14,480
weight it down

2322
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:16,399
and throw it out into this aquatic

2323
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:20,479
environment and let those organisms

2324
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:23,039
naturally uh colonize that clean sponge

2325
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:24,559
i thought that was a really smart way of

2326
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:27,760
you know collecting

2327
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:30,239
these initial inoculants um so that's

2328
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:32,960
that's one way to get these you know

2329
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:34,000
what i want to call oxygen tolerant

2330
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,960
anaerobes

2331
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,119
um the other is is the the silt the the

2332
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:42,000
mud at the edge of the

2333
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:43,920
waterway you know there's all kinds of

2334
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,359
riparian zones

2335
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:50,000
a lot of them are polluted unfortunately

2336
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:52,559
so you really have to do your homework

2337
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,399
to seek out a place that you know is

2338
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,719
like in natural farming

2339
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:59,039
the least disturbed you can possibly

2340
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:01,039
find within a reasonable amount of

2341
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:03,119
um you know reasonable traveling

2342
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:05,519
distance from where you are

2343
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:06,479
or do this on vacation and ship at home

2344
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,600
i mean there's

2345
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:12,319
there's there's ways of doing it um

2346
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,199
so that's that's one way uh another way

2347
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:15,920
is to

2348
01:26:13,198 --> 01:26:17,439
take compost that you know you're uh

2349
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,800
that's highly aerobic and that you're

2350
01:26:17,439 --> 01:26:22,000
really happy with

2351
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:24,000
um and over wet it um you know start

2352
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,119
pushing it toward the anaerobic

2353
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,920
environment

2354
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:29,840
and then maintain it and and watch it

2355
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:33,279
now this is kind of like growing out

2356
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:35,440
imo 3 it's very easy to screw up

2357
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:37,519
so imo 3 you're basically adding all

2358
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:39,439
these food sources

2359
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,880
and then making sure it never hits the

2360
01:26:39,439 --> 01:26:42,479
temperature 120

2361
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:44,159
and if it does you turn it and you have

2362
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:48,079
to continuously do this

2363
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:51,759
until you break the thermophilic

2364
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:53,279
phase and it pushes into a mesophilic

2365
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,880
um and that's where you're going to

2366
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:59,279
really get that rapid

2367
01:26:54,880 --> 01:27:01,520
um protozoa uh and fungal growths

2368
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:03,920
so and actually it's it's it's more

2369
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:06,080
fungal in the imo 3. it's not really

2370
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:08,000
protozoa until you get into im04

2371
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:10,559
but i'm not going to hang on that too

2372
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,840
long so again it's it's biomimicry it's

2373
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,560
the understanding of

2374
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,440
like where do these organisms live in

2375
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:19,120
nature

2376
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:24,479
and then either harvesting them there

2377
01:27:19,119 --> 01:27:24,479
or recreating that environment at home

2378
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:28,800
let's uh let's uh let's tease some of

2379
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,679
this apart so let's go back to the first

2380
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,400
one where

2381
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:34,560
you said like okay number one is collect

2382
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:36,079
seaweed so that's great so if i if we

2383
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,320
were to collect seaweed which i

2384
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:39,519
am going to because i happen to live

2385
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:41,920
near salt water

2386
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,600
so i'm going to go down to the beach and

2387
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,560
this is our time of year that we get

2388
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:48,639
lots of

2389
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:52,560
bull whip kelp that gets washed ashore

2390
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:54,639
and so i take some bull whip kelp and

2391
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,920
cut it up and put it into you know fill

2392
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:58,960
up a half

2393
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:01,440
of a five gallon bucket with it am i

2394
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,520
going to then cover it with fresh water

2395
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:06,960
or do i need to cover it with

2396
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:10,159
salt water since that is where those

2397
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:12,000
microbes are from um no you're just

2398
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:12,479
going to use regular fresh water okay

2399
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,399
and

2400
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:16,158
you know i encourage you to leave you

2401
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:17,198
know i don't even cut it up to be honest

2402
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:17,920
with you i just throw it all in the

2403
01:28:17,198 --> 01:28:20,559
bucket and i

2404
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,639
i let the sand be all over it i you know

2405
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:25,199
if there's a root attached i leave that

2406
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,960
in play um and then once i've done the

2407
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:29,039
ferment

2408
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,960
then i will chop it up and and blend it

2409
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:32,719
into the compost as well

2410
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:34,560
um but for the fermenting process i

2411
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:39,119
don't even chop it up i mean you can

2412
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:40,719
i don't see any reason why to not or two

2413
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:42,158
because really what you're trying to

2414
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:44,560
gain is those

2415
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:46,238
transitional organisms as well as that

2416
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,880
biofilm that's really going to help

2417
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:51,839
to create the perfect environment for

2418
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,920
this biology to really grow out

2419
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,679
all right so so we've got the seaweed

2420
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:58,158
we've got the fresh water

2421
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:00,399
and um you know we learned from that

2422
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:02,399
prior episode with joey berger that that

2423
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:03,519
creating these ferments you need to

2424
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:05,519
leave

2425
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,719
these plants in a different for a

2426
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:09,760
different amount of time

2427
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:11,600
depending on how bulky they are and

2428
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:14,800
seaweed's pretty damn bulky

2429
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:17,920
how long would you let let this ferment

2430
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:19,600
sit before you used it so i did

2431
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,960
i've done three of them since i've been

2432
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:23,440
here um

2433
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:25,439
and generally speaking and again the sun

2434
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:28,479
has been at different heights

2435
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:30,638
so i think the the first one was

2436
01:29:28,479 --> 01:29:31,519
10 days the most recent one during

2437
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:34,800
summer was

2438
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:36,719
was seven days so it's really a key is

2439
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,159
again you're looking for the white foam

2440
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:40,239
and you may have to do this a couple of

2441
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:42,238
times to get it right

2442
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:44,079
you're looking for that foam production

2443
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:47,439
and you're looking for that smell

2444
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:50,960
to turn from like fresh kelp to this

2445
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:53,678
funky like something that your nose goes

2446
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,920
what the hell is that it does it doesn't

2447
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:56,239
recognize it as bad it doesn't recognize

2448
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,560
it

2449
01:29:56,238 --> 01:29:59,279
good it just it sends a warning to you

2450
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,600
like i

2451
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:02,639
don't recognize this i don't know what

2452
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,960
this is

2453
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:06,560
and when your nose tells you that then

2454
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,639
you know it's right yeah because

2455
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:10,159
you'll have that and you'll have the the

2456
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,639
bubbles on the top and you're like yeah

2457
01:30:10,158 --> 01:30:12,960
i'm done

2458
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:14,639
the foam right and so and so i would

2459
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,679
assume that that is also the same

2460
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:18,480
technique for

2461
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:21,039
like the general aquatic plants right

2462
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:23,439
usually probably freshwater plants

2463
01:30:21,039 --> 01:30:26,158
that are you know around your ponds or

2464
01:30:23,439 --> 01:30:28,479
vernal ponds or whatever where you live

2465
01:30:26,158 --> 01:30:29,679
you'll go and and you'll put those in

2466
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:31,519
and fresh water

2467
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:33,679
put them in the sun for seven to ten

2468
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,760
days and remove it when you

2469
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:37,920
when you smell the beginning of funk and

2470
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,840
you see some of the bubblization

2471
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,239
but how what are you gonna do that with

2472
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,880
uh silt and mud that seems to be a

2473
01:30:42,238 --> 01:30:47,439
pretty different substance

2474
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:51,039
right that's the opposite so instead of

2475
01:30:47,439 --> 01:30:53,839
adding water you're adding air

2476
01:30:51,039 --> 01:30:54,319
remember how i told you to harvest your

2477
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,639
silt

2478
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:58,079
when you were building your pot right i

2479
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:59,760
told you to let it dry out

2480
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:02,399
yeah don't just spread it all out on a

2481
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:04,960
big uh

2482
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:05,839
so the exact same thing you're spreading

2483
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,000
it out

2484
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,279
to a point where it's a little bit

2485
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,760
easier to work with

2486
01:31:09,279 --> 01:31:13,198
and it doesn't have that stink to it

2487
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,600
because if i don't know about you but

2488
01:31:13,198 --> 01:31:15,119
i've

2489
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:17,120
done plenty of hiking in and around

2490
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:19,840
swamps and rivers and

2491
01:31:17,119 --> 01:31:20,399
you know you find those oxbows or where

2492
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,319
you get an

2493
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:24,079
eddy where the water actually swirls

2494
01:31:22,319 --> 01:31:25,679
backwards against the current along the

2495
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:27,760
edge of the

2496
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:29,199
banks and you step in that and you'll

2497
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,520
sink to your knee and mud and you pull

2498
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:31,759
your

2499
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,880
foot out you're like oh man that's not a

2500
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:36,239
rank yeah

2501
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:38,800
right so you don't want that rank smell

2502
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:40,799
but you want that funky like your nose

2503
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:43,520
doesn't know what the hell this is

2504
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,639
so you're doing the opposite of adding

2505
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,199
water you're adding

2506
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:49,359
air so you're spreading it out i don't

2507
01:31:47,198 --> 01:31:50,960
probably suggest using the sun because

2508
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:53,359
you'd really have to be

2509
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,319
on top of this to catch it at the right

2510
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:57,198
point

2511
01:31:54,319 --> 01:31:59,519
but you want that silt to go from

2512
01:31:57,198 --> 01:32:00,719
squishy like you grab it it squishes

2513
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,480
through your fingers

2514
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:04,079
to the point where it actually starts to

2515
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:06,718
clump up

2516
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:07,920
now you've you've you've aerobically

2517
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:11,279
stabilized that

2518
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:15,679
anaerobic silt

2519
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:18,399
and then and then am i going to

2520
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:19,359
put it back in the water or that's it no

2521
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:22,158
no it's done

2522
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:25,119
and so and so my top dress with it top

2523
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:28,158
dress with it blend it with your compost

2524
01:32:25,119 --> 01:32:28,880
um blend it with your aeration the

2525
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:30,879
blending part

2526
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,800
is probably pretty valuable because i

2527
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:36,079
can imagine if you just

2528
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:38,400
top dress with with it that it would be

2529
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:38,960
tempted to shift back to anaerobic as it

2530
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:41,279
gets

2531
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:43,279
soppy wet again well no i would i would

2532
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:46,960
recommend taking a um

2533
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:48,719
uh like a a little bit coarser than a

2534
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:51,679
window screen yeah and making a little

2535
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:54,000
screen box and then taking that clump

2536
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:54,719
and just screening it so you're breaking

2537
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,039
it all apart

2538
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:58,800
into little pieces right over the top of

2539
01:32:57,039 --> 01:33:00,639
whatever your top dressing or

2540
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,000
screen it into a bucket outside and

2541
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:03,840
bring it in and then just you know

2542
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,719
throw it on with your hand but no it

2543
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,600
won't it when you when you've micronized

2544
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:10,000
it

2545
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,719
um it's kind of like saying well i made

2546
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,920
you know

2547
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:15,119
flour meal or oyster meal it's going to

2548
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,800
go back to a shell

2549
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:18,158
no it's never going to go back to that

2550
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,920
original state it's

2551
01:33:18,158 --> 01:33:22,879
it's permanently broken up it's

2552
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:26,079
permanently destabilized or micronized

2553
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:28,319
all right and then um and then the other

2554
01:33:26,079 --> 01:33:32,399
variety you suggested was to

2555
01:33:28,319 --> 01:33:37,599
take if i understand it um uh

2556
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:39,759
aerobic compost and then

2557
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,520
try to add a bunch of water to it and

2558
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:44,239
then squeeze it out

2559
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:45,360
no just push it push it toward anaerobic

2560
01:33:44,238 --> 01:33:47,599
so i'm sure

2561
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:49,439
most of the audience has come in contact

2562
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:51,520
with stinky compost

2563
01:33:49,439 --> 01:33:52,559
so the reason it's stinky is because

2564
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:55,679
it's anaerobic

2565
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:58,719
or low oxygen so again

2566
01:33:55,679 --> 01:34:01,119
you can in all of these examples it's so

2567
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:02,840
easy to screw them up it's not funny so

2568
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:06,000
you really have to

2569
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:06,639
learn the craft don't expect to be a one

2570
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,238
in

2571
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:11,199
master you're really you're looking for

2572
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:13,279
certain things

2573
01:34:11,198 --> 01:34:15,759
you're using your common sense and

2574
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:18,238
intelligence to understand that

2575
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:20,639
no i don't want to put a huge clump of

2576
01:34:18,238 --> 01:34:22,959
stinky mud on top of my plant

2577
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:24,719
or no i don't want to let this ferment

2578
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:26,319
to a certain point that it becomes a

2579
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:28,639
stinky nasty

2580
01:34:26,319 --> 01:34:30,158
smelling thing i'm trying to catch it at

2581
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:32,319
just the right time

2582
01:34:30,158 --> 01:34:34,960
where it's in transition and it's going

2583
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:37,519
to help me transition my soil

2584
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,359
so in the case of a super soil or a

2585
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:42,719
soilless medium

2586
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:43,920
that that kelp ferment or that aquatic

2587
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,239
plant ferment

2588
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,960
you're going to know because it's slimy

2589
01:34:46,238 --> 01:34:48,959
it's like

2590
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:50,319
you feel it's like gelatin it's almost

2591
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,800
like uh

2592
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:53,759
aloe when you put that squish that stuff

2593
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,000
out on you

2594
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,679
that's the biofilm that's going to

2595
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,920
create the environment

2596
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:01,600
to for the rest of the biology to

2597
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:05,118
explode

2598
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:05,840
so again this is this is a delicate

2599
01:35:05,118 --> 01:35:08,639
process

2600
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:10,400
and your the chances of screwing it up

2601
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:12,159
are far greater than getting it right

2602
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:14,879
especially the first time

2603
01:35:12,158 --> 01:35:16,799
so you need patience and and again if

2604
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,600
the more you monitor it the more you

2605
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:20,079
love it

2606
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:22,320
and pay attention to it the better your

2607
01:35:20,079 --> 01:35:24,800
chances of a success will be

2608
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:25,439
so again you're trying to push this nice

2609
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,480
aerobic

2610
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:30,960
fluffy compost toward an

2611
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:31,839
anaerobic environment and you know if

2612
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,079
you want to do it

2613
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:36,159
mathematically that's that's probably

2614
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:38,319
the best way to learn how to do it so

2615
01:35:36,158 --> 01:35:41,118
that you can repeat it

2616
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:43,439
so add a cup of water into this aerobic

2617
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:44,799
compost that's in a compost bin a five

2618
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:46,879
gallon bucket

2619
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,480
and watch what happens and then add

2620
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:50,319
another cup and then add another cup

2621
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:52,158
until the point where you turn it stinky

2622
01:35:50,319 --> 01:35:54,158
and then rewind to the point where

2623
01:35:52,158 --> 01:35:57,359
you've added four cups

2624
01:35:54,158 --> 01:35:59,279
not five mm-hmm uh and then repeat it

2625
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:01,198
so once once you've got once you've

2626
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:03,359
added the right number of cups of water

2627
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:04,638
and it has just started to turn where

2628
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:06,960
you're going like ah there is the

2629
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:09,199
telltale funk of transition

2630
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,118
that's what i want to capture are we

2631
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:12,799
going to put that through a screen and

2632
01:36:11,118 --> 01:36:14,000
make small morsels of it like we did

2633
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,360
with the other side

2634
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,118
i think that would be i think that would

2635
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:17,599
be probably the smartest approach and

2636
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:20,238
again

2637
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:22,639
you know if you're starting with an

2638
01:36:20,238 --> 01:36:24,718
unscreened compost

2639
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:25,840
i would recommend you screen it so it's

2640
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:28,239
at least easier to

2641
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,960
break like maybe you screen it first

2642
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:30,959
right

2643
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:32,158
right whenever possible screen at first

2644
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,880
so you don't have to try to do it when

2645
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:34,319
it's wet

2646
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:36,560
right with all these clumps sticking

2647
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:38,319
together yeah so you know start with the

2648
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:40,480
screen compost and then

2649
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:42,079
after you get to that point re-screen it

2650
01:36:40,479 --> 01:36:43,919
with the same screen now you've now

2651
01:36:42,079 --> 01:36:46,319
you've broken it apart again

2652
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,118
all right awesome all right so those

2653
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:49,759
were

2654
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:51,439
uh one two three those are four

2655
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:54,800
different varieties

2656
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:55,839
of collecting um oxygen tolerant

2657
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:59,679
anaerobes

2658
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:03,279
um facultative anaerobes

2659
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:06,639
and the other way too you're getting

2660
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:07,759
arabs that are low oxygen tolerant as

2661
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:10,880
well so you're getting both

2662
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:13,440
both both teams that play in the

2663
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:14,719
middle environment and do well on the

2664
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:16,238
other end of the spectrum

2665
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:18,880
but they come together and play in the

2666
01:37:16,238 --> 01:37:21,439
middle so let's let's finish off with

2667
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,639
any other strategies that you may have

2668
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:24,799
for

2669
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:26,880
increasing the aerobic nature of soil

2670
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,520
right i mean the whole point of this is

2671
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:30,079
that

2672
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:30,880
we're moving our soil from anaerobic

2673
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:34,399
environment

2674
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:37,760
to being less aerobic and being

2675
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:41,118
um excuse me we're moving it from being

2676
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:44,239
less anaerobic to more aerobic

2677
01:37:41,118 --> 01:37:46,238
by adding new microbes and bacteria that

2678
01:37:44,238 --> 01:37:48,319
play around in the middle area

2679
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:50,238
what else can we do to build the aerobic

2680
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:53,679
nature of the soil to help this

2681
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:55,599
this aggregation process on okay so

2682
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:57,199
this would be do this would be field

2683
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:59,199
soils because obviously

2684
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:00,799
soils medium is going to be already

2685
01:37:59,198 --> 01:38:04,000
completely aerobic

2686
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:07,039
because it's got so much pore space so

2687
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:09,920
we're in a field condition

2688
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:11,679
um and we have highly compacted soil say

2689
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,600
we just bought a farmstead

2690
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:16,000
and we're growing our six plants or

2691
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:20,000
whatever and it was old farmland

2692
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:23,439
or ag land or or just you know well-used

2693
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,439
lawn or or whatever

2694
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:28,880
i would say that the the easiest

2695
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:30,880
but the thing that takes the longest is

2696
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:34,079
a series of cover crop rotations

2697
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:36,000
so something like a jackhammer radish i

2698
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:39,359
think they call them daikon

2699
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,880
radishes are wonderful for breaking up

2700
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:42,639
compaction

2701
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,560
i've actually seen stuff that was so

2702
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:46,719
compacted that the

2703
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:47,600
the radish actually pushed itself out of

2704
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:50,800
the soil

2705
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:53,520
which is you know pretty unusual

2706
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:55,279
but it was a highly compacted clay soil

2707
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:58,960
so it is understandable

2708
01:38:55,279 --> 01:39:02,479
but by using root crops

2709
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:04,158
and crops that have known deep tap roots

2710
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:06,079
there's there's a number of

2711
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:07,198
i don't like to call them weeds because

2712
01:39:06,079 --> 01:39:08,559
i don't believe they are

2713
01:39:07,198 --> 01:39:10,238
i think they're what we call

2714
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:11,520
successionary plants that they're

2715
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:14,079
basically

2716
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:16,800
providing or building the soil for the

2717
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:18,880
next succession of plants to come in

2718
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,639
by pulling out certain minerals that are

2719
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,960
deficient in the soil

2720
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:24,319
bringing them up to the surface and then

2721
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,239
dying as a plant

2722
01:39:24,319 --> 01:39:28,799
and releasing them on the surface so the

2723
01:39:26,238 --> 01:39:29,519
next plant the next succession can come

2724
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,159
in

2725
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,880
but that takes time humans humans you

2726
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:35,759
know we have

2727
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:36,159
a hundred years uh mother earth thinks

2728
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,760
you know

2729
01:39:36,158 --> 01:39:44,399
100 years nanosecond so

2730
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:46,880
we want to do this and have it right now

2731
01:39:44,399 --> 01:39:48,960
so when you're in a situation where you

2732
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:50,239
don't even have the opportunity to cover

2733
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,639
crop for a year

2734
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:54,000
which in all honesty personally i'd like

2735
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:57,600
to see people build soil

2736
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,039
for three years to really get that

2737
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,960
to the point where you can just take

2738
01:39:59,039 --> 01:40:02,158
your whole hand and just stuff it down

2739
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:05,920
into your elbow

2740
01:40:02,158 --> 01:40:08,719
without any resistance whatsoever that's

2741
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:10,239
beautifully aerobic soil that will send

2742
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:12,639
cannabis plant roots

2743
01:40:10,238 --> 01:40:13,519
flying through this through the matrix

2744
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:16,639
but that's

2745
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:19,040
takes time um and perhaps amendments

2746
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:22,159
like you know tilling in compost

2747
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:24,960
so your strategy is is is

2748
01:40:22,158 --> 01:40:25,759
dependent on your again resources and

2749
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,800
the time

2750
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:30,800
that you have allotted so in in the

2751
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,480
situation where i have a highly

2752
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,960
compacted soil

2753
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:36,638
and i want to grow cannabis plants this

2754
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:39,198
year

2755
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:40,239
in this spot i would say all right so

2756
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:42,799
what you want to do

2757
01:40:40,238 --> 01:40:44,638
is get yourself some really good compost

2758
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,800
and you're going to do mound culture

2759
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:48,400
kind of like hugel culture but basically

2760
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:51,119
you're just going to build a

2761
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:52,879
half of the horizontal soil system right

2762
01:40:51,118 --> 01:40:54,639
on top of the soil

2763
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,319
that way you'll get your fast rooting if

2764
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:58,319
your seeds your tap will have the

2765
01:40:56,319 --> 01:41:01,279
ability to push down into the

2766
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:03,359
existing profile i would highly

2767
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:05,519
recommend that you do

2768
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:06,799
a soil chemistry test and a saturated

2769
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:11,280
paste test

2770
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:14,560
because a lot of these imbalances

2771
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:16,719
cause compaction go figure right so by

2772
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:19,480
adding some of these

2773
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:21,359
required micronutrients and or

2774
01:41:19,479 --> 01:41:25,039
macronutrients

2775
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:26,960
you are going to naturally put into play

2776
01:41:25,039 --> 01:41:28,639
the soil chemistry

2777
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:30,800
this is probably the most important

2778
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:33,199
thing i can teach anybody

2779
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:34,239
you need to look at soil in three

2780
01:41:33,198 --> 01:41:36,319
different lights

2781
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:37,279
and and where those three circles come

2782
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:40,399
together is

2783
01:41:37,279 --> 01:41:42,719
the sweet spot number one physical

2784
01:41:40,399 --> 01:41:44,079
sand silk clay and organic matter what

2785
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:45,279
are the relations what are the

2786
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:48,479
proportions

2787
01:41:45,279 --> 01:41:50,079
really important second soil chemistry

2788
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:51,839
without the right chemistry you're going

2789
01:41:50,079 --> 01:41:52,880
to have all kinds of other battles you

2790
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,600
have to fight

2791
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,639
and finally biology all three are

2792
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,400
equally important

2793
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:01,039
and again where the three rings come

2794
01:41:58,399 --> 01:42:02,238
together that's the sweet spot where you

2795
01:42:01,039 --> 01:42:05,519
want to be

2796
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:08,000
so now that we've got a a fast growing

2797
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:08,560
kind of soilless medium on the surface

2798
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,719
we have

2799
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:14,000
our you know natural drainage and our

2800
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:16,319
sand salt clay below that

2801
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
we've put our chemistry into play now

2802
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:21,279
it's a matter of putting the biology

2803
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,600
into play so a good inoculant whether

2804
01:42:21,279 --> 01:42:23,920
it's

2805
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,679
your own compost extract as long as you

2806
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,520
know that you have good organisms

2807
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:29,679
i've traveled the country a number of

2808
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:32,400
times worked with men

2809
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:33,840
women i've been baking compost 50 years

2810
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:35,599
i know what i'm doing i have the best

2811
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,520
compost i put it under the microscope

2812
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:39,600
i'm like yeah you've got great compost

2813
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:42,080
it just doesn't have any biology in it

2814
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:44,719
it's a great nutrient source and that's

2815
01:42:42,079 --> 01:42:47,920
you know that's another thing that

2816
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:50,399
awareness for compost and and taking

2817
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:53,279
that word and breaking it apart

2818
01:42:50,399 --> 01:42:54,158
what is compost not all composts are

2819
01:42:53,279 --> 01:42:56,399
created the same

2820
01:42:54,158 --> 01:42:57,679
i can take ground up organic matter and

2821
01:42:56,399 --> 01:43:00,158
call it compost

2822
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:01,440
i can take biodynamic mayonnaise and

2823
01:43:00,158 --> 01:43:03,519
call it compost

2824
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:05,279
although the texture of both of them are

2825
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:08,159
opposite ends of the spectrum

2826
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:10,319
right so we really need to define that

2827
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:12,960
word a little bit better

2828
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:13,920
but anyway so back to the point now now

2829
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:16,480
i have this

2830
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,319
you know super soil soilless medium on

2831
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:19,919
the surface for fast rooting growth

2832
01:43:18,319 --> 01:43:21,198
i'm going to put the biology in play

2833
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,880
yeah the biology is probably going to

2834
01:43:21,198 --> 01:43:25,359
wash through

2835
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:26,880
a lot of that that top matrix but it

2836
01:43:25,359 --> 01:43:29,279
will establish itself

2837
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:30,560
as soon as it gets into that zone

2838
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:32,238
between the two

2839
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:34,239
of what you piled on top and the

2840
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:36,000
existing soil and then it's going to

2841
01:43:34,238 --> 01:43:38,000
start building soil structure

2842
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,760
and then i would cover crop all the way

2843
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:43,679
around the outside of this

2844
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:45,679
raised bed uh or mound culture

2845
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:47,679
so that those roots from the plants that

2846
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:48,239
i planted in the indigenous soil start

2847
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:50,719
to push

2848
01:43:48,238 --> 01:43:52,238
in underneath that pile and co-mingle

2849
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:54,239
with my cannabis plants

2850
01:43:52,238 --> 01:43:55,279
again the more plants you can put into

2851
01:43:54,238 --> 01:43:57,759
the soil

2852
01:43:55,279 --> 01:43:58,880
into play the faster you can build

2853
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:01,920
aggregation

2854
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:05,600
aggregation is is a key or

2855
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:08,239
is is a direct result of glues

2856
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:09,360
and i'm glad that we you asked me that

2857
01:44:08,238 --> 01:44:12,479
question because

2858
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:15,519
one of the things i did not cover was

2859
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:16,238
other types of natural glues so sap

2860
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,560
robes

2861
01:44:16,238 --> 01:44:20,238
are past known as saprophytic which we

2862
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:23,119
can't call them anymore because

2863
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:24,879
phytic means plant and fungi's are not

2864
01:44:23,118 --> 01:44:28,319
plants they're fungi

2865
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:31,520
so saprobes excrete a

2866
01:44:28,319 --> 01:44:34,880
glue called glomulin and it again is an

2867
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:36,800
incredibly strong glue for bonding

2868
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:38,639
soil particulates and silt and clay and

2869
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:42,079
organic matter together

2870
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:45,118
so the fastest way to get aggregation

2871
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:47,039
is to have a high level of biology

2872
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:48,479
especially if you're using like this you

2873
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:53,840
know medium

2874
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:57,678
oxygen environment biofilms

2875
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:59,520
and you know increased the bacteria

2876
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:00,719
make sure you do an inoculant of

2877
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:04,400
protozoa which is

2878
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:06,719
what's coming from fish brew and

2879
01:45:04,399 --> 01:45:07,439
again you want to get a really good

2880
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:10,960
fungal

2881
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:13,198
presence and that's why you know elaine

2882
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:14,079
dr elaine ingham speaks so much about

2883
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:17,678
the fungal

2884
01:45:14,079 --> 01:45:21,198
f to b ratio is because you're missing

2885
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:22,960
50 percent of the entire soil kingdom

2886
01:45:21,198 --> 01:45:24,399
if you do not have mycorrhizae and

2887
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:26,880
saprophytes

2888
01:45:24,399 --> 01:45:27,599
or saprobes doing the work for you by

2889
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,319
excreting

2890
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:32,719
uh acids and building glues and pushing

2891
01:45:30,319 --> 01:45:35,198
nutrients and cycling all over the place

2892
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:36,960
i mean the new work coming out on

2893
01:45:35,198 --> 01:45:39,839
mycorrhizae

2894
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:41,359
insane there are relationships of

2895
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:44,719
bacteria that move

2896
01:45:41,359 --> 01:45:48,799
in and out through the wall

2897
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:52,000
of the hyphy internally into the fungi

2898
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:55,760
to perform processes and

2899
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:59,118
also move back out and travel down it

2900
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:02,960
there's some incredible new

2901
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:05,039
videos showing uh with some incredible

2902
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:08,079
new microscopy

2903
01:46:05,039 --> 01:46:09,359
techniques showing just colonies of

2904
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:11,600
bacteria

2905
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:14,079
moving up and down the channels of the

2906
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:15,199
hyphy as if it was a super highway

2907
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:17,198
and they're not all going in one

2908
01:46:15,198 --> 01:46:18,799
direction they're they're going at each

2909
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:19,198
other from both directions and moving

2910
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:23,279
around

2911
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:24,000
each other it's crazy so if you do not

2912
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:27,359
have these

2913
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:30,479
these organisms in play you're losing

2914
01:46:27,359 --> 01:46:34,158
50 of the potential uh

2915
01:46:30,479 --> 01:46:35,919
of of you know plant genetics

2916
01:46:34,158 --> 01:46:37,439
and again if you're going to use

2917
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,359
mycorrhizae

2918
01:46:37,439 --> 01:46:42,079
and you're going to use it in pots you

2919
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:42,880
gotta have plants growing non-stop in

2920
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:45,439
that or that

2921
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:46,239
mycorrhizae is gonna die and if you use

2922
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:49,439
any soft

2923
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:51,359
rock phosphate you're gonna disassociate

2924
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:53,359
that plant with the mycorrhizae and the

2925
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:56,319
mycorrhizae is gonna die

2926
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:58,158
and remember it takes 90 days for full

2927
01:46:56,319 --> 01:47:01,359
colonization so that means

2928
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:02,799
from the root to the source of sand silt

2929
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:04,559
and clay to mine

2930
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,639
so again if you have a super soil and

2931
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,320
you do not have sand silt and clay

2932
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:09,840
don't waste your money on mycorrhizae

2933
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:11,679
inoculants you're just throwing your

2934
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:14,239
money out the window

2935
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:16,800
but those guys are what is going to

2936
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:19,678
speed up that aggregation process

2937
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:21,039
and in the case of a mound culture in

2938
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:22,399
the fall you want to plant it with a

2939
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:23,600
winter wheat you want to plant it with

2940
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:26,638
something

2941
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:30,159
that's going to continuously

2942
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:31,840
feed your biological kingdoms

2943
01:47:30,158 --> 01:47:33,439
throughout the course of the winter or

2944
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:35,440
until they go dormant now

2945
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:36,960
if it freezes and it goes dormant that's

2946
01:47:35,439 --> 01:47:37,919
fine everything is going to be in play

2947
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:41,039
in spring

2948
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:43,600
just like it is in nature so you know

2949
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:44,880
those are the those are the key ways to

2950
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:48,639
to build

2951
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:50,719
um soil in a un ideal

2952
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:52,880
dirtish environment right on that's

2953
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:56,000
great you know that um

2954
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:58,239
the the mound style um

2955
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,319
is actually what you taught during the

2956
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:03,118
water and watering episode

2957
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:04,319
and tip for me to get over my

2958
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:06,238
hydrophilic

2959
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:08,079
soil right because the this is

2960
01:48:06,238 --> 01:48:11,118
hydrophobic

2961
01:48:08,079 --> 01:48:13,679
yes hydrophobic you got it um the hydro

2962
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:15,920
the the soil top had gotten the point

2963
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:16,880
where when i poured my water on it it

2964
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:19,840
just like

2965
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:20,719
slid right off like it was on the um the

2966
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,719
hood of a car

2967
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:24,480
it just slid off to the side and then

2968
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:26,480
down the side of the pot

2969
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:27,599
and during that episode you're all like

2970
01:48:26,479 --> 01:48:30,479
heck you know cover

2971
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:31,920
cover all of that with compost and make

2972
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:33,519
sure it doesn't dry out just keep it

2973
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:37,118
nice and moist and

2974
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:37,840
you know maybe it took two weeks for the

2975
01:48:37,118 --> 01:48:40,799
constant

2976
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:41,840
interaction and of all that the compost

2977
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:44,840
and the moisture

2978
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:46,239
and the microbes the bacteria in the

2979
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:50,319
compost

2980
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:54,000
it just like woke up all of the assisted

2981
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:57,359
biology in my bio

2982
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,479
hydrophobic soil and and it just like

2983
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:00,880
melted away

2984
01:48:58,479 --> 01:49:01,678
and i can see how if you had a pile of

2985
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,679
that

2986
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:05,279
um and they were you know they were

2987
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:07,520
placed nearby each other

2988
01:49:05,279 --> 01:49:08,399
on acreage how it would have that same

2989
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:11,679
effect you're

2990
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:14,960
you're essentially softening up parts

2991
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:17,679
of its protective you know

2992
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:18,800
sheath and incurred coaxing some of the

2993
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:21,520
life to come back

2994
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:23,840
and wake up again um until that it can

2995
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:26,880
then spread itself

2996
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:30,079
spot on and remember like any time water

2997
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:31,118
moves horizontally and laterally it's

2998
01:49:30,079 --> 01:49:33,279
eroding

2999
01:49:31,118 --> 01:49:35,359
and you do not want that and that's you

3000
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:35,759
know that's the biggest problem we have

3001
01:49:35,359 --> 01:49:39,039
as a

3002
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:42,320
as a species right now is is the loss of

3003
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:45,359
soil through transportation all

3004
01:49:42,319 --> 01:49:48,000
80 of all the soils on this planet came

3005
01:49:45,359 --> 01:49:49,039
from transportation so that's wind or

3006
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,118
water

3007
01:49:49,039 --> 01:49:52,639
and to have bare soil i mean i live out

3008
01:49:51,118 --> 01:49:54,479
here in oxnard and every time the wind

3009
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:56,480
picks up you get dust devils and

3010
01:49:54,479 --> 01:49:57,678
everything is caked with dust all the

3011
01:49:56,479 --> 01:49:59,598
time

3012
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:01,599
because these guys are just constantly

3013
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:03,119
plowing and rotating and they're never

3014
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:05,840
cover cropping

3015
01:50:03,118 --> 01:50:07,759
um and they don't give the soil a chance

3016
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:10,430
to to heal itself

3017
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:11,520
they just pound it with more friggin mpk

3018
01:50:10,430 --> 01:50:13,520
[Music]

3019
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:15,760
and that's a result of you know that's

3020
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:17,920
why the salt the soil is just blowing

3021
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:20,639
away and they're down into subsoil now

3022
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:23,599
i mean lucky for them that the the soil

3023
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:27,359
that they have here is this amazing clay

3024
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:30,639
sand clay silt relationship it's really

3025
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:32,880
silty clay sand and

3026
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:34,400
the nutritional value of it is insane

3027
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:37,118
the problem is

3028
01:50:34,399 --> 01:50:38,879
that again we have very dry environment

3029
01:50:37,118 --> 01:50:42,719
and it's windy

3030
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:44,880
and they don't they don't

3031
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:46,319
i shouldn't say they don't have the best

3032
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:49,359
practices they have

3033
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:51,599
the practices that they utilize

3034
01:50:49,359 --> 01:50:52,960
because they're producing so much food

3035
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:54,800
all the time

3036
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,639
and you know that's the necessary of

3037
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:57,520
what i want to call manufacturing

3038
01:50:56,639 --> 01:50:59,359
farming

3039
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:01,040
where you just constantly put in another

3040
01:50:59,359 --> 01:51:02,479
row another another round of plants

3041
01:51:01,039 --> 01:51:03,359
another round of plants another round of

3042
01:51:02,479 --> 01:51:05,519
plants

3043
01:51:03,359 --> 01:51:07,198
you just never get a chance to stabilize

3044
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:09,920
and build aggregation

3045
01:51:07,198 --> 01:51:10,319
but you're spot on i mean you could put

3046
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:12,960
uh

3047
01:51:10,319 --> 01:51:13,920
this mound um out in the middle of your

3048
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,239
backyard

3049
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:18,560
and you'll see i mean it's gonna it's

3050
01:51:16,238 --> 01:51:21,519
gonna soften the soil probably within

3051
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:22,719
five six eight feet of that pile once it

3052
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,400
gets going

3053
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:26,079
and that's why i said you know plant

3054
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:27,118
plant all the way around it because that

3055
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:29,599
too is gonna help

3056
01:51:27,118 --> 01:51:31,759
to soften even further out and deeper

3057
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:34,480
down as those roots penetrate

3058
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:36,079
and and build rhizosphere and and

3059
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:38,319
introduce all those microbes

3060
01:51:36,079 --> 01:51:39,599
into that soil matrix they'll start

3061
01:51:38,319 --> 01:51:40,079
building aggregates i mean they're

3062
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:43,279
they're

3063
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:45,679
hardworking little guys fantastic

3064
01:51:43,279 --> 01:51:47,439

where we talk about the um the layering

3098
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:04,239
technique of creating substrate for

3099
01:53:03,439 --> 01:53:07,519
containers

3100
01:53:04,238 --> 01:53:11,198

the rhizosphere

3105
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,239
and how to determine how much water is

3106
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:23,360
enough
