1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,138
so Ethan you know you've spoken for

2
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:11,529
years about your vision of the future

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:14,529
where people are growing specialty kima

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:16,778
bars that are being grown with a terpene

5
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:19,089
mix and a cannabinoid mix that are

6
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:22,179
specifically for different types of

7
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:24,519
patients and that with you know a little

8
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:27,070
bit time and a lot of effort we would be

9
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:29,289
able to get to these custom cultivars

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,660
for these for these different patients

11
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:33,609
but of course the the cannabis industry

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,340
right now is kind of going in another

13
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:40,510
way at the same time which is moving

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:42,340
towards distillates and and and and

15
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:44,968
terpenes and kind of putting them

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:48,280
together in kind of a cocktail and

17
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,070
trying to customize cannabis medicine

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,950
for patients that way as somebody who i

19
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,929
know is very much into whole plant what

20
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:58,840
are your thoughts on trying to get to

21
00:00:55,929 --> 00:01:02,710
those goals of customized cannabis

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,439
medicine through dinner isolates instead

23
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,108
of through growing whole plants in in

24
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:12,129
one plant well to me that approaches a

25
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:15,068
little bit backwards it is clear that

26
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:18,578
the cannabis plant has a very plastic

27
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:22,060
genome this is a way of saying that you

28
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:25,298
can make it do anything if you take the

29
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,638
time to selectively breed it for

30
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:29,740
specific components and combinations

31
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:31,868
that you want this has been amply

32
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:35,289
demonstrated that's always going to be

33
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:41,429
better in contrast we have the situation

34
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:45,159
now where many people are producing CBD

35
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:48,789
isolates they they might use a hemp

36
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,560
source for example and they realize that

37
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:53,168
on the world market they can get forty

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,289
dollars a gram for this material but we

39
00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:57,848
know that many patients with a severe

40
00:01:56,289 --> 00:02:00,579
seizure disorder would go through that

41
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:02,770
in a day it's also been amply

42
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:05,228
demonstrated that CBD alone although

43
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:09,489
it's a great medicine for severe

44
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:12,250
epilepsy for schizophrenia we could do

45
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:12,730
the same thing probably a lot better

46
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,389
with

47
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:19,859
much lower doses of CBD when it's in

48
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:22,359
combination with its other natural

49
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,659
friends let's say the other components

50
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,049
in cannabis so a little bit of THC with

51
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:33,329
a bigger amount of CBD is good for very

52
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:36,340
many conditions there was recently a

53
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,410
meta-analysis this is a situation in

54
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,769
which someone reviews the literature and

55
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:43,870
crunches all the numbers from multiple

56
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:47,829
studies together to create an overall

57
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:50,560
impression so fabbrizio pamplona did

58
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:55,780
this in relation to a comparison between

59
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:58,949
CBD is a pure drug versus CBD as an

60
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:03,009
extract in treatment of severe epilepsy

61
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:05,348
what they found was that although there

62
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:07,840
could be comparable levels of efficacy

63
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:11,798
that it would work for seizures about

64
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,920
the same the doses required for the CBD

65
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:19,209
extracts with other components included

66
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:23,138
were about 20% of what was required with

67
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:27,250
CBD alone and the side effects were much

68
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:30,400
lower because at very very high doses in

69
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,379
combination with other drugs CBD can

70
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,109
produce some drug drug interactions that

71
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:38,049
you just don't see at the lower doses

72
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:40,629
when it's a whole plan of medicine so

73
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:45,819
that's a factor now what about the

74
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:49,120
situation of using either a pure

75
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:54,009
cannabinoid or a cannabis extract and

76
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:57,280
then adding terpenoids from an outside

77
00:03:54,009 --> 00:04:00,128
source well I I'm really against this

78
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,878
first it's often done with synthetic

79
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:05,378
terpenoids from chemical producer that

80
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:06,098
were never designed for human

81
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:10,418
consumption

82
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:12,250
and they might be 95% pure but we don't

83
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,319
know if I percent is important yeah it

84
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,038
could be we don't know what it is and

85
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:19,478
what its potential toxicity could be

86
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:22,899
additionally we don't know that it's

87
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:25,529
going to be the same stereoisomer that

88
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:28,448
cannabis produces

89
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:30,938
molecules have three-dimensional

90
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:33,038
structures and if it's turned the wrong

91
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:35,590
way if it's the mirror image it can have

92
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:37,658
a totally different effect it can smell

93
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:40,529
different it can have different effects

94
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:43,389
in the brain or other parts of the body

95
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:46,179
so I realize what people are trying to

96
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:48,519
do with this but to me it's vastly

97
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:52,060
preferable to take the time and

98
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:55,269
selectively breathe cannabis for the

99
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,899
components and proportions that you wish

100
00:04:55,269 --> 00:05:00,758
to target when I think about people

101
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:04,810
using eye slits and putting them

102
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:07,990
together to try to reach a clinical goal

103
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:10,778
with a patient it feels like a analog

104
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,788
versus digital music to me where if

105
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:15,459
you're taking you know one part this

106
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:17,829
terpene one part THC one part a couple

107
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:19,598
of different you know minor cannabinoids

108
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:21,758
and put them together you're getting

109
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:24,339
these zeros and ones but with analog

110
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,310
music when you're putting a needle on a

111
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:30,310
record you get all of the depth of it

112
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:33,098
instead of just the composite of the

113
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:36,459
pieces is that an appropriate way to

114
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:40,870
think about it well maybe I like a lot

115
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:46,689
of digital music but with respect to the

116
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:49,538
plants it's my considered opinion that a

117
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:52,509
properly constituted extract is going to

118
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:54,180
beat these combinations any time and

119
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:57,278
clearly if we're talking about

120
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,949
development of a pharmaceutical it has

121
00:05:57,278 --> 00:06:01,598
to be from one species if we're

122
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:04,360
combining species that becomes a

123
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:07,000
combination medicine and then you're

124
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,088
probably tripling or more of the work

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,610
because you have to do toxicology

126
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:15,639
analysis on each component separately

127
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:19,598
and then all of them together and it

128
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,918
becomes cost prohibitive so if let's say

129
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:23,288
that we were talking about using these

130
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:27,338
isolates as a bridge because these

131
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:30,968
custom chemo VARs don't exist yet

132
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:33,459
I'm guessing they don't exist there's no

133
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:35,649
but it's and so and so it's I can see

134
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,399
someone watching thinking myself well in

135
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:39,610
the shore

136
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:42,579
we're going to use you know terpenes and

137
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:46,900
isolates together until we grow these

138
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:49,448
plants and I'm wondering a can that do

139
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:50,799
more damage than help the patient and be

140
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:53,379
if you know where these plants are what

141
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,540
are your thoughts on that well the

142
00:06:53,379 --> 00:07:01,478
problem is that yes these plants exist

143
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:03,879
but in very limited jurisdictions for

144
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:06,009
instance some of these types of Kim

145
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,759
Avars that I'm describing or available

146
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:11,469
in California and Washington DC but

147
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,000
they're not generally available because

148
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:18,190
our federal laws prohibit these crossing

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,379
state borders let alone international

150
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:24,180
borders so that's the first thing that

151
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:29,110
needs to happen I'm not in favor of

152
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:32,829
combining external synthetics as a

153
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:35,740
stopgap measure because again these are

154
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:40,709
potentially toxic the amounts use may

155
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:44,250
not be proper at all and it's just not

156
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:48,370
not a proper approach mm-hmm

157
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:52,629
last question on this so for people who

158
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:54,639
are using isolates and terpenes to you

159
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:58,990
know try to have this bridge until these

160
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,300
plants are more more accessible is there

161
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:05,560
a way for them to know when they're

162
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:07,689
reaching threshold points that could you

163
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,819
know be toxic like offering terpene

164
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:12,009
toxicity because you know I know that

165
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:13,689
it's it's pretty well regarded that

166
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:15,879
because we've had the relationship with

167
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:19,209
the cannabis plant for so long and it

168
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:21,459
generally moves slowly in its changes

169
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:23,680
that we continually are checking in with

170
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:26,168
the plant whereas if we grab a bunch of

171
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,840
isolate and we put it together we

172
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:31,750
haven't had a long relationship with

173
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:33,819
that particular combination and so we

174
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,990
put ourselves at more risk yeah that

175
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,089
that's true

176
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,330
people should keep in mind what the

177
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:44,020
relative concentrations would be under

178
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:46,660
natural conditions so if we have total

179
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:49,549
cannabinoids in the 20 percent or 25

180
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:52,459
percent range

181
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:55,969
many of the chemo VARs only still have

182
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:58,879
about one or two percent terpenoids 5%

183
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:01,310
which I've seen is really good so you

184
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,820
can get to the point that it's a five to

185
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:06,709
one ratio of cannabinoids to terpenoids

186
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,129
so people certainly shouldn't be

187
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:12,889
exceeding that plus they need to keep in

188
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:16,789
mind that too much of a good thing is

189
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:21,439
really possible let's take the example

190
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:25,549
of beta pine or I'm sorry alpha piny

191
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,880
piny n-- is a bronchodilator

192
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:31,189
it opens up the lungs but when there's

193
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,529
too much it's irritating to the lungs

194
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,480
and can have a reverse effect say and

195
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:38,480
someone who's asthmatic

196
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,330
a little bit of alpha pining will

197
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,710
counteract the short-term memory

198
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:47,450
impairment the THC produces but too much

199
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:50,470
potentially could be too stimulating and

200
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:53,090
we know that acetylcholinesterase

201
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,330
inhibitors which is the activity that

202
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:59,269
elephant pining produces boosts memory

203
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:02,420
in low amounts but if the dose is

204
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:04,759
excessive they could make it more likely

205
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:08,899
for someone to have a seizure in other

206
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:10,819
words alpha pining has toxicity if the

207
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:13,269
dose is too high and the same thing

208
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:16,520
would apply to any other terpenoid

209
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:20,529
another example would be essential oils

210
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,529
which are combinations of terpenoids

211
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:27,440
essential oil of lavender is okay to

212
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:30,439
place on the skin what's called using

213
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,140
meat so if somebody has a burn and puts

214
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,960
lavender essential oil that will help

215
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:38,899
with the burn and it won't be bad for

216
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,090
the skin however many other essential

217
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:44,480
oils would be caustic if applied

218
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:49,009
directly to the skin on produce burning

219
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,860
or other reactions so I really worry

220
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:54,439
about safety and relation to these kinds

221
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,079
of practices if people are not being

222
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,189
cognizant of

223
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:02,948
the proper proportions or the need to go

224
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:04,269
slowly with these things and if you want

225
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:06,909
to learn more about this we actually

226
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:08,889
have got a link to dr. Russo's paper on

227
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:11,850
this topic in the first comment below

228
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,850
thank you dr. Russo
