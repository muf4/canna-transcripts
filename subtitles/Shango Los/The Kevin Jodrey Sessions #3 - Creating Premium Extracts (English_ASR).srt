1
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,929
so another question I want to ask you is

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,509
that you know lots of different strains

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:12,759
are being extracted now at all different

4
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:14,949
levels of expertise but one thing that

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:17,320
we're seeing more and more are people

6
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:20,259
who are extracting flowers and the

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,370
terpene profile or in the enjoyment

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:26,290
level of the final extraction doesn't

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,120
taste like the original flower a good

10
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:29,739
example from it for that is Washington

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,720
skunk right was involved with a run

12
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:33,878
recently where you know the the

13
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,250
Washington skunk itself it had you know

14
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:38,409
the you know the kind of alcohol esters

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,750
and the skunk enos that we all loved but

16
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:42,519
when it was concentrated it tastes like

17
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,049
burnt rubber and it was like it was a

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,890
clean professional extraction so it

19
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:48,009
wasn't like there was anything wrong

20
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,020
with the extraction but the the hint of

21
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:52,390
that burnt rubber that's in those skunk

22
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:56,079
strains when you took it when a flower

23
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:58,329
it was it was nice at that density but

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,310
then when you extract it suddenly it

25
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:02,230
tasted dis pleasurable and so we made

26
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,088
back hash out of some of it and it had

27
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,519
the same experience so so when you

28
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:08,888
remove the plant material and you really

29
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:11,108
hit on those notes it became something

30
00:01:08,888 --> 00:01:12,548
that people were first suspicious about

31
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:14,349
smoking because it tasted like burn

32
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:16,149
rubber but then when we realized it was

33
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:18,068
just legit the terpenes that were in it

34
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:20,289
um you know no one wanted to buy they

35
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:24,759
would choose something else so for

36
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:27,849
people who are strategizing what flower

37
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:29,590
to set up to extract how do you how

38
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:32,138
would you approach that that that

39
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:35,560
challenge of the final product not

40
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:37,509
tasting like like your your your origin

41
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,219
flower you know the only way that you

42
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:41,349
can do this is you have to really look

43
00:01:39,218 --> 00:01:43,118
at a development cycle for outdoor

44
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:45,428
farmers it's basically a year so you

45
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,828
have to look into next season so every

46
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:50,409
year we would test a number of varietals

47
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:53,169
and see what we liked and then have them

48
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:55,359
blown in some small capacity so we could

49
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,099
say did this transfer and the way we had

50
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:58,568
hoped because you'll smell things and

51
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:58,930
you'll be like mmm that's fascinating

52
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:01,180
out

53
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,070
could increase some of this intensity it

54
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,020
would be highly attractive and so

55
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:07,000
sometimes you hit it head-on and you

56
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:08,769
pull out these wonderful notes and tones

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,508
that you could barely detect and then

58
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,159
other times you intensify components

59
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,449
that become undesirable and the only way

60
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,650
that you can determine that to me

61
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:16,539
personally in terms of how the

62
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,330
individual determines it is through

63
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:21,159
testing where you grow it you run it you

64
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,170
determine is there a value if there's a

65
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:25,090
value you commit next year I don't think

66
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:26,739
cannabis fluctuates so quickly in a

67
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,110
bigger market people like distrained is

68
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,600
your but the reality is it's it's

69
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,310
profiles that kind of hold for time and

70
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,780
for the farmers what they want to be

71
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,310
able to do is do the testing to find

72
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,199
varietals that work for them on their

73
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,170
farm location cultivation techniques

74
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,179
skill level and then determine where did

75
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:45,069
it shine and so for me certain flowers

76
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,810
like skunks look like for me chasing

77
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:49,150
skunk the skunk project is really about

78
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,129
smokeable and joint form for people in

79
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,950
my age group who still know how to roll

80
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,959
cannabis and that way what could happen

81
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:57,729
is individuals will want to experience

82
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,979
in that way to find out what is the

83
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:01,389
attraction to it but I knew that once

84
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:03,909
you get into skunks you weren't going to

85
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,589
have the the extraction capabilities

86
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:06,639
because of the fuels and the esters that

87
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,439
were you're going to lose a lot of these

88
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,359
subtleties that mask some of these other

89
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,370
dominant flavors that are aggressive so

90
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,410
burnt rubber in the joint is really neat

91
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,670
but when you intensify it it's not

92
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:19,780
enough effect is edgy and hard and so

93
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:21,219
depending on what you're trying to do

94
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,229
and I think most farms really need to

95
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:25,299
diversify their product lines in a sense

96
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:27,250
of what works well for you as a farmer

97
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:30,099
on your property and then what do you

98
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,989
believe your sales market is and that's

99
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,849
really doing the research on what is

100
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:36,189
moving in the market in general and then

101
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:38,439
breaking up your distributions to match

102
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:39,729
that and so you I'm gonna grow all three

103
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,099
roles that's dangerous I'm gonna grow

104
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:43,389
all extract that's dangerous you want to

105
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:44,919
be able to put yourself in a stratified

106
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,699
market with those different positions

107
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,559
that you're taking and I think that

108
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,149
the individuals who are doing it if

109
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,439
there have been successful with selling

110
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,909
cannabis they have an ability to

111
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,650
determine this and if they're not they

112
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:57,659
should get a hold of somebody that they

113
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,730
know who sells cannabis that has a good

114
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,139
palate that says this is something that

115
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:02,969
people would like or it wouldn't and

116
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:04,379
that way what it does it allows you to

117
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:06,240
make the correct decisions but for me

118
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:08,009
it's a full-year a cyclical time I'm

119
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,900
into our guys it's going to be you know

120
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:11,429
every two and a half three months so

121
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,200
indoor can allow you to do a much

122
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,580
quicker cyclical run and if you can work

123
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,529
with people that are doing indoor it

124
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,980
lets you see the subtleties of how your

125
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:21,208
flower will respond but ultimately it's

126
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,650
going to be what it's going to be where

127
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,019
you put it and it's going to pick up the

128
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:26,250
environmental changes meaning the impact

129
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,930
of the environment on the cannabis

130
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,000
flower and it's gonna pick up what

131
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,490
you're using to grow it and so if you

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,310
model it exactly well then you get the

133
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,810
exact same result but when you start to

134
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,759
do it under different lighting different

135
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,009
nutrient changes it changes the profile

136
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,668
in the mouth but it lets you get kind of

137
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:47,490
close and so the ability to use indoor

138
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:49,289
tools to help you narrow the scope of

139
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,480
what you're trying to grab and then you

140
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,790
take those cultivars that you sifted

141
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,379
into a smaller population bring them to

142
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,810
your location and say hey these shine

143
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,550
here and they work now we know it works

144
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,139
the creme brulee cut that I like to work

145
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,990
with there's been a couple years in

146
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,750
operation of first we sifted it out out

147
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,978
of a big population and then we took a

148
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,350
look at it and said what happens when

149
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:12,329
you run it live and then once we found

150
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,860
out what it did live we committed to run

151
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:15,569
a farm live or a good portion of the

152
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,069
farm so it was a multi-year process

153
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:19,259
because I know that when you get

154
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:20,920
something that's exceptional in terms of

155
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,289
how you perceive it

156
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,750
you can go out of bold that quickly good

157
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,760
is good and there's all these little

158
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,230
micro trends but ultimately people want

159
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,449
things that have a quality and that

160
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,189
quality is just real and if you can

161
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:35,439
satisfy that then you have a couple

162
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:37,089
years of stability and I think farmers

163
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,860
need to work on that concept more than

164
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:40,359
every year I have to be red-hot because

165
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,730
you'll never match that trend you'll

166
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,259
always really be behind it when trends

167
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,480
are pop and people are setting them

168
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:48,819
anybody who's not setting it shouldn't

169
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,860
follow it until it becomes developed and

170
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:52,529
what am i lawyer tell me it's better be

171
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,580
the leading edge than the bleeding edge

172
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:56,109
and so I think that that's how you

173
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:58,269
really approach it I think that really

174
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,740
points to the importance of if you

175
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:01,870
really want to make a great product

176
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,400
allow yourself the product development

177
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,530
cycle to do it I mean so many people

178
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,789
they're in a rush to get them to market

179
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:08,379
because they need to get revenue or to

180
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,310
satisfy to investors so they need to

181
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:11,110
make their house payment you know

182
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:13,509
whatever it is a lot of people are

183
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,550
rushing product to market and they

184
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,870
haven't done a short run to make sure

185
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,250
it's a properly like they just assume

186
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,899
and then they jump ahead people are

187
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,860
doing this with packaging now too but

188
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:22,810
but if you want to make something

189
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,730
excellent stretch out that product

190
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,829
development process and have a clear

191
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,129
idea what is you're trying to do you

192
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:31,408
know you if you look at Apple when

193
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,088
and Jobs came back to Apple they were

194
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:34,678
they had hundreds of ideas that he

195
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:38,069
looked at and he narrowed it down to

196
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:39,329
basically iPhone iPod he cut out we cut

197
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:40,830
everything out what those things and he

198
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:42,658
said everybody focused these are the

199
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:46,649
things that have a validity that have a

200
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:48,028
reality and I have the ability to say

201
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:50,968
that I think this will work from my

202
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:52,800
prior history and so you have to be able

203
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:55,288
to honestly ask yourself do you have

204
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,209
that vision in your field so obviously I

205
00:06:55,288 --> 00:06:59,639
know nothing about electronics but in

206
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:01,079
cannabis I I feel that I understand the

207
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,429
market well enough to say this is

208
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,068
something that is not that attractive

209
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:06,448
and I don't see the value and this is

210
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,759
something that I believe is highly

211
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,199
attractive and I see the value and that

212
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,490
way it allows you now to figure out how

213
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,038
do we optimize it because it took us

214
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,869
another year to figure out the picking

215
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:17,278
time at the creme brulee because the

216
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,679
first year we took it about five or six

217
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:21,360
days later than I took it the year this

218
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:23,038
at the subsequent year and they were

219
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,369
different profiles one of them was

220
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,899
sharper harder less aromatic and then

221
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:30,419
when we picked it a little bit earlier

222
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:33,028
we dialed in the curve a little bit less

223
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:36,808
than perfect on the flower resulted in a

224
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:38,908
far more active concentrate live and

225
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:41,039
that's where I found the sweet spot and

226
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:42,688
that sweet spot is you just honestly to

227
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,788
yourself into your crew that you work

228
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:47,369
with let's just do product test and say

229
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:50,728
are we satisfied and are we satisfied

230
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:52,679
and why are we satisfied and do we think

231
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:54,899
it could be better or do we think we it

232
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:57,418
could be worse and that way you start to

233
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:59,069
honestly shape this process because a

234
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:00,748
lot of it is you just want to feel good

235
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:02,098
and you want to say we do great but a

236
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:03,809
lot of times you have to say you know I

237
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:06,418
don't think this is what we wanted and

238
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:08,129
then you have to take another cycle to

239
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:09,508
dial it and if you can't then you

240
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:11,249
realize that's what it is

241
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:12,629
and with breeders you know they might go

242
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:14,099
down the road two or three years on a

243
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:15,599
line and realize that there's nothing

244
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:17,968
here they have to go all the way back

245
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,128
and go down another road and that

246
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:22,498
dedication to it over time is I think

247
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:24,479
where you get the success in a stability

248
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:26,519
of a product because what you do is you

249
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,709
really find stuff that resonates with

250
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:30,300
the customer that works well for you if

251
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,300
they don't intersect you're you're

252
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,340
really gonna do poorly

253
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,500
the customer loves it but you can't grow

254
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,269
it at your property and you love to grow

255
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,980
it but no one wants to buy it neither

256
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:40,840
one of those extremes work there has to

257
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,389
be some little Venn diagram in the

258
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,580
middle where it touches and and that's

259
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:48,399
the part of R&amp;D that's needed that you

260
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:51,480
really connect grow ability work ability

261
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,480
sell ability
