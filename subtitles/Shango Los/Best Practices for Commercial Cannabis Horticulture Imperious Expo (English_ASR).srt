standards so we've got a fantastic

61
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,639
while my panel today and we're going to

62
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,560
going to chat about 40 minutes and then

63
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,869
take about 10-15 minutes of questions

64
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,360
and then we'll be complete so we're

65
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,650
going to start at the far end with a

66
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,180
question for Ryan and then and then

67
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,569
everyone else will have an opportunity

68
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,569
to weigh in their their opinions as well

69
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:49,259
so the right you know what is a common

70
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:51,780
error that can be avoided when scaling

71
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:53,969
up from a prohibition-era sized

72
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,209
Bravo of let's say about 100 blooming

73
00:02:53,969 --> 00:03:01,639
plants to a very large licensed

74
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,640
commercial cannabis grow forecast

75
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:10,670
here but your illegitimate decorum and

76
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:12,500
understanding that basically you're not

77
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:16,159
dealing with say several hundred square

78
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,229
feet but now I do work with disabilities

79
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,120
and you multiply work in Canada as

80
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:22,729
consulting that like I do work with

81
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:28,819
facilities that are in the tens of

82
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:31,870
people arranged and so the information

83
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:34,939
of the taxes that you do life before

84
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,420
especially once we get into what I call

85
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:40,729
a high tech or high intensity range it

86
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:42,979
just amplifies itself done you can do

87
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:45,109
some of the similar classes that you

88
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:48,049
usually a small production but now you

89
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:49,550
have to understand that especially with

90
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,969
the companies I'm working for they're

91
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:56,570
looking for very high yield in the

92
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:59,379
shortest period of time and in Canada

93
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:02,870
the federal government regulates all

94
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:04,729
medical marijuana production so we also

95
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:10,580
have to answer to the federal government

96
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:14,449
and my my job basically is is again to

97
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:17,209
then we hold the ideas of cultural

98
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:19,879
practices include very expensive

99
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:22,430
environmental practices practices that

100
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,500
are going to create the highest yield

101
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:30,620
with the best quality in a shorter

102
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:32,930
period of time but a gtu this so the

103
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,819
dude the question is when scaling up

104
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,269
from a probationary over on a hundred

105
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:40,339
plan to a large license grow what are

106
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:42,949
the common errors that you can see being

107
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:45,500
avoided with little forethought so one

108
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:48,050
of the big issues that I come across

109
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,209
and be quite frequently is a proper

110
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,550
planning in planning starts the

111
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:54,799
beginning with your business development

112
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,230
understanding what I can achieve this

113
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,020
motivation so you're trying to damage

114
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,270
are you establishing a facility that is

115
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:04,099
going to produce as much as possible

116
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:06,439
are you selling facility that's going

117
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,750
for the highest quality are you having a

118
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,430
research facility so understanding what

119
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,100
your motive is and what your business

120
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,259
practices extremely important first step

121
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,650
it's not what you begin to plan your

122
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:20,180
neck a bit that planning you know many

123
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:22,849
different ways to make know what your

124
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,160
business model so depending on whether

125
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,740
you're going indoors outdoors greenhouse

126
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,500
so understanding your in developing your

127
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,490
business model with really high strength

128
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,139
at the beginning is really important

129
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:41,210
yeah all this does not refer to slam

130
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:44,389
medals it also having proper procedures

131
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:47,239
and processes in order or even going

132
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:55,479
really important because if you have

133
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:58,610
issues and problems sorry about that

134
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,210
okay if you have if you're trying to

135
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,030
deal with problems of small

136
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:04,888
their deployments intensify and get

137
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,750
larger when you try and upscale

138
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:11,759
so if you have your processes in order

139
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,918
and like you said next we have a role in

140
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,770
this in this factors and knowing which

141
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:19,109
direction your companies to develop for

142
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:21,719
is a really good idea because some how

143
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:26,100
many focus mostly on edibles on focused

144
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,590
on low Sun will do concentrating for the

145
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,129
plethora and so if you know a stretch of

146
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:34,978
your going and you have those processes

147
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:37,829
yes actually idea that that you have a

148
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:39,538
column that is small and your small grow

149
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:42,719
when you scale it up your problems are

150
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:45,959
likely going to scale up as well yeah so

151
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,949
Kate Rivera um so commercial monitor

152
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:52,379
crops of all kind at past issues because

153
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,280
of its lack of biodiversity and and

154
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,860
other predators

155
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,379
what is the suggestion you have for

156
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,250
commercial growers to avoid losing whole

157
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,939
props attack yeah that's a difficult one

158
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,658
for everybody

159
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:11,639
so the Canada plan is one of the first

160
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:14,250
plants mobile deployment varietals grow

161
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,500
have a environment the lineages of

162
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,240
webbing plan come from are in numerous

163
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,098
different areas with with numerous

164
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,168
different environments so knowing your

165
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:23,120
screen knowing what's going into those

166
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:26,329
rain

167
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,569
important the number one most important

168
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:31,550
thing is is pest management being

169
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:34,399
proactive as opposed to reactive is

170
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,290
always the best approach to it having

171
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,228
the pest management programs where you

172
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,900
act like you have at Nvidia you don't

173
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:44,079
take care of your client health is going

174
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:46,728
to say you look for success longer group

175
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,198
missions a monoculture crops that's a

176
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:50,478
tough one there's a lot of people that

177
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,370
they I bet this variety and I can

178
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:55,310
produce X amount of counter for life I'm

179
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,649
gonna go for it what happens is that

180
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,300
wonder writing kind of digress is

181
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:01,189
genetically a little bit like you have

182
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,439
nothing to back yourself up with so the

183
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,629
first to find your genetic diversifying

184
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,819
them in a way where you're understanding

185
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:10,009
those genetics before you put them into

186
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:11,629
a population before your timing on them

187
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:14,360
for production is really key

188
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:16,189
I think a lot of people go for it the 50

189
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,500
trades for the hundred strains and they

190
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:20,660
lose focus on what nice rains are doing

191
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,610
become extremely hard a tough one to

192
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,919
figure out what are my strains

193
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,689
benefiting from or what it what am i

194
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:28,579
hitting my trainings but so in my

195
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:30,860
opinion pest management starts to the

196
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:32,929
mini and it's always something like a

197
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,570
need to be reevaluate and you know what

198
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,519
strains map we we have about 30

199
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,200
different strains that are our facility

200
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,649
in each one of those trainings we have

201
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,129
two humans

202
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:49,448
program we primarily use predatorial

203
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:52,569
insects our main motive defense as well

204
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:54,969
as other natural my go insecticide

205
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:57,278
bacterias and whatnot so learning how

206
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,410
the responses of the plant are each of

207
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,149
these methods is really important more

208
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:02,618
data you collect the better your

209
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:04,269
programs going to become how about a

210
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:06,278
thorough my question before we move on

211
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:10,600
JD so you said that one of the good

212
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:13,899
ideas into issue of work as if you have

213
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,959
a hesitancy in infestation now to

214
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:19,269
prevent it and then when you describe

215
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:23,169
your palate of preventives

216
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:26,499
you had both you know pesticide grades

217
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:28,838
but also that Vincent I'm assuming that

218
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:32,079
when you're talking about planning ahead

219
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,720
you don't mean spraying when there are

220
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:37,208
tests you're talking about more leaning

221
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,369
on beneficial insects because you really

222
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:41,018
probably don't want to add chemicals

223
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:42,819
that children necessary that do you have

224
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:44,769
correct interpretation that's true well

225
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:46,808
when I mentioned sensitize a lot of

226
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:49,119
people get this idea of chemicals that

227
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:51,519
identifies just anything that combats

228
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:55,949
that they can be a micro insecticides of

229
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,720
using fungi using bacteria using calcium

230
00:09:55,948 --> 00:10:00,338
enriching your plants to be healthy so

231
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,009
that way the bugs don't want to attack

232
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:05,199
you that's the most important right it's

233
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:07,298
okay and at the same original question

234
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:10,708
what suggestions you have for commercial

235
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:12,480
growers of scaling and tactician

236
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:15,949
preventive maintenance

237
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,779
you're number one

238
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:20,790
Nellie kind of having a protocol set up

239
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:24,089
prior student having plans you

240
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:28,339
personally probably that idea I heard

241
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:34,259
were enormous into Judaism outdoors and

242
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:37,680
we have scrubs we have your net here

243
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:39,210
your medicine so try to implement those

244
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,609
things in the beginning and making it a

245
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,560
habit just really easy to get going and

246
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:48,570
then as a lot part and humanistic

247
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:50,699
practices on the back end and also one

248
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,310
thing that was hard for us in the

249
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,410
beginning we were expanding on the

250
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:58,709
ground of that we were submerged right

251
00:10:55,409 --> 00:11:01,559
in the middle of top view and so getting

252
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:04,200
to know like what agricultural problems

253
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,389
are already close to your facility or in

254
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:11,100
your area is really important because

255
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:15,480
don't know about you'll know what's kind

256
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:20,040
of expected what exposures yet also like

257
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,930
Katie said preventive influences

258
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:24,299
preventative sisters also like a

259
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:26,549
companion plan so if you have outdoor

260
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:29,069
grow you know look into what you can

261
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:30,569
plant see some of our antibiotic

262
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:34,050
relationships with the plants

263
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:40,010
of them grill healthier from giant while

264
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:40,009
different kinds of by our management and

265
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,700
I think that if you start off that way

266
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:48,929
you'll have a better chance

267
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,610
I think that idea of knowing your

268
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:53,509
neighborhood is really insightful

269
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:56,370
because a lot of this thing that the

270
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:57,779
neighborhood of our grow ends either at

271
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,269
the walls the greenhouse or the

272
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:03,209
warehouse or at the fence line but it's

273
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:05,370
just not the case where I'm from in in

274
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:08,190
Washington on Vashon Island one of the

275
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:11,070
time that we run into a lot is a terior

276
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,900
mold called botrytis which here in

277
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,720
Arizona that you can see a lot less of

278
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,610
that so wonderfully dry and great

279
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,230
growing environment but one of the

280
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,800
Pacific Northwest we get retraced a lot

281
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:25,259
and you know answers speaking to some

282
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,569
experts on this in the area about why we

283
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,149
have such bad woods right another like

284
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:34,020
well yeah sure it's cold and you got a

285
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:36,809
wet knife and Misty foggy morning now

286
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:39,240
really it's the one field down in Oregon

287
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:41,939
and will look like and they explained

288
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,909
that to make late bottle vintage

289
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,080
Riesling in Oregon they actually spray

290
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:49,019
boat rightist

291
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,210
on the grapes and so that degrades

292
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,909
shrivel faster well that makes its way

293
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:57,450
blowing up to Washington and so being

294
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:59,219
aware of what what is in your

295
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:03,000
environment that could be adding X

296
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:06,360
variables to your bro is very important

297
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,279
well so so Casey on this end we will

298
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,180
start with you on the next question so

299
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,379
and and teach Rivera already

300
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:15,259
touched on this a little bit we're going

301
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:17,809
to go farther down we have so many new

302
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:19,580
Rovers start with a wide variety of

303
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:21,969
cultivars because they want to grow

304
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:25,060
something for every taste in the market

305
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:28,490
and while others focus on just a few

306
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:31,849
cultivars and focus on growing those

307
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:34,180
effectively how do you balance that for

308
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:37,519
yourself and commercial level between

309
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:39,979
having enough varieties for the market

310
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,409
but also not having there be so much

311
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,330
variety that you can't tend to each

312
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:48,889
specific cultivar needs specifically

313
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:51,370
right so we have followed the 30 to 40

314
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:53,769
strains our facility right now which

315
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,269
which is kind of heavy

316
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:59,649
we're trying to narrow it down what I

317
00:13:56,269 --> 00:14:04,340
think is probably a better approach for

318
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:07,639
like our our market is having you know

319
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,649
five six seven flagship something that

320
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,240
you can own in the market something that

321
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,459
you're really really really successful

322
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,490
at growing if you were going to want to

323
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,680
come back for a good idea and then also

324
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,450
having enough straighten your back

325
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:23,959
pocket that if you do lose genetic

326
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:27,230
diversity are taking your genetics

327
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:29,450
starts to degrade over time and you can

328
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,600
have something that you're working with

329
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,560
to pull out and replace it or have time

330
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,830
to

331
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:45,049
that it but you know cloning and making

332
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:47,960
them stronger in kasya

333
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:50,569
the nail on the head with that the more

334
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,310
you diversify your strain database the

335
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,400
more you have to pay attention to a tree

336
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:57,649
and that starts to begin knowing what

337
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,120
your lineage of restraining are can do a

338
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:00,528
better indication on how they're going

339
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,769
to grow the problems that you're going

340
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:05,778
to see with them one thing that we do in

341
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,970
here but one is we really are close to

342
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:11,509
what the market obviously we don't just

343
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:13,250
grow blue dreams and og we really kind

344
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:14,990
of as well as we want to shake the

345
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,669
market with what we find is a good

346
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,339
genetic able we're breeding ourselves

347
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:21,439
but also coming out with good variety is

348
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:23,420
a really solid variety that the market

349
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,360
actually want as well too so we work

350
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:28,639
really closely with all our partners

351
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,070
expenses our extraction company to find

352
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,169
out what's working and at that point we

353
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:36,800
figure out how best to grow a crop

354
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:39,019
specifically or what that market so

355
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,120
there's a lot of ways we can shape the

356
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:42,289
market and there's a lot of ways that we

357
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,539
need to be listening to the market

358
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:47,809
responding not understanding that the

359
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:49,338
song is a six month for a year out you

360
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:51,259
have you have to continue paying

361
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,460
attention to what your genetics are

362
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:54,080
doing where they're going

363
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,639
one thing that we've done is we

364
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,759
separated our genetics into three

365
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,588
categories we have age decency the a is

366
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,629
our our string that we can really sell a

367
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:07,420
lot so those are going to be naturally

368
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:09,759
Remus the bees are the ones that sort of

369
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:11,979
self but maybe are through that harder

370
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,710
to grow and so we'll place those on an

371
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,210
every other cruising type recycle and if

372
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,889
these are kind of more of our research

373
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,470
strength strain that we're really trying

374
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:22,210
to work on to develop for the market but

375
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,528
it's not quite there yet so you

376
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:26,080
obviously don't want to put your seeds

377
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:28,720
in pretty 100 pounds of those one of

378
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,879
those in a smaller area really through

379
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,470
miliion and experts and then bring us

380
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:40,809
arguably acceptable i do canada

381
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:44,950
completion basically of different

382
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:48,459
strains but we do concentrate on a

383
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:52,170
hybrid that is going to give us more

384
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:54,460
veining a medicinal classification

385
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:56,889
because the government does regulate

386
00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:01,930
that so we are looking at being the

387
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:04,029
total percent THC content the CBDs maybe

388
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:06,220
we're looking there and were looking for

389
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:08,289
strain so in the greenhouse which you'll

390
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,720
see is you'll see meaning for forty two

391
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:13,420
or three major strains and that's

392
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,360
basically because it's dictated by the

393
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:19,179
pharmaceutical industry in Canada we

394
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,039
don't even have to spend except for DC

395
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:24,429
which can get away with a lot of things

396
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:29,079
we we don't have to spend again because

397
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:33,670
it's just of being legalized so so most

398
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:36,609
of our strains are stupid

399
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:39,070
most of our strains are based on one

400
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:41,619
being are the medicinal industry is

401
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:43,189
going to be requested you know I can

402
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:46,339
imagine how the business

403
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,710
in Canada the variety would be something

404
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:50,419
that will be mimicked because you know

405
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,579
in the end you can only cleave so many

406
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,110
people but but from the horticultural

407
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:56,779
side I would think that'd be a real

408
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:58,939
pleasant a pleasant thing if your

409
00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:00,589
responsibility to keep these friends

410
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,019
live and you really only have two

411
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:05,269
varieties you can get into such intimate

412
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:07,849
relationship with them instead of 40

413
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:12,139
plants that I can't imagine that there

414
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:14,269
be a lot pleasure in that my work like I

415
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,730
am of time physiologist so my work has

416
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:19,069
always been this to basically look at

417
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:22,700
for instance requirements that the

418
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:25,369
different strains how we unfold so many

419
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:28,730
leaves in a short period of time to get

420
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:31,429
us into that state 6870 date flowering

421
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,170
period even looking for now strains that

422
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,930
are going to go below the sixty eight

423
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:38,630
sixty day work on that so there's still

424
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:41,299
if for me it's always great to read the

425
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:44,660
periodicals on on the different strings

426
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:47,329
on the blendings to see where where we

427
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:50,540
get into whether it kneeling an 8020

428
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:53,329
indica sativa vice versa that type of

429
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:55,339
thing that that's what makes the world

430
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:58,339
go round for me yes I'm just being

431
00:18:55,339 --> 00:19:00,470
infallible and then again going to be

432
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:02,909
paying attention to

433
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,740
as extremely important you're talking

434
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,870
about genetic drift more you

435
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,509
mass-produced and clone up clone on

436
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:12,329
clone we're evolving these plants so

437
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:14,429
gravity more rapidly than most other

438
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:16,529
fine programs out there so paying

439
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:18,780
attention to these variables that can

440
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:21,210
cause a tricks here sometimes towards

441
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:22,950
the positive commence towards a negative

442
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,048
so pay attention to those and what might

443
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:30,480
be causing this expression to come out

444
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:33,418
really important so keep kicking your

445
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,519
very servic you and this ability that

446
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:38,400
you remember talking about yesterday so

447
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,558
indoor growers and any municipality did

448
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,330
find or worse because they're unable to

449
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,908
control the smell all the blooming

450
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:49,829
plants what suggestions you have for

451
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:51,390
trying to keep those smells indoors we

452
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:58,558
convinced our neighbors that artists own

453
00:19:51,390 --> 00:20:01,380
cars that's a really tough way to do is

454
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:04,019
only under operation depending on if

455
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,620
you're doing it changes I'll sealed your

456
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:09,658
environments are there's numerous

457
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:12,239
technologies that you can use we quickly

458
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:14,159
yesterday about h2o2 plasma generators

459
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,220
that basically change the structure of

460
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,809
things in the air and gave odors

461
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,909
charcoal filtration another thing that

462
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:23,038
we do within our rooms is we watch our

463
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:25,650
negative deposited pressures so there's

464
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,269
nothing leaving the room our rooms are

465
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,710
pressurized to the point to where things

466
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:31,819
are staying in

467
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:35,130
we can move really really close

468
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:36,808
monitoring of where that air goes we're

469
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,580
constantly moving around our facilities

470
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:42,269
checking our HVAC unit and checking any

471
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:45,240
kind of exhaust and personnel our arm is

472
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:48,119
in a rural zone so the complaining isn't

473
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,099
too much but you know it's possible that

474
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:52,769
one person does not like the song as

475
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:54,839
well for some reason and you really have

476
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:57,329
to do everything it cost again it goes

477
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:00,418
beyond the programs as well do your

478
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:03,210
trimming your production your tire rooms

479
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:04,409
all those parts of the facility are

480
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,899
really things that you need to think

481
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:12,299
about in your other mitigation right yep

482
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:15,658
we haven't known the option of just

483
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:18,269
setting up facilities into urban areas

484
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:21,630
of the world they basically have to be

485
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:25,259
set up as far as away from any type of

486
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:29,789
residential area and we do use rubbers

487
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:32,788
and we do use heads of overt emitters

488
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:36,058
but it's not really a problem because

489
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:41,369
gel don't have out we're so proud it's

490
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:43,589
like in Uganda if a a farmer 175 he's

491
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:46,558
not allowed to be within 100 miles of

492
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:48,928
any any area because of the big order

493
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:51,089
so I guess perhaps it's best to find a

494
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:53,009
farm and then some a new facility

495
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:56,569
because then you can't differentiate

496
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:56,569
between the south sooner or later

497
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,150
don't want either so you don't have a

498
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:05,279
lot of visitors coming here you're

499
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:09,840
injured you're way out Manila's no

500
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:12,420
litter I would just add you know know

501
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,869
your know your community don't be afraid

502
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,558
to go out there and make friends and

503
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:19,589
tell them ahead of time

504
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:22,579
Mavis what's going on if I come over to

505
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:26,189
see your facility talk to you top tier

506
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:29,849
community officials and see you what

507
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:31,230
they feel is how you know how about a

508
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,419
new beginning isn't you're better

509
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,279
prepared and you can budget it in in

510
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,550
there the other stuff walks you with

511
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:42,029
your charcoal filtration their deposits

512
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:43,440
pressures there you can set up you know

513
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:45,359
the HEPA filters which are really

514
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,789
expensive and don't all day clock with a

515
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,799
flip odor control and then there's

516
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:53,639
there's bio filter skew that they're

517
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:55,349
doing some work on which are not yet you

518
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,400
know to go to but somebody's definitely

519
00:22:55,349 --> 00:23:01,709
keep a nice I think that the idea of

520
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,920
community outreach and involvement

521
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,990
cannot be understated as well I mean

522
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,690
every one of us who owns it works at a

523
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:11,880
cannabis company is a is a

524
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,549
representative of our industry as a

525
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,460
whole and we have to remember that for

526
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:19,769
you know past sixty years or so we've

527
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,079
all been demonized because of the

528
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:24,750
unfortunate political and popularity of

529
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,449
plant that we all love so much and so

530
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:30,509
you know they expect us to be you know

531
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,970
and she unclean folks who are mean and

532
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:35,279
now we're talking to right but but

533
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,679
that's how you intend to get so much of

534
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,629
this community pushback when when you

535
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,710
show up at your neighbors did you

536
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,000
freaking welcome somebody in the

537
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,769
neighborhood yeah

538
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,900
you don't need to bring one chain but

539
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:47,670
you know you show up there you know and

540
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,080
you're smiling and you're you're saying

541
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,789
that you're here and you're nice and

542
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:53,220
you're glad to be them and invited over

543
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:55,680
for you know tour so they can check it

544
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,000
out that kind of openness and when they

545
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,549
see you know these are three very

546
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,039
friendly looking humans here right this

547
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:04,769
is going to tend to decrease their

548
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:06,480
barriers to society that your vendor

549
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:08,879
nice folks and that they don't want to

550
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,569
go call the local councilman and talk

551
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:16,140
trash about you yeah really good we even

552
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:18,779
take the time to have not on silica

553
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:23,040
content but we will have a community

554
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:26,519
night and we talk about why we're

555
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:29,490
actually growing medicinal and really

556
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:32,490
try to educate we try to educate the

557
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:35,759
community or just people and chart and

558
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:37,680
see less a Braverman abrasiveness coming

559
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,779
back to us and with the pull up you're

560
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:43,019
standing that this just isn't a

561
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:46,079
community we're affecting a medicinal

562
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:50,250
industry of all ages of young children

563
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:53,639
of people everyone that means no and I

564
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:58,319
think we're starting to break a lot into

565
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:00,570
good media thanks for a lot of magazines

566
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,480
that are really putting a lot of effort

567
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:06,970
into that now to show that we're not

568
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,839
here we are there for a purpose familiar

569
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:13,690
Yeah right right minute exactly the

570
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:16,990
issue has been education we've all been

571
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:19,630
educated one way for so long in evolving

572
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:23,079
that lack of education in my opinion is

573
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:25,510
a set you know and I promise not that

574
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:28,419
all of us do it everyone involved in and

575
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:31,089
I hold in the industry as well as I call

576
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:34,950
in a community up to all the communities

577
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:37,569
reach out to our local legislators our

578
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,519
laundry facilities as well as our

579
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:41,769
neighbors to really help educate and one

580
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:46,750
what this client is doing the world and

581
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:48,369
what we can do so I think that you know

582
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:52,359
if you want to get a whole bunch of

583
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:54,609
growers to kind of like engage in really

584
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,149
ruthless debate like at a house party or

585
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:56,500
something

586
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,570
you could have someone a few questions

587
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,789
the first one is which is better indoor

588
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:05,349
or outdoor this is what everybody feel

589
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:07,269
itchy out of it but the other blood and

590
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:09,399
is also fun for pushing buttons is this

591
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:12,029
next question start with you Casey

592
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,530
so you'll grow over shoes there favorite

593
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:17,529
substrate to grow in for a variety of

594
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:20,039
reasons but but it all gets very

595
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:22,450
specific when you have to scale up to

596
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:25,299
large-scale industrial commercial

597
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,430
growing so so Casey when's your

598
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:29,440
preferred substrate for commercial use

599
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:32,620
and why right so this is something that

600
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,789
we've been tackling recently we were

601
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:35,789
basically it really

602
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:47,288
and at that time we're spending about

603
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:50,019
$120,000 a year on substrates and so we

604
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:53,679
were using a lot of chelated nutrients

605
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:56,200
and whatnot so what we found is that by

606
00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:00,070
switching to a recycle organic-looking

607
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,830
select oil we're able cut off reuse our

608
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:06,389
oils there's no film ended where you

609
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:09,639
need to leave the feature class a lot of

610
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:12,210
organic living material when you create

611
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,370
this this perfect environment to grow

612
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:18,038
beneficial bacteria and fungi and

613
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:21,069
basically just remove the plant you put

614
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:24,009
a do one in and you know you're cutting

615
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:27,158
down on th you know testing pH in your

616
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:29,669
soil making sure that it's has a

617
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,049
sufficient level for nutrient uptake and

618
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:34,600
you know you're not messing with dirty

619
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:38,400
reservoirs they have to clean all the

620
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:41,740
time so to support pop propositional so

621
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:46,390
that that's one of the things that you

622
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:49,620
really need to consider in my opinion it

623
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:54,280
is a little bit of a touchy subject but

624
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:56,319
anyway what I critical particles are

625
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:57,519
majority but I think that there is

626
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,369
really good information

627
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,319
one item down great alcohol - a

628
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:05,018
phenomenal six so high

629
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,849
article one called Denton haven't highly

630
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:10,750
effective platforms and I had a lot of

631
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:14,199
really good information about beneficial

632
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:16,720
in the soil and then also another

633
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,590
article on growing for maximum flavor

634
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,038
and then a book talking with micro yeah

635
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:27,009
team with my little brother

636
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:31,269
so sobriety takes me that yeah I have to

637
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:34,179
go to it the large industry they look at

638
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:37,419
just a feed like mix and I'm supposed to

639
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:41,350
be selling beef early mint but the other

640
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:46,330
Nappanee it's like you say is coming up

641
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:52,199
with a good organic next I would usually

642
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:55,839
then every year I would add a third new

643
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:58,840
that mix only to get the biomass worth

644
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:01,209
we figured biomass can get quickly after

645
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:03,548
a while and insults note sometimes the

646
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,558
matter so if you've done a flush and you

647
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:08,168
reject it because it's totally organic

648
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:13,808
you have to understand that all your

649
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:16,509
organic feeds me the biomass microbes to

650
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:21,819
break them down into an elemental source

651
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:24,669
of nutrient but I always find still life

652
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:27,099
look at what I would do I removed that

653
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:29,259
way but then I have to work with large

654
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:33,009
announce whether you use a peat perlite

655
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:35,230
they would use Michael rising in it but

656
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:38,349
they don't use a lot of arguments they

657
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:41,980
use like inorganic salts and they go

658
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:44,740
happen to the older to be investors who

659
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,009
are saying we want this year we want to

660
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,740
dispatch for short periods at nine

661
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:52,950
would you do so we have both I work with

662
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,900
both sides full-time chemistry before

663
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,450
you go I just want to point out there

664
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:00,450
hop in grind answer with a new awesome

665
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:05,819
grower just you know man you got baby

666
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:09,690
bio mass that's Nextel around you go to

667
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:12,269
your dolphin go straight go straight in

668
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,919
basically tool depending on your

669
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:16,410
business calls pending on what your

670
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,770
outcome is you can use any variety of

671
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:21,840
strength personally we go with your

672
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:23,579
denim exploit wearing Indo farm as well

673
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:25,259
we do have to do have this made you

674
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:27,629
throw a little bit outdoors but worry

675
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:29,910
indoors as well and we use a

676
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:31,860
regenerative oil approach we worked with

677
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,900
a local company that builds our soils

678
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:36,479
based off of the recommendation that I

679
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,790
give in the blend that I have they

680
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,410
regenerated for us three complicated

681
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:42,690
bring it back we've developed a really

682
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:44,669
good program yeah we could do this

683
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:46,259
in-house but right now we don't have the

684
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:47,910
time or space Olivia

685
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:50,220
so we outsource that to a local company

686
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:53,040
that work directly with on each of our

687
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,990
one we don't just have one room we don't

688
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,909
just have one vegetative plant and that

689
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:59,490
goes into learning your plant each

690
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:01,140
specific variety life a little bit

691
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,000
different things and I needed to up

692
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,549
lament that with a nutrient

693
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,919
the whole year of getting your plants

694
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:10,710
that beneficial right off the bat in

695
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,090
that resistance is a great approach one

696
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,429
of the terms that I hear a lot is a

697
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:16,829
drain away and a lot of people feel like

698
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:19,110
the soil is okay we're running off well

699
00:31:16,829 --> 00:31:20,908
honestly you're optimizing your facility

700
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:23,428
and you're not going to be any water

701
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:26,640
what kind of redevelop that term into it

702
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:29,370
is it BTUs and one thing that we do is

703
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,610
we pay close attention to how that place

704
00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:34,619
is reacting how many water feeding how

705
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:36,298
much nutrients were applying to it and

706
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:39,178
that we were able to adjust our

707
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:41,038
scheduling as well as our partner client

708
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:43,230
being feed everything

709
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,990
optimally so we don't having trained

710
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:48,120
away there is ZERO wire that comes out

711
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:51,450
of our facility that is not used by the

712
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:53,759
plan there are benefits to using other

713
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:56,340
types of growing methods we use

714
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,900
aeroponics and all our cloning just

715
00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:00,449
because that's what our schedule allows

716
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,190
best work takes a lot of space save a

717
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,259
lot of time and if you're doing it right

718
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:07,890
increase of really healthy brew system

719
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:10,109
very fast starting the vegetative mode

720
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,600
which California research in our blooms

721
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:15,000
we use the regenerative soil and paying

722
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,678
attention to your soil is key one thing

723
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,619
that we do is we get our feet surface

724
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,538
are we tested so we can see our biology

725
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:23,339
going on roadies our element our

726
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:25,829
interval going on the lake surface we

727
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:28,529
also test our soil as well too because

728
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:30,298
the soil when it comes in so we need get

729
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:33,359
a big fine on the welcome what are sort

730
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:36,929
of looking like not just mineral oil but

731
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:38,729
imperialize we also set the performance

732
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:40,740
of plant and if our plants are unhealthy

733
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,329
as well too we'll do soil tests because

734
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,069
that's really going to tell you what's

735
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:45,138
going on

736
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:47,538
like do I have a weak magnesium

737
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:50,058
deficiency or am i giving it too much

738
00:32:47,538 --> 00:32:51,648
health you blocking out my magnesium so

739
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:53,898
paying attention to your soil pay

740
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:56,928
attention to your coal yours pay

741
00:32:53,898 --> 00:32:59,869
attention to your plans really ties back

742
00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:01,700
to that they dig but it really goes from

743
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:04,308
start to finish in this new your

744
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:07,159
operation you can do is sustainable you

745
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:09,408
soil the daily hydroponic sustainably

746
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:13,278
they comes back to what kind of business

747
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:17,570
are you creating for yourself just one

748
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:20,750
thing I that is I always look at the

749
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:24,500
percent duration in the minutes

750
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:26,778
basically we always sell oxygen short

751
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,690
events but say if I have a mix that's

752
00:33:26,778 --> 00:33:32,148
too tight and I can't get rid of the

753
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:35,090
that order the system can get rid of the

754
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:37,518
excess for free water that's filling all

755
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:41,000
the large pores which should only be

756
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,798
filled with after watering oxygen people

757
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,250
understand how important oxygen is

758
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:49,278
oxygen is at replenishing villages we

759
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:52,099
call them Bolger receptors I can get

760
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:53,659
oxygen my next can get rid of all of its

761
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:57,019
excess water in less than three hours

762
00:33:53,659 --> 00:34:00,200
can get oxygen back in there a lot of

763
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:03,109
your minerals or elements are basically

764
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,360
looking for Oh to to group the group

765
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:09,440
into to move into the plant places fast

766
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:12,799
so there is a speed for that also too I

767
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,588
have to promote myself and that's a lot

768
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:19,190
of Boston I get a lot of mediators we

769
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:21,039
have a lot of these so-called space Neri

770
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,710
that hold on

771
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:25,779
but you want to look for all those roots

772
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,579
that keep on subdividing small group

773
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,070
through years

774
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:32,019
95% of water and nutrient taken up by

775
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,280
plants picking up through those little

776
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:37,389
goo FairTax

777
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:41,139
so it's by getting a lot of repairs we

778
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:43,809
didn't reach the root surface area by 20

779
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:45,639
to 30 percent meaning that so anytime

780
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:48,549
you put something through there whether

781
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:50,620
it's just eh offered water or nutrients

782
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:53,080
in that you've created a root surface

783
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:55,359
area so that your nutrients you have

784
00:34:53,079 --> 00:35:01,239
much more diffuse not going through as

785
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:04,090
leaching but going optical time in with

786
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:05,919
that is paying attention to that thing

787
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:08,050
in the light to your soil that's

788
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,740
actually feeding your plant is really

789
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,660
important

790
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:13,449
are we creating an environment for our

791
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:17,019
bacteria is our rhizosphere healthy is

792
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:19,179
it active is it producing for our planet

793
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:21,900
is it giving our plants the beneficials

794
00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:24,210
that it needs 16

795
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,880
that oxygen is what's keeping the

796
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:30,630
bacteria alive and healthy creating an

797
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,090
anaerobic soil systems a really tough

798
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,519
thing and people get psyllium wilt a lot

799
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:40,019
of pathogens to come out of that

800
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:42,179
knocking atmosphere so it's okay to keep

801
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:43,170
repair while you're on life restart this

802
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:45,809
next question with you

803
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,820
so some growers build their entire grow

804
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:50,250
or on the style of watering that they

805
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,920
intend to do well many of the solutions

806
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:55,500
used in smaller grows simply do not stay

807
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,240
tail up to commercial use so what is a

808
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,190
watering solution that you believe is a

809
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:03,539
good one for consideration by new

810
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:06,269
tenants producers that's a good one I'd

811
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:07,829
hear of a boy oh we started out with we

812
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:10,679
have a lot of new partners on the team

813
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:11,940
and and I'm an educator I really like

814
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:13,649
teaching people I don't just like

815
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,980
telling people how to do it I like them

816
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:18,960
inquiries on their own and if they don't

817
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,360
of the wheel to the barn

818
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,909
we started out and watering everything

819
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,530
in and our facility we have over 7,000

820
00:36:23,909 --> 00:36:28,289
plants so if you can imagine the time it

821
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:30,780
takes to hand water 7,000 plant or what

822
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:33,630
that is to educated all of our partners

823
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,820
on what's the soil saturation rate what

824
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,470
is the plant doing paying attention to

825
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,840
the plant while you're watering and how

826
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:41,699
much is going in there it kind of

827
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,380
connects you a little bit the plants are

828
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,239
connected to us and the more we connect

829
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,390
ourselves with those plants the more we

830
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:50,199
pay attention

831
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:52,989
they need recently we shifted into a hog

832
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:55,058
native drift system which right now

833
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:57,219
we're on about version 3.5 business

834
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:59,109
that's how it goes there's no perfect

835
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:01,149
plug-and-play system everything kind of

836
00:36:59,108 --> 00:37:03,420
need to get designed by your own but

837
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:06,099
we've developed a brutha drip system

838
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:09,099
after learning these metrics after

839
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:11,019
learning exactly what our plans need by

840
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:12,609
hand watering them we've developed we've

841
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:14,709
been able to move that into our drip

842
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:16,358
system and been very successful at not

843
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:18,490
only minimizing our time that it takes

844
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:20,949
demands of human hours at a pace of

845
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:22,689
water your experience your system but

846
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:24,338
also excessively getting the plant

847
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:27,309
exactly what it means

848
00:37:24,338 --> 00:37:29,558
every time I can't count to 30 seconds

849
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:31,510
of a thirty second that brine maker make

850
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:33,700
a TV cam so telling someone getting a

851
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,950
twenty seconds I may count twenty like a

852
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:38,409
bartender or I made count twenty as a

853
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:40,808
one thousand two one thousand so having

854
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:43,088
a system to where it's exactly the same

855
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:45,130
every time and then understanding what

856
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:46,778
your points are doing are they opinion

857
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,028
are they not of taking it

858
00:37:46,778 --> 00:37:51,250
do I need water every other day so

859
00:37:49,028 --> 00:37:55,929
knowing that really helped dial and

860
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:58,329
optimize your your water yeah I agree I

861
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:59,710
would propose on that actually we we

862
00:37:58,329 --> 00:38:01,960
have several thousand plants at our

863
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:06,280
facility also started up and watering

864
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:10,349
everything is that half of our apartment

865
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:13,269
water you have implemented some

866
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:16,480
variations to do rooms built recently

867
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:18,280
and attach the background on hand

868
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,530
watering and getting to know your plants

869
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:25,980
at that point very much less idle

870
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:28,840
anarchic urination sobriety you are can

871
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,659
through your pure evasion but a given

872
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:35,260
one a facilities can hear speakers

873
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:37,440
that's a lot of plans we go very

874
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:41,140
high-tech time I've done that as

875
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:45,070
archaeologists I do do that well

876
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:49,449
transpiration protocols and data and I

877
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:51,160
for providing strain because we all know

878
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:54,549
that the lean mass is different the

879
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:58,839
problem but then through computers we

880
00:38:54,550 --> 00:39:02,530
put it through a pall system and I know

881
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:05,559
plan that's only three weeks old in 60

882
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:08,650
days oh how many liters of water it's

883
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,929
actually losing based on the foot-candle

884
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:14,170
reading or the light reading of that

885
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:16,480
name and we just feed that back into a

886
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:20,590
pulse pistol and it pulses the water

887
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:24,539
through leaders post water linearly

888
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:26,890
what we're trying to do is basically

889
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:29,710
reduces much stress

890
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:32,829
unfortunately pinterest does not show up

891
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:35,409
or they tell you that well the plant is

892
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:37,299
wilting so it's under stress basically

893
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:39,579
the plant stress usually with any

894
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:42,880
clinton substrate shows up three to four

895
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:46,090
days prior to that and so you might miss

896
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,820
three or four days before watering where

897
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:51,670
so when we're basically doing this is

898
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:56,289
trying to meet the dealer requirements

899
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:57,970
but still got to be even grower you got

900
00:39:56,289 --> 00:40:00,759
to do you still have to go up there and

901
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:03,159
once a while check the roots you have to

902
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,560
lift that pot i have i've time not do

903
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:07,449
anatomy when i would just ignore when

904
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:10,150
you're up there 6:00 in the morning

905
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:11,799
living every prophecy do i water if

906
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:15,460
you'll find water because of those

907
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:21,250
things as all and water now a lot of

908
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:23,440
that young roars watch walkway you look

909
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:28,480
at the plant yet and all the computers

910
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:31,019
do not turn the computer off go out

911
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,659
there and learn how to your plants our

912
00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:37,630
remaining time with its when cannabis or

913
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:41,049
not you can be a roots min instead of

914
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:44,460
Laxman because we're top artists and

915
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:50,590
kumkum like to say you maintain that

916
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:53,889
ideal for good rises here so we got this

917
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:54,970
time for a couple questions so I have

918
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:58,719
any answer

919
00:40:54,969 --> 00:41:03,069
yes but my question is intended and

920
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:06,639
whatever identity - trading would that

921
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:09,010
limit the entire global health world

922
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:12,279
patient and we're not reducing this

923
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:14,290
range but we're always working on still

924
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:18,190
developing the trainings - what what

925
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:20,949
what you still medicinally and tossed by

926
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:23,170
and produced what he's looking for

927
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:25,960
so it's not that one all story we're

928
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:28,930
never one of eliminated strains we're

929
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,090
just working with them to see what what

930
00:41:28,929 --> 00:41:32,980
gives it best what we can do at that

931
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,780
time and I think it right Kate correct

932
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:37,900
me if I'm wrong I think the way of the

933
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:40,570
Canadian system work is your customer is

934
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,490
not actually the public your customer is

935
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,809
of our circuit company the financier is

936
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:45,909
knowing you what they want

937
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:47,799
yeah and so it says like the

938
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:49,599
pharmaceutical company that choosing the

939
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,960
searching Pro how they're going for it

940
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:57,190
it's not any growers and pharmaceutical

941
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,289
asked me and I'm always at at wit's end

942
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:02,230
with pharmaceutical company because

943
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:04,989
you're not working at at the plant at

944
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:07,329
its potential and work should be growing

945
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:10,569
more just like they're just looking at

946
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:13,239
one entity of it which not gonna work

947
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:15,640
not going to work if we just I say it

948
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:17,709
was very we start getting in television

949
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:18,219
we're going to be a dream for any big

950
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,409
problems

951
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:23,588
yeah just show me how to an annoyed

952
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:26,259
no no but that's what see that's what

953
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:29,170
sells to the pharmaceuticals okay it's

954
00:42:26,259 --> 00:42:32,019
like half the pharmaceutical oral

955
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:33,608
medicines we take give you breakers

956
00:42:32,018 --> 00:42:36,189
there's Morgan that do the same thing

957
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:46,538
but they produced 200 side-effects

958
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:50,858
that's your our people Brian yes you and

959
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:53,769
your leaves are you know we send them to

960
00:42:50,858 --> 00:42:56,190
an analytic lab does agriculture testing

961
00:42:53,768 --> 00:42:59,288
and depending on the state there's

962
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:02,108
certain labs that can do it they're glad

963
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:04,150
set if they're USB 8-month it won't

964
00:43:02,108 --> 00:43:07,210
touch it so just reach out to the local

965
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:10,900
lab and he's doing what some last night

966
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:13,838
has a tissue testing some last might as

967
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,700
well tell my to vote so just reach out

968
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:17,739
so in community people that run the labs

969
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:20,078
are for lack of a better term like

970
00:43:17,739 --> 00:43:22,838
myself a treat so they love talking

971
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,119
about this stuff and they may be able to

972
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:27,759
help you with another lab or under labs

973
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:32,829
so in-house testing the IG not right

974
00:43:27,759 --> 00:43:34,528
okay what's the turnaround well in order

975
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:37,568
to make it kind of depends on the season

976
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:40,280
we there's a lot of agriculture in organ

977
00:43:37,568 --> 00:43:42,320
you know it is very seasoned oh you want

978
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,360
for at least a month you know and so it

979
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:47,269
just depends on what happening with

980
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:49,820
arrests agriculture until we develop

981
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:52,489
cannabis specific labs that can come in

982
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:56,539
all the enticement pets we got to rely

983
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:58,369
on agriculture lab I'm interested when

984
00:43:56,539 --> 00:43:59,809
you are taking these samples make sure

985
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:03,230
you're taking the lately samples

986
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:06,259
basically revolves refer to the will be

987
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:08,300
call the most recently matured leaf I

988
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:10,430
mean someone likes they won't want to

989
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,930
test that that yellow at the bottom

990
00:44:10,429 --> 00:44:13,219
that's not going to work

991
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:15,259
I'm not want to test the one in the

992
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:17,359
middle you have to test the one that's

993
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:23,570
actively taking up all the nutrients

994
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:26,990
appoint on and in soil samples if you're

995
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:29,840
using soil then they do one type of test

996
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:31,779
now if you switch over to Blake dating

997
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,280
Pete like mints with his no soil in it

998
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:36,710
it's always good to let the lab know

999
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:42,980
that because then that isn't totally

1000
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:46,059
different test if it does one learn it's

1001
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:49,820
a precious minute talk about the

1002
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:53,289
intensity of caravanning I definitely

1003
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:56,809
did most version what do you think about

1004
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:58,019
biochar compost tea that the word for

1005
00:44:56,809 --> 00:45:03,409
anything else to you

1006
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:03,409
pentagram men were increasing that that

1007
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:17,250
like I give when we get to like all lazy

1008
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:21,150
soil it needs to be things like biochar

1009
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:23,789
and other amendments that are going to

1010
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:26,940
actually be symbiotic with the root

1011
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:30,179
system they're always they're always a

1012
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:33,240
good a good addition and again it is

1013
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:36,239
based on you should know your soil you

1014
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:38,399
should your plants will tell you in that

1015
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,319
no lifetime I'm getting a little

1016
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,320
sluggish I'm getting a little grayish

1017
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:47,160
teal blue instead of a vibrant green so

1018
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:50,430
yeah there is the benefits those but

1019
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:52,920
again all I can really say is that

1020
00:45:50,429 --> 00:45:55,379
totally when you want to try these new

1021
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,000
products there's enough information on

1022
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,250
the internet to learn about these

1023
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,710
products you should totally understand

1024
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:03,650
that product before you use it that

1025
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:07,429
you're using it for the right purpose

1026
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:09,980
because sometimes they cost a lot yeah

1027
00:46:07,429 --> 00:46:13,799
one thing that we've been working with

1028
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:15,960
recently is our cast

1029
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,800
and the worm castings are a really good

1030
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:22,289
amendment because they have so much

1031
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,060
biological activity in them and you're

1032
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:27,119
not going to per your plants by applying

1033
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:28,259
you can't really apply too much so it's

1034
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,829
a good place to start

1035
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,700
and Sarah's here what we use oh they're

1036
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:35,340
good people to talk to

1037
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:36,449
without your question yeah there's

1038
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:39,720
actually a lot of different companies

1039
00:46:36,449 --> 00:46:42,839
right now emerging in the bacterial type

1040
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:45,989
of the market a lot of people think we'd

1041
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:48,269
be feed when really we should kind of

1042
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:50,219
arrest ourselves away from the beam

1043
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:55,079
mentality and think about our

1044
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:57,449
biodiversity of our soil Bokashi certain

1045
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,400
bacteria that promote phosphorous uptake

1046
00:46:57,449 --> 00:47:01,618
instead of adding a behavior in the

1047
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,750
middle of a community this different

1048
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:05,809
bacterias that are responsible for doing

1049
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:07,639
different things so like I said

1050
00:47:05,809 --> 00:47:10,440
understanding what that product does

1051
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:12,539
when you should apply it how you should

1052
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,789
apply is really important to maximize

1053
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:17,730
that you're not going to want to offer

1054
00:47:14,789 --> 00:47:20,340
as boosting bacteria on at the beginning

1055
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:21,840
maybe you will depending on how our stem

1056
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,579
growth just depends on the strain that

1057
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,289
you want to produce well to so learning

1058
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:27,960
was brought up learning what that

1059
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:30,029
bacteria does and again jet lowenfeld

1060
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,740
that he's produced at three different

1061
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:33,680
flows now

1062
00:47:30,739 --> 00:47:37,399
they're amazing books even microbes with

1063
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:39,679
our giant union with bacteria incredibly

1064
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:45,170
knowledgeable books on how to use those

1065
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:48,618
and why just the fact that getting back

1066
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:50,000
to the make sure that your media is a

1067
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:52,550
meeting that's going to be well

1068
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,980
oxygenated after cream image because all

1069
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:58,880
of these additives they can get very

1070
00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:01,490
lethargic and lazy if you're Michael

1071
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,800
sphere it is not a healthy rhizosphere

1072
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:07,789
so you're pouring a lot of money into

1073
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:11,090
something in my mind isn't working it

1074
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:12,469
will work but you still have to before

1075
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:14,630
you get to the get-go all these

1076
00:48:12,469 --> 00:48:16,819
amendments and you have to be very

1077
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:20,269
confident healthy with the rhizosphere

1078
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:22,430
that you're throwing what a fantastic

1079
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:25,550
collection and experiencing share today

1080
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:29,079
thank you very much - kinky hug Katie

1081
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:29,080
Rivero and right hand
