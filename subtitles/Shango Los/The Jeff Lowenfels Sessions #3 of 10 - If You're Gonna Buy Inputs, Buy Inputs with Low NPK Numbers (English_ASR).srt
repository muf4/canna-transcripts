1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,760
so Jeff you know last night when you

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,740
were talking I heard something I had

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:16,990
never really considered before I know

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,689
that I can't be the only one who has a

5
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:22,179
history of going to the grow shop and

6
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:24,969
buying nutrients with the highest

7
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:27,820
numbers because you know as far as NPK

8
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:30,549
goes because it feels like it's the most

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,738
bang for the buck like like like I want

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,530
to get the most nutrient possible for my

11
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:38,500
money but last night you said that in

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:41,018
actuality you recommend purchasing lower

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,878
numbers because it's overall going to be

14
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:44,439
better for the rhizosphere

15
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,570
would you break that out a little bit

16
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:48,070
sure of course yesterday I was talking

17
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,530
about wattle flowers but it applies to

18
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,628
all plants and not just cannabis plants

19
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,039
as far as I'm concerned you know the

20
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:55,509
tendency is to want to go get the

21
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,309
highest knife you can you possibly can

22
00:00:55,509 --> 00:01:00,608
that's that first number in the NPK

23
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:03,039
trilogy we've all been inundated over

24
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:05,920
the years with television ads and

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,079
television ads and television ads about

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,269
how that high nitrogen number that I

27
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,340
mean if they're green long and gorgeous

28
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:15,519
green plants and it's gonna make things

29
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,350
go fast and so we're all custom to the

30
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,030
idea that you want to have that high

31
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:21,250
number and then of course comes the

32
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,040
hydroponic people who say okay look at

33
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,739
this man to give this stuffing and I

34
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,360
don't think people sit back and think of

35
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:31,419
a number of things so let me first start

36
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,920
by by explaining you're not feeding the

37
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,859
plant when you're dealing with soil

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,879
you're feeding the microbes those

39
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:41,560
microbes will then feed the plant

40
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,599
through the cycling of their bodies and

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,609
what's in their bodies so you're feeding

42
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,019
the microbes you want to have a food

43
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:50,650
that the microbes are gonna be able to

44
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:52,509
digest and eat nicely you know you don't

45
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,940
want to have a you know something that

46
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:58,450
just one kind of microbe wanted or the

47
00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:02,319
impacts of the diversity and and you you

48
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:05,079
you you want to have something you know

49
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,348
obviously that contains more than just

50
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,978
NPK so I go for the lower numbers and I

51
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:12,459
go for the

52
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:14,500
and the lower numbers I'm talking about

53
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:16,930
things like you know three four three

54
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,150
that kind of a number if you if you have

55
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,340
a number over the middle numbers the

56
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,010
phosphorous number if that number is is

57
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,810
over fifty parts per million somehow I

58
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:28,509
think that equates to basically like a

59
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,420
10 or a 12 and that middle number so

60
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:34,509
like a a 1012 would be that middle

61
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:36,759
number if it's that high provides enough

62
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:38,679
phosphorous so that the mycorrhizal

63
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:41,019
fungi which would normally go out and

64
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,510
get the phosphorus for the plant doesn't

65
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:44,650
do that the plant says I don't need to

66
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:46,750
feed these guys I'm getting the

67
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,640
phosphorous for free and so it changes

68
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,810
either the signaling of the actually

69
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,488
makes everybody lazy it makes the plant

70
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,709
appreciate the free lunch all right yeah

71
00:02:54,489 --> 00:03:00,519
yeah it makes it makes not so much lazy

72
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:02,079
it makes the plant just not attract to

73
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,370
the rhizosphere those microbes that

74
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:07,420
would normally be there because it

75
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:10,269
doesn't need them and and so so then you

76
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:12,548
have to you know supply those until a

77
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:13,629
plant stops doing that and and when you

78
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:15,519
put it in that high number for

79
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:19,269
phosphorus the plant is stopped same

80
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,650
thing with nitrogen so it makes sense if

81
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:23,379
you want to have a good healthy soil

82
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:26,170
food web to feed the microbes not the

83
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:27,969
plant and to not become a microbe

84
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:29,949
yourself that's what happens when you

85
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,590
use those side numbers you kill off some

86
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:34,568
of the members of the food web you have

87
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,430
to become them otherwise the plant

88
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:38,349
doesn't eat right so if you look at some

89
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,599
of these packages I won't mention the

90
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:42,159
evil people but if you look at their

91
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,199
package you've got a reply they're stuff

92
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,449
in every two weeks every two weeks

93
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:48,578
because you're the soil food web and

94
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:49,839
you've destroyed it no because you've

95
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:51,549
created this artificial environment

96
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,870
right no planet says I don't need to

97
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:54,730
support that I don't need to attract

98
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,039
these michaelis forget the concept that

99
00:03:54,729 --> 00:04:00,409
in some instances these hi Michael

100
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:03,919
decided nitrogen fertilizers and I

101
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:06,049
okay we'll actually change the diversity

102
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,149
I mean that's that's a serious problem

103
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,520
in some instances it will actually kill

104
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,650
off the microbes in some instances it

105
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:16,310
increases one kind of micro because

106
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,110
they'll they eat this stuff but you

107
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,269
really want to have a nice balanced even

108
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,100
system you want the microbes to do the

109
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:26,870
work you don't want to have the planet

110
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:30,020
make a decision I like that idea that

111
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:32,360
that were our job as farmers is really

112
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:34,789
to take care of the microbe community

113
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,170
and the microbe community takes care of

114
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,750
the plant right when I was first getting

115
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:41,720
an organic food as a serious follower of

116
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,579
Joel Salatin from Ohio based farms and

117
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,740
one his thing he said he says you know

118
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:47,930
I'm not a cattle and chicken farmer I'm

119
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,879
a grass farmer and so long as I produce

120
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,100
good grass now all the animals eat

121
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:54,860
similarly we're trying to create you

122
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,710
know a good microbes so that the plant

123
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:02,629
has something that it wasn't eat so

124
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:05,269
herders yeah well that's exactly right

125
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:07,360
in and I think people forget that and

126
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:09,409
the reason why we forget it is because

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,689
before World War Two that's all people

128
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,120
did and all of a sudden these artificial

129
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:15,259
fertilizers came in after the war hmm

130
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,040
where do they come from

131
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:20,990
munitions a Senator Sarah so yes it's

132
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,610
just one of those systems that have

133
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,110
gotten out of hand and so when you

134
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,210
talked about it to go back to your

135
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,300
beginning of the question you know your

136
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:31,299
concentration levels you thought you

137
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,100
know by those higher ones it's cheaper

138
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,689
ultimately in terms of the economy but

139
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,970
that's not really true because you have

140
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:39,889
to apply it more and your plan is by

141
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,990
more susceptible to everything because

142
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:44,389
it doesn't have the micro community to

143
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,280
help it fend off yeah yeah I mean I mean

144
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:47,899
given how many decadence I got you know

145
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,519
once you change the diversity then

146
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:51,769
you're really screwing things up and so

147
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,000
yeah absolutely so you want to pay

148
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:56,870
attention to what you're doing and

149
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,449
frankly when you buy these things you

150
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,670
know you might want to think about where

151
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:03,979
we don't see if I park compost the

152
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,290
compost is made out of manure could come

153
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,200
from a cow that can't we mmm maybe you

154
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,460
want to buy this stuff that the cow eats

155
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,279
you know so there's all sorts of ways of

156
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:15,529
thinking different about this it's as

157
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,969
opposed to remember that TV commercial

158
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:23,449
right and one more question about the

159
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:27,200
NPK numbers and so very often we will

160
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:29,629
want to you know use soil additives that

161
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,000
have got of several different types

162
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:33,800
right and they've all got their own NPK

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,569
numbers how do you how do you think

164
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,220
about stacking those right do we add

165
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,589
them together and suddenly now we've got

166
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,090
an N of 18 because we've used five

167
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:42,079
different things that are three I mean

168
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:45,439
like how does that work it's very

169
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,859
confusing you know at one time we're

170
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,319
trying to understand these moles

171
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:54,530
percentages you know so confusing and

172
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,620
and even the NPK numbers themselves

173
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:59,000
don't really represent nitrogen 5 you

174
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,939
know the phosphorus is really not

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,550
phosphorus I think it's phosphoric acid

176
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:06,740
I know you know it's just so confusing

177
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:09,800
but all I know is that what you do mix

178
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,360
them together you are additive as

179
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,220
opposed to subtract them and you're

180
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,360
increasing the number as you go

181
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,990
once again it's sort of one of these

182
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,189
situations where you gotta make sure

183
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,889
that you're giving the plant what it

184
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:26,629
needs and what a lot of people do is

185
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,310
just knee-jerk apply these things so I

186
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:31,159
would say the other part of the question

187
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,780
should be or the answer should be you

188
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,700
need to test to see what your plant

189
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:36,199
really needs and most people don't do

190
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,539
anything thanks for sure

191
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,129
we really are deficient in that regard

192
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,350
and there's so many neat ways to test

193
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:44,659
that you know from saw food web

194
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,550
microbiome owner and PK it's all good

195
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,880
stuff we want to do it

196
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,230
informations power so yeah so let's see

197
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,509
if we can go back and summarize the

198
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,319
answer you want to keep those numbers

199
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:57,689
low because you're feeding the microbes

200
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:00,480
not feeding the plant the microbes feed

201
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:02,910
the plant by keeping the numbers low you

202
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,700
keep that micro set healthy and the

203
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,500
plant does not rely on the food you're

204
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,149
applying there they were still relying

205
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,509
on the right work fantastic thank you

206
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:11,509
very much

207
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,939
you
