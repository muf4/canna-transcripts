2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:10,169
it's amazing to see how much cannabis

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,629
extraction has evolved in such a short

4
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:14,580
time I mean if you looked at cannabis on

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,190
a historical timeline there would be

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,750
flowers and hash for millennia and then

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,460
right at the end of the timeline

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,009
suddenly humans start using alcohol

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,109
butane and carbon dioxide and even hair

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,539
straighteners to remove the essential

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,550
oils of the cannabis plant the beginning

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,260
of normalization has created a surging

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,230
demand for all sorts of extracts

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,600
including dab oil inputs to make edibles

15
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:39,209
and full extract cannabis oil or fee Co

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,399
each of these processes demand the right

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,739
technology employed by a knowledgeable

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,750
technician if you enjoy hearing smart

delighted to be here so I'm excited to

57
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,819
be talking about Eden and your

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,740
experience with extraction for a while

59
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:16,139
you know Eden was in the

60
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,870
Tanika extraction business well before

61
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,969
cannabis what kinds of other extractions

62
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,090
were you designing prior to getting into

63
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:27,150
cannabis well the founder of the the

64
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:31,379
company for its chest began doing

65
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:34,469
extractions in about 1994 but actually

66
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:37,229
cannabis was always a part of that

67
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:41,310
process he did a lot of different kinds

68
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:43,709
of botanicals but you know for instance

69
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,770
he was the first one the first to

70
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:50,969
advertise in high times for a an

71
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:54,750
extraction system in 94 95 and that was

72
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:59,520
a small ethanol system and then he put a

73
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:02,430
large system in San Francisco in 1996

74
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,200
one proposition 215 passed so some of

75
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:11,990
the other botanicals if there's a wide

76
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:15,209
array is biofuels Masuda coals herbs for

77
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:18,570
acupuncturist herbalist actually the

78
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:21,570
abreast of extraction knowledge that he

79
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:24,739
has across multiple botanical structures

80
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:27,359
and industries is really amazing you

81
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:30,960
know it surprises me you know I thought

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,790
I knew your you know Eden labs

83
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,400
background in cannabis but I had no idea

84
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:37,259
that Fritz had gotten started so early

85
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,960
in the San Francisco scene that's

86
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,969
actually when I was living down there he

87
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,330
obviously has had an affinity for

88
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:47,909
cannabis medicine a long time did you

89
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,030
did you find that you were you're well

90
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:52,680
positioned because of that experience

91
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,620
when the first you know in Washington

92
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,870
and Colorado first broke out he pretty

93
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,450
prince was probably like finally I get a

94
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,920
chance to apply my technology in in

95
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:07,229
functioning markets yeah I mean you know

96
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,879
I said back in the mid 90s it you know

97
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:09,959
if it wasn't for California even allowed

98
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,269
to be a part-time job

99
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:17,430
oh yeah hobby so yeah he has been doing

100
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:20,370
this quite a while and it definitely was

101
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:23,720
a boon to Eden as well as the entire

102
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,310
industry to have someone with his

103
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,180
background and experience when those

104
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,439
markets

105
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:36,209
and live in later on for Colorado and in

106
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:38,370
Washington and in 2009 so if he was

107
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,930
beginning you know like you said if it

108
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,418
weren't for California be a part-time

109
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,400
job and I know that your extractors are

110
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:47,269
used across other industries for

111
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,279
different botanicals at what point did

112
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:53,008
did the threshold kind of get past where

113
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,019
you went it went from just being you

114
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:56,759
know you know Fritz and one or two other

115
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,519
people to oh gosh

116
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,710
you know it looks like we need to we

117
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,348
need to start hiring people because the

118
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:06,620
cannabis part of our business is is

119
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:09,719
growing so fast

120
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:14,030
yeah that's tipping point for especially

121
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:19,710
for cannabis was about 2009 and then

122
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:21,659
really kicked in in 2010 mm-hmm and and

123
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:24,329
and so I can imagine at that same time

124
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,180
you know you're early sales were to

125
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:30,659
medical cannabis companies in Washington

126
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:33,379
and Colorado and in in California which

127
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,490
had already been selling to but you know

128
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:37,740
those a lot of those new companies

129
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,180
wanted to use your technology but they

130
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,000
didn't have access to traditional

131
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,030
financing yet and while you know while

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,709
the eating machines are you know a are

133
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:48,089
worth the money they're also not

134
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:50,069
something that a lot of these new

135
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:52,168
companies you know had and financing

136
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:54,689
right away I can imagine that you had to

137
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:56,158
do some pretty creative financing to

138
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:59,339
help these companies get the ball

139
00:05:56,158 --> 00:06:01,168
rolling also making sure that Eden was

140
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:07,198
first to market in this groundbreaking

141
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:10,918
industry yes so those early years were

142
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,530
very challenging for people to be able

143
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:17,549
to get in to you know get equipment that

144
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:19,049
would really help them be successful so

145
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,990
there was definitely a lot of creativity

146
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:25,370
and there still is I mean it's still an

147
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:29,280
issue obviously with you know not having

148
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:31,408
access to the federal banking system and

149
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,089
or you know companies can't get lines of

150
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:36,689
credit you know you have to completely

151
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:38,659
rely on investors and you know often

152
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,550
that can be problematic

153
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,640
I'm having those two worlds come

154
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,350
together so it has been challenging in

155
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,879
it and it still is but certainly a lot

156
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,980
better mm-hmm

157
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:52,430
that's for sure and also you know in the

158
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,319
early days of medical it was it was such

159
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,509
a legal gray area that it was a lot

160
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,610
harder to find you know even angel

161
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:01,099
investment capital and since and since

162
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,650
we're all pretty well at least fairly

163
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,020
confident that cannabis is here to stay

164
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:08,029
it's a lot easier to get individual

165
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:10,549
investment now than it was in those in

166
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:14,000
those early days you know the you know

167
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:16,460
in addition to the the early companies

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,850
not necessarily having the financing for

169
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:22,729
such a you know fine product as the

170
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,580
extractors you know a lot of the owner

171
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:28,040
operators didn't have proper science

172
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:30,769
backgrounds how do you make up for

173
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,840
operator error as they as they run your

174
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:35,750
machines you know a poor mish of poor

175
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:38,029
operator getting poor results looks bad

176
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,250
for EDA not because the machine is doing

177
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:42,319
anything wrong but because the quality

178
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,870
of what's coming out of the machine and

179
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,639
then is going for sale or to a patient

180
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,170
or whatever you know it might not be up

181
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,789
to quality and then they say always run

182
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,590
on an eating machine when when actually

183
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,520
the machine was fine but the operator is

184
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:55,369
the one who doesn't have the experience

185
00:07:52,519 --> 00:08:00,310
what do you do as a company to to help

186
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:03,259
soften the likelihood of that well

187
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,970
several different things but the

188
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:09,110
foundation of all of that actually is

189
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:12,860
why it started engineering co2 systems

190
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,389
to begin with he was he was doing all

191
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,280
kind of different botanicals as we

192
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:17,839
mentioned earlier one of the things that

193
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:19,429
he had a hard time extracting with

194
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,689
ethanol because he started with ethanol

195
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:26,300
systems was called a kava and it would

196
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:28,250
not extract well in ethanol so I was

197
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,629
like all right well I needed I need to

198
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,209
try some temperature and pressure and

199
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:34,969
they start looking around at different

200
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:36,710
to two extraction systems there are only

201
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:40,099
a couple of companies at the time and

202
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:44,600
they were huge international companies

203
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:49,870
and the systems were very expensive they

204
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,889
were fully automated they were fussy and

205
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,519
of course none of these companies had

206
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:56,179
any idea

207
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:58,850
about you know extracting heavily

208
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:00,859
resinous materials so he said all right

209
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,360
well I don't want a system like that I

210
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,279
just want something that simple to

211
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:09,500
operate that will not break down that

212
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:12,529
you know I can I can run comfortably and

213
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,980
so that's what he designed and you know

214
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:18,289
22 years later the systems haven't been

215
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:23,029
based on that are very easy to operate

216
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:27,919
and they are extremely reliable and and

217
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:29,839
we as a company we obviously were

218
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:32,979
extremely invested in this industry and

219
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:36,860
we really want all of our people to be

220
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:41,779
successful so we have an internal

221
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:43,610
training for those people we have text

222
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:47,509
that they can call to help them with

223
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:49,610
things we have a really good obviously a

224
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:52,460
network having been in the industry as

225
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:55,519
many years that we share information

226
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,440
with a lot of our clients and we pass

227
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,259
some of that stuff on if they are

228
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,930
agreeable to to do that obviously some

229
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:04,610
of the technology or the protocols that

230
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:08,539
they come up with our there are IP we

231
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:12,019
don't share that but the systems are

232
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:14,120
there designed to help people people be

233
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:16,100
successful and we've gone through many

234
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,429
different reiterations of the system at

235
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,950
this point and we just released a new

236
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:25,309
version this last year and it's awesome

237
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:28,970
I can imagine especially in the early

238
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:31,039
days when turnover for lab staff was you

239
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,600
know pretty consistent that there must

240
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,309
have been some frustration from your

241
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,399
from your training department because

242
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:39,109
just as you got a company's lab staff

243
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,730
trained up and they could use the

244
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,889
Machine correctly you know they were

245
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,750
moving on for one reason or another and

246
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:47,299
you're like oh man we got to start all

247
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,970
over again I can imagine that you know

248
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:51,529
as far as you know startup and moving in

249
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,889
a new industry that must have been one

250
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:58,730
of the early frustrations yeah what we

251
00:10:54,889 --> 00:11:01,009
we've dealt with that is we we train the

252
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,230
operators on this system that they get

253
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:05,429
and then we can have two four people at

254
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,259
a time from any given company

255
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:10,889
and part of their Morty is hooked into

256
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:12,480
the fact that a certified trained person

257
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,949
is running that system and if I have

258
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,269
somebody else do it what's their

259
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:20,370
warranty so it gives some emphasis to

260
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:21,899
have always have an operator who has

261
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,820
been trained and knows what they're

262
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,250
doing and that has worked very well for

263
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,980
everyone that's actually a really great

264
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,559
strategy to tied having a properly

265
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:35,070
trained person to the warranty itself

266
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,809
you know in the early days you know all

267
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,700
sorts of different people in different

268
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:41,909
labs running your machines I'm like do

269
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,259
they know what they're doing and there

270
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,000
has been a lot of that and there you

271
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,610
know it has and actually the industry

272
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,339
has been my opinion been held back quite

273
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,769
a bit by and lack of a real

274
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,839
understanding of extraction and I can

275
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:56,399
tell you Shankar you mentioned earlier

276
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,370
about all the traveling that I do and

277
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,629
the primary reason is just trying to get

278
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,028
in front of people to talk about

279
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:04,860
extraction and why extraction is so

280
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:06,809
important to this moving this industry

281
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,450
forward especially on legalization

282
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:12,269
because it's hard to legalize on medical

283
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:14,520
without a claim to your product so

284
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:17,370
that's one of the reasons why when I

285
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:21,149
came in as CEO I wanted to brand the

286
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:23,549
company as primarily as co2 and ethanol

287
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:25,350
we make all kinds of different systems

288
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:28,559
using all sorts of different solvents

289
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:32,879
but this industry needed an easy path

290
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,979
and it's hard to argue with those two

291
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,990
extraction methodologies yeah that makes

292
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,379
a lot of sense and I want to go ahead

293
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,419
and compare co2 to BHO but let's do that

294
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:43,708
after the first break here we are going

295
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:45,719
to take a first break and be right back

296
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:48,299
you are listening to shaping fire and my

297
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,028
guest today is AC Braddock CEO of Eden

298
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:52,500
labs now that the health benefits of

299
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:54,539
terpenes have become well known in the

300
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,429
cannabis industry people everywhere are

301
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,439
looking for the purest terpenes without

302
00:12:56,429 --> 00:13:00,000
adulterants the problem with most

303
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,040
terpene providers is that they're not

304
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,559
sourced naturally and instead are made

305
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:07,078
as a byproduct of refining petroleum and

306
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,669
that's so sketchy the terpenes sold by

307
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,819
true terpenes are entirely different

308
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:13,500
they are certified organic non-gmo and

309
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,140
food grade that means that they are

310
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,580
extracted from real plant sources there

311
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,559
are no solvents of any

312
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:23,070
they are distilled only with steam

313
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:24,869
that's right only steam in fact terpenes

314
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,970
from true drippings are so pure that you

315
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,490
can eat them not only that but you can

316
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,680
stack them with better results too what

317
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,899
I mean is other company's terpenes have

318
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,579
got a few percent of impurities and when

319
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,500
you stack those terpenes to make your

320
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,270
blend you're adding a variety of

321
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,639
impurities that degrade your final

322
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:43,379
product true terpenes also have

323
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,240
strain-specific turbines for a wide

324
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:47,580
range of cannabis strains like Durbin

325
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,490
poison sunset sherbet and granddaddy

326
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,379
purple true terpenes has robust and

327
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,120
supportive customer service so your

328
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,309
questions will get answered fast and

329
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,039
efficiently if you shop for Turk's

330
00:13:56,309 --> 00:14:00,599
before you know how rare that is so

331
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,519
whether you want to cup your hands to

332

Shang colos and our guest this week is

351
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,840
AC Braddock CEO of Eaton Labs so you

352
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,460
know during the end of the last set of a

353
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,050
see you were saying how one of the

354
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,690
things that you wanted to do as you came

355
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:57,899
in as CEO was to start to play this

356
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:01,560
evangelist role for extraction and for

357
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:04,110
easy to use co2 machines and you know a

358
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,819
lot of people have been you know in the

359
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,669
early days they were they were making

360
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,410
BHO butane hash oil and in the early

361
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:12,629
early days people were blasting outside

362
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,069
which of course was really dangerous but

363
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:18,299
one of the things that a lot of people

364
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:22,170
really like about co2 is that there is

365
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:26,219
no residue left in the product and it's

366
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:28,049
not a combustible hydrocarbon which a

367
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,700
lot of people are concerned about you

368
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:30,528
know getting any residue out of it

369
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,189
because it

370
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:37,149
be a carcinogen so you know what what as

371
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:39,620
part as part of your of your evangelist

372
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:43,220
presentation to people what do you say

373
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:47,230
when you're comparing co2 to BHO and why

374
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,230
co2 is such a great choice for folks

375
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:53,958
well number one marketability you know

376
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,299
even in the supplements industry many

377
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:59,448
years ago they started moving over to

378
00:15:56,299 --> 00:16:01,969
co2 from hexane and they used it as a

379
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:03,859
marketing tool and their packaging and I

380
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,470
think there's a there's a movement in

381
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,558
this country for sustainable

382
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:13,009
environmentally friendly organic

383
00:16:09,558 --> 00:16:15,499
products so and it's not just cannabis

384
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:18,139
it's it's all industries because most of

385
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:21,110
our our food products are currently

386
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:26,799
extracted with hexane which is very

387
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:28,610
toxic and in Europe has been banned

388
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,799
anything that's usually made without

389
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,528
light hydrocarbons from many countries

390
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,419
in in the in Europe are not allowed to

391
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:38,149
be sold in Europe but they are allowed

392
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:42,799
to be sold in the US so we have a little

393
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:44,750
bit of a problem with you know what what

394
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,039
we get is human consumables for many

395
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,970
different things that includes

396
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:51,708
pesticides and in our foodstuffs but in

397
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:55,490
cannabis you know we have this spotlight

398
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:57,649
on us about the kind of products that we

399
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,649
make and how they're grown which is good

400
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:06,259
but we want to shine that light across

401
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:08,929
multiple industries but you know as I

402
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:11,000
said earlier even makes all kinds of

403
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:16,699
different systems and including butane

404
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,019
and propane systems the reason why we

405
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,058
start against what we started focusing

406
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:23,779
on this is because as you said in the

407
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:26,720
early days there were so many non

408
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:28,759
experts utilizing butane because it was

409
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,130
inexpensive to get into and there were

410
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:33,259
horrific accidents and it was really an

411
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,140
Achilles heel for the industry the media

412
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:39,079
was having a field day with it and we

413
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,990
needed an alternative but these days

414
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:43,970
there are many companies who make really

415
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:48,980
good butane propane pro

416
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:51,350
products it just requires time to do the

417
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,860
post-processing and understanding of

418
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:56,750
what you're dealing with one of the main

419
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:59,569
problems with any solvent really

420
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:02,298
especially you know butane or propane as

421
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:04,279
it goes through pipelines and you get

422
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:06,619
what they call quote-unquote mystery oil

423
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:09,139
in there which is basically pipeline

424
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:12,229
lubricants so as long as companies are

425
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:16,309
being responsible and sourcing really

426
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:22,190
clean solvents and then purging it and

427
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:26,538
handling the oils properly it's it's a

428
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:28,429
viable production method and especially

429
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:31,038
since different kinds of solvents

430
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:33,080
produce different kinds of products so

431
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,929
when we deal with people we try and find

432
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:37,879
out okay what are you trying to make are

433
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:39,500
you trying to make an edible are you

434
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,020
trying to make shatter are you trying to

435
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,419
do bait pens because different

436
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:47,329
methodologies are better there for

437
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:49,070
different product lines I think that's a

438
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:51,619
really insightful point that you

439
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:55,730
mentioned about you know the the the

440
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:58,788
cleanliness of BHO or pho or what have

441
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:02,298
you it got a bad reputation in the early

442
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:04,308
days but it wasn't because of the BHO

443
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:07,339
itself it's because was because the

444
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:09,769
state of the industry was so young we

445
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:12,079
had the proper techniques and the

446
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:14,298
education to remove the residual

447
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:18,019
solvents just didn't exist in the

448
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:21,558
industry yet and you had a lot of non

449
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:23,418
science inexperienced people doing the

450
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:25,819
post-processing and then it would go out

451
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:27,740
and and you know you could taste it or

452
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:29,779
it would snap on the nail or whatever

453
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,409
and people could tell that there was

454
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:37,038
still residual BHO but the point where

455
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:40,190
the industry is now through through

456
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:45,109
education and hiring more scientific lab

457
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:46,850
staff to a more or less BHO and other

458
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:49,369
light hydrocarbons are going to be

459
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:52,579
cleaner than they ever were in the early

460
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:54,979
days of medical and a lot of that

461
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:58,158
that fear it's probably time for that to

462
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:01,250
go away yeah I already have it also

463
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:03,679
still falls back on the mission and

464
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:07,429
focus of whatever the company is - I

465
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,590
mean a lot of the people who really who

466
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:12,200
understand this is a long term plate

467
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:13,939
it's not a short term place it's not

468
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,278
about making a bunch of money quickly it

469
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:19,278
just isn't I mean anybody in this

470
00:20:16,278 --> 00:20:21,500
industry knows that at this point so

471
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:23,329
you're either going to self-regulate and

472
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,788
be an example for the rest of industry

473
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:27,918
or you're going to be in it for a money

474
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:30,500
grab and it's pretty easy to pick out

475
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,580
who those companies are the problem is

476
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:36,648
the general public can't differentiate

477
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:38,359
yeah and there's there's not testing for

478
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:40,339
that that's mandatory none of the states

479
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,479
either so you have to you know you have

480
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,908
to self-educate

481
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,500
and then find some sort of brand that

482
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,559
you like and then stick with that brand

483
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:51,769
loyalty and that makes for a really

484
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,778
exclusive market yeah it does it

485
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:55,548
definitely hinders the market and you

486
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:57,528
know and I won the reasons I appreciate

487
00:20:55,548 --> 00:21:01,429
you know you're inviting me on this on

488
00:20:57,528 --> 00:21:03,558
this talk today - because the more we

489
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:05,000
can help educate each other and the

490
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:06,619
general public and come to some

491
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,619
consensus on the messaging that we're

492
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:14,658
going to be bringing as recreational

493
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:17,750
continues simply to expand we are going

494
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:20,690
to we don't want to get into a scenario

495
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:23,089
where the culture of this industry flips

496
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:26,480
and we're doing same old same old

497
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:29,298
business and you know we've got Monsanto

498
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,548
type companies and you know it's just

499
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:34,908
there's so much potential for the

500
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:39,319
cannabis industry to change our food

501
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:41,059
consumption civil rights you know

502
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:45,710
there's just so many different things

503
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:49,250
that is that are what keep so many of

504
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:51,950
these companies the tenacity comes from

505
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,630
the passion well I think you know I

506
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,980
totally agree with you and I think that

507
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,960
a lot of us who used to work in the

508
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,480
metal in medical industry actually have

509
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,750
that fear and we watch it because you

510
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:05,028
know cannabis the plant itself you know

511
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,778
it teaches right and the people who are

512
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:08,509
who tend to be

513
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:10,128
be attracted to cannabis and whole plant

514
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:13,098
medicine of which I know you're also a

515
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:15,408
big advocate for like I am you know we

516
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:17,628
saw the kinds of people who used to be

517
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:20,809
attracted the medical industry and as

518
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:23,118
states become recreational and licensed

519
00:22:20,808 --> 00:22:26,089
and new forms of investment come in and

520
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:28,488
the players change out you know our

521
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:32,598
entire industry at is at risk to

522
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:35,119
becoming more of a commodity and lose a

523
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:36,648
lot of that you know original spirit

524
00:22:35,118 --> 00:22:38,718
that I think you're talking about and

525
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:40,638
and there's got to be enough good

526
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:43,219
players in the industry who want to keep

527
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:44,718
the quality high who want to try to you

528
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:47,719
know stay as close to a whole plant as

529
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:49,278
we can and to continue to think about

530
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:51,739
the health of the consumers and the

531
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:55,190
patients and and and it takes people

532
00:22:51,739 --> 00:23:00,558
like you evangelizing that and to to

533
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:03,619
remind people of that yes absolutely and

534
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:06,648
there are some really amazing companies

535
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:10,398
in this industry and there's some

536
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:12,949
companies that aren't so much and if we

537
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:16,548
can help bring them in but you know you

538
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:18,528
touched on it it's it's the investors

539
00:23:16,548 --> 00:23:21,888
and other business people who are

540
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:25,548
looking at this as a green rush who come

541
00:23:21,888 --> 00:23:28,278
in and expect big numbers and take

542
00:23:25,548 --> 00:23:29,898
equity out of small businesses and who

543
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:32,648
are already under tremendous amount of

544
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:35,178
pressure to even just stay in business

545
00:23:32,648 --> 00:23:42,699
with these people who are just talking

546
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:46,460
about numbers to them and having that

547
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:51,169
flavor start taking over what we're

548
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:52,729
doing is if it's not is not where we

549
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:55,969
want to go yeah it it's disheartening

550
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:57,558
that's for sure yes so before we go to

551
00:23:55,969 --> 00:24:00,830
the second commercial I want to talk a

552
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:04,598
little bit about about flavor of co2 you

553
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:06,858
know I several years ago I was CEO of a

554
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:09,798
extraction company and we used Eden

555
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:11,898
machines and as CEO and as our

556
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:15,168
evangelist one of the things that I

557
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:18,138
often had to were to convince people

558
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:19,610
about co2 was that that it had flavor

559
00:24:18,138 --> 00:24:23,329
and it could it could

560
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:25,849
really nice dabs compared to BHO and you

561
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:27,079
know part of what my stick was when I

562
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:29,089
talked to people was you know in the

563
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:33,289
early days people were not really sure

564
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:34,819
in the lab how to make a fine tasted a

565
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:37,099
boil because they weren't familiar with

566
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:39,558
the machines yet and the post-processing

567
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:43,129
and so they were just cooking the Terps

568
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:45,379
off and it wasn't this but it wasn't the

569
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:49,190
issue of co2 it was the issue of

570
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:51,890
inexperienced people using co2 but even

571
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,539
to today as the technology has gotten

572
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,220
better and as laboratory teams have

573
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:57,798
gotten better there's still this

574
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,870
remaining myth of that like oh you know

575
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:03,139
dho is always going to taste the best

576
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:06,019
and co2 is is not going to taste very

577
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:08,690
good but I know because you know I eyed

578
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:11,750
or co2 dabs I know the taste is there

579
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:14,539
what do you say when people kind of

580
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,369
slough off co2 and they say oh it

581
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:20,058
doesn't have the flavor because I'm sure

582
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:22,039
you get this pretty often yourself well

583
00:25:20,058 --> 00:25:26,450
yeah we've been getting that for you

584
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:30,940
know a while but I think the system of

585
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,870
it is from where we are we're in

586
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,710
generally where we are in the industry

587
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:40,819
so the way I look at it is we are still

588
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:46,548
in bathtub gin mentality about cannabis

589
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:49,609
oil so a lot of people only care about

590
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:53,319
the amount of THC and it being

591
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:55,579
inexpensive so that lends itself to

592
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:57,609
trying to produce a product with as much

593
00:25:55,579 --> 00:26:03,199
THC and it as possible

594
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:06,259
so the early and you know early on co2

595
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,819
is really trying to compete with the co2

596
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:10,369
operators are trying to compete with

597
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:13,369
trying to get as much THC in their oil

598
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:15,289
as possible so they over processed it

599
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:17,449
they would take it out of the system

600
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:19,359
they would post process at post process

601
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:22,970
it and to continue continue to

602
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:25,729
concentrate it until the THC levels were

603
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:28,220
high but of course then you've a per

604
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:31,390
eyes off all of the like light essential

605
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,380
oils or which are all the terpenes

606
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,900
so for about

607
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,470
five years actually been trying to get

608
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:41,990
our clients because our systems can

609
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:44,240
fraction eight off terms separately to

610
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:45,440
and you know then of course what they

611
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,069
are doing is they are taking all that

612
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,380
post process post process oil and then

613
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:53,659
trying to put it into a smokeable

614
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,580
product what what they really should

615
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,529
have been doing is just do an extraction

616
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:58,939
of the terpenes which come off really

617
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:01,369
quickly because they're live essential

618
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:04,160
oils they come off in like 15 to 45

619
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:06,739
minutes squirt that out set it aside

620
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,220
continue to run take the lipids and

621
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:11,779
waxes out of that bulk oil and

622
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,819
reintroduce the terpenes so you have a

623
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:18,500
whole plant extraction you don't have to

624
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:22,549
use additives for fluidity in the pens

625
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:24,559
or and - at this point we have multiple

626
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:27,769
clients who are doing a1 process where

627
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,649
they just run subcritical and and that

628
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:33,109
is starting to happen because the public

629
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:36,680
especially I think in the northwest and

630
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:39,699
in California some areas where all the

631
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:42,710
pot nerds quote-unquote which we are

632
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:45,019
aren't concerned with th - having high

633
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:47,360
levels of THC we want a full profile

634
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:50,240
cannabinoid and terpene profile we want

635
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,559
you know one of the things that I'm

636
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,029
really seeing especially here in

637
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:59,480
Washington is very high CBD strains

638
00:27:55,029 --> 00:28:01,430
utilized with very low THC and those are

639
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,680
the connoisseur products and they're

640
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,060
just starting to catch on and we're

641
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,090
going to see more and more of that

642
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:11,869
because the high THC market is extremely

643
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:15,109
limited but the full cannabinoid profile

644
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:18,259
full terpene entourage effect that is a

645
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:19,879
massive market yeah and certainly one

646
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:21,319
that's going to keep on growing we're

647
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,090
going to go ahead and take our second

648
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:25,789
and last break you are listening to

649
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:29,179
shaping fire and my guest today is AC

650
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:31,009
Braddock CEO of Eden labs using

651
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,990
pesticides when growing cannabis has

652
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:35,450
been common for a long time nowadays

653
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:37,579
though we know better we know that most

654
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,080
pesticides formulated for food crops

655
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:41,509
have never been tested for use with

656
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:43,789
cannabis they've been tested to be eaten

657
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:45,769
in tiny doses they have not been tested

658
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:46,668
to be inhaled and especially not

659
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:49,339
concentrated

660
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:50,869
into a cannabis oil chemical residues

661
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:52,730
from pesticides are not healthy for

662
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:55,368
anyone but they are especially dangerous

663
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:57,470
for patients for commercial cannabis

664
00:28:55,368 --> 00:28:59,898
growers this has become very impactful

665
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:02,089
cannabis enthusiasts and patients have

666
00:28:59,898 --> 00:29:05,178
gotten educated enough that they avoid

667
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:07,158
growers who used pesticides not only

668
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:09,528
that but states across the country have

669
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:13,100
begun making pesticide testing mandatory

670
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:14,778
on all licensed cannabis crops the time

671
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:16,908
has come to find a better way to fight

672
00:29:14,778 --> 00:29:18,798
garden pests than covering your cannabis

673
00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:22,899
and chemicals and there is a better way

674
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:25,249
let some good bugs fight your bad bugs

675
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:27,048
beneficial insects and predatory mites

676
00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:29,329
have come a long way since we were

677
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:31,278
buying ladybugs online and putting them

678
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:35,509
in the grow room and just hoping for the

679

00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:28,579
you are listening to shaping fire I'm

700
00:30:27,048 --> 00:30:31,158
your host Shengo louse and our guest

701
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:33,888
this week is AC braddock CEO of Eden

702
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:35,619
labs so right before the break you were

703
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:38,628
talking about the difference between

704
00:30:35,618 --> 00:30:40,278
super and subcritical and that some

705
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:42,980
folks were we're switching to

706
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:45,079
subcritical so that they could get more

707
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,538
flavor profile because you know the

708
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:49,759
future of cannabis is not just THC its

709
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:52,368
whole plant its flavor its taste and

710
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:53,749
it's healing and and a lot of folks are

711
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:56,720
not familiar with the difference between

712
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:59,629
super and subcritical all I really know

713
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,329
about it is that people wanted to try to

714
00:30:59,628 --> 00:31:02,668
avoid

715
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:04,769
using subcritical simply because the run

716
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:06,600
took so much longer and it was less

717
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:08,609
number of runs they could do in a

718
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:09,658
24-hour period but when you kind of

719
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:11,339
break that out for us what the

720
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:16,110
difference between super and subcritical

721
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:20,220
extraction is yeah so the wonderful

722
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:22,048
thing about co2 unlike a lot of other

723
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,620
different kinds of solvents is that it's

724
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:28,619
very tunable where you can run the

725
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,898
material through it a wide array of

726
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:34,768
temperatures and pressures to get out

727
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:41,099
all kinds of different products where

728
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:46,250
it's primarily useful cannabis is to be

729
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:49,558
able to separate out the terpene profile

730
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:53,220
and that was a thing earlier that's a

731
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:56,940
low pressure low temperature profile

732
00:31:53,220 --> 00:32:01,829
it's under 1,100 psi and a low

733
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:03,480
temperature so and that's also as I said

734
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:06,089
to know how the market is changing a bit

735
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,058
I mean any kind of quality product that

736
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:14,038
you make I don't care what it is takes

737
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:16,319
longer you know wines cheese's I mean

738
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:18,509
the list goes on any comments artisan

739
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:20,308
yes anything that's ours and that's what

740
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:21,929
we want this market to beat we want it

741
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:25,048
to be artists and we want it to be small

742
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:27,990
business we wanted to be a micro

743
00:32:25,048 --> 00:32:30,990
business as opposed to a macro there's

744
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:33,659
certainly room for macro but the more

745
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,278
our small to medium sized businesses we

746
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:37,880
have in cannabis or anything is

747
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:42,119
beneficial

748
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:46,710
so the subcritical will pull lots of

749
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:49,229
terpenes but you also need to then go up

750
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:52,169
to supercritical to pull a lot of the

751
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:54,240
other cannabinoids and the THC because

752
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:57,179
th you can sometimes be hard to pull out

753
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:00,359
especially you know th VA which is

754
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:01,830
another product which is up coming up at

755
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:04,668
people or don't have a really clear

756
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:08,189
understanding about is having a product

757
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:09,600
with THC a in it so especially for

758
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:12,298
medical patients because you're going to

759
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,980
go with pain benefits without all the

760
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:17,460
psychoactive parts

761
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:19,470
in there so there's a wide range of

762
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,890
temperature and pressure to be able to

763
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:26,400
create a recipe that's unique to your

764
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:29,190
product and pulling out different

765
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,170
cannabinoid profiles at different places

766
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:36,480
in the extraction process which gives

767
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:38,789
you I P which is extremely important for

768
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,130
this industry especially when we start

769
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:44,220
start going back and forth between you

770
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:45,990
know pharmaceutical versus nutraceutical

771
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,660
or pharmaceutical versus you know

772
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:51,289
cottage market yeah this is how we're

773
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:54,960
going to be able to have some traction

774
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:57,990
so as as these markets get larger I

775
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,900
would think that the sales of Eden lab

776
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:03,539
extractors to particular locale in the

777
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,940
country or heck even the world is a is a

778
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:09,059
leading indicator of the next really

779
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,800
relevant Canada scene do you find that

780
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:13,019
to be the case and if so where do you

781
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,190
think are going to be the next hot spots

782
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:16,190
because that's where you're shipping

783
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:23,909
obviously California for sure division

784
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:25,380
is a huge market east coast there are

785
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:27,989
several states that look like they're

786
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:30,210
going to be you know Pennsylvania well

787
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:32,369
you know there were laws only only doing

788
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:34,110
cops concentrates which I don't

789
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:37,619
necessarily agree with I think that

790
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:42,570
there's a medical benefit for flour as

791
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:45,980
well but the technology going forward to

792
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:51,539
be able to separate out molecules to

793
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:53,880
pull out CB CVG for instance which is

794
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:58,739
one of my favorites because it's great

795
00:34:53,880 --> 00:35:01,680
for pain and the Filmation but moving

796
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:03,479
all that forward so we're we have a we

797
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:07,589
have two distributorship now actually as

798
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:09,570
a company in israel and tapping into

799
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:12,360
some of those European markets like

800
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:15,750
Israel Australia they're several

801
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:20,430
different you know Germany the UK is

802
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:24,570
gearing up quickly I think Canada South

803
00:35:20,429 --> 00:35:27,730
America it's uh you know it's kind of

804
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:31,390
disturbing to see because I feel like

805
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:34,300
Washington and the west coast should be

806
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:37,629
kind of leading this technology but

807
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:40,710
because of our federal regulations other

808
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:43,450
places in the world are gaining traction

809
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:45,579
which is fine I mean lots of clinical

810
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:48,868
trials are going on all over the world

811
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:52,119
it would just be nice to have to be here

812
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:54,130
it was it was so disappointing to live

813
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,470
in Washington and have us be you know

814
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:59,050
one of the First's and then because of

815
00:35:56,469 --> 00:36:01,629
this you know dual-layer of our federal

816
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:04,210
laws and then the the confusion on

817
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:07,000
implementation at the state level I feel

818
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:09,909
like we're in Washington the the example

819
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,429
of how not to do it and and as soon as

820
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:15,009
the US government stopped international

821
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:17,529
pressure for cannabis it is amazing how

822
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:19,900
quickly it broke out everywhere as soon

823
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:22,930
as we stopped strong arming people to

824
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:26,200
not using cannabis medicine yep yeah it

825
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:28,059
was some of the things that Washington

826
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:30,368
have done is has been very very

827
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:31,960
disappointing and heart-wrenching for

828
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:34,030
many people and I know especially people

829
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,720
who were in medical previously and have

830
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:41,280
moved into the 502 market but it's

831
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:46,469
especially with how medical has been

832
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:49,750
handled here in the state which is

833
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:51,399
incredibly hypocritical yeah it's a

834
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,050
shame that you know the patients were

835
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,849
the first ones and the medical providers

836
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,050
we're the first ones that provide them

837
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:59,019
of course they're the ones who are left

838
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:01,269
holding the bag in our in the new system

839
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:04,420
here but heck we could do a whole show

840
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:06,550
just on Washington's failure so so let's

841
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,980
move right along so I know you and I are

842
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:11,320
both you know serious whole plant

843
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,240
advocates and and I don't know the

844
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,000
answer to this question and so I figure

845
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:19,929
best time is to now to ask you so so

846
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,369
what is lost during a co2 extraction and

847
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:22,960
I think that's from what I'm

848
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:26,619
understanding your answer sub is going

849
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,858
to provide more of the original plant so

850
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:32,170
what's what's what's in the plan that

851
00:37:29,858 --> 00:37:34,358
you would get when you toke it or you

852
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,450
don't combust it that's not in the oil

853
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:39,779
that comes after it's derived by a co2

854
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:39,779
extraction

855
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:47,130
you know I can't say that I exactly know

856
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:49,600
the answer to that question obviously

857
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:53,190
different methodologies will leave

858
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:56,469
different things behind that's obvious

859
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:57,700
the difference between smoking and co2 I

860
00:37:56,469 --> 00:38:01,599
don't know

861
00:37:57,699 --> 00:38:07,629
personally I do know that sometimes when

862
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:10,750
I smoke I can become very achy depending

863
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:14,680
on what strain it is but that never

864
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:15,880
happens when I ingest so there's not

865
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:17,889
only what the difference in the

866
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:22,300
extraction method but also what happens

867
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:24,329
physiologically with how the plant works

868
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,800
in your body yeah that makes sense

869
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:29,769
what while I'm asking you things that

870
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,620
that you don't have ready answers to how

871
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:34,360
about this one um well you know when

872
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:36,219
I've spoken to medical doctors about

873
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,170
dabbing some think that we will

874
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:41,529
eventually find out that dabbers are

875
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:44,320
inhaling terpenes in a volume and in a

876
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:46,090
method that it can be toxic to humans

877
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,559
and obviously these studies have not

878
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,930
been done yet because we would know

879
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:52,449
about them but you know you are sure

880
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:54,190
around a lot of folks studying oils

881
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:56,500
thinking about oils developing the

882
00:38:54,190 --> 00:39:00,970
technology so what are your personal

883
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:03,730
thoughts on the safety of dabbing well

884
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:07,779
yeah that has that is becoming quite a

885
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:12,780
concern and well another new trend that

886
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:15,790
we're hearing about is that a lot of vho

887
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:19,330
products there a lot of people who are

888
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:21,400
adding are now taking a Pho product and

889
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:26,440
taking terpenes from a co2 extraction

890
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:27,670
and putting that on the BHO product so

891
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,460
obviously you're going to have a pretty

892
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:34,530
significant terpene profile that they're

893
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:37,240
entertainers are light hydrocarbons so

894
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:41,320
you know it's been going back to a whole

895
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:43,209
plant philosophy if you've got a plant

896
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:46,300
and it never has more than you know

897
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:48,940
let's say 20% terpene profile and you're

898
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:53,560
mixing it together to create a 75%

899
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:55,240
terpene profile I I would say that they

900
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:57,969
there should be room for concern there

901
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:59,259
because it doesn't naturally occur that

902
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:02,529
way and probably that doesn't actually

903
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:04,180
occur like wait for a reason yeah that

904
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:06,640
makes sense you're you're like super

905
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:08,289
charging it and your body may have never

906
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,839
seen anything like it before know how to

907
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:12,940
deal with it yeah at some point it could

908
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:16,539
become poisonous or you know it just

909
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:19,690
it's just too much and and I think we

910
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,170
you know continually need to look at the

911
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,420
plant

912
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:27,269
as it is and what it offers I mean that

913
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:33,460
is why this industry exists so to

914
00:40:27,269 --> 00:40:35,079
suddenly take a sharp turn has to be

915
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,970
fought should be thought through and

916
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:38,349
considered carefully yeah I think this

917
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:43,059
is a fun question I think that I need to

918
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:45,730
go find myself a really good a medical

919
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:48,429
doctor respiratory nerd get him on the

920
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,929
show and pick out one for you oh good

921
00:40:48,429 --> 00:40:51,809
excellent I will ask you about that as

922
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:54,519
soon as we're done here

923
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:58,000
excellent so I want to finish this show

924
00:40:54,519 --> 00:41:00,009
with a real serious well not real

925
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,750
serious but a really direct business

926
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:05,700
question because we've talked on this

927
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:08,019
show before about a trademark and

928
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:11,529
licensing and the importance of

929
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:13,509
companies to continually defend their

930
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:15,480
their brand marks and their trademarks

931
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,250
because if if they're not constantly

932
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,710
defending the use of their of their

933
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:23,920
product names and of their marks that

934
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:26,740
over time their trademark gets diluted

935
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,740
and and it becomes indefensible and and

936
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:32,979
you know I have seen a lot of different

937
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:35,619
extraction machines and and so many of

938
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:38,050
them look like your original machines so

939
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:39,789
my question for you is that you know I'm

940
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,920
assuming that you're being copied again

941
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:44,440
and again by other extraction companies

942
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,820
seeking to catch up with Eden's lead do

943
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,510
you find that you have to strongly

944
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:50,860
defend your design patents oh yeah of

945
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:53,680
course

946
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:56,980
but you know it's a little difficult to

947
00:41:53,679 --> 00:42:01,239
with co2 because co2 was invented in

948
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:04,300
World War two and so it's not a new

949
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:07,669
process by any stretch but obviously

950
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:10,800
some of the different tweaks and

951
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:14,210
how we put a system together is

952
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,609
certainly pat herbal but yes there are

953
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:19,858
many in the last few years I would say

954
00:42:17,608 --> 00:42:22,019
there's a dozen more extraction

955
00:42:19,858 --> 00:42:26,699
companies who have come into the market

956
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:28,858
and to be able to hang on to your market

957
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:32,789
share while you're educating the public

958
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:35,519
on what the difference is and the

959
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:38,539
systems are because some of these

960
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:41,730
systems that come in

961
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:45,719
you know without naming names you know

962
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:47,880
one company that I know of there hundred

963
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:50,129
leader takes 64 hours to do an

964
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:56,300
extraction you know where ours would

965
00:42:50,130 --> 00:43:00,059
take you 7 to 12 so it's really

966
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:02,700
detrimental to the operators and the

967
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:04,980
businesses who who get these systems who

968
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:07,318
don't understand the differences because

969
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,659
they're going to fail and they can't

970
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:12,568
they can't have that kind of overhead

971
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:15,659
and have that kind of length of time in

972
00:43:12,568 --> 00:43:17,338
an extraction process but it goes back

973
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:21,358
to a whole extraction piece on every

974
00:43:17,338 --> 00:43:23,429
level in this industry with as many

975
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,739
companies that are popping up doing a

976
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:28,529
building extraction technologies are you

977
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:31,229
to the point yet that you have have got

978
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:33,000
dedicated people on staff who whose job

979
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,769
it is to defend your patents and to look

980
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,690
for infringement or is it just your

981
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:39,619
engineers occasionally come across one

982
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:43,400
and then you hand it over to the lawyers

983
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:49,650
we probably primarily just let our legal

984
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:52,019
team deal with that you know I guess as

985
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:56,940
a business owner at some point you have

986
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:59,989
to make a decision and are you going to

987
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:05,039
spend a lot of your time looking at your

988
00:43:59,989 --> 00:44:06,899
competitors and trying to compete or are

989
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:10,529
you going to focus on what you do best

990
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:12,720
and we did make that decision a few

991
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:16,560
years ago that we are going to do what

992
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:18,629
we've always done and that just do our D

993
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,529
and look at the science and continue to

994
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:22,420
make better extraction systems because

995
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:25,330
takes a tremendous amount of time energy

996
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:30,940
and just that they're constantly chasing

997
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:33,069
other people in a distraction from a

998
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,079
from an idealist point of view I

999
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:37,480
actually really love that answer because

1000
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:40,509
you know I understand the importance of

1001
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:43,210
defending design patents as you know the

1002
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:45,660
importance of holding on to IP for

1003
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:48,369
business but I'm also in the old school

1004
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:51,699
idea of information yearns to be free

1005
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:55,000
and and I also like you know rapid

1006
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:57,429
prototyping and evolving so I find it

1007
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,230
encouraging that that you are leading

1008
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:01,569
Eden in a way that you're all like well

1009
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:03,909
we'll defend when we have to but let's

1010
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:06,480
just make the next thing and then we'll

1011
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:09,909
just always be ahead of the crowd III I

1012
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,909
appreciate that approach yeah you know

1013
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:14,409
yeah it's like I don't I don't care it

1014
00:45:12,909 --> 00:45:17,409
it Eaton's the biggest company I just

1015
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:19,389
want us to be the best company that's

1016
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:20,949
what it's all comes down to because if

1017
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:23,769
we're the best our clients will be

1018
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:27,309
successful and they'll be able to then

1019
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:30,280
become pillars of mission and in this

1020
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:32,170
industry that will hopefully continue

1021
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,760
the tipping point in the direction this

1022
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,360
culture wants it to go and that's what

1023
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,210
it's all about

1024
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:39,130
