2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,719
the popularity of psilocybin mushrooms

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,798
has exploded in the last few years not

4
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,960
only are laws relaxing in many cities

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,278
across the country but cultivation best

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,760
practices are being codified and shared

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:24,160
online like never before

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,800
using mushrooms at different doses makes

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,480
for very different experiences a micro

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,960
dose is intended that you don't feel it

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,119
at all while a half to a full gram makes

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,120
for a fun day of exploration and of

13
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,839
course you can keep going up in dosage

14
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,439
from there to have a very powerful human

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,360
experience

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,759
anywhere along this range of dosing

17
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,399
though can change the trajectory of your

18
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,320
life

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,320
because mushrooms have such a profound

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,799
impact on brain function

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,159
but we really don't know why and isn't

22
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,078
that odd

23
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,839
mushrooms have been used by humans since

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,640
the beginning of recorded history and

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,280
yet they have been taboo and barred from

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,600
research in the modern scientific era

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,198
but happily those challenges to research

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,040
are coming down

29
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,359
this isn't to say that we know nothing

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,118
about how mushrooms function it's just

31
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,280
that most hallucinogenic mushroom

32
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,280
research has not been approved up until

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,118
now and scientists who were doing the

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,759
research during the dark days were

35
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,118
shunned if they talked about it

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,400
if you want to learn about cannabis

00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,239

i'm your host shango los

59
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,920
today my guest is neuropharmacologist

60
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,079
miyabi shields phd

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,800
dr shields is co-founder of real

62
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,040
isolates which ironically focuses on the

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,280
importance of secondary plant components

64
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,359
and synergistic cannabis blends so

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
essentially whole plant medicine

66
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,360
miyabi received their phd in

67
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,039
pharmaceutical sciences focusing on the

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,959
biochemistry of the endocannabinoid

69
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,400

70
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,878
2018

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,959
miyabi has authored or co-authored six

72
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,359
peer-reviewed publications and presently

73
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,840
has a patent under review for a novel

74
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,400
fungus and plant extraction method

75
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,120
miyabi also has a substantial list of

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,800
honors and awards including a 2016

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,360
their tick tock channel at miyabi phd

80
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,280
has 180 000 followers and is where i

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,680
first met miyabi

82
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,598
today's episode is really special i have

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,840
not found this information available

84
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,679
anywhere else during the first set we

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,000
will describe the interrelated body

86
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,760
systems that are stimulated by silicon

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080
and how these systems interact at a

88
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,158
chemical level the second set is all

89
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,280
about dosing thresholds and mechanics of

90
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,959
tolerance

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,039
and during the third set we focus on

92
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,878
specific applications for this knowledge

93
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,639
and how to effectively use psilocybin

94
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,000
mushrooms to improve your health and

95
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,639
life

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,959
welcome back to shaping fire miyabi

97
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,359
i'm so excited to be here today i'm you

98
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,439
know it's really gotten to be fun to

99
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,360
have you back a few times and we clearly

100
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,959
get along and chat so well i've gotten

101
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,959
to the point where i'm not you know i i

102
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,560
mean i still get nervous before i record

103
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,039
most of these shows because i want to

104
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,479
get it right you know um but i'm so

105
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,479
comfortable with you and we have such an

106
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,479
easy time chatting like i was just

107
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,359
excited to get together and chat with

108
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,759
you today there was not the uh the the

109
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,760
kind of nervous anxiety so so i'm stoked

110
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,399
that we've gotten to that point

111
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,878
totally i feel like we just have so much

112
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,080
in common and in what we're interested

113
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,479
in and

114
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,439
i'm really really also just excited to

115
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,679
touch on these topics uh you know i'm

116
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,680
super passionate about molecular

117
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,120
pharmacology and i think these two

118
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,159
things don't often get talked about

119
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,879
together and i'm excited to uh to dive

120
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,560
into that right on so um i think we

121
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,798
should start this show off with a little

122
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,959
preamp because you know you and i came

123
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,679
up with the idea for this show from us

124
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,840
just chatting as as now friends

125
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,840
and uh we're gonna be going back and

126
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,839
forth

127
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,918
between um you know historical

128
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,399
scientific papers

129
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:38,159
new scientific papers

130
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,399
and i guess what i'd call like like uh

131
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,600
informed conjecture on your part because

132
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,638
you're like you're a pharmacologist

133
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,280
you're you know you're one of the

134
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,040
experts in the field in this area and

135
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,198
some of your some of the stuff that

136
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,280
you're going to say today is

137
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,680
you know we haven't been allowed to

138
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,439
study yet and i think it's important for

139
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,240
people to understand that you know

140
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,240
you're qualified to make these educated

141
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,960
guesses but you're gonna you're gonna

142
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,519
kind of let us know where the hard

143
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,638
science ends and your conjecture begins

144
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,399
right

145
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,800
definitely i mean we are gonna be

146
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:15,198
entering into a space of abstract theory

147
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,000
which is that we know about these

148
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,919
systems and we know like certain facts

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,038
about how the systems interact with one

150
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,680
another

151
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,680
but we don't know like how that could

152
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,759
directly be extrapolated into the human

153
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,199
brain because the human brain is so

154
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:34,000
complex at the same time we have all of

155
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,759
this information from the general public

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,038
and people who have

157
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,720
reported and written and shared all of

158
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,759
these experiences

159
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,199
activating one or both of these systems

160
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,000
and so we're going to be like kind of

161
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,478
piecing through the big gap between

162
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,199
those two spaces

163
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:56,318
right on cool so with that said let's

164
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,680
get right into it so um

165
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,800
i understand that when we consume a

166
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,120
psilocybin mushroom or you know uh we

167
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,720
might call it a philosophy mushroom if

168
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,199
we want to talk about you know the

169
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,280
species but that's a mushroom that has

170
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,800
psilocybin the chemical in it so a

171
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,758
philosophy mushroom has psilocybin in it

172
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,160
and

173
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,199
once it's in the human body it's not

174
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,160
actually the psilocybin which creates

175
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:27,600
the the the reaction in the human body

176
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,880
it's actually silicin and so a silicy

177
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,520
mushroom has psilocybin in it which our

178
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,600
body converts to silicon and so it's the

179
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,799
silicon that's the active ingredient in

180
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,160
the end for us so would you explain that

181
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,360
process because i've never actually

182
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,280
heard it explained clearly um how our

183
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,038
body changes the psilocybin into the

184
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,399
silicon

185
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:55,439
so it's actually really similar it's

186
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,239
it's pretty similar to decarbon cannabis

187
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:02,079
the difference is that our body is very

188
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,280
efficient at changing uh psilocybin into

189
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,478
salocin

190
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,799
and um

191
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,680
basically the molecule psilocybin has a

192
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,840
phosphate group on it and a phosphate

193
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,759
group is this like very negatively

194
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,959
charged like bulky

195
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,840
uh piece of the molecule and that group

196
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,239
does a couple things it prevents it from

197
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,159
easily crossing into the brain it also

198
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,720
prevents it from binding to the

199
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,680
receptors and all of the effects are

200
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,319
felt when a molecule is able to bind and

201
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,079
activate a receptor so that phosphate

202
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,560
group changes the shape of the molecule

203
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,198
right it's this big bulky

204
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,759
negatively charged like piece on the

205
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,520
edge of it and so psilocybin is not

206
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,439
active but our body contains an enzyme

207
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,439
an enzyme is like a little machine that

208
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,560
does a chemical reaction

209
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,719
and our body takes psilocybin and turns

210
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,598
it into cellosin

211
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,080
by taking away that phosphate group and

212
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:03,038
leaving behind just an oxygen and a

213
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,439
hydrogen or a hydroxyl group and that's

214
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,159
what makes it active so psilocybin is

215
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,639
actually what would be called a pro drug

216
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,199
in pharmaceutical sciences there are

217
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,000
quite a few pro drugs actually um i

218
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,919
believe aspirin is an example of a pro

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,120
jug which is something that goes into

220
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,799
your body and then becomes activated by

221
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,280
the body so it's just like a different

222
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,478
class of molecules and they're not

223
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:31,598
active on their own they become active

224
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,519
when our body either in this case takes

225
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,240
off that phosphate group and then

226
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,519
removes that big bulky negative charge

227
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,120
and allows it to activate the receptors

228
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:46,879
okay so so once our body has removed

229
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,679
that group and and it becomes this uh

230
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,519
more

231
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,079
i don't know digestible or that's

232
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,679
probably bad choice of words but um

233
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,120
a usable uh salosin um that i had i had

234
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,759
not heard that pronunciation of it all

235
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,440
you start using that um

236
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,559
what does it go and bind with because

237
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,240
like you know the other times you've

238
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,929
been here when we've been doing the

239
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,039
endocannabinoid mechanics

240
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:09,039
[Applause]

241
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,879
uh series we're always talking about the

242
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,919
endocannabinoid system right and and

243
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,120
we're going to talk more about the

244
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:18,399
endocannabinoid system in second set but

245
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,879
what is this solosin molecule looking

246
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,879
for to connect with

247
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,480
also quickly i don't know that that

248
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,639
pronunciation is right or wrong i think

249
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,039
it's kind of like tomato tomato and

250
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,799
people prefer to pronounce things the

251
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,799
way that in my in my opinion some of

252
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,278
these things are pretty just pronounced

253
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,879
the way um that you've heard other

254
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,278
people pronounce them

255
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,120
but back to your question um what do

256
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,519
they activate so they activate the

257
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,000
serotonin system and serotonin system

258
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,120
receptors there are so many of these and

259
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,320
if you have ever seen the molecule it is

260
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,959
really really similar to serotonin

261
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,160
serotonin is a

262
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,719
tryptamine

263
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:02,399
it's in a class of molecules that is

264
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,399
created from the amino acid tryptophan

265
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,759
and they have a very distinctive

266
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,000
shape to them and solosin is almost

267
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,919
identical to serotonin they're very very

268
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,919
similar and so what you were saying

269
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,278
before um instead of calling it like

270
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,519
digestible

271
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:20,240
um what i would say is that cellosin

272
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,240
like is a puzzle piece that fits it fits

273
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,159
into the puzzle better

274
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,799
after the phosphate group has been

275
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,240
removed because it's trying to fit into

276
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,039
the same spot

277
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,720
on the receptors as serotonin

278
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:37,278
and it's the similarity in those shapes

279
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,720
that allows it to bind to it so

280
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,200
silic

281
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,879
solosin psilocybin doesn't bind very

282
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,480
well to any of the receptors as we

283
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,838
mentioned before it doesn't fit but

284
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,320
silocin binds really well to many of the

285
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,120
serotonin receptors i've heard it been

286
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,640
called a pan agonist before pan meaning

287
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,039
everything right

288
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,278
but it doesn't bind equally to all of

289
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,679
those serotonin receptors it does favor

290
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,919
some over the other specifically in

291
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,958
terms of like psychedelic psychoactive

292
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,278
effects

293
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,639
it's been linked mostly to the serotonin

294
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,200
2a

295
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,199
receptor it's a subreceptor type i

296
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,278
believe there are 18 there's there's

297
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,399
quite a few different types of serotonin

298
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:21,120
receptors we don't have data for every

299
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,679
single subtype of receptor

300
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,639
monsolosin and i think the only one that

301
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:30,078
i saw that it does not bind well to is

302
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,240
the serotonin 3 subtype receptor and

303
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,879
that receptor is actually a completely

304
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,440
different like type of switch if you

305
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,360
imagine these receptors are like

306
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,680
on and off switches

307
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,919
uh in the body that start all of these

308
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,919
domino effects there are these different

309
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,679
types of of switches right like i guess

310
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:50,799
if i'm going with this metaphor there's

311
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,958
like a regular light switch that you see

312
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,359
there's like a dimmer switch there are

313
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,879
like those metallic on and off switches

314
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,480
there's switches that are just buttons

315
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,799
that you press on and off and the

316
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,879
serotonin 3 receptor is a different

317
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,039
subtype than all the others and i think

318
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:08,078
that's in my opinion probably why it

319
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:11,199
doesn't bind as well to salosin but in

320
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:15,120
terms of the the activation um otherwise

321
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,480
it it seems like solosin activates

322
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,440
almost all of the other serotonin system

323
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,800
receptor subtypes which means that it

324
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,519
mimics serotonin in the brain

325
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,958
it's interesting too if it's a

326
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,200
pan-agonist and to use your light switch

327
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,919
example it kind of kind of makes me

328
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,600
think of like when you go into um

329
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,919
like a big auditorium or something

330
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,000
you'll see as you enter you know often

331
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,759
they'll be like a string of like seven

332
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,559
or eight light switches for like

333
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,799
different parts of the hall right and i

334
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,199
imagine silicon just showing up in the

335
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:53,359
human brain going let's party and just

336
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,759
like flick them all on you know um

337
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,200
is is the serotonin

338
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,879
um

339
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:04,240
receptor the only variety of receptor

340
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,720
that that silson is connecting to i mean

341
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,600
as we know when you when you take

342
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,519
you know

343
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,680
hallucinogenic mushrooms your brain just

344
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,000
like lights up right when you know we

345
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,919
know it as a first person experience but

346
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,320
we also know that when they when they

347
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,759
put people in you know mris when they're

348
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,240
when they're using and stuff that are

349
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,679
and or similar and people's brains are

350
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,320
just like lit up um are there other

351
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,559
um types of receptors that accept

352
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,079
silicon as well or is it mostly just in

353
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,239
the serotonin group

354
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,239
so from what i've read it's mostly just

355
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,720
in the serotonin group but the fact that

356
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,519
it's all of the serotonin subtypes is

357
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,800
what makes it very very unique to that

358
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:48,320
activity um i i think it here's another

359
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:50,639
thing that i'm unsure about is um so a

360
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,240
lot of the literature in the scientific

361
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,440
the previous scientific literature

362
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,839
focuses on serotonin i'm not sure that

363
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,240
every receptor subtype has actually been

364
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,800
tested because often

365
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,759
you only see what you're looking for and

366
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,359
it's not i'm not positive that it's been

367
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,198
you know ruled out that it wouldn't

368
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,278
interact with other receptors i think

369
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,439
the only one i know for certain that has

370
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,919
been ruled out that i saw was the

371
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,600
dopamine d2 receptor because that's one

372
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,919
key difference between

373
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,639
serotonin and lsd

374
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,120
is that lsd does activate the d2

375
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,560
receptor and sorry not serotonin

376
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,120
psilocybin and

377
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,359
salocin do not activate the dopamine

378
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,759
system whereas lsd does

379
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,278
activate that system partially so that's

380
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,679
the only one that i know

381
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,679
that i can speak to um

382
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,719
for certain that hasn't been like ruled

383
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,479
out but i i think that in terms of like

384
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,879
are there other there's it's kind of a

385
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,800
trick question because um are there

386
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,039
other things that are in the mushrooms

387
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,319
that could be activating other systems

388
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,759
that is very very possible and also

389
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,639
unexplored

390
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,159
all right um

391
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,198
so

392
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:06,078
because you study the serotonin system

393
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:08,159
so intimately you've got a different

394
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,479
perspective than just about everybody

395
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,679
else and i would like to hear your

396
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,920
thoughts on how

397
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,759
rare and

398
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:22,799
neat it is that that this one

399
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,360
molecule lights up so many serotonin

400
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:28,078
receptors at the same time right because

401
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:32,399
by by you saying that it suggests to me

402
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:34,638
that that most other molecules would not

403
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,198
light up so many of the different

404
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,879
serotonin receptors like how cool is

405
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,838
that like talk to us about like the

406
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:45,278
rarity of that and and why

407
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,279
mushrooms are unique because of that

408
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,159
so i think the most i think one of the

409
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,360
most interesting things is this contrast

410
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,958
from from my background in

411
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,800
pharmaceutical sciences it's the

412
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,879
contrast of um

413
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,599
you know synthetic pharmaceuticals that

414
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,759
target the the serotonin system all of

415
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,040
them kind of are structured around

416
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,959
avoiding the serotonin ii receptor

417
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,360
family because they're trying to like

418
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:14,000
avoid the effects

419
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,959
and it's it is rare um in terms of how

420
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,399
strongly it activates it it's rare i

421
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,719
know that there are other natural

422
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,720
products out there and other

423
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,199
naturally occurring molecules that do

424
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,920
work upon the serotonin system but they

425
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,719
don't do it with such like veracity or

426
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,319
potency like it's it's a very potent

427
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,079
interaction

428
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,120
and the reason for that is because it's

429
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,479
very very similar to serotonin and

430
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,600
another thing that's interesting about

431
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,399
psilocybin that i've always wondered um

432
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,920
is

433
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,919
it's purpose i guess i've always just

434
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,479
wondered about its original purpose in

435
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,559
the mushrooms because it clearly must be

436
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,399
doing something for them as well

437
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,239
and it's this is something that's like

438
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,639
far outside but in terms of natural

439
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,440
products you know these molecules in

440
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,839
these plants and in these funguses they

441
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,759
they are serving a purpose for those

442
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,480
living plants and living funguses as

443
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,279
well

444
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,838
and there's this big um

445
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,318
there's this big like homology or

446
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,798
similarity between all of those

447
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,038
molecules in the plants and in funguses

448
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:19,679
and in bacteria and in other living

449
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,798
things and then in all of the molecules

450
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,319
like inside us inside our brains and

451
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,400
bodies and

452
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,879
like circulating around in our blood

453
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,080
causing signaling systems and immune

454
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,280
system responses and i think it's

455
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:39,279
amazing that living things produce

456
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:42,160
molecules that are so comparable and so

457
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,319
active on the human systems

458
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,480
and that's just it's always been really

459
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,319
magical to me it's been a magical thing

460
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,319
with cannabis and the endocannabinoid

461
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,038
system and i think it's magical with the

462
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:55,519
serotonergics as well i think there's an

463
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,879
evolutionary link there

464
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,200
yeah i would have to agree with that and

465
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,679
you know you know you calling it magical

466
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,279
is one of the you know least scientific

467
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,519
things i've ever heard you say but it's

468
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:08,000
also it's also like really true right i

469
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,759
mean there are reasons why

470
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,558
humans have

471
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,440
um

472
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,200
put

473
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:18,480
mushrooms on a on a spiritual magical

474
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,519
otherworldly pedestal because the

475
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,720
effects that it has on the human brain

476
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,079
are

477
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,480
like literally mind-blowing right and so

478
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,199
um and it's beyond our

479
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,240
present um

480
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,038
scientific knowledge though we're we're

481
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,880
getting able to research more of it now

482
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,038
but but historically like if you don't

483
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,600
know what's how something functions it's

484
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,200
magic right and so that's not really an

485
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,279
inaccurate term

486
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,640
no and there's and it's it's also not

487
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:53,759
inaccurate that there is still so much

488
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,240
unknown left in the world even with the

489
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,279
amount of science that we have and i i i

490
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,359
love science i'm you know science is my

491
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,519
my passion but one of the things that i

492
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:07,119
learned from it is just this giant you

493
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,918
know giant unknown that is still there

494
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,119
and

495
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,280
in terms of like spirituality and

496
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,839
that level of unknown and that level of

497
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,240
faith there we're not we're not at a

498
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,119
place yet where we actually can say we

499
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,720
have a big understanding of it and in in

500
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,959
the research on

501
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,079
psychedelics they use this word

502
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,000
sometimes

503
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:33,439
in ineffable which means like you can't

504
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,558
describe it in words i i believe is the

505
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,919
definition

506
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:40,240
and that is something that i think is

507
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,559
really fascinating about specifically

508
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,240
the serotonin system um also the

509
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,480
endocannabinoid system and how they work

510
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,440
together but specifically linked to

511
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,319
serotonergic psychedelic experiences

512
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,519
is that it can create feelings and

513
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:58,798
experiences that are ineffable they're

514
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,000
mis they're mystic and magic and

515
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,359
spiritual

516
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,159
and deep

517
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,599
and we have yet to be able because we

518
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,200
can't describe them because they're

519
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:11,359
ineffable it's very very difficult to

520
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,159
study them but the fact that that comes

521
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:17,038
from these molecules that are also from

522
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,480
a living thing part of this planet is

523
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:23,038
just it is magical and yeah i love

524
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,440
um i love describing science that way

525
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,000
and i think it's it seems like a

526
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,679
hypocritical like um

527
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,480
maybe not hypocritical but it seems to

528
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,600
be like it would be in contrast to

529
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,640
itself but i've always said that um in

530
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:41,119
terms of merging my my scientific

531
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,520
passion with my spiritual beliefs i've

532
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:46,319
always said that both both science and

533
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:49,519
spirituality are ways of embracing and

534
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:52,798
understanding this like giant unknown

535
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:55,119
in the universe and there's just there's

536
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,839
just so much unknown and i think that's

537
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:01,038
one of the things that exploring and i'm

538
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:04,079
so excited to see as we can like open up

539
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:06,079
research and explore these you know this

540
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,439
interaction with the serotonin system

541
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:11,119
more i'm excited to see what we find um

542
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,000
and i'm i wouldn't be surprised if we

543
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,759
don't just find even more unknown yeah

544
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,919
amen and now i'm gonna go one more i'm

545
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,599
gonna go one more step into this unknown

546
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,440
magical spiritual before we get back to

547
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,599
the hard science and that is

548
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,840
um you know this this idea of an

549
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,798
ineffable experience comes up all the

550
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,519
time when talking about dmt

551
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:33,038
dimethyltryptamine

552
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:36,400
the experiences that humans have on on

553
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,000
significant doses of that drug are so

554
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,759
beyond

555
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,400
human regular experience that um it's

556
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:49,519
it's really cool that that

557
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:52,159
whole new descriptors have evolved

558
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,720
when talking about dmt and the

559
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:58,320
experience and and how it changes and

560
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,919
rewires the human brain

561
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:04,960
it demands the development of first new

562
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,799
vocabulary to decide to describe it if

563
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,038
so that humans can share their

564
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,279
experiences and then once it gets in

565
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:14,798
hand the hands of like scientific

566
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,000
researchers like you then then that kind

567
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,240
of

568
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,279
potentially sloppy

569
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,240
um new magical vocabulary that people

570
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:28,639
use to describe it then demands

571
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,880
new specific scientific vocabulary

572
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,679
and understanding to describe it at a

573
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,120
scientific level and um i think that

574
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,640
this kind of

575
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:42,239
um growth of the ineffable

576
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,159
drug experience becoming more

577
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,558
um

578
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,159
malleable by humans where we can like

579
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,158
talk about them and understand them more

580
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,039
i think that we are right at the front

581
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,679
of this this huge explosion of this kind

582
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,879
of learning by humans everywhere because

583
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,038
we're all getting

584
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,440
easier access to

585
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,240
these these plant medicines

586
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,720
and

587
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,400
um and and scientists are more

588
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,600
encouraged to research them now for

589
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,400
whatever reasons yeah it's just so much

590
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,079
more available and there's so much more

591
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,919
communication in the community that

592
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,798
helps i mean i think it's incredible

593
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:22,640
that so many people can have such

594
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:26,158
similar experiences also dmt is very

595
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:29,360
very similar um molecule to cellosin

596
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,880
they are almost identical because dmt is

597
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,038
almost identical to serotonin and

598
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,760
they're they're very similar in that way

599
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,158
but what i was describing earlier with

600
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,319
psilocybin turning into salicin

601
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,278
when you remove a phosphate group and

602
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,359
you leave a hydroxyl group just the oh

603
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,839
if you were to remove that hydroxyl

604
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,558
group that would be dmt

605
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,359
and

606
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,798
they're they're incredibly similar

607
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,038
molecules but then they have these

608
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,960
different effects and then the community

609
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,359
and what i was mentioning earlier about

610
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,679
how we have all of this information from

611
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,839
the community and from people who are

612
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,640
actively you know using and

613
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,720
using these these molecules and then

614
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,559
reporting on their experiences and

615
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,600
they're they're comparable they're

616
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,879
similar experiences and that ineffable

617
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,158
um

618
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,080
you know that

619
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,480
that ineffable experience or that

620
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,319
mysticism experience it's also given a

621
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,480
third name in in scientific literature

622
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:28,399
called oceanic boundlessness and that um

623
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,278
you know that entire

624
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,519
like experience is linked to actually

625
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:37,200
better outcomes like better health

626
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:40,158
outcomes and it's it's in to me super

627
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,919
interesting because essentially i equate

628
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,799
that in in some way

629
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,038
this is this is like my understanding of

630
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,960
it is that that's equated to me with

631
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,720
like a spiritual wellness or something

632
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,798
that is ineffable it's not something

633
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,679
that we're quantifying right now but we

634
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,119
can

635
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,960
say that if you have that mystical

636
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,359
ineffable experience or if you have

637
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,360
something like that that there is a

638
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,798
significant chance that it increases

639
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,479
your health outcome

640
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,599
which is a physical

641
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,679
quantitative response and so that is

642
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,639
just a piece down this road of this

643
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,038
whole like mind-body connection that

644
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,440
i think um you know is under is

645
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,919
under-researched i would say even

646
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,759
in all the things that i've read and

647
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,919
this is one of my things that i'm super

648
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,079
passionate about we're just scratching

649
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,038
the surface on understanding the

650
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:34,879
connection between our mind our bodies

651
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:37,919
and then how we view that connection to

652
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,600
the world and the rest of like the life

653
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,520
that's on this planet

654
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,599
beautiful i love how you put that all

655
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,079
right so let's let's bring us back in um

656
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:47,839
for back to the the heart harder science

657
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,359
uh that was a good that was away from

658
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,199
the tangent yeah that was that was a

659
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,359
good tangent but so let's bring it back

660
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,440
so so on on the during the

661
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:57,678
endocannabinoid mechanics

662
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,558
a series that we've been doing together

663
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,000
um you mentioned kind of um as a passing

664
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,240
thought that

665
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,278
mushrooms interact with the

666
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,200
endocannabinoid system too which was

667
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,000
originally what gave me the idea for for

668
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:14,000
this episode um you've already explained

669
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,480
to us very clearly how the the um

670
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,798
the the silicon

671
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,519
molecule lights up so many of the

672
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,599
serotonin receptors after that

673
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:27,440
particular group is stripped off to

674
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:29,678
stripped off it um i'm curious how um

675
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,798
this the silicon molecule interacts with

676
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:36,159
the endocannabinoid system as well

677
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:38,639
so there's two different ways and it's

678
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,440
it's like an indirect way so the first

679
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,038
one

680
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,880
is that the 2a the serotonin to a

681
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,400
receptor which is the one that's been

682
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,080
linked to

683
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,080
um the psychedelic experiences like

684
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:54,759
that receptor when you activate it

685
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:57,119
actually leads to an increase in

686
00:26:54,759 --> 00:27:00,079
endocannabinoids that's one of the

687
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:03,038
that's one of the downstream effects of

688
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:05,119
activating this receptor and so in the

689
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,919
first way you're increasing your level

690
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,839
of of endocannabinoids like after you

691
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,320
take psilocybin because it activates

692
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,240
these receptors and that's part of what

693
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,079
what those receptors do

694
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,480
the next way is a little bit more

695
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:22,000
complicated and it has to do with the

696
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,240
fact that we more recently have learned

697
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,319
that these receptors are not operating

698
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,599
by themselves so when i say like the

699
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,439
serotonin

700
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:32,240
um

701
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,798
5ht2a receptor you know previously to

702
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,000
let's say like 10 years ago

703
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:40,639
we were all assuming that that receptor

704
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,798
kind of operated by itself or it

705
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,480
operated with another version of the

706
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:47,200
same receptor like serotonin and

707
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,640
serotonin and it was only more recently

708
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,278
that we've discovered

709
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,080
that these receptors can actually

710
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,558
bind to another receptor in a different

711
00:27:54,079 --> 00:28:00,240
system and that that will change the way

712
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:03,278
that it signals and not much is known

713
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,278
in terms of how it changes the signaling

714
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:08,240
and what the downstream effects of this

715
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:12,319
are but what is known is that the

716
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,798
serotonin 5ht2a receptor does bind to

717
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,359
the cb1 receptor which is the main

718
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,519
endocannabinoid system receptor and the

719
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,199
receptor that's responsible for the

720
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,679
therapeutic effects or most of the

721
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,640
therapeutic effects of cannabis

722
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,640
and so that piece of it is less

723
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,759
understood but

724
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,880
is there there is some population in the

725
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:37,038
brain of serotonin 2a receptors that

726
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,480
when they are being activated by

727
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:43,200
salosine will probably be attached to a

728
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,480
cb1 receptor at least in part like they

729
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,440
exist together in the brain cells

730
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,679
and will come together and

731
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,919
operate together and when those two

732
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,759
receptors are operating together their

733
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,799
signaling can be altered and we don't

734
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:02,240
really have a a great um tangible grasp

735
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,918
on how and what that does but we do know

736
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,000
that it affects the endocannabinoid

737
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,840
system because the cb1 receptor is the

738
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,720
main receptor for the endocannabinoid

739
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,359
system

740
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,839
okay um let's take one step back for a

741
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,599
moment um i think i probably should have

742
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:18,079
started the set with this but would you

743
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,639
give like a just like an easy thumbnail

744
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,879
explanation of what the serotonin system

745
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,440
is in the human body for for folks who

746
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,760
may not be familiar with it

747
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,919
okay sure yeah the serotonin system is

748
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,798
one of the best known like

749
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,759
neurotransmitter signaling systems in

750
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:38,158
the brain and in the body we talk a lot

751
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:41,200
about serotonin making you happy i think

752
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,039
that's usually one of the main

753
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,319
one of the main associations that people

754
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:48,319
have with it but serotonin is a molecule

755
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,119
and the serotonin system just like the

756
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:54,480
endocannabinoid system is made up of the

757
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:57,119
receptors and the enzymes that work upon

758
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,919
the serotonin molecule and serotonin

759
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:02,558
controls a lot of very very important

760
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,559
functions and i this is where my

761
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,558
interest originally came to the table is

762
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:08,398
that the serotonin system and the

763
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,278
endocannabinoid system actually have

764
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:13,278
like a huge overlap in the things that

765
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,679
they control and how they work together

766
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:18,880
and they're localized in some of the

767
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,798
similar areas in how they like modify

768
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,720
this control um one of the most

769
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,918
important ones being like the brain and

770
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,200
the gut or the gi tract interaction so

771
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,600
serotonin

772
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,840
just like the endocannabinoids is a

773
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,639
signaling molecule and the system itself

774
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,480
is all over your body and controls like

775
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,799
a huge number of things that's why

776
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,319
there's so many different receptors and

777
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:41,440
that's why they are

778
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,359
you know

779
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,519
expressed in different parts of of the

780
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,439
brain and the body that help to to

781
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,679
regulate these um

782
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,840
these different processes

783
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,919
so that sets up my next question great

784
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:54,879
because i was going to follow up with

785
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,480
you know

786
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,600
are are the serotonin system and the

787
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,319
endocannabinoid system

788
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,759
like standing next to each other at at

789
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:07,519
equal

790
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:10,798
levels of complexity and control or

791
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,599
does the endocannabinoid system

792
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:16,000
control slash

793
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,359
balance the serotonin system because

794
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,398
when we talk about the endocannabinoid

795
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,918
system we're all talk we're always

796
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,918
talking about how it's the

797
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,519
the body's natural thermostat and if

798
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,278
you've got a system that's running hot

799
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,079
it'll cool it down and if it's running

800
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:31,119
if it's sluggish it'll it'll pick it up

801
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:33,918
is is the serotonin cycle is the

802
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,678
serotonin system one of the systems the

803
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,880
endocannabinoid

804
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,720
system

805
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,799
modulates or are they are they are they

806
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,319
like two different cooks in the kitchen

807
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:45,440
sounds like there's a lot of overlap so

808
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,558
i'm not really sure how you're gonna

809
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,759
answer that

810
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,119
yeah it's it's a complicated answer i i

811
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,519
usually say that it's it's a

812
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:56,158
relationship the best metaphor i have

813
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,399
for it is probably marriage i think it's

814
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,720
like a marriage they both

815
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,278
um have things that they take care of on

816
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,600
their own and together but neither one

817
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:08,880
of them almost ever operates without

818
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,839
some form of feedback from the other

819
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,720
system

820
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,879
um so like for an example of this as i

821
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,360
mentioned earlier if you activate the 2a

822
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,360
the serotonin 2a receptor you end up

823
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:20,479
with elevated levels of endocannabinoids

824
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,359
so that's

825
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,000
an example of the serotonin system

826
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:28,798
modifying the endocannabinoid system on

827
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,599
the flip side the endocannabinoid system

828
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:34,798
is capable of modifying levels of

829
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:37,599
serotonin um is capable of modifying the

830
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:40,319
risk the the density of the serotonin

831
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:42,079
receptors so it goes the other direction

832
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,798
and they they fulfill very different

833
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:47,839
roles while they are also

834
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:50,240
modifying the same um like overall

835
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,319
purpose in in the body so they work

836
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,200
together sometimes they work against

837
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:59,439
each other other times and it's it's

838
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,919
incredibly complicated dance i think

839
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,399
all right so so we're talking about the

840
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,519
the complexity between these two systems

841
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:08,959
and how

842
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,720
they're getting turned on by by silicon

843
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,440
and you know we're usually talking about

844
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,120
the endocannabinoid system and and whole

845
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,440
plant medicine right because both you

846
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,639
and i are very much whole plant cannabis

847
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,440
advocates

848
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,038
and i know that mushrooms have their own

849
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,240
terpenes um are there reasons to make

850
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:31,440
sure that we take a whole mushroom or an

851
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,440
infused tea instead of isolated

852
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,880
psilocybin or

853
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,038
yeah they're probably psilocybin

854
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,880
crystals because like crystallized

855
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:40,158
psilocybin is becoming much more

856
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,039
available

857
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,120
as people have have made best practices

858
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,200
for that extraction process

859
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,518
and i know that a lot of people tend to

860
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,360
want to avoid eating the flesh of the

861
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,960
mushroom because

862
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,719
it upsets a lot of people's stomachs and

863
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,159
so like some people believe that you

864
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,759
should eat the whole mushroom some

865
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,720
people say you know since it's all water

866
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:02,079
soluble you do it in an infused tea and

867
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,319
then you can leave the flesh of the

868
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,639
mushroom you know in the strainer and

869
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,960
then some people just go for the crystal

870
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,358
because they see it to be more of a pure

871
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,199
easier on the stomach experience and i

872
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:15,598
don't think there's been a whole lot of

873
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,358
actual research on this yet except for

874
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,079
like you know individual psychonauts

875
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:22,878
doing it um but as far as like the brain

876
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,760
chemistry part of it you know is there

877
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:27,679
is there a justification for whole plant

878
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,639
mushroom

879
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,800
i i think that there is but i also you

880
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,559
know there's not a lot of research on

881
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,720
the different molecules that are in the

882
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,358
different strains of these mushrooms or

883
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,838
even just in them in the main strains so

884
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,000
in terms of like the active compounds

885
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:46,320
yes like psilocybin is the active

886
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,398
compound in in the mushrooms it's been

887
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,800
identified but there's going to be a lot

888
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,559
of other things present in the actual

889
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,879
living mushroom

890
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:58,320
and i i think that like the difference

891
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:00,000
between like the psilocybin there's a

892
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,680
pretty much a perfect analogy here

893
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,599
between that and

894
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,480
whole full spectrum

895
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,440
cannabis products and like say like a

896
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:13,199
rosin press or something that is like

897
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,159
extracted partially purified um versus

898
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,719
then like isolate or or distillate and i

899
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,639
think you know similar to cannabis i

900
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,879
think that there are advantages and

901
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,319
disadvantages to

902
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,079
each um

903
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,240
each version there are certainly

904
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,119
advantages to isolated forms of things

905
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:33,838
because uh for one it's reproducible

906
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,160
right like as opposed to whenever you

907
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,759
have a living um

908
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,239
whenever you have a living thing

909
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,800
producing you know a large number of

910
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,559
products there is the chance that they

911
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,160
will it's probable that you would get

912
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,119
different effects but i would argue that

913
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,799
that's also a positive um once you are

914
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,880
once you can understand it which we are

915
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,359
i think scratching the surface of of

916
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,920
doing that um i do know that there are

917
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,598
just so many things in all mushrooms not

918
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,320
just psilocybin mushrooms that are worth

919
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,320
investigating that haven't yet um there

920
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,559
are tons of like

921
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,559
different types besides even like its

922
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,159
own terpenes actually i recently read a

923
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:11,199
paper where they found molecules and

924
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,279
mushrooms that activate the

925
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,919
endocannabinoid system which makes them

926
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,960
cannabinoids um these are not psilocybin

927
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,079
mushrooms they're different mushrooms

928
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,760
but it's it's interesting because it's

929
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,200
it could exist in the psilocybin

930
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,720
mushrooms as well because we don't

931
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,799
actually have a ton of information on on

932
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,279
what that what that looks like and on

933
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,359
isolating those compounds and then

934
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,599
testing them against the receptors um

935
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:38,159
the order of operations would go first

936
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,000
like taking everything out of the

937
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:42,239
mushrooms and then kind of separating

938
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,679
them out into like types of molecules

939
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,399
and then like how many of them are

940
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:49,118
present and then testing those

941
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,079
individually um against each of the

942
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,720
receptors to see what is going on um and

943
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,280
i i haven't actually seen a ton of

944
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,358
information on the smaller what would be

945
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,160
like the rare molecules that are that

946
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:03,759
are in um the mushrooms but there's

947
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,719
certainly

948
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,000
many many that are there and probably

949
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:11,519
many that have yet to be investigated or

950
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,920
even discovered

951
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:17,119
what a great time to be

952
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,920
a you know a college or

953
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,680
or

954
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,200
post

955
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,519
postgraduate

956
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:26,399
student who is both a psychonaut and a

957
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:28,079
scientist like i remember back in school

958
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,800
you know there were there were

959
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,440
like the the odd folks who you knew were

960
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,640
doing drug stuff in the lab when i was

961
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,880
in school

962
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,519
but it was very shush and very frowned

963
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,358
upon and the school could not find out

964
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,920
but now there's like full-on programs

965
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,759
what a great time to be a scientist

966
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,519
psychonaut like all this stuff is open

967
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,160
to folks and we don't know it yet and

968
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,639
yet now we're allowed to research it i

969
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,879
think you just can't deny you can't deny

970
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,799
that there is therapeutic benefit

971
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,280
because there's there's therapeutic

972
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,560
benefit and there's also

973
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,160
you know it's the same thing that

974
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,639
happened the revolution with cannabis i

975
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:08,000
really think helped pave the way

976
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:10,559
for this to occur it's like something

977
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,159
that was so stigmatized and that still

978
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,039
is and i think that we still have work

979
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,159
to do

980
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,838
but you know it it has really changed

981
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:19,838
the culture around cannabis has really

982
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:21,920
changed and it's been a lot of work by a

983
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:24,239
lot of people who've come well before me

984
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,480
and you're one of them and has done a

985
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,319
lot of work in changing this this stigma

986
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,599
for the better and i think that that's

987
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,320
paved the way

988
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,079
because we are all able to see now or a

989
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,240
larger population is able to see like

990
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,880
wow there's a lot of therapeutic benefit

991
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,439
that has yet to be explored um

992
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,519
everyone's more open i think to that and

993
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,559
i i think it's really really exciting

994
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:49,039
because you can't deny that there's

995
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,119
therapeutic benefit here and that

996
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,119
understanding it will only help us to

997
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,079
like reduce the risk of the negative

998
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,880
effects

999
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,640
right on fantastic all right so um let's

1000
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,960
wrap this up and go to commercial during

1001
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:04,400

we're going to be talking a lot more

about specific dosing and thresholds for

dosing and so we're going to start off

1152
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,159
by

1153
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:36,159
defining some of these terms we're going

1154
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:38,879
to be using um if you just simply google

1155
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:40,559
you know mushroom dosage chart you'll

1156
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,440
find a lot of different

1157
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,679
um

1158
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,599
representations of this chart and you

1159
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,598
know there's a little bit of variability

1160
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,559
but generally the doses we're going to

1161
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,880
be talking about today fall into uh five

1162
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,199
different categories um the first is the

1163
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,358
micro dose and and while it's true that

1164
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,039
you know how much is the right micro

1165
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:01,119
dose for you is something that you need

1166
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:04,000
to work out for yourself generally

1167
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:08,640
speaking uh people discuss it as being

1168
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,519
0.1 gram of of the mushroom itself and

1169
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,440
you know um you know i prefer 0.08 some

1170
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,800
other people may uh you know have their

1171
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,480
own number but generally when we're

1172
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,280
talking about a micro dose we're talking

1173
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,519
about one um then there is a term i

1174
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,839
actually learned from miyabi uh when we

1175
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:26,000
were prepping for this which is a museum

1176
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:27,358
dose which is

1177
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,880
a little bit more than a micro dose

1178
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:31,920
you're actually looking to have you know

1179
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,519
a little bit more going on in your head

1180
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,400
which is going to be about more like

1181
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:37,679
like 0.5 of a gram so about about a half

1182
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,559
gram there

1183
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:42,799
um and then there is uh the mini dose

1184
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,358
and the mini dose is more like one to

1185
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,480
two grams so you're definitely going to

1186
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:51,199
get some you know psychoactive activity

1187
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,760
but uh you know you can probably still

1188
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:55,358
be around people and um but then there's

1189
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,960
then there's the macro dose which is

1190
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:59,519
going to be anywhere between three to

1191
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,039
four grams generally and at that point

1192
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:02,719
you're going to be having a significant

1193
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,880
response you know you're probably going

1194
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:07,598
to be more likely to avoid people

1195
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,920
um and and you know you'll be you'll be

1196
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,838
seeing you know sacred geometry and

1197
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,159
nature and and you're putting together a

1198
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:15,119
whole bunch of things and um you know

1199
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:16,719
often

1200
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,280
often um

1201
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,639
people can tell that you're tripping

1202
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,040
by this point

1203
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:25,838
and then above the macro above three to

1204
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:28,480
four grams um you know you know above

1205
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:31,440
four grams you know people go five six

1206
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,480
seven grams sometimes more which

1207
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,400
is

1208
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,719
epic and then these are generally called

1209
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,720
these like heroic doses or god seeing

1210
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,480
doses something like that so

1211
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:42,480
um so you can get yourself more familiar

1212
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,559
with this scale by simply you know

1213
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,400
googling mushroom dosage chart but but

1214
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,159
those are the general those that's the

1215
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,800
vocabulary that we're going to be using

1216
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:52,960
today all right with that said

1217
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,839
so miyabi like why do we often

1218
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,400
experience permanent or at least you

1219
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:01,199
know longish term temporary changes to

1220
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,800
ourselves after taking mushrooms because

1221
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:07,838
we we have the experience

1222
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,240
during that the after we take it right

1223
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,838
but but it feels like things change for

1224
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:14,318
us for a while and there's like this

1225
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:16,480
afterglow and then eventually it it

1226
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:20,159
feels like certain certain attributes

1227
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,159
wear off but certain learning stays um

1228
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:24,558
so so i'm kind of wondering if there's

1229
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:26,558
like a half-life for for a mushroom

1230
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,240
experience as far as like the neurology

1231
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,319
goes

1232
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:33,679
so i think in terms of the after effects

1233
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:36,079
or the after glow effects i think in my

1234
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:38,799
opinion those are directly linked to

1235
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,440
molecules or effects that the that the

1236
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,599
slows and molecules had that are still

1237
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,079
in your system actively in terms of the

1238
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,680
more longer term changes and effects

1239
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,200
that people can feel

1240
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:51,279
i think that's a that's a different

1241
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,960
that's a different piece but what both

1242
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,599
of them kind of point to in what's

1243
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,079
unique about the serotonergics and

1244
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,318
activating the serotonin system seems to

1245
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,680
be this disruption in what would be like

1246
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:06,000
the default pathway and all of us have

1247
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:07,440
like we we all have a ton of

1248
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,119
subconscious

1249
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:13,760
default brain activity that we're going

1250
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:17,519
through and that our brain just does

1251
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,200
automatically for us and we can try um

1252
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,559
to consciously

1253
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,639
think of things from different

1254
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,359
perspectives but i mean i think most of

1255
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:26,799
us have had a situation in our lives

1256
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:28,719
where we've thought through something a

1257
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,400
million different ways and we can't seem

1258
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,639
to find a way through right or we can we

1259
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,200
can't approach the problem from any more

1260
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:37,759
ways than we're aware of and a piece of

1261
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:40,399
that comes from our brain being stuck in

1262
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,480
some of these like similar pathways and

1263
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,639
so one of the reasons why i think that

1264
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,039
there are these lasting effects has to

1265
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:49,519
do with just the disruption of that

1266
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:51,838
pattern the disruption of the same

1267
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,119
patterns happening over and over and

1268
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:55,679
over again

1269
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,680
and the creation of new patterns and

1270
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:59,919
sometimes i think that

1271
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,279
in terms of like an after effect and

1272
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,200
some of them staying or some of them

1273
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,000
leaving it could have to do with these

1274
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:09,439
pathways still being freshly activated

1275
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,838
there is a saying that neurons or so

1276
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,559
neurons or brain cells but brain cells

1277
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:17,119
that fire together will wire together

1278
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,559
and when a brain cell is activated and

1279
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,318
activates another brain cell and it

1280
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:23,119
makes this like new circuitry or this

1281
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:25,119
new path there are actual physical and

1282
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:28,240
chemical reactions between those two

1283
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,119
brain cells that facilitate them firing

1284
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:31,838
again

1285
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:35,519
and it isn't until they are kind of

1286
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:37,039
weeded out that they stop firing uh and

1287
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:39,679
i think that when

1288
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:42,079
you are activating your serotonin system

1289
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:43,759
you know with mushrooms and as we

1290
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,400
mentioned in the first set it's a

1291
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,119
pan-agonism or it's an activation of all

1292
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,720
different types of serotonin receptors

1293
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:54,720
all over the brain you end up creating a

1294
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:55,919
lot of new pathways or a lot of new

1295
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:58,159
signaling

1296
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,039
systems and you disrupt this this

1297
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:02,399
default um i've heard it described as a

1298
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:05,039
uh i think it's called the default

1299
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,720
network or a default mode i've heard it

1300
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:09,358
described that way

1301
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:11,199
in terms of disrupting that you're kind

1302
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:12,400
of taking

1303
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:16,159
your brain

1304
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:18,318
out of that that routine and like

1305
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,558
showing your brain or

1306
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:23,279
like facilitating your brain going down

1307
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,440
these other pathways that are new

1308
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,800
avenues to approach things and and new

1309
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,559
perspectives

1310
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,318
so that's that's one piece of it and

1311
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,440
then and then the other piece i think is

1312
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:33,679
something that we touched on a little

1313
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,159
bit earlier which is mysticism or

1314
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:38,239
oceanic boundlessness and or at the

1315
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:40,799
higher do at the higher doses and

1316
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:43,358
thresholds we were talking about um

1317
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,960
changes in your perception of yourself

1318
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:47,679
or your ego

1319
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,960
usually called ego death right or ego

1320
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,519
disillusion

1321
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,760
and changing the way that you perceive

1322
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,199
yourself and your identity and your

1323
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,599
place in the world

1324
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,159
and how that can have a

1325
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,760
a huge lasting effect on the on your

1326
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,399
perspective and how you approach like

1327
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,000
the rest of your life um so i'm not sure

1328
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,200
if that was too broad i've been

1329
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,719
answering

1330
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:10,078
for your question no that was that was

1331
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:12,078
that was good but i'm also going to

1332
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,079
follow up with something very specific

1333
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,240
right so so

1334
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,240
taking that as being true

1335
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:20,479
would you describe

1336
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:23,759
what what is happening at a very

1337
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,920
specific biological chemical level when

1338
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,440
we we all talk about these you know

1339
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,440
mushrooms help

1340
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,318
um create new neural paths and

1341
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,159
um

1342
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:37,279
mushrooms help

1343
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:39,039
deepen your neural paths

1344
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,400
what does that mean

1345
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:41,920
in

1346
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,000
um

1347
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,159
mechanically in the brain like that

1348
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
that's that's the storytelling way of

1349
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:49,759
saying it what's the specific chemical

1350
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,639
way of saying that

1351
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,040
so

1352
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:54,318
this the chemical way of saying is is

1353
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:56,159
that um

1354
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:58,159
if you imagine like your brain is like a

1355
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:00,239
network right like your brain is a

1356
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:03,598
network of transportation

1357
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:06,000
and things are going to and from um

1358
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,559
you know the stronger and more often so

1359
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,480
the more often like two brain cells will

1360
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,720
fire together the stronger that

1361
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,119
connection will be and in terms of the

1362
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:17,118
the biology and the chemistry of that it

1363
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,358
actually strengthens it in terms of like

1364
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,960
it will physically create proteins that

1365
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:23,440
will link themselves together that are

1366
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,519
like little velcro proteins it will

1367
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,000
become a bigger and stronger like

1368
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:29,679
surface area or synapse like area there

1369
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,318
are multiple ways that your body can

1370
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:34,558
make it so that that connection happens

1371
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:36,639
easier it's faster and easier it's like

1372
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,359
the equivalent i would say of like

1373
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:41,519
having a dirt road versus like a freeway

1374
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:43,679
um or a throughway where there's just

1375
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:45,838
like tons of lanes and tons of cars are

1376
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:47,598
moving and there's no lights or anything

1377
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:50,000
um and the more often that you use

1378
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,160
something or some pathway the more

1379
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,280
likely your brain is to turn that

1380
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:56,879
pathway into a freeway or a through way

1381
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,839
and that

1382
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,760
when you're

1383
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:02,159
when you're in a pattern or a habit or

1384
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,720
just actually as we go about our lives

1385
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:07,519
our brain is constantly trying to find

1386
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:09,679
the most efficient way to activate those

1387
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:12,480
same pathways that it does all of the

1388
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:15,199
time and so when it when you're saying

1389
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,280
that when you take a mushroom and it

1390
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:19,679
changes this neural pathway it promotes

1391
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,000
neural growth and it like deepens these

1392
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:24,078
pathways what you're saying is that the

1393
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,400
molecule activates these serotonin

1394
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:29,280
receptors then when it activates those

1395
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:32,559
serotonin receptors it causes a new

1396
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,720
pathway a new domino effect to occur and

1397
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,000
that when this domino effect happens and

1398
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:37,919
you have this

1399
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,838
this new pathway being opened up it

1400
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,280
deepens this connection between that

1401
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:42,558
otherwise wouldn't be there between

1402
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,160
these two brain cells because it's

1403
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,640
almost like a false

1404
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:49,358
connection it's it's stimulating or it's

1405
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:52,000
mimicking what would happen if serotonin

1406
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:55,199
had been released between those two

1407
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,239
cells does that yeah and so and so but

1408
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:01,039
when you say uh that this this pathway

1409
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:04,000
is being deepened um

1410
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:05,358
chemistry wise you're saying that more

1411
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,719
of these

1412
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:10,639
velcro

1413
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:14,399
like meshing proteins are being formed

1414
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:18,078
and so it's like having a a a thin

1415
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:21,200
copper cord connecting things versus

1416
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:23,200
a a big fat copper cord or some other

1417
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:25,919
it's like your your bandwidth is

1418
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:28,159
increasing along that path

1419
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,400
yeah and and your brain cells are all

1420
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:33,039
attached to usually they many of them

1421
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,920
have multiple connections and it they're

1422
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,920
constantly in flux like changing

1423
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,400
changing these connections although as

1424
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,000
we get older we do it less and less like

1425
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,559
in general

1426
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,519
it's often referred to as plasticity in

1427
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:50,960
general our brains become less plastic

1428
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:52,719
as we get older and so we start to only

1429
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,639
we start to only strengthen these

1430
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:56,879
connections that are currently being

1431
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:59,279
used and it's not always like the the

1432
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,119
proteins that um are like the velcro

1433
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,760
molecules it could also be like the

1434
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:06,240
levels of receptors that are present the

1435
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,119
levels of enzymes that are present or

1436
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:11,279
transporter proteins that are present um

1437
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:13,119
there's a few different ways it's i mean

1438
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,119
the body is very very

1439
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,798
um complex and in this amazing way

1440
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,480
there's a lot of like there's a lot of

1441
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:20,719
different ways to do the same thing and

1442
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,719
they all support each other um and so

1443
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:24,639
when when i say that like when you're

1444
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:27,118
when you're disrupting that pattern

1445
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:29,598
you're activating new pathways and

1446
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,760
you're you're kind of simulating uh

1447
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,440
maybe a new interaction that wouldn't

1448
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,359
have otherwise happened because there

1449
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,720
wouldn't be serotonin there

1450
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:39,039
right i totally thought so actually

1451
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:40,719
there's like a whole series of processes

1452
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:43,358
that happen it's not like

1453
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:46,399
one thing happens to

1454
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:48,480
to make the the neural net uh

1455
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,760
more robust it's actually

1456
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,240
making these vel velcro proteins it is

1457
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:58,000
uh setting out in new directions to make

1458
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,838
the neural network more complex and have

1459
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,280
more redundancies

1460
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:02,480
it's um

1461
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,760
i don't know i don't know what the other

1462
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,519
ones would be but the idea is it's a

1463
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,920
bunch of others

1464
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:10,559
yeah it could be even changing the gene

1465
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,880
expression of certain receptors or

1466
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,400
certain factors in the cell because

1467
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,079
these i mean i won't i'm not going to go

1468
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,480
into way too much detail on this part

1469
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,240
but it's these receptors like there's

1470
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,119
different classes of them and and we

1471
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,039
know

1472
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,440
so much about what they do with the

1473
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:27,759
signaling pathway when they're activated

1474
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,519
will go and it it can take this one

1475
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,280
thing called a g protein and it splits

1476
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:32,159
up into three other things and each of

1477
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,559
those

1478
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:36,159
three pieces that get split apart will

1479
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,319
go to a different part and do a

1480
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:40,639
different activity um and it's it's

1481
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:42,480
incredibly complex and it's beautiful

1482
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,239
and in my opinion

1483
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,199
and there's there's so many ways in

1484
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:50,318
which they end up being closer um tied

1485
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:51,759
to to one another and it's it's similar

1486
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:53,838
to um

1487
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,799
yeah i guess it's it's a it's a rounded

1488
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:57,039
approach

1489
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:58,719
that it happens in general it's this is

1490
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:01,440
not actually unique to any of the

1491
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:04,078
receptor systems it happens in general

1492
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,880
when you activate systems in tandem and

1493
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:08,079
when your brain is is forming these

1494
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,400
connections

1495
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:13,920
all right so let's move forward and

1496
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,920
let's talk about the differences in

1497
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,480
um

1498
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,079
the different results in in the neural

1499
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,318
network based on these different

1500
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,920
threshold doses that we set up at the

1501
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:26,079
top of the set so

1502
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,798
um because we know that like when when

1503
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:31,119
we apply these different doses we are

1504
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:33,440
trying to do different things and if we

1505
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,519
are getting different results

1506
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,079
um that's telling me that that the brain

1507
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:40,559
is firing differently on these different

1508
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:42,079
um amounts so so let's start by talking

1509
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,960
about micro dosing so we're talking

1510
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,318
about

1511
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:49,119
um uh uh you know we'll just use point

1512
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:52,079
one since that is generally um

1513
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:55,280
taken as the as the baseline micro dose

1514
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:57,440
so at so so more or less the the the

1515
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,000
main protocols that people follow are

1516
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,400
either like five days on two days off or

1517
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,798
three days on one day off which you know

1518
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,280
are wildly similar between the stamets

1519
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:09,119
and the fatimid protocols one way or

1520
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,160
another you're taking this small amount

1521
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,559
of

1522
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:13,920
0.1 for several days in a row and then

1523
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,559
you're taking a little break and then

1524
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:20,639
you're doing it again

1525
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:24,559
what do we know about what is happening

1526
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:26,078
for this repetitive micro dose

1527
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,599
versus

1528
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:30,000
what we'll talk about in a minute which

1529
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:33,359
is like when we take you know a mini or

1530
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,440
a macro dose what what is the

1531
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:38,078
uh what's going on mechanically in our

1532
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,599
brain that makes the micro dose um

1533
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:41,039
efficient

1534
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,039
very effective

1535
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,719
yes there's a there's a couple there's a

1536
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:47,599
couple different pieces of this one the

1537
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:49,838
first the first piece is actually what

1538
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:53,519
happens at a different dose to the

1539
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:54,960
receptor and i'll just pick the 5ht2a

1540
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:57,039
receptor since that's the one that's

1541
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,838
classically associated with the effects

1542
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:02,400
of mushrooms that receptor

1543
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:05,199
when we're talking about like how a

1544
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,639
molecule will attach to a receptor um

1545
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:08,159
there's activating it there's

1546
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:09,519
inactivating it and then there's like

1547
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:11,920
everything in between there's all of

1548
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:14,079
these ways in which you can do it but in

1549
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,519
in just like the most general way we can

1550
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,720
say it um solution activates the 5ht2a

1551
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:21,280
receptor

1552
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:23,598
but it does that for a certain amount of

1553
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,760
time and there is a statistical

1554
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:29,119
probability of it binding to the

1555
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,960
receptor so let's say solution

1556
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,960
is in the body like you're taking a

1557
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,039
micro dose of it

1558
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,079
there's not that much

1559
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:40,318
so there's not a large concentration and

1560
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,960
so the statistical probability that it

1561
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:45,759
will bind to the receptor is less

1562
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,838
which is part of how it makes it less

1563
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,319
active because there's less of them that

1564
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:53,440
will be bound to the receptors causing

1565
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:56,719
these effects so that's one difference

1566
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,480
is the number of molecules bound to

1567
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:02,000
these receptors

1568
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:05,199
as a result of the actual way like

1569
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,239
smaller amount that's that's present in

1570
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:08,399
the body

1571
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:10,959
because this is true for all receptors

1572
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,798
um all receptors and the interaction

1573
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,720
with their with the molecules that

1574
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:17,679
activate them whether that's you know

1575
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:21,118
drugs or molecules inside our bodies

1576
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:22,719
that um interaction is an equilibrium

1577
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,960
which just means that it's a balance

1578
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:28,159
between what is there and what is not

1579
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:30,000
there and so the more of any of the drug

1580
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:31,279
or any of the molecule that you have the

1581
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,400
more you're going to push that

1582
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,920
equilibrium to having the molecule bound

1583
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,599
to the receptor and there will be more

1584
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,880
and more of them bound so that's the

1585
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,318
first difference

1586
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,599
in terms of the micro dose you have like

1587
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:45,519
a very low amount and so you probably

1588
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:48,559
don't have all of your serotonin

1589
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:50,880
receptors bound to solution

1590
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:54,079
there's like it's highly likely that

1591
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,400
it's only a partial number of them at

1592
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:57,519
any given time because the dosage is

1593
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,760
lower

1594
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:01,838
and then that leads to differences in

1595
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,240
the downstream signaling

1596
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:06,318
because when the receptor is activated

1597
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:09,358
as i mentioned earlier it starts this

1598
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:11,119
really long signaling cascade and most

1599
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:14,000
of the time it ends up with a number of

1600
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:16,000
changes but those changes are additive

1601
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
right so if there's one receptor that's

1602
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,599
happening and then another receptor um

1603
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,358
that will be different than if there's

1604
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:22,720
only one

1605
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:24,798
i follow that

1606
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:26,000
um

1607
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:27,119
is there

1608
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,199
a

1609
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,599
does the variable that you're doing it

1610
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:33,439
so often adds something because like

1611
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:34,318
certainly macro doses which we'll talk

1612
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,400
about

1613
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:37,440
are you know have their own

1614
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,760
special

1615
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,559
you know benefits but

1616
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:45,680
uh i'm curious about the fact that

1617
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:48,400
taking this small amount five days in a

1618
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:51,199
row does does does hitting that same

1619
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,960
note again and again and again is there

1620
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:56,318
so like some kind of like

1621
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:58,480
like training that is taking place or or

1622
01:01:56,318 --> 01:02:00,719
when it's that often you're you're

1623
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,880
seeing reactions in other systems or

1624
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:06,719
something um there's got to be something

1625
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:08,000
to this um to doing it so often oh i'm

1626
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:09,519
so glad you brought that up because i

1627
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,280
would totally forgot about that was my

1628
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:13,759
second but it was my second piece that i

1629
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,359
was gonna say um the second piece of it

1630
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,400
that is different is that you're doing

1631
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:21,119
it regularly so on the first end you're

1632
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,039
only doing a very low level activation

1633
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,119
it's not it's probably not all of the

1634
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,400
serotonin receptors right and then the

1635
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,720
second difference being that you are

1636
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:32,079
doing it regularly even regardless of

1637
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:34,159
the pro the protocol it is it's regular

1638
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:36,240
um and it's it's pretty consistent so in

1639
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:38,798
this case in the micro dosing case if

1640
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:41,679
we're gonna compare it to what your body

1641
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:43,519
feels like is happening your body feels

1642
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:46,159
a little bit like you just have a little

1643
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:48,318
more serotonin in your body

1644
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:51,199
all the time because you're doing it

1645
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:54,000
regularly right so your body then does

1646
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:56,798
have um what is called a homeostatic

1647
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,039
change or a it's a um

1648
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:02,239
it's a reaction all of our bodies are

1649
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:04,480
constantly balancing what is happening

1650
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:06,558
today and what happened yesterday with

1651
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,000
what is going to happen tomorrow that's

1652
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:10,079
one of the main

1653
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,199
things that that our body is responsible

1654
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,480
for doing

1655
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:15,118
and so

1656
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,519
in terms of there being like low levels

1657
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,838
of your body thinking that there's low

1658
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:21,599
levels of serotonin or slightly higher

1659
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,159
levels of serotonin that are normally

1660
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,838
there um there are definitely changes

1661
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:28,719
that it will

1662
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:30,318
induce that are different from

1663
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:32,480
what we're discussing later in the macro

1664
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:34,960
dose it's different from then a very

1665
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,920
large scale uh interaction with all of

1666
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:40,079
the serotonin receptors just once um and

1667
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,000
it's actually the same mechanism or a

1668
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,440
similar mechanism to

1669
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,199
most of

1670
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,200
the like long-term

1671
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:49,838
like mental health medications also

1672
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:52,798
function based on this sort of long-term

1673
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:55,038
low-dose effect or homeostatic effect

1674
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:57,599
that your body changes over time right

1675
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,839
like i think it's very common for um

1676
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,359
mental health prescription drugs for you

1677
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:03,199
to be monitored over time because they

1678
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:05,838
don't take effect for a couple weeks and

1679
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,598
then you know it's it's a titration um

1680
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:09,679
it's a it's a similar

1681
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:11,359
thing or it's a similar scale of an of

1682
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:15,440
an effect

1683
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:16,880
all right so um with the microdoses um

1684
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,039
we are

1685
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:22,400
uh getting

1686
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:24,559
some binding but not complete binding to

1687
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,119
all the receptors and the fact that

1688
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:28,079
we're doing it regularly

1689
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,760
um

1690
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,559
i don't know i guess i could say creates

1691
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:35,039
new opportunities for the neural network

1692
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:37,280
to use its resources differently would

1693
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,400
that be a fair way to put it in layman's

1694
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,200
terms

1695
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,280
yeah

1696
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:44,399
i think that's a great explanation i'd

1697
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:47,760
say that doing it regularly induces

1698
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:50,160
small changes in the brain as if you

1699
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,839
had slightly higher levels of serotonin

1700
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:53,440
all the time

1701
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:55,759
will that cause me to produce less

1702
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,000
serotonin like will will it leave you

1703
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,839
like like if you stopped micro dosing

1704
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,838
suddenly would it would it leave me in a

1705
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:06,480
serotonin depleted state because the

1706
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:08,719
the mushrooms have been

1707
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,838
using those receptors

1708
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:14,159
i haven't seen any information that

1709
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:16,960
supports that but

1710
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:19,679
is it possible that it increases the

1711
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,960
levels of like enzymes that metabolize

1712
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:24,879
serotonin um it is but

1713
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,480
i don't i don't think i've seen anything

1714
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,559
that supports that it would leave you

1715
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:31,920
like with a depletion although there are

1716
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:34,319
some um molecules out there that do and

1717
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,280
that it's like documented that they do

1718
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:38,558
um

1719
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,160
or they can have that effect like one of

1720
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,319
them um

1721
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:44,159
i'm thinking it is um

1722
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:47,119
mdma

1723
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:49,038
and it does it does induce like a

1724
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,760
a change and this is at like larger

1725
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:55,359
larger doses but um it does induce a

1726
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:57,359
change that leads to like a temporary um

1727
01:05:55,358 --> 01:06:00,639
feeling of like depletion

1728
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:03,199
afterwards all right so let's jump up to

1729
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:04,798
uh jump up the scale to macro doses so

1730
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:07,199
now we're talking between like you know

1731
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:08,639
three and four grams roughly of of the

1732
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:10,639
mushroom flesh

1733
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:13,038
at this point um we're not really

1734
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:14,719
talking about doing this regularly like

1735
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:17,680
a micro dose we're gonna we're gonna

1736
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:19,919
take you know five days a week this is

1737
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:21,598
more something that folks do

1738
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,599
um you know

1739
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:26,160
semi-regularly or a couple times a year

1740
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:28,480
or once a year or this is more an event

1741
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:30,239
this is this is a ceremony for a lot of

1742
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,798
people unless they're just partying on

1743
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:34,879
it for most folks this is you know they

1744
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:38,559
are doing this to create meaning in

1745
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:40,400
their lives or whatever and um

1746
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,839
uh so we're not talking about doing it

1747
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,760
regularly but we are talking about doing

1748
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:48,000
a hell of a lot more of it so um

1749
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,559
what do you see from your perspective of

1750
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,400
the the differences between the macro

1751
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,160
and the micro experience that you just

1752
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,720
laid out for us

1753
01:06:54,159 --> 01:07:00,239
i think that there's a it's clearly a

1754
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:02,959
big difference between activating all

1755
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:06,558
all of the receptors at this at the same

1756
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:08,798
time also because um so the other thing

1757
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,240
that i that i should mention now about

1758
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:13,038
the microdosing is that when you're at

1759
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:15,439
these lower levels not all the receptors

1760
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:16,720
will be activated equally either like i

1761
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,559
mentioned like some of them will be

1762
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:21,118
active and some of them will be inactive

1763
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:24,720
um at the lower doses it's way more

1764
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:26,400
likely that the solution molecules are

1765
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:28,719
only activating

1766
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,680
certain receptor subtypes that it's

1767
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:33,919
especially bad it's especially attracted

1768
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:36,719
to um and then as you get into the

1769
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,639
higher and higher doses it will start

1770
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:41,279
attaching to all of the serotonin

1771
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:43,838
receptors because there's so much there

1772
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,359
right that it's going to activate all of

1773
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:48,480
the different types and all of them at

1774
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:49,838
once and all all over the place and this

1775
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,039
you know if you've seen them in the in

1776
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:52,880
the brain scans you end up with these

1777
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:54,839
like beautiful brains that are just like

1778
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,838
completely lit up

1779
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:59,759
and in this case um

1780
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:01,599
in terms of like the the big long-term

1781
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,480
benefit in in the bigger doses i

1782
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:07,599
definitely think that it is linked to

1783
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:09,599
the mysticism or oceanic boundlessness

1784
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:12,640
and or ineffable

1785
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,880
way of describing that that experience

1786
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:16,960
um you mentioned that people do it to

1787
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,480
try to like fix something or to you know

1788
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,520
the set in the setting being really

1789
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:21,919
important

1790
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,839
um you know i think it's

1791
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,000
i think it's interesting because i think

1792
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:27,759
about it as like a problem or if a

1793
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,439
problem um

1794
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,279
is like a mountain one of my friends put

1795
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,399
this really beautifully like if you have

1796
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,839
a problem

1797
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,759
and and it's a mountain that you're

1798
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:37,039
trying to climb and you just end up

1799
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,359
trying to approach it from different

1800
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,039
trail heads eventually like you probably

1801
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,199
will find a way to climb the mountain

1802
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:44,880
but the problem is sometime

1803
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:47,599
to a point in our lives where we've

1804
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:50,000
approached that same mountain so many

1805
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:53,039
times that we can't possibly see a

1806
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,119
different way to you know climb up that

1807
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:57,039
mountain and we're just you know we we

1808
01:08:55,119 --> 01:09:01,119
don't have that option

1809
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:03,439
and i think one of the main um positive

1810
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:05,439
attributes of a big macro dose which is

1811
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,519
just one time

1812
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:09,919
or way less frequent is that you have

1813
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,080
this activation where you activate all

1814
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,679
of the receptor subtypes

1815
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:16,479
at the same time

1816
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:19,920
and so you have a way larger

1817
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:22,798
disruption in that default pathway and

1818
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,158
you have a way larger

1819
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:25,198
activation

1820
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:28,559
of

1821
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:30,559
the extraneous others or new types of

1822
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,440
pathways new perspectives and new

1823
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,839
thoughts

1824
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,278
that you could then

1825
01:09:32,838 --> 01:09:36,880
reintegrate and

1826
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:39,520
you know take from that take from that

1827
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:42,239
experience in a different way

1828
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:44,480
do we have any idea

1829
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:44,479
what

1830
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,479
what uniquely is happening when you

1831
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:53,439
activate all of those receptors at the

1832
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:54,399
same time if if a microdose is

1833
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,559
you know

1834
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:58,960
we're we're pushing the button on some

1835
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,039
of the receptors and so we're doing this

1836
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,920
kind of slow and steady wins the race

1837
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:05,519
kind of improvement for

1838
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,239
the neural network

1839
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:10,880
versus taking a macro dose where you're

1840
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:12,799
essentially taking all of the buttons on

1841
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,840
all of the receptors and just mashing

1842
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:19,199
the hell out of them so so you're you're

1843
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:22,880
going from you know one person singing

1844
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:25,919
every day to suddenly this whole coral

1845
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:28,480
all singing together and the melody it

1846
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,359
creates something that is way more than

1847
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:34,479
the sum of its parts do we know what

1848
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:37,679
that is in the brain when we're taking

1849
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:39,759
macro doses is there some state in the

1850
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,960
brain that we achieve

1851
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,039
from

1852
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,520
mashing all of those receptors at the

1853
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:48,560
same time i mean we know how it feels

1854
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,920
right but i'm curious to know do we know

1855
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,640
what's happening

1856
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,760
like chemically in the brain

1857
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,760
that

1858
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,199
um

1859
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:00,640
at the same time we're having these

1860
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:02,479
these spiritual experiences

1861
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:05,280
i feel like chemically in the brain it's

1862
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:08,238
probably chaos it's like

1863
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:11,119
it's like you're activating every

1864
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:13,198
serotonergic cell i'm not just in the

1865
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:14,800
brain too i mean at the macro doses like

1866
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:16,639
there's body effects there's like

1867
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,159
stomach effects and other things but

1868
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,119
we're talking about the brain

1869
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:24,839
um you're activating and you're super

1870
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:28,079
activating all of the serotonin

1871
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,840
like neurons that then go on they go on

1872
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:31,198
to activate other things right like i

1873
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,000
mentioned earlier

1874
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:36,799
um that they activate and can and modify

1875
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,640
the endocannabinoid system but serotonin

1876
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:41,920
also plays an important role in the

1877
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:44,320
dopamine system and it's originally this

1878
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,319
is like an older belief it used to be

1879
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:48,559
believed that serotonin and dopamine

1880
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:50,000
were like contrary to one another or

1881
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,840
that they um

1882
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,880
they were like opposites and they they

1883
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:57,039
balanced each other out and it's been

1884
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,960
the more and more that we've looked into

1885
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:00,560
all of these systems for that matter not

1886
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:03,359
just serotonin dopamine and the

1887
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:05,920
endocannabinoid system but specifically

1888
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:08,238
those three um they're very very closely

1889
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,079
linked together and so you have this

1890
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:11,839
massive activation of the serotonin

1891
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:14,800
system but you're also going to have

1892
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,840
this massive downstream activation of

1893
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,679
the dopamine system and the

1894
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,960
endocannabinoid system

1895
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:20,719
and in terms of

1896
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,719
of scientifically

1897
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:24,399
and at my level what is what is

1898
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:25,279
happening i

1899
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:27,839
think

1900
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:29,599
from from my understanding of of what

1901
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,319
would happen to the receptors at that

1902
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,920
point is that all of them are doing all

1903
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:36,479
of their downstream signaling pathways

1904
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,800
at the same time there is a massive

1905
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:40,639
overlap between some of the pathways

1906
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,560
being synergistic which means that they

1907
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:45,440
increase each other and some of the

1908
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:47,760
pathways being um antagonistic or they

1909
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:50,879
they cancel each other out um like for

1910
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,000
example the the serotonin 2a and 2c

1911
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,079
receptors

1912
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,760
often are viewed as canceling each other

1913
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:57,840
out when it comes to how they affect

1914
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,800
dopamine so all of this is kind of like

1915
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:03,199
competing and happening at the same time

1916
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,800
and what what i think we know at least

1917
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:07,279
one of the things that

1918
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,719
we're we're learning um increasingly

1919
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:10,880
learning is that coming coming out of

1920
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:11,840
this like for the health benefits and

1921
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,840
where

1922
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,800
where those come from

1923
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:19,600
it appears to be linked to

1924
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:22,719
this feeling of of a deep uh

1925
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:25,199
connectedness experience that is

1926
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:27,198
incredible to me that it's linked to a

1927
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:28,479
system in the brain or in an interaction

1928
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:30,719
in the brain

1929
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:35,599
but that certainly seems to be

1930
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:35,600
more profound at the higher doses

1931
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:41,198
okay um one more question on this track

1932
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:44,000
before we move on to the next topic area

1933
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:47,839
which is um you mentioned that at the

1934
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,158
macro doses not only are the serotonin

1935
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,319
receptors all being mashed on

1936
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:54,479
but also there's all these other effects

1937
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:57,119
in the other parts of the body including

1938
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:58,799
the endocannabinoid system and in the

1939
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:00,158
gut and

1940
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:03,520
you know certainly we know that the

1941
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:06,960
bowels are lit up um and and you know

1942
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:09,840
breathing is impacted in some ways uh

1943
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:12,399
certainly your muscle sets react to it

1944
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:15,039
um can you talk a little bit about the

1945
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:18,319
the non

1946
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:20,238
receptors that get lit by a macro dose

1947
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:23,119
and kind of explain to us what's

1948
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:24,718
happening in the totality of our bodies

1949
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:26,399
because like mushrooms are a very whole

1950
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:29,359
body drug

1951
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:31,119
oh yeah so the easiest thing i think to

1952
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:32,639
describe is the stomach one because

1953
01:14:31,119 --> 01:14:35,679
that's like very

1954
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:38,159
it's it's part of the process um you

1955
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:39,760
have the most serotonin receptors in

1956
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:41,279
your gut and gi

1957
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,840
area and in your stomach your stomach

1958
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:45,519
produces huge amounts of serotonin

1959
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,600
and so activating those serotonin

1960
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,760
receptors that's part of what causes

1961
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:53,280
that stomach upset there's also other

1962
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:56,400
things in in mushrooms that i think add

1963
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:59,759
to that effect but a piece of that you

1964
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:02,559
know upset stomach feeling comes from

1965
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:05,039
activating the receptors that are in

1966
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:07,280
your gut and in your stomach and

1967
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:09,198
other like otherwise there's this

1968
01:15:07,279 --> 01:15:12,158
there's this communication

1969
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:14,399
back and forth always between your brain

1970
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:16,719
and your body and between what is called

1971
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:18,639
like the peripheral or like your body's

1972
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,880
nervous system and then your central

1973
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,840
nervous system so like one of the things

1974
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,920
it's

1975
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:27,360
like the the feeling of like how you can

1976
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:29,039
have decreased pain or decreased um

1977
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,880
you know like like temperature

1978
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:33,760
regulation even just decreased like

1979
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:35,600
sensory feedback in general right um a

1980
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,920
piece of that comes from this another

1981
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,480
disruption or a communication disruption

1982
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:42,239
between like peripheral and central um

1983
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:45,039
and when you are

1984
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:47,678
flooding your body with a molecule that

1985
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:50,399
activates receptors that are everywhere

1986
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:52,480
um and that are so expressed in your

1987
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:54,319
central nervous system and in the core

1988
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:58,399
of controlling these things

1989
01:15:54,319 --> 01:16:00,719
um and that's a piece of what causes the

1990
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:02,319
like whole effect or the whole

1991
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:05,520
experience is that there's always a

1992
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:06,880
feedback um between what's going on in

1993
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,920
the brain and what's going on in the

1994
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:12,800
body and these these little loops that

1995
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:14,399
our our body goes through they're

1996
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,400
they're regulated

1997
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:20,158
along the way in in many different

1998
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:21,679
pieces by these neurotransmitters and so

1999
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:24,479
by taking something that mimics

2000
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:27,600
serotonin you're modifying

2001
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:28,639
every piece of of that loop for those

2002
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,120
systems

2003
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:34,079
are there serotonin receptors throughout

2004
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:36,399
the body similar to endocannabinoid

2005
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:38,158
receptors throughout the body

2006
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:41,119
so it's similar i don't believe that

2007
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:42,960
they have the same exact profile of the

2008
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:44,640
amount so both the endocannabinoid

2009
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:47,600
system and the serotonin system are

2010
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:49,280
expressed very very highly in the brain

2011
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,039
and both of them are expressed also in

2012
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:53,119
the gi tract but the endocannabinoid

2013
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:55,679
system i believe is more in the fat

2014
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:57,359
tissue than the serotonin system is i

2015
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,039
believe the serotonin system is also

2016
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:00,319
found more heavily in like the cardiac

2017
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:02,719
or the heart

2018
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:04,799
area i both the endocannabinoid system

2019
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:07,198
and the serotonin system are

2020
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,119
all over the place um but in terms of

2021
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:10,960
like how highly they're expressed i

2022
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:12,319
think they have a slightly different uh

2023
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,000
expression pattern

2024
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,359
you know i think that if you asked me i

2025
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,600
would have said oh yeah of course

2026
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:19,920
there's serotonin receptors in the gut i

2027
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,000
mean yeah of course but but i think i

2028
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,440
also forgot that until you mentioned it

2029
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,679
again and

2030
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:28,000
if if i'm think if i'm now thinking more

2031
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:29,600
holistically instead of oh serotonin

2032
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,960
receptors in the brain and i'm thinking

2033
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:35,199
about oh serotonin receptors in like

2034
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,920
these groupings all around the body

2035
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:40,799
suddenly it makes a lot more sense why

2036
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:43,760
mushrooms activate so many different

2037
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,960
places in the body

2038
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,400
um

2039
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,000
you know it's it's not that the mushroom

2040
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:49,759
has to have a bunch of different

2041
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,479
chemicals to reach these different

2042
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,400
places it's just the receptors are are

2043
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:56,319
all over the place and i want to follow

2044
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:57,439
up on on

2045
01:17:56,319 --> 01:17:59,279
as you were explaining that you

2046
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:02,079
mentioned that that you believe that

2047
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:07,039
there are other chemicals in the

2048
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:09,039
mushroom that activate in the stomach um

2049
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:10,479
uh do you have anything more to say

2050
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:13,119
about that about what these other

2051
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:14,079
chemicals may be i mean i know that

2052
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:17,279
there's

2053
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:19,279
probably tons depending on the strain of

2054
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:20,960
mushroom that you're looking at but one

2055
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:22,559
of the type the class of molecules that

2056
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:26,158
i'm really interested in has to do with

2057
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:27,520
like sugars um mushrooms can produce and

2058
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:29,119
mushrooms produce these really

2059
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:32,080
complicated it can produce these really

2060
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:34,079
complicated types of molecules that are

2061
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:35,039
like similar to sugar or like linked to

2062
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:36,640
sugars

2063
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:38,800
um i mean

2064
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:41,280
and then i'm also interested in very

2065
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:43,840
very similar compounds to psilocybin or

2066
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:44,960
cellosin that there are probably or

2067
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,239
possibly

2068
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:51,198
many similar other forms of of those

2069
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:52,559
molecules that share a similar shape and

2070
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:54,319
are just slightly different kind of

2071
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,000
similar to the rare cannabinoids right

2072
01:18:54,319 --> 01:18:58,880
so if you think about like the

2073
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,439
biosynthetic pathways that these

2074
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:02,880
mushrooms and that the cannabis plant

2075
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:05,678
they that the pathways that they go

2076
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:08,079
through to create these molecules um

2077
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:09,679
they are done by enzymes which are like

2078
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:11,920
little machines like i mentioned earlier

2079
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:14,480
that do chemical reactions and those

2080
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:17,440
little machines are not always perfect

2081
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:19,839
they can make mistakes and they can

2082
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:21,839
create like little off-by-products and

2083
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,440
things and sometimes they just will

2084
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,440
create a certain amount of like little

2085
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:27,198
amounts of things and so this is one of

2086
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,158
the differences between

2087
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:33,519
isolated extracts and like whole um

2088
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:36,639
plant or whole or whole whole formula

2089
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:38,320
yeah whole fungus extracts right um

2090
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,960
is that you're not gonna like eliminate

2091
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:41,840
any of those like mistakes or just like

2092
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,600
trace

2093
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,360
trace amounts that are slightly slightly

2094
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,280
different right because um i mean this

2095
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:48,799
is like an example you brought up

2096
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:50,960
earlier with dmt

2097
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,640
there's the different types um and

2098
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,119
that's kind of what you're when when

2099
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:57,920
people talk about the different types of

2100
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:59,760
dmt i think there's like red and

2101
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,039
all these different like versions versus

2102
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,079
like the crystal

2103
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:06,238
um versus like an oil you're you're

2104
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:08,479
talking about like different like slight

2105
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:11,759
modifications or derivatives that are

2106
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:13,119
present in the plant um in small amounts

2107
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,199
they're in smaller amounts than the

2108
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:17,599
other than the other molecules and i

2109
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:19,279
believe that you know psilocybin oslosan

2110
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,360
would be no different i believe that

2111
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:23,119
there would be small amounts and i'm i'm

2112
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:24,559
not sure possibly it's already been

2113
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:26,479
found i just haven't i haven't seen it

2114
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,400
in the literature but i i think it's

2115
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:29,919
it's quite possible or very very

2116
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:32,399
possible that it's there and it exists

2117
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,960
and that um in all the different strains

2118
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:37,599
um it's that there are complementary

2119
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,039
molecules um present and that that's a

2120
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,520
piece of what's different between all of

2121
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:42,960
these different strains of mushrooms is

2122
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,679
what else is in there it's not the

2123
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:48,399
psilocybin content that's different well

2124
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:49,840
the psilocybin content can vary between

2125
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:53,439
these different strands of mushrooms

2126
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:55,920
absolutely but that they also have other

2127
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:57,039
complementary molecules inside of them

2128
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,880
and i have

2129
01:20:57,039 --> 01:21:01,519
like ideas of what i think that they

2130
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:03,359
could be but um i would be really really

2131
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,280
excited to look at it hopefully one day

2132
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:09,119
in the future right on

2133
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:12,238
so so when comparing the micro dose uh

2134
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:15,039
permanence of change to a macro dose

2135
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:17,839
permanence of change um

2136
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:20,960
would you suggest that there's any uh

2137
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:23,279
difference in permanence between the

2138
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:26,319
two varieties or two thresholds of

2139
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:29,279
dosages like if we talk about like the

2140
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:31,519
event the the the benefits of micro

2141
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:33,920
dosing stay with us and then and then

2142
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:36,719
perhaps some of their attributes fade

2143
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,480
away and that happens

2144
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:41,119
with potentially different attributes

2145
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:43,919
with a macro dose and potentially they

2146
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:46,238
they you know some of them go away

2147
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:48,800
would you say that that the the fading

2148
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:52,158
of the benefits are like on par with

2149
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:55,119
each other or that or that they they

2150
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:57,119
last differently

2151
01:21:55,119 --> 01:22:00,399
that's a super

2152
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:01,198
super hard question let's see

2153
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:02,799
i

2154
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:05,839
i think i guess i would think that

2155
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:08,639
they're more just different tools

2156
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:12,159
different tools for different uses and

2157
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:14,079
different advantages right because um

2158
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:15,759
on on one hand

2159
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:17,840
i think that

2160
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,920
there is a huge benefit and that that a

2161
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:22,960
lot of people have experienced the huge

2162
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:25,359
benefit from a profound experience

2163
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:27,679
right something that is life-altering

2164
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:30,799
and life-changing but that is very

2165
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:33,600
subjective and i know that i've read

2166
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:35,600
people's experiences with micro doses

2167
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:38,639
where they have had a profound

2168
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:40,159
experience for them on a micro dose

2169
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:41,840
right because everything in this world

2170
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:43,359
is is subjective

2171
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,319
so i think that

2172
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:46,000
um

2173
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:48,000
i think it's a very difficult question

2174
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,560
because i think so much of that has to

2175
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,600
do with the individual person

2176
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:55,360
what they are seeking from this and also

2177
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:58,079
maybe even just a little bit about their

2178
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:59,920
neurochemistry or their like specific

2179
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:02,000
neurodiversity because i think you

2180
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,079
mentioned at the beginning of this um

2181
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,479
there are different doses of micro doses

2182
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:08,000
for people who experience like certain

2183
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:09,599
people are sensitive

2184
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,840
um and

2185
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,120
that's going to be true for the benefits

2186
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,279
as well

2187
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:17,679
okay so uh one more thing i want to hit

2188
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:20,238
on before we we go to the second break

2189
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:22,158
and that is tolerance um you know we're

2190
01:23:20,238 --> 01:23:23,678
all pretty familiar with cannabis

2191
01:23:22,158 --> 01:23:26,479
tolerance and that

2192
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:28,480
um when you're when you're taking in uh

2193
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:31,839
thc regularly

2194
01:23:28,479 --> 01:23:34,000
um your your receptors

2195
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,520
can can stay full up and and perhaps

2196
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,600
even get lazy

2197
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:40,880
but but with um

2198
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:43,440
with psilocybin um

2199
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:45,600
if you take mushrooms on day one and you

2200
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:48,799
take them on day two you're gonna have

2201
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:51,120
to take more on day two but from from

2202
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:53,600
what i understand from the literature

2203
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:55,519
it's not really tolerance it's it's it's

2204
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,760
kind of like a different mechanism but i

2205
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,440
have no way to explain it so so would

2206
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:01,840
you would you kind of teach us a bit

2207
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:03,519
about about what that's like to take

2208
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:05,600
mushrooms

2209
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:08,320
day one and then day two and the fact

2210
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:11,520
that you need more what's going on there

2211
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:13,679
sure so usually tolerance is uh in

2212
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,679
reference to the receptors which is why

2213
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:18,158
i think um

2214
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:19,920
why i think like usually this is a

2215
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:21,679
different form or a different mechanism

2216
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,158
of tolerance because

2217
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:27,039
when it comes to mushrooms or any of the

2218
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:30,158
serotonergics it's actually linked to

2219
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:33,198
the enzyme that breaks it down which is

2220
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:36,479
called monoamine oxidase this enzyme

2221
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:38,638
takes the molecule and adds and and

2222
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:41,919
makes it inactive it inactivates the

2223
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:43,199
molecule and when you um the first day

2224
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,520
that you would take mushrooms like let's

2225
01:24:43,198 --> 01:24:47,678
say your body has like five of these

2226
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,239
ends of these enzymes to break it down

2227
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:53,440
the next day your body would have like

2228
01:24:50,238 --> 01:24:55,198
50 like tons and so because you have so

2229
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:57,198
many of these enzymes it would like

2230
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:58,879
immediately break it down

2231
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:01,039
and that's that's why it's a it's a

2232
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,960
different mechanism because it's linked

2233
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:05,439
to breaking down the molecule into

2234
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:07,520
something inactive rather than being

2235
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:09,839
linked to changing the number of

2236
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,800
receptors that the molecule is binding

2237
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,440
to

2238
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:15,039
all right um and and and this last

2239
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:17,759
question i i just stumbled into this

2240
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:19,600
question so i may not act actually ask

2241
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:23,679
it scientifically accurately but you

2242
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:27,039
mentioned the maos and um

2243
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:29,039
uh i re recall like back in back in my

2244
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:32,719
college days i was taking uh saint

2245
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:36,399
john's wort for anxiety and i remember

2246
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:38,480
uh that that uh taking mushrooms was not

2247
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:40,879
having the same kind of effect and i

2248
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:43,119
remember at the time thinking being told

2249
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,960
oh it's because the saint john's wart is

2250
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:49,519
an mao inhibitor

2251
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:52,000
and so so taking mao inhibitors um uh

2252
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:54,960
lessens the potency of a of a whole

2253
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,479
category of drugs um and i don't even

2254
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,239
know if i'm asking that question right

2255
01:25:56,479 --> 01:25:59,759
but i'm sure you know what i'm talking

2256
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:02,000
about so would you talk a little bit

2257
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:04,560
about mao inhibitors

2258
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,880
yeah it's actually very um

2259
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:09,280
it's very dangerous and this is a

2260
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:12,560
something a psa it's very dangerous to

2261
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:16,319
mix two different types of serotonergic

2262
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:18,159
molecules specifically maoi or monoamine

2263
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:21,198
oxidase inhibitors

2264
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:24,000
and serotonergic agonists which is what

2265
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:24,960
mushrooms are it's what lsd is as well

2266
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,639
because there is something called

2267
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:29,039
serotonin syndrome that you can get if

2268
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:31,679
you overload the serotonin like system

2269
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:33,760
and it's very it's very rare and you to

2270
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:35,920
to be able to do that if you were just

2271
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,440
using one but it's way more likely to

2272
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,719
happen if you're using more than one so

2273
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:42,158
okay i'm going to stop talking about

2274
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:44,079
that now but it exists um and it's more

2275
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:46,399
likely i i have never heard about that

2276
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:48,399
that it would decrease your

2277
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:51,039
ability because in theory

2278
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:54,319
taking something that is a monoamine

2279
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:57,439
oxidase inhibitor would turn that enzyme

2280
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:59,840
off right it would inhibit that enzyme

2281
01:26:57,439 --> 01:27:01,039
and so in theory you would actually have

2282
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,639
more

2283
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:04,960
of the mushrooms

2284
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:06,319
present still and actually that's the um

2285
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:10,960
premise of

2286
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:12,079
ayahuasca because ayahuasca if you eat

2287
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,319
dmt

2288
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:17,279
it gets metabolized so quickly that you

2289
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:18,799
can't feel it so that's why ayahuasca is

2290
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:21,519
a very complicated mixture and it's

2291
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,600
different depending on um but like

2292
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,920
person in place the shaman who's

2293
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,440
creating it and the and the tribe it's

2294
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:32,560
different in a bunch of places but the

2295
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:35,439
main ingredients that go into it are a

2296
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:38,400
monoamine oxidase inhibitor that then

2297
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:39,678
allows the dmt to not be metabolized so

2298
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:41,920
i would say it's almost the opposite

2299
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:44,000
effect but perhaps because you were

2300
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:45,119
taking st john's wort

2301
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,760
perhaps

2302
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:50,319
it was actually increasing the level of

2303
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:52,480
monoamine oxidase that was there because

2304
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:53,439
if it has an inhibitor and it has like

2305
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:54,399
this

2306
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:56,000
um

2307
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:58,399
reactionary effect in your body or the

2308
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,039
homeostatic effect that then your body

2309
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:03,039
upregulated it so that's that's possible

everything your company does you've got

2377

so many responsibilities every single

time to really dig into your marketing

but that does not mean they bought my

2421
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,880
opinion i've worked with blunt branding

2422

on five projects now for various of

2423
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,400
their clients and every single time they

2424
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:52,719
have done more than they have promised

2425
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:54,960
and over delivered on results i love how

2426
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:56,719
they generate new revenue and focus on

2427
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,600
that as the goal instead of just making

2428
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:01,198
a pretty logo similarly every single

2429

presentations on how to approach finding

2477
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,840
your dream job in cannabis and why we

2478
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:44,000
choose cannabis business even though the

2479
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:45,840
risks are so high as of today there's

2480

welcome back you are listening to

2485
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:58,000
shaping fire i am your host shango los

2486
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,238
and my guest today is pharmacologist

2487
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,479
miyabi shields all right so here's the

2488
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:04,959
big finish in the first set we learned a

2489
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:07,119
lot about how the serotonin cycle

2490
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:09,920
interacts with silicon

2491
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:11,359
and also with the endocannabinoid system

2492
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,520
a little bit about

2493
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:16,079
how dopamine reacts as well during the

2494
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:19,199
second set we talked about the different

2495
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:21,039
thresholds for dosage the mechanics and

2496
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:23,039
and how it works during during this

2497
01:34:21,039 --> 01:34:25,600
third set though we're going to talk

2498
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:29,679
about uh some of the applications for

2499
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:32,159
this um so so i want to point out that

2500
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:34,480
this really isn't an episode about the

2501
01:34:32,158 --> 01:34:37,439
spiritual relationship and

2502
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:40,399
communications psychological benefits

2503
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:43,039
of taking mushrooms um certainly

2504
01:34:40,399 --> 01:34:45,118
there is a lot to say about that but

2505
01:34:43,039 --> 01:34:47,920
we're really talking more about

2506
01:34:45,118 --> 01:34:50,079
physiological mechanics today so

2507
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:52,239
um you know uh you'll you that that

2508
01:34:50,079 --> 01:34:54,079
information on the psychology benefits

2509
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:56,079
the psychological benefits of taking

2510
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:58,319
mushrooms um you can pick that up

2511
01:34:56,079 --> 01:34:59,359
elsewhere or or maybe i'll do a show

2512
01:34:58,319 --> 01:35:01,759
about in the future but that's not

2513
01:34:59,359 --> 01:35:04,158
really what we're talking about today um

2514
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:06,239
we're gonna start though miyabi with um

2515
01:35:04,158 --> 01:35:08,799
i know that you're a big fan of taking

2516
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:11,359
psilocybin and cannabis together because

2517
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:13,679
they're synergistic um will you go ahead

2518
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:17,359
and and kind of explain why you see them

2519
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:21,359
as being such uh such uh good friends

2520
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:23,599
totally i i think that the systems are

2521
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:26,319
complementary and

2522
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:27,840
there is so much overlap and interplay

2523
01:35:26,319 --> 01:35:30,238
between the

2524
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:32,880
system and the serotonin system

2525
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:35,198
and it's clear it's interesting because

2526
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:38,639
there's almost no research on that are

2527
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:40,960
done together on cannabis and mushrooms

2528
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:43,679
and there's very very limited research

2529
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:46,480
on on how the systems when they're

2530
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:47,359
activated together in humans that is

2531
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:50,638
but

2532
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:53,679
there is tons and tons of information

2533
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:56,000
out there in the real world community of

2534
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:58,719
people who use mushrooms and cannabis

2535
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,960
together and in general they are a

2536
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:03,520
potentiating or they're synergistic

2537
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:05,279
which means that you can use less of

2538
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:08,320
both of them to achieve a strong effect

2539
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:09,840
or that they don't necessarily um

2540
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:11,599
you know one doesn't necessarily just

2541
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,840
like strengthen the other but that they

2542
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:16,239
complement each other in such a way that

2543
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:18,239
the therapeutic benefits can be greater

2544
01:36:16,238 --> 01:36:20,879
when they're used together at smaller

2545
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:22,238
doses than when they're alone and i

2546
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,079
think that

2547
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:26,238
i think it's interesting and i obviously

2548
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:28,399
understand why because it's difficult to

2549
01:36:26,238 --> 01:36:30,559
study such it's complicated to study

2550
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:33,198
cannabis it's complicated to study

2551
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,360
mushrooms and there's so many molecules

2552
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:37,839
in both plants but i think that it's

2553
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:40,399
incredible and worth talking about that

2554
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:43,679
their benefits can be used together and

2555
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:46,079
that one of the main things that um

2556
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:48,399
people talk about is about how

2557
01:36:46,079 --> 01:36:50,559
there are some negative effects to both

2558
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:52,559
cannabis and mushrooms and that in

2559
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:55,440
general you can limit those negative

2560
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:58,800
effects by using less of them in general

2561
01:36:55,439 --> 01:37:00,879
using less of any drug is beneficial for

2562
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:03,600
you in the long term

2563
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:05,760
and yeah it is i think that it's it's

2564
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:08,639
crazy and i would love to see more

2565
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:11,360
research on the synergy between the two

2566
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:14,000
and that it's very explainable in terms

2567
01:37:11,359 --> 01:37:16,719
of how i mentioned earlier the actual

2568
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,960
receptors interact with one another and

2569
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:21,039
then the the cells in the brain and the

2570
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:22,719
brain cells that fire together also

2571
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:25,118
interact with one another

2572
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:27,279
it's in a way that that makes sense that

2573
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:28,319
they're complementary and that um

2574
01:37:27,279 --> 01:37:30,639
actually

2575
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:32,960
it's been a rece it was a recent

2576
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:36,000
paper that showed that if you use

2577
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:39,600
cannabis regularly you have an increased

2578
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:42,079
number of those uh receptor the receptor

2579
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,760
dimers the two receptors together so the

2580
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:46,639
serotonin receptor

2581
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:48,480
with the cb1 receptor i was mentioning

2582
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:49,520
earlier they come together and they

2583
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:51,439
signal

2584
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:54,560
differently when they're together there

2585
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:57,439
is actually very preliminary early early

2586
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:59,920
evidence that regular cannabis use will

2587
01:37:57,439 --> 01:38:03,519
increase the number of those two

2588
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:05,039
receptor subtypes together um which is

2589
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:08,560
just interesting because it's kind of

2590
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:11,840
pointing to or hinting at the idea that

2591
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:14,639
you can modify either system to be more

2592
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:17,279
complementary with each other or or put

2593
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:20,560
it in a different balance per se

2594
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:22,000
do you have any thoughts on on if you're

2595
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:24,639
going to be

2596
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,319
using mushrooms at what point to start

2597
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:28,079
your cannabis uh

2598
01:38:26,319 --> 01:38:30,158
use as well would it be

2599
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:31,920
you know start before it comes on do you

2600
01:38:30,158 --> 01:38:33,439
want to wait till it comes on are there

2601
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:35,039
is there any mechanics going on there

2602
01:38:33,439 --> 01:38:36,960
that we want to be aware of

2603
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:40,158
well i think one of the biggest benefits

2604
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:41,439
has to do with the anti-nausea effects

2605
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:43,679
of cannabis

2606
01:38:41,439 --> 01:38:45,839
so that's a big and in terms of in terms

2607
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:48,960
of like onset of using them together i

2608
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:50,960
think that would be um something like

2609
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,960
worth mentioning is that like mushrooms

2610
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:55,279
often cause an upset stomach and

2611
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:57,279
cannabis combats upset

2612
01:38:55,279 --> 01:38:59,039
upset stomach and gi issues

2613
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:01,039
one thing worth mentioning is that

2614
01:38:59,039 --> 01:39:03,439
because they potentiate each other

2615
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:05,439
because they work together that way it

2616
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:08,238
is you have to be very very careful and

2617
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:10,879
this is not something for the first time

2618
01:39:08,238 --> 01:39:13,039
ever to do without considering what the

2619
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,239
dosages are and how they interact with

2620
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:16,000
one another

2621
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:18,879
because they certainly interact with one

2622
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,960
another in a way that potentiates the

2623
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,719
total overall effect

2624
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,840
one thing that i've found is really

2625
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:25,520
useful

2626
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:27,920
is that you can

2627
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:30,000
because of cannabis um having a shorter

2628
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:32,399
duration of action if you're smoking it

2629
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,719
or inhaling it or you know

2630
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:37,118
dabbing it vaping it it has a shorter

2631
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:39,520
duration of action and so one thing that

2632
01:39:37,118 --> 01:39:42,880
i think is useful is that you can almost

2633
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:44,560
use cannabis to like as a titrator or

2634
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:47,679
something that is a very subtle

2635
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:50,080
alteration of the effect and this is a i

2636
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:52,079
mean this is something that i've seen

2637
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:53,519
tons of people do it's just it isn't

2638
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:55,118
talked about

2639
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,719
and it isn't studied in the scientific

2640
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:59,198
literature and i would i would love to

2641
01:39:56,719 --> 01:40:01,760
study it one day or for someone to to

2642
01:39:59,198 --> 01:40:03,439
study it because i think that there are

2643
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:05,920
different benefits

2644
01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:06,960
that can be obtained by using them

2645
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:10,399
together

2646
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:13,840
so we know that cannabis is biphasic

2647
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:16,559
meaning consuming some thc reduces

2648
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:19,119
anxiety but taking more than your

2649
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:21,440
personal threshold makes it anxiety

2650
01:40:19,118 --> 01:40:24,319
causing right

2651
01:40:21,439 --> 01:40:28,879
mushrooms also seem to cause both

2652
01:40:24,319 --> 01:40:30,880
relaxation and can cause anxiety too um

2653
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:33,199
i'm guessing that they're biphasic this

2654
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:35,679
is why we focus so much on like mindset

2655
01:40:33,198 --> 01:40:37,839
and setting right with all psychedelics

2656
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:40,719
what effect will using mushrooms and

2657
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:44,079
cannabis together have in regard to

2658
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:46,800
anxiety creation or secession

2659
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:49,439
okay so this answer is gonna be entirely

2660
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:52,639
based on the experience from others that

2661
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:53,439
i've heard and from the theory of of

2662
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:55,039
what

2663
01:40:53,439 --> 01:40:57,759
is interacting with these with these

2664
01:40:55,039 --> 01:40:58,560
receptors and these molecules but

2665
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,520
but

2666
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:03,679
uh when a molecule is biphasic usually

2667
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:06,239
it means that there's this opposing

2668
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:09,118
effect right at the second dose you at a

2669
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:11,919
higher dose or a higher threshold um

2670
01:41:09,118 --> 01:41:14,719
it's possible that that second threshold

2671
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:18,239
that causes anxiety is caused by an

2672
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:20,880
imbalance in these signaling systems and

2673
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:23,279
it is possible that that imbalance has

2674
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:25,359
to do with only activating one of those

2675
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:27,840
systems at a time

2676
01:41:25,359 --> 01:41:29,920
from what i've seen in

2677
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:32,639
in personal experiences and

2678
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:34,319
qualitatively of others in general they

2679
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,800
can have a curbing effect on that

2680
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:40,399
anxiety um effect when used together

2681
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:43,279
although it is also certainly true that

2682
01:41:40,399 --> 01:41:44,799
it can cause if you're unprepared or if

2683
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:45,719
there's other

2684
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,320
like

2685
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:50,000
environmental factors in your setting

2686
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:51,599
that it could go the other way and so i

2687
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,760
think it's hard to say like with

2688
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:55,760
certainty that there would be anything

2689
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:58,639
that would happen for certain for any

2690
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:01,360
specific person in that

2691
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:04,560
scenario in any scenario but that i do

2692
01:42:01,359 --> 01:42:07,118
think that it's possible that they can

2693
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:09,039
at least and to a certain extent curb

2694
01:42:07,118 --> 01:42:10,719
that effect by having it be an

2695
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:12,960
activation of both systems at the same

2696
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:15,760
time because they balance each other out

2697
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:18,480
um while but while that's being said i i

2698
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:19,440
don't think that we know enough to say

2699
01:42:18,479 --> 01:42:21,198
that

2700
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:22,879
it wouldn't also

2701
01:42:21,198 --> 01:42:24,799
at times have the opposing effect

2702
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,600
because it's definitely true that it

2703
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,360
could

2704
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:29,679
yeah and this is definitely one of the

2705
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:32,158
experiences that falls in the

2706
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:34,158
personalized medicine approach right

2707
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:36,079
like like you know everybody's gonna

2708
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:38,079
have to figure out what their own

2709
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:41,279
biphasic thresholds for mushrooms and

2710
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:44,319
cannabis are you know start slow and low

2711
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:46,399
and and find your own right um and i and

2712
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:48,158
while we're here i appreciate the fact

2713
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:49,759
you giving me some of these answers to

2714
01:42:48,158 --> 01:42:52,238
these questions that honestly the

2715
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:55,039
science doesn't exist yet and the fact

2716
01:42:52,238 --> 01:42:56,479
that you're willing to you know

2717
01:42:55,039 --> 01:42:58,000
take a professional

2718
01:42:56,479 --> 01:42:59,678
guesstimate i appreciate your

2719
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,840
willingness to do that

2720
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:05,118
i mean this is all that this is all just

2721
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:08,079
an abstract idea at this point but there

2722
01:43:05,118 --> 01:43:08,880
is some very real world applications

2723
01:43:08,079 --> 01:43:11,198
that

2724
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:13,840
are happening and i think it's i i think

2725
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:16,319
we shouldn't ignore the fact that people

2726
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,400
do use mushrooms and cannabis together

2727
01:43:16,319 --> 01:43:22,399
and that in in general there are

2728
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:24,319
unexplored unexplored um options here

2729
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:27,359
so we've been talking all day today

2730
01:43:24,319 --> 01:43:29,759
about how um mushroom psilocybin

2731
01:43:27,359 --> 01:43:32,000
interacts with the serotonin system

2732
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:34,239
which is one of the reasons

2733
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,039
why people turn to mushrooms for

2734
01:43:34,238 --> 01:43:39,919
migraines right and it's amazing i have

2735
01:43:37,039 --> 01:43:41,439
heard so many different ideas from

2736
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:46,399
patients about

2737
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:48,638
why taking either low or large doses of

2738
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:50,399
of psilocybin mushrooms

2739
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:51,440
helps their

2740
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:53,599
their

2741
01:43:51,439 --> 01:43:56,079
their migraines either stopping it at

2742
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:58,960
the onset or stopping it once it's

2743
01:43:56,079 --> 01:44:00,800
already on or used as a preventative i

2744
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:03,279
mean i've heard so many different

2745
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:05,440
strategies and i don't know if any of

2746
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:08,319
them are better than the other but but

2747
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:11,198
from from your perspective um what do

2748
01:44:08,319 --> 01:44:13,759
you see as far as the effectiveness that

2749
01:44:11,198 --> 01:44:16,079
psilocybin might have in the prevention

2750
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:18,560
or cessation of migraines

2751
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:21,519
i i think that there's so much evidence

2752
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:23,440
in both the endocannabinoid system and

2753
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:25,520
the serotonin system

2754
01:44:23,439 --> 01:44:28,799
so i mentioned earlier that when you

2755
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:31,199
activate the serotonin 5ht2a receptor

2756
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:33,520
which is the main receptor associated

2757
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:35,678
with psychedelic effects that you will

2758
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:36,639
increase your levels of endocannabinoids

2759
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:39,039
as well

2760
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:40,880
and for this one this i think is more

2761
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:41,679
linked to the preventative

2762
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,639
but

2763
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:47,199
migraines are associated with clinical

2764
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:49,359
endocannabinoid deficiency um which is a

2765
01:44:47,198 --> 01:44:50,399
theory by dr ethan russo

2766
01:44:49,359 --> 01:44:52,079
and

2767
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:54,319
it's it's a theory but there's a lot of

2768
01:44:52,079 --> 01:44:57,359
evidence there's a lot of evidence

2769
01:44:54,319 --> 01:45:00,000
behind people with migraines and also

2770
01:44:57,359 --> 01:45:02,479
fibromyalgia and ibs or irritable bowel

2771
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,800
syndrome having clinical endocannabinoid

2772
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:07,039
deficiency having lower levels of

2773
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:09,679
circulating endocannabinoids

2774
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:11,519
um in their body and having this be one

2775
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:14,399
of the reasons why they are sensitized

2776
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:15,280
to getting migraines so in that that's

2777
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:16,719
one

2778
01:45:15,279 --> 01:45:18,158
possible way that i think that it

2779
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:20,079
modifies it and then the other way is

2780
01:45:18,158 --> 01:45:22,079
through the serotonin system

2781
01:45:20,079 --> 01:45:24,079
and actually the

2782
01:45:22,079 --> 01:45:25,279
like most or some of the most common

2783
01:45:24,079 --> 01:45:27,760
migraine

2784
01:45:25,279 --> 01:45:30,639
medications that are abortive or that

2785
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:33,760
get rid of your migraines are tryptans

2786
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:36,079
they're also molecules that activate the

2787
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:38,719
serotonin system so this is actually a

2788
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:41,920
very very similar mechanism to what the

2789
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:44,719
pharmaceutical agents have as well

2790
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:47,279
although it's slightly different because

2791
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:50,239
the pharmaceutical drugs activate only

2792
01:45:47,279 --> 01:45:53,599
one of the serotonin receptor subtypes i

2793
01:45:50,238 --> 01:45:56,238
believe it's 1b as the type or 1a

2794
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:58,719
but they only activate one for the most

2795
01:45:56,238 --> 01:46:01,039
part of the serotonin receptor subtypes

2796
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:03,118
and it's a very very different um

2797
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:04,800
effects profile and can actually cause

2798
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:06,559
like rebound migraines and there's

2799
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:08,000
there's certain like there's positive

2800
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:09,280
things associated with they do work in

2801
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,039
important migraines but then there's

2802
01:46:09,279 --> 01:46:12,719
negative things that don't appear to

2803
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:15,519
happen with

2804
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:18,079
psilocybin mushrooms and i think that

2805
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:20,159
it's this um i do think it's a dual

2806
01:46:18,079 --> 01:46:22,079
approach i think it has to do with the

2807
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:25,359
effects of

2808
01:46:22,079 --> 01:46:28,479
the 2a 2c receptor or perhaps the pan

2809
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:31,198
pan agonism of activating all of the

2810
01:46:28,479 --> 01:46:33,198
serotonin system subtypes because

2811
01:46:31,198 --> 01:46:35,359
for both migraine and cluster headaches

2812
01:46:33,198 --> 01:46:37,359
there's a lot of really really positive

2813
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:39,920
evidence of using

2814
01:46:37,359 --> 01:46:42,158
mushrooms to either prevent them in

2815
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:43,118
terms of like a long-term usage or abort

2816
01:46:42,158 --> 01:46:46,479
them

2817
01:46:43,118 --> 01:46:48,719
now i i know that you are not a medical

2818
01:46:46,479 --> 01:46:50,559
doctor and you are not giving medical

2819
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:52,639
advice so i'm asking this question

2820
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:54,560
specifically from

2821
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:56,960
what you are learning from the

2822
01:46:54,560 --> 01:47:00,239
literature and from your own knowledge

2823
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:02,880
of how the neural network work works

2824
01:47:00,238 --> 01:47:06,479
based on though that information is

2825
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:07,199
there one strategy for using mushrooms

2826
01:47:06,479 --> 01:47:10,399
to

2827
01:47:07,198 --> 01:47:12,638
uh thwart migraines that seems like it's

2828
01:47:10,399 --> 01:47:15,279
more likely to be effective than others

2829
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:17,760
like you know uh micro dosing for

2830
01:47:15,279 --> 01:47:19,759
migraines or or or macro dosing for

2831
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:21,280
migraines or taking it at this point or

2832
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:23,360
that point like do you have anything to

2833
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:25,118
add on that topic

2834
01:47:23,359 --> 01:47:26,719
you know migraines are such a

2835
01:47:25,118 --> 01:47:29,679
complicated

2836
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:31,840
disorder and they're a trigger disorder

2837
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:34,079
um which means that like once you once

2838
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:36,239
you trigger a migraine attack like

2839
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:39,118
there's a prodromal phase and then the

2840
01:47:36,238 --> 01:47:42,718
the pain phase so in terms of like what

2841
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:45,920
the best um mechanism is i i really hope

2842
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:48,158
we have that answer in the long term in

2843
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:49,840
the short term i i say that i've known

2844
01:47:48,158 --> 01:47:51,759
people who i've known someone who's

2845
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:54,639
completely cured themselves of of

2846
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:57,920
migraines using mushrooms um and in this

2847
01:47:54,639 --> 01:48:00,000
case it was like somewhat regular um so

2848
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:02,079
in that case i think that like somewhat

2849
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,238
regular use and

2850
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:06,399
like the microdose route of being able

2851
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:08,559
to use it more regularly may be

2852
01:48:06,399 --> 01:48:10,960
beneficial in terms of like somewhat

2853
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:13,199
permanently altering um the circuitry

2854
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:15,760
that leads to you triggering your your

2855
01:48:13,198 --> 01:48:16,960
migraines um but i don't think that

2856
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:20,000
there's enough

2857
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:22,000
yet uh to say even just in in migraines

2858
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,880
in general and what causes them because

2859
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:27,600
um a piece of this of migraines is

2860
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:30,319
vasculature or the the blood flow

2861
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:32,079
in the brain um and so perhaps in that

2862
01:48:30,319 --> 01:48:35,198
sense too altering it somewhat

2863
01:48:32,079 --> 01:48:36,158
chronically would be beneficial um

2864
01:48:35,198 --> 01:48:37,919
yeah i

2865
01:48:36,158 --> 01:48:40,079
that's a really really good question and

2866
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:42,158
i i honestly hope that i have an answer

2867
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:43,679
for you like you know within the next

2868
01:48:42,158 --> 01:48:46,559
like i don't know maybe i'll give myself

2869
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:51,600
time the rest of my life

2870
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:54,800
right on um so um i know that you are uh

2871
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:56,960
very very interested in inflammation and

2872
01:48:54,800 --> 01:49:00,560
and that is closely related to the

2873
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:03,600
serotonin system as well um are there

2874
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:06,159
strategies for using uh mushrooms or

2875
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:08,639
mushrooms and cannabis together to help

2876
01:49:06,158 --> 01:49:12,079
fight inflammation

2877
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:13,520
so i think that the the way that this

2878
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:15,198
involves inflammation or the way that

2879
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:18,320
mushrooms interact with inflammation has

2880
01:49:15,198 --> 01:49:21,598
a lot to do with um there's a type

2881
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:23,118
of inflammation that's not like swelling

2882
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:25,360
or like

2883
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:27,439
redness or all rashing and this type

2884
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:29,519
like this type of inflammation

2885
01:49:27,439 --> 01:49:32,399
is just like a systemic

2886
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:34,719
um release of chemical inflammatory

2887
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:37,039
factors in the body and in the brain and

2888
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:38,639
there's two places in serotonin where

2889
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:40,639
serotonin i think plays a big role in

2890
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:42,639
that the first one is in the gi tract

2891
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:45,279
and the second one's in the brain and

2892
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:47,840
inflammation in the brain can cause

2893
01:49:45,279 --> 01:49:50,399
depression and there's one specific

2894
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:52,319
subtype of depression that's caused by

2895
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:55,359
inflammation in the brain that actually

2896
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:56,399
leads to decreased levels of serotonin

2897
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:58,960
and so in this

2898
01:49:56,399 --> 01:50:01,359
in this case this would be a way that

2899
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:03,840
um you know perhaps you can rebalance

2900
01:50:01,359 --> 01:50:05,920
that or decrease the inflammation by

2901
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:08,000
supplementing with more serotonin it's i

2902
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:09,599
guess it's it's unclear whether the

2903
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,520
inflammation causes the decreased

2904
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:14,239
serotonin or the decreased serotonin

2905
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:16,400
causes the inflammation or vice versa

2906
01:50:14,238 --> 01:50:18,718
but by rebalancing

2907
01:50:16,399 --> 01:50:20,719
the signaling in your brain you can lead

2908
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:23,279
to a decreased

2909
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:26,000
level of inflammation or the release of

2910
01:50:23,279 --> 01:50:27,920
these inflammatory cytokines um because

2911
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,238
also in general

2912
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:32,719
this is just a very very large general

2913
01:50:30,238 --> 01:50:35,919
statement but in general inflammation in

2914
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:40,158
the brain is caused by like stress

2915
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:42,800
and like that we could potentially by

2916
01:50:40,158 --> 01:50:46,000
decreasing anxiety and stress

2917
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:47,760
then aid in our levels of systemic

2918
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,158
inflammation

2919
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:52,880
it really seems that one of the one of

2920
01:50:50,158 --> 01:50:54,319
the first benefits that people get from

2921
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:58,639
micro dosing

2922
01:50:54,319 --> 01:50:59,840
is increased resilience to anxiety and

2923
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:01,840
stress

2924
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:03,599
people who i meet that start micro

2925
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:06,159
dosing they're only a couple weeks in

2926
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:09,360
before they're all like you know life

2927
01:51:06,158 --> 01:51:11,519
isn't getting me down as much anymore um

2928
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:12,719
do we know what the

2929
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:14,880
um

2930
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:17,520
the the mode of action there is like

2931
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:19,679
what what why that's happening

2932
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:23,199
i don't know if anyone if there's ever

2933
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:26,239
been anything published on this um but i

2934
01:51:23,198 --> 01:51:27,519
my personal belief is that it has to do

2935
01:51:26,238 --> 01:51:29,598
with this

2936
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:31,840
low-level mimicking like mimicking of a

2937
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:35,840
low-level increase in your levels of

2938
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:37,920
serotonin that then kind of allow you to

2939
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:39,360
restructure that default

2940
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:42,079
and that

2941
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:44,719
that a lot of people who begin micro

2942
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:47,118
dosing for anxiety right or for

2943
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:50,719
like managing stress um

2944
01:51:47,118 --> 01:51:51,679
you are sensitized to those pathways

2945
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:54,000
that

2946
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:54,880
like lead to like negative thought loops

2947
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,840
and

2948
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:58,639
um

2949
01:51:55,840 --> 01:52:01,840
can spiral down into like negativity and

2950
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:03,840
it's it's not easy to change your your

2951
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,920
structuring of your brain that way and i

2952
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,719
think this that's the like part of the

2953
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:08,399
um

2954
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:12,399
book by michael poland how to change

2955
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:15,519
your mind right is that in many ways um

2956
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:18,238
you can use these microdoses as tools

2957
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:20,080
for restructuring the way that you

2958
01:52:18,238 --> 01:52:22,479
process the things that you are and

2959
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:25,198
aren't just about the level of stress

2960
01:52:22,479 --> 01:52:27,359
that your body or your brain takes it to

2961
01:52:25,198 --> 01:52:28,960
something stressful happens in your day

2962
01:52:27,359 --> 01:52:30,880
instead of

2963
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:31,679
allowing it to go to

2964
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,440
this

2965
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:36,480
this changes everything for the rest of

2966
01:52:33,439 --> 01:52:39,839
my life and you know and going down that

2967
01:52:36,479 --> 01:52:41,759
entire pathway um making it more of a

2968
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:45,360
habit let's say to

2969
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:47,440
stop that and only allow it to stress

2970
01:52:45,359 --> 01:52:49,359
you out to the extent that is more

2971
01:52:47,439 --> 01:52:51,759
manageable it's and that's not an easy

2972
01:52:49,359 --> 01:52:53,598
task that's not something that is

2973
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:55,199
that's not something that is easy it's

2974
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:56,480
something that takes a lot of conscious

2975
01:52:55,198 --> 01:52:58,960
effort and

2976
01:52:56,479 --> 01:53:01,439
and work and i think that

2977
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:03,118
micro dosing is a tool to make it easier

2978
01:53:01,439 --> 01:53:04,399
for your brain to like restructure to

2979
01:53:03,118 --> 01:53:07,279
that task

2980
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:09,039
right on so in addition to restructuring

2981
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:13,198
there is just simply

2982
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:16,000
um optimizing and and brain healing and

2983
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:18,319
um let's let's finish with this um you

2984
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,238
know we have talked many times on

2985
01:53:18,319 --> 01:53:23,279
shaping fire about

2986
01:53:20,238 --> 01:53:25,118
the use of cannabinoids especially cbd

2987
01:53:23,279 --> 01:53:27,559
cannabidiol

2988
01:53:25,118 --> 01:53:29,759
for its um uh

2989
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:32,080
neurogenesis benefits meaning the

2990
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:32,960
creation of

2991
01:53:32,079 --> 01:53:35,840
more

2992
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:39,198
uh neurons especially the uh the

2993
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:41,679
dopamine excreting cells that when lost

2994
01:53:39,198 --> 01:53:44,319
tend to lead to like parkinson's

2995
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:47,679
syndrome and and things like that and so

2996
01:53:44,319 --> 01:53:49,920
by taking by taking cbd we increase our

2997
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:51,599
brains neuroplasticity

2998
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:53,359
and because they

2999
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:55,520
because of the neurogenesis and now and

3000
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:58,399
now today we're talking about

3001
01:53:55,520 --> 01:54:01,599
the the neuroplasticity benefits from

3002
01:53:58,399 --> 01:54:03,839
mushrooms and perhaps neurogenesis

3003
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:05,440
would you talk a little bit just simply

3004
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:06,400
about how

3005
01:54:05,439 --> 01:54:08,960
um

3006
01:54:06,399 --> 01:54:11,039
micro dosing and you can you can add the

3007
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:13,840
cbd component if you wish

3008
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:17,359
just makes for a for a healthier

3009
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:19,279
younger functioning brain

3010
01:54:17,359 --> 01:54:20,960
yeah so i think younger is an

3011
01:54:19,279 --> 01:54:23,599
interesting that's an interesting

3012
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:26,000
adjective to use because

3013
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:29,520
in general when we're saying younger

3014
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:31,760
brain we're talking about more plastic

3015
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:33,520
or like less

3016
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:35,119
not finished is not the word we're never

3017
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:38,639
finished our brains are always going to

3018
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:40,719
be changing um but more like random

3019
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:43,840
thoughts and random connections and less

3020
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:46,639
like solidified and minimal connections

3021
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:49,440
and the reason why um

3022
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:51,840
things like in in general when things go

3023
01:54:49,439 --> 01:54:53,598
away or we lose we lose certain

3024
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:56,319
functionalities

3025
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:59,360
a piece of that has to do with our brain

3026
01:54:56,319 --> 01:55:02,479
not activating those pathways anymore or

3027
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:06,559
those or making those connections right

3028
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:08,718
um and i think one of the things that

3029
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:10,560
mushrooms help and that by activating

3030
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:13,599
the serotonin system in the way that it

3031
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:16,320
does which is pan activation all over

3032
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:18,639
um you really are sort of like

3033
01:55:16,319 --> 01:55:20,399
stimulating you're you're literally

3034
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:23,920
you're quite literally

3035
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:25,920
chemically stimulating a giant system

3036
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:27,920
in the brain that kind of just like jump

3037
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:30,079
starts and has all of these down there's

3038
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:31,520
all these downstream things that it will

3039
01:55:30,079 --> 01:55:32,479
interact with and that it will then

3040
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:34,719
activate

3041
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:38,158
um to kind of like

3042
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:38,960
give a bunch of different new pathways a

3043
01:55:38,158 --> 01:55:40,638
a

3044
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,920
boost or at least like a little

3045
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:44,400
activation

3046
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:45,118
um and what that can do is it can start

3047
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:47,679
a

3048
01:55:45,118 --> 01:55:50,960
you know it can start a bunch of other

3049
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:54,158
like next level um things that can lead

3050
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:56,560
to like eventually differences in the

3051
01:55:54,158 --> 01:55:58,799
way like your openness i guess

3052
01:55:56,560 --> 01:56:00,320
would be um

3053
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:02,400
one way of putting it like how you were

3054
01:56:00,319 --> 01:56:04,559
describing about having like a better

3055
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:06,158
way of reacting to anxiety the the other

3056
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:09,119
thing i would say is like is like

3057
01:56:06,158 --> 01:56:11,039
openness in general and flexibility and

3058
01:56:09,118 --> 01:56:12,880
that those things are all

3059
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:15,198
generally speaking associated with being

3060
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:18,159
happier which is also generally

3061
01:56:15,198 --> 01:56:20,960
associated with serotonin um

3062
01:56:18,158 --> 01:56:22,879
so that would be mechanistically the way

3063
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:25,439
that i think that

3064
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:28,000
that this is working is that it

3065
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:31,519
facilitates and encourages new

3066
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:34,479
connections because it creates and like

3067
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:36,639
sparks these new connections that

3068
01:56:34,479 --> 01:56:38,238
otherwise wouldn't have been stimulated

3069
01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:40,480
because there would be

3070
01:56:38,238 --> 01:56:43,039
limited places where serotonin would be

3071
01:56:40,479 --> 01:56:45,919
released because as we get older our

3072
01:56:43,039 --> 01:56:48,079
brains um are less and less plastic and

3073
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:50,880
we release serotonin in more and more

3074
01:56:48,079 --> 01:56:51,760
specific areas or in pathways that have

3075
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:54,159
been

3076
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:54,960
you know kind of cultivated as opposed

3077
01:56:54,158 --> 01:56:57,118
to

3078
01:56:54,960 --> 01:57:00,079
introducing a new molecule that mimics

3079
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:02,158
serotonin that will activate a bunch of

3080
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:04,639
different pathways that otherwise maybe

3081
01:57:02,158 --> 01:57:06,319
would not have been activated together

3082
01:57:04,639 --> 01:57:08,800
wow that's a really great explanation it

3083
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:11,279
reminds me a lot of like use it or lose

3084
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:13,760
it right like as as we get older if we

3085
01:57:11,279 --> 01:57:16,158
if we don't stay physical we lose some

3086
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:17,119
of our mobility and and our options

3087
01:57:16,158 --> 01:57:19,598
become

3088
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:21,359
more limited right that i can imagine

3089
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:23,520
that that would work the same way with a

3090
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:27,118
neural network too if we're if we're not

3091
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:29,360
stimulating these these various networks

3092
01:57:27,118 --> 01:57:31,279
eventually we're doing the same thing

3093
01:57:29,359 --> 01:57:33,920
every day and things are becoming a

3094
01:57:31,279 --> 01:57:36,880
little more rote and we start to lose

3095
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:39,279
options because some of those those

3096
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:42,960
neural pathways that that give us more

3097
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:44,479
mental options get pruned or or or are

3098
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:45,439
are less deep

3099
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:47,359
and

3100
01:57:45,439 --> 01:57:49,678
so by using

3101
01:57:47,359 --> 01:57:51,279
by by micro dosing we're just giving

3102
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:53,279
everything enough stimulation to keep

3103
01:57:51,279 --> 01:57:55,759
them online

3104
01:57:53,279 --> 01:57:58,158
yeah they quite literally do get pruned

3105
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:59,760
our our brain cells look a lot like

3106
01:57:58,158 --> 01:58:00,879
trees and

3107
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:02,800
yeah they do

3108
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:05,359
they they look a lot like trees and they

3109
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:06,880
do quite literally end up they they're

3110
01:58:05,359 --> 01:58:08,479
the purpose of that is to be more

3111
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:09,359
efficient right and to

3112
01:58:08,479 --> 01:58:11,439
to

3113
01:58:09,359 --> 01:58:14,319
deliver the messages down the same

3114
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:16,399
pathways faster and more efficiently um

3115
01:58:14,319 --> 01:58:20,000
but absolutely no that's

3116
01:58:16,399 --> 01:58:21,759
that's a good um analogy to use right on

3117
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,840
well miyabi thank you so much for

3118
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:26,400
joining me again um this was everything

3119
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:29,039
i hoped it would be and every time

3120
01:58:26,399 --> 01:58:32,238
we talk i learned so much and

3121
01:58:29,039 --> 01:58:34,158
um i get so much fan mail for you

3122
01:58:32,238 --> 01:58:37,439
through my account people really

3123
01:58:34,158 --> 01:58:40,479
enjoying your ability to take these um

3124
01:58:37,439 --> 01:58:44,000
these pretty complex uh you know

3125
01:58:40,479 --> 01:58:46,559
biological mechanisms and put them into

3126
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:49,599
uh examples that that anybody can

3127
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:52,560
understand so um so i appreciate you uh

3128
01:58:49,599 --> 01:58:55,119
going down this path with me about uh

3129
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:57,520
mushrooms today and and appreciate both

3130
01:58:55,118 --> 01:58:59,519
uh both your expertise and and you know

3131
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:01,440
good cheer with all this

3145
01:59:30,319 --> 01:59:34,238

for you to do that

3147
01:59:34,238 --> 01:59:40,158
by far the best is to start with

3148
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:41,679
miyabi's instagram account because while

3149

social media accounts come and go the

3151
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:49,599
instagram seems to be pretty steady and

3152
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:49,599
that's miyabi p-h-g

3153
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:56,880
m-i-y-a-b-e-p-h-d miyabi p-h-d on

3154
01:59:53,279 --> 01:59:59,279
instagram and then also miyabi has a

3155
01:59:56,880 --> 02:00:01,599
gargantuan following on tick-tock you

3156
01:59:59,279 --> 02:00:03,439
