1
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:14,529
I think that one of the kind of hidden

2
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:18,189
in plain sight secrets of Canada's home

3
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:20,829
growing is is how many people water

4
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:23,890
their plants with chlorinated tap water

5
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:26,049
from the city and don't want to cop to

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,880
it right I mean I think we all pretty

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,070
much know that we should not be using

8
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:33,339
the tap water because it usually is

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:37,058
chlorine and chloramines and fluoride

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:39,670
and all these things that are toxins to

11
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:43,539
the micro of life right but at the same

12
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:47,588
time you know having the water you know

13
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:49,510
out or spun to blow off the chlorine and

14
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:51,640
even worse as the chloramines right

15
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:53,378
which you can't blow off a lot of people

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,299
just don't have time for that right or

17
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:56,979
they're just generally would easy about

18
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:58,689
it right and so they don't and so they

19
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:03,308
just go ahead straight with the tap

20
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:05,259
water and and you know if we took it as

21
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:07,810
a rule clearly that should not be done

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,700
but a lot of folks are like my plant

23
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:13,329
still grows you know it still does

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:17,680
alright and so um you know we break out

25
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:20,529
for us how significant it is using tap

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,180
water versus using something that is

27
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,579
fresh without the chemicals doesn't

28
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,909
really matter sure well you know it I

29
00:01:24,578 --> 00:01:30,758
think it does ultimately can we really

30
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:32,409
tell the difference I'm not sure let me

31
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,930
believe me back up I'm so glad I have a

32
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:37,090
will yeah cuz it's just you're right

33
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:40,210
it's one of those things most people

34
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,728
don't think about people just water

35
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:45,188
their plants and and and here's why that

36
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:46,810
works and they won't go backwards it

37
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,548
works because first of all if you let

38
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,310
the water just sit for fifteen or twenty

39
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:53,590
minutes or an hour the the chlorine will

40
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,899
evaporate in either case by putting the

41
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,670
chlorine and the chloramine what you're

42
00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:01,599
right is much worse because it never

43
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:04,420
evaporates into soil what happens is the

44
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:08,019
organics in the soil complex it up they

45
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:10,330
tie it up so that it may kill initially

46
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,610
but it gets tied up and then it's it's

47
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,590
no longer active

48
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,120
so to speak and so that's why you're

49
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,860
able to water your plants they don't die

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,599
the microbes are still alive it's

51
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,600
Internet cetera are you killing any

52
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,299
microbes probably are you killing lots

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,460
of them I don't know there are three or

54
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,680
four ways you can you can find out you

55
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,840
can test the soil you could send it in

56
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,500
for so food web test you know you you

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,200
could see whether the soil really is

58
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,759
different from my perspective it's just

59
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,369
so easy to just lift the bucket of water

60
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:44,429
sit and go over you have a watering can

61
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,259
and just let it sit or a barrel and use

62
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,300
that water that's taking care of the

63
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:51,959
chlorine and then let the other stuff

64
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,610
complex up some people put tang in which

65
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,770
complexes it up but the organic matter

66
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,959
does hang you don't mean the orange

67
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,939
beverage from space yeah but that's like

68
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,969
and sugared formula bacteria yeah

69
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:05,579
absolutely I think if you look goggle

70
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:07,229
fish tanks and you know poor meaningless

71
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,459
centers and that's what the tanks that

72
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:14,009
probably started from but so what do you

73
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,890
do let the water sit for a while and and

74
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:18,269
it is a problem if you could use well

75
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,939
water that's a better way to go

76
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:23,069
obviously rainwater I you know I used to

77
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:25,199
suggest just keep a barrel of rain water

78
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,289
around but cheap so look that Clank will

79
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,179
sit in it yeah right yeah so so let's

80
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:33,719
talk about this the idea of having the

81
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,250
water out because the the chlorine it

82
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,620
bakes off pretty easily

83
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,629
but you're still left with chloramine

84
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,459
right and you said that when we when we

85
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:46,439
pour the chloramine water into the plant

86
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,930
there's some biology there that will

87
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,819
bind with the chloramine and make it

88
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,390
let's just say inner for lack of a

89
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,359
better word

90
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:56,969
could we add whatever that is to the

91
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,380
water and have that done before we pour

92
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:00,780
it a couple of handfuls of compost

93
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:02,340
absolutely no question about it

94
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,709
let's sit there for an hour two or three

95
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,049
and stir it every now and then yeah

96
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,640
definitely what's what's in the mature

97
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,430
compost that binds with the chlorine

98
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,179
well it's it's organic material so you

99
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,750
know whatever

100
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,798
we got an air deep article of play and

101
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,839
human plagues I said some things like

102
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,508
that yeah yeah exactly

103
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,448
and and it's the things that the

104
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:26,430
microbes eat up enough so the context is

105
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:29,100
it up and I'm sure Michael didn't take

106
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,900
it out so so let's say people who really

107
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,449
want to you know take action on rice

108
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:35,969
let's say that that you've got a you

109
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:39,090
know a typical water barrel and and you

110
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,310
poured water from your city tap into it

111
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:43,709
and so like you know what is that like a

112
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,199
55-gallon you know you say just you know

113
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:48,689
throw a couple couple handfuls yeah

114
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,870
that'd be a great way to go ah I just

115
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:54,509
don't you know throw it yeah throw in

116
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:59,720
for a 55-gallon I do it two or three or

117
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:59,719
four pounds just run bubbled or stirred

118
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,139
if I was making because I am without

119
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:09,120
making aerated compost tea separately I

120
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,069
could just pour it right in there and it

121
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,959
will clean up the chloramines absolutely

122
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,909
that's the solution I was looking for oh

123
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,228
yeah and of course you're killing some

124
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,720
of the company when you're making the

125
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:20,939
compost tea no you'll be killing someone

126
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,979
Stan yeah yeah well but I'd rather have

127
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:24,569
that happen and then container than in

128
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:28,399
my plot he wanted yeah you want to try

129
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:28,399
to keep the integrity the rhizosphere

130
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:36,449
sure so you know again millions of

131
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:39,240
people one of their plants with the

132
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:42,180
chlorine and the chlorine in it anything

133
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,759
you can do to reduce it is definitely

134
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,949
not hurting your plant and for

135
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,990
everything that I remember it certainly

136
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:53,029
could be helping it right cool thank you

137
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,030
very much yeah we got

138
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,769
you
