2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,119
fungus of all kinds are really becoming

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,019
popular with a wider range of people

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,058
psilocybin is slowly starting to be

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,460
legalized for research and therapy while

6
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:19,500
psilocybin micro dosing has exploded in

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,240
every corner of the country we are

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,820
hearing reports of fungus that eats

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:26,399
microplastics how turkey tail helps cure

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,980
cancer and how lion's mane mushroom are

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,659
pretty much your brain's best friend of

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,880
course culinary mushrooms have been

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,100
enjoyed by humans forever but we are

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,020
seeing a huge Resurgence in home and

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,939
small farm growing of culinary mushrooms

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,800
meaning that rare non-commercial

17
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,199
varieties are popping up at farmers

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,238
markets and in the neighborhood trades

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,520
last year I discovered that I totally

20
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,199
loved wine cap mushrooms I had never

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,719
come across that Kraft mushroom until

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,700
gifted it by a home cultivator now I'm

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,679
constantly searching for them and

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,600
finally the fungus in the soil is

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,539
essential for all the food we eat and

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,399
the flowers we love especially cannabis

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,219
so many mushroom varieties touching our

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,840
lives and being helpful in so many ways

29
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:08,400

I'm your host shangolos

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,479
my guest today is Stephanie Garcia

59
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:11,759
Mycologist Stephanie Garcia has a degree

60
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,620
in botany and Plant Pathology and

61
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,479
completed her master's program at the

62
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,480
University of Hawaii in tropical

63
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,818
conservation biology focusing on below

64
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,699
ground fungal diversity over varying

65
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:25,979
environmental gradients on Hawaii Island

66
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,719
after completing her Masters she

67
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,939
proceeded to tour southeast Asia

68
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,979
studying local plants and mushrooms and

69
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,318
landed back in Oregon spending time

70
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:35,818
between cannabis harvests and the Bureau

71
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,179
of Land Management

72
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:40,079
she now studies both endo and

73
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,000
ectomycorrhizal fungi and their

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,459
associations and benefits to various

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,039
plant hosts as quality compliance

76
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,019
manager at mycorrhizal applications

77
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,818
Stephanie and her husband Emery are

78
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,920
expecting their first child in just a

79
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:54,719
couple weeks so we are especially glad

80
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,579
that she chose to fit Us in before that

81
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,680
major Milestone and if you listen

82
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,840
closely you will hear their dogs norm

83
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,060
and Betty in the background

84
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,500
on today's episode of shaping fire we

85
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,000
will make sure we are all on the same

86
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,739
page regarding the differences between

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
mycelium mycorrhizae endomycorrhizae and

88
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:14,099
ectomycorrhizae followed by a deeper

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
discussion about mycelium specifically

90
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:19,500
during the second set we will focus on

91
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,598
endomycorrhizae its functions and how

92
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,759
you can damage its functioning by

93
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,799
inhibiting the symbiosis taking place in

94
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,719
the soil and we finished the episode

95
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,760
with a wide-ranging discussion of best

96
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,039
practices for creating a thriving

97
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,039
environment for mycelium and mycorrhizae

98
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,318
including inoculants proper watering pH

99
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:41,158
proper nutrition and the use of ground

100
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:43,500
covers welcome to shaping fire Stephanie

101
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,539
thanks for having me Shane go so let's

102
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,000
start off with two bits of vocabulary

103
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,098
that are misused all the time in soil

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,259
discussion

105
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:54,000
mycorrhizae and mycelium will be used

106
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:56,759
you know obviously the entire episode

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,280
today but it isn't uncommon for folks to

108
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:02,098
use the two words mycorrhizae and

109
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,019
mycelium interchangeably and and they're

110
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:06,359
not the same thing so will you start by

111
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,000
teasing those apart for us

112
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,739
certainly yeah that's a

113
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,060
that's a good question I like that you

114
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,640
point out that some people can get

115
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,759
certain things confused like that

116
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,819
so when we talk about mycelium we're

117
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,719
actually talking about the vegetative

118
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:28,560
structure of a fungi so you could think

119
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,040
of it as being analogous to plant roots

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,800
so you could think of it as fungal roots

121
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,000
so that's what the mycelium that's what

122
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,579
mycelium is so if you have a mushroom if

123
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,160
you go mushroom hunting and you find a

124
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,659
fruiting body like say you go for morels

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,639
right now because it's a perfect time of

126
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,800
year to be looking for morels there's

127
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,740
going to be an entire network of their

128
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,800
root system Underground

129
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,220
now when we're talking about mycorrhizae

130
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,060
that's actually describing a symbiotic

131
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,639
relationship it's a mutualism and it's

132
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,379
occurring between the plant roots and

133
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,379
those fungi fungal roots

134
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:20,039
so mycorrhizae is is more of an activity

135
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:21,960
than a physical thing that like that has

136
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,900
a name that's a noun it's it's it's it's

137
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,879
more active than that it describes this

138
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:29,219
relationship it isn't it isn't

139
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,279
necessarily oh there's a mycorrhizae

140
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:36,199
right there it's more like ah those are

141
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:39,959
two that is a host and a fungal network

142
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:43,020
exhibiting mycorrhizae activity

143
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:45,659
yeah yeah that would be correct so you

144
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:49,019
know I mentioned the morale earlier that

145
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:51,419
is a mycorrhizal fungi but you wouldn't

146
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,639
call their root system a mycorrhizae

147
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:56,399
right so you could say a morale is a

148
00:05:53,639 --> 00:06:00,180
mycorrhizal fungi but when you want to

149
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:02,819
describe what how the morels mycelium is

150
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,699
interacting with its plant host that

151
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:08,099
would be the mycorrhizal symbiosis

152
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:12,478
so yeah my crazy is really describing

153
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:15,360
the symbiosis it's used incorrectly all

154
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:18,060
the time and like you know earlier in my

155
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,419
soil knowledge I definitely was

156
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,160
um uh you know doing that myself so

157
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:24,719
um and while we're at it because even

158
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,819
though during the first set we're going

159
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,680
to discuss mycelium networks and then

160
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,199
we're going to focus more on mycorrhizae

161
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,680
and set two I am pretty sure that you're

162
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,400
going to be talking about mycorrhizae

163
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,038
um as part of your answers during set

164
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,439
one so we we should probably also get

165
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,839
the the other key vocabulary that we

166
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,600
want to tease apart to which is the

167
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,939
difference between endomycorrhizae and

168
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,259
ectomycorrhizae

169
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:57,839
yeah yeah so Endo mycorrhizae when you

170
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,220
think of endo you think of inside or

171
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,758
that's the Latin

172
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:05,100
you know meaning for endos inside

173
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,840
um so really what it's describing is

174
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,500
what's happening more on the cellular

175
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,500
level inside of the root but if we go

176
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,600
even more broadly

177
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:19,019
endomycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic

178
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,259
relationship with about 80 to 85 percent

179
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:25,079
of plant species

180
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,479
so all of our aggro most of our

181
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:30,598
agricultural crops a lot of our

182
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:33,899
ornamental crops all grasses

183
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:36,719
so I call them more of our bread and

184
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:39,239
butter of mycorrhizal fungi because they

185
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,340
associate with such a wide range of host

186
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,439
plants

187
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:46,019
um now let's go back down into the root

188
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,839
on the cellular level hyphy will

189
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:51,478
penetrate into the root and it goes

190
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,799
between cells but it also goes inside

191
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,560
the cells

192
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,038
and then inside the cell is really where

193
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,459
the nutrient exchange is occurring and

194
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:05,519
the endomycorrhizae they make a

195
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:10,258
specialized structure called arbuscules

196
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:15,139
so that's the site of nutrient Exchange

197
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:18,439
um most endomyclerizal fungi also form

198
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:21,620
vesicles that's a storage structure

199
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:25,259
these fungi are really good

200
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:28,860
at helping plants overcome drought type

201
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:31,740
conditions vesicles they believe for you

202
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,860
know one reason why they can do that so

203
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:38,879
uh anyway the Endo mycorrhizal fungi

204
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,240
you'll also see them or hear them being

205
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:44,539
referred to as

206
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,560
AMF and that just stands for arbuscular

207
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:48,419
mycorrhizal fungi

208
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:52,139
you can also hear or see them being

209
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:55,559
referred to as vam that's vesicular or

210
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:57,659
muscular mycorrhizae micrizal fungi

211
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,359
so they don't

212
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:03,179
refer them anymore refer to them anymore

213
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,399
as the vam because some species don't

214
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:07,379
produce as vesicles

215
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,259
so yeah we're getting really detailed

216
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:13,500
there on the endomycorrhizal fungi but

217
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:16,259
it is important to understand that these

218
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,899
hyphy of these types of fungi they go

219
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:22,080
inside the cell and then the nutrient

220
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,299
exchange is happening happening within

221
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,759
the cytosolic fluid

222
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:30,659
now ectomicorizal fungi on the other

223
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:33,120
hand they don't associate with as broad

224
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:35,579
of a host

225
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,159
um Range so they're associating with

226
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,540
maybe five to ten percent of plant

227
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,179
species

228
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:44,099
primarily conifers

229
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:47,159
some Hardwoods

230
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:50,399
and then there are some agriculturally

231
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:53,278
important plants that form the

232
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,458
ectomycorrhizal symbiosis

233
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,519
so then if we go down to that cellular

234
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:02,099
level again and we compare it to the

235
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:05,100
endomicorizal fungi the ectomycorrhizal

236
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:08,519
fungi also make specialized

237
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:13,500
structures they do also penetrate into

238
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:16,379
the root but they also make a mantle so

239
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,778
mycelium will cover the outside of the

240
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:20,939
root kind of like a sock right so your

241
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:23,820
foot is like the root

242
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,779
so the mycelium covers the root on the

243
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,180
outside

244
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:30,360
and then it also penetrates

245
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,199
inside the room but instead of carrying

246
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,680
out

247
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:38,940
the nutrient Exchange in an individual

248
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:41,879
plant cell the mycelium travels around

249
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,760
the cells and they call that a heartache

250
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:46,439
net and so this is another more

251
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,860
specialized structure that they make

252
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:53,180
they don't produce any type of

253
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,919
our vascules our vesicles

254
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:59,099
so yeah they're just they're doing all

255
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:01,620
their nutrient Exchange in between cells

256
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,980
and since we're talking primarily about

257
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,200
cannabis cultivation and the Ecto is

258
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,539
really only uh interacting with I think

259
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,278
you said like 10 or 15 percent of plants

260
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:13,439
we're probably going to be talking when

261
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,778
we talk about mycorrhizae today we're

262
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,760
going to be generally assuming we're

263
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:20,338
talking about endomycorrhizae unless you

264
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,179
point out otherwise right yeah that's

265
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,740
correct cannabis doesn't associate with

266
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:28,679
ectomycorrhizal fungi so right on well

267
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,060
that makes it easier today so so okay so

268
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,859
that's why I wanted to start out there

269
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:33,739
with the definitions of mycelium

270
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,579
mycorrhizae and then and then

271
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,039
endomycorrhizae just for everybody's

272
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:40,199
benefit so with that said we will we

273
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:41,939
will uh jump back and talk uh much more

274
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,820
in detail about mycorrhizae during set

275
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,560
two but but here let's smooth on in

276
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,660
right now to talking about mycelium

277
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,259
networks to get a really good

278
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:55,019
understanding on what those are so so

279
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:57,720
mycelium are the fleshy vegetative white

280
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:00,360
strands that form massive networks in

281
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,300
the soil we now know what does it

282
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,539
consist of like what what actually do

283
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:08,879
the white strands what are they made of

284
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:11,399
other than just generally fungus and and

285
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,620
how are they made

286
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,320
hmm interesting

287
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:19,259
um well fungal cell walls are made of

288
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,440
chitin so that's really what they're

289
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:24,059
composed of and

290
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,500
they're made through meiosis I mean you

291
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:28,018
know they're growing just in the same

292
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,839
way fresh fresh growth would occur from

293
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,179
a plant right so they're really

294
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:37,440
exploratory like you said most of them

295
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:41,099
are more whitish tannish in color

296
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,339
um mycelium can consist of just one long

297
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:48,079
tubular like structure and it can also

298
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:52,200
have SEPTA which divides

299
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:53,819
divides this long tubular structure

300
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,860
um

301
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,540
and and for folks who aren't familiar

302
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,800
with meiosis

303
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:00,439
um would you just explain that real

304
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,120
quick

305
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,639
sure so I mean that's a it's

306
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,879
reproduction right so we're basically

307
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:11,820
having cell division occur

308
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,620
um and then the DNA is being passed

309
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:17,040
there's a there's I mean it's a pretty

310
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:19,620
uh technical process and it also depends

311
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,240
on the species right but even even what

312
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,980
you already said just kind of makes it

313
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,740
clear I I what I was trying to getting

314
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,659
at is like what is the what is the the

315
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,539
mycelium making machine and the answer

316
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:32,519
is itself is right by by cellular

317
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:36,179
splitting just making itself more of

318
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,100
itself right right right on so for for

319
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:40,799
those of us who you know are

320
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,259
transplanting our plants or maybe we're

321
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:46,319
out uh in the field collecting

322
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:48,480
indigenous microorganisms or

323
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,480
um or or whatever we're doing um we'll

324
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,759
come across mycelium strands that are

325
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,039
like a whole range of colors from like

326
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,439
the bright white which I always think of

327
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:00,958
as oves those look really healthy and

328
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,880
whereas some are you know more of a

329
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:07,979
whitish gray or some are like a

330
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:10,259
whiter-ish beige are are these different

331
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,899
um strains of mycelium that are these

332
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,899
different colors or does or does you

333
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:19,078
know a healthy thriving

334
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:22,019
mycelium is it always white and and

335
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:23,519
these colorations are signs of some kind

336
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,220
of imbalance

337
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:30,360
that's a really great question

338
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:33,420
um yeah it is really a species dependent

339
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:36,539
um you know morels for example they they

340
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:38,159
don't have this bright white necessarily

341
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:40,198
mycelium especially when you have them

342
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:44,100
in culture

343
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:46,679
um so I would say you know that yeah

344
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,259
there may be some type of environmental

345
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,719
condition that might make them this more

346
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:53,220
dull yellow

347
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,740
um you know maybe they're not the most

348
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,740
healthy but also we have a lot of

349
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,360
different colors of mycelium depending

350
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,519
on the species

351
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,440
that's good to know too because

352
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,940
um I know you know as I said my question

353
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,100
I thought that I needed it all to be

354
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,440
bright and I should not judge my

355
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,199
mycelium necks were harshly just because

356
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,720
they don't look bright and because that

357
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,859
could that could cause me to incorrectly

358
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,899
diagnose this situation

359
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,959
so if there are different

360
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:28,799
um strains of mycelium

361
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:32,159
um how do mycelium networks of different

362
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:34,559
species interact do they do they you

363
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,899
know explore and then butt up to each

364
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,479
other and then and then connect even

365
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:42,179
though they're different species or are

366
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,639
these are these mycelium networks of of

367
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:47,578
different strains

368
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,560
um uh kind of wrapped around each other

369
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:51,559
but not necessarily connected

370
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,500
a great question Django I'm glad you're

371
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,899
full

372
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:02,059
uh so I think I would say that's really

373
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:05,399
species dependent we know in some

374
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:07,439
mycorrhizal fungi there is competition

375
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,940
so

376
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,100
um you know I know of one researcher

377
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:14,579
that works on rhizopogon that is an

378
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:18,778
ectomycorrhizal fungi but they'll be

379
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:19,519
more competitive for their resources so

380
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:23,159
um

381
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,959
they don't necessarily they may you know

382
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:26,639
they may just exist wrapped around each

383
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,198
other but really they're they're

384
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,198
competing for resources

385
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:35,519
um so so so in that case

386
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,560
um I think that most of us think about

387
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,019
the mycelium networks as being these

388
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:42,419
these nutrition transport networks and

389
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:44,278
they're connecting everybody and you

390
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,719
know in my mind I go so far as I think

391
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,480
oh they're trying to help everybody get

392
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,720
along but actually there is competition

393
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,920
between mycelial relationships so they

394
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:59,579
are they are bonding with networks that

395
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:01,198
they see as allies and then and then

396
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:04,019
turning a cold shoulder and not

397
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,639
connecting to networks that they see as

398
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:07,619
competitive

399
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,020
yeah you could think of it that way but

400
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:11,519
one thing I do want to just clarify is

401
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:14,279
that

402
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,318
um there are there are other there's

403
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:17,759
another group of fungi that we're kind

404
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,798
of forgetting about a little bit we're

405
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,859
forgetting about our saprophytic fungi

406
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:26,160
so they're not necessarily creating a

407
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:30,019
network between plants

408
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,720
um you know amongst each other their

409
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:36,839
mycelium is really there to Decay dead

410
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:40,140
organic matter and they're the recyclers

411
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:43,019
right I mean they're recycling the Duff

412
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,059
and so those those are a little

413
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,859
different in that they're creating their

414
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:49,500
own little Network just so that they can

415
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:51,779
eat more right so they can Decay more

416
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,940
and then eventually maybe they can fruit

417
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,319
you know I think you're I think you're

418
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,298
right that was good that you picked that

419
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:59,939
up I I definitely think that I was

420
00:17:57,298 --> 00:18:03,179
putting the responsibilities for

421
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,038
mycelium and saprophytic fungus into the

422
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,960
same basket yeah that's good for me to

423
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:11,220
tease those apart too so

424
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,919
so um so the the mycelium networks while

425
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:17,579
I was picturing them being large like

426
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,860
like in uh covering a wide space and

427
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:22,379
therefore had this idea that they were

428
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:24,000
also going from plant to plant I don't

429
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,840
know exactly how I was picturing that

430
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,839
but

431
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:30,480
um but really uh perhaps mycelium

432
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,220
networks are a little bit more localized

433
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,839
based on

434
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,519
um I don't know the project or their the

435
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,439
responsibility of that particular

436
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,599
mycelium Network

437
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,519
yeah I like that you can think of it

438
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,639
almost like their little project because

439
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,259
even thinking outside of the saprophytic

440
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,660
fungi that are decaying this dead

441
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:52,259
organic matter we also have parasitic

442
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,880
fungi right so we know that those could

443
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,619
spread from

444
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,900
um you know those could certainly make a

445
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:00,119
network and go from tree to tree but

446
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:03,900
they could also be more localized just

447
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:06,839
dependent on is their host available

448
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,120
um what can they infect right

449
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:12,839
um where do they infect because we have

450
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:15,839
other fungi that are primarily existing

451
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,119
on leaves that are causing damage there

452
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,298
right

453
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,579
so but yeah I think when we think about

454
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:26,579
mycelium and one reason why I love

455
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:28,019
mycorrhizal fungi so much is that we

456
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:29,460
really think of them more as the

457
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:31,798
protagonist

458
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,079
and we want to think of mycelium as

459
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:36,179
being this just incredible thing in this

460
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,759
network that spreads you know between

461
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,440
the trees and like you say try to you

462
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,200
know help everybody get along and

463
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,000
distribute out nutrients really well

464
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,000
um so I think when we think of mycelial

465
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,339
networks we really do think about the

466
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,359
more beneficial kind and that would be

467
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:56,879
more you know like the mycorrhizal fungi

468
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,619
and if I tend to drift into giving

469
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,780
um credit to mycelium that's for

470
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:02,639
safrophytic fungus be sure to call me

471
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:04,319
out on it again because I don't want to

472
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,538
be spreading the Bro Science we're here

473
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,879
to get it right I mean but those are

474
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,919
great too because you know I mean we

475
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,679
would have just meters and meters of

476
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,080
death in our forests and and there's

477
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,820
also some very tasty saprophytic fungi

478
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,399
so we don't want to forget about those

479
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:23,279
for sure all right so so let's talk

480
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:28,140
about some of these tasks that um that

481
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:31,200
we rely on mycelium uh to do so so

482
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,759
um why don't you just instead of me like

483
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,860
just kind of like trying to pull a list

484
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:37,079
out of the air um you're the expert so

485
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:39,479
so let me just kind of hand you the mic

486
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:43,199
and tell us a little bit about the the

487
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,058
varied tasks that my celium is doing

488
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,340
um in the soil

489
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:50,038
um you know as part of its role

490
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:52,139
sure yeah and I do just want to say you

491
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,660
know I'm I still don't consider myself

492
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,179
an expert I just consider myself you

493
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,519
know constantly uh trying to educate

494
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:02,940
myself in the in this pursuit of

495
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,879
knowledge specifically with fungi so

496
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,860
um I appreciate you saying that but uh

497
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,900
you know you can be humble but like we

498
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:11,279
all we all heard your your credentials

499
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,720
at the beginning of the show and and

500
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,660
you're here because like you know you're

501
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,400
kind of the expert so so I I appreciate

502
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,360
your humility on it but uh I have a

503
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,880
feeling you have all the information

504
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:23,479
that we're looking for yeah I'll strive

505
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,600
I'll strive to meet those expectations

506
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:30,500
okay so you want to know about the roles

507
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:34,558
of mycelium within the soil please okay

508
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:37,019
so I think I think mycelium's you know

509
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,839
it's main objective and it may be more

510
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:43,038
of a selfish objective on its part is

511
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:46,259
to gain enough resources to reproduce

512
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:48,599
right that's going to be the main goal

513
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:50,640
it's like I'm going to explore the soil

514
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:54,240
I'm going to try to gain resources

515
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:58,259
enough to take care of myself

516
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:01,740
um so I think that's one objective is

517
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:05,339
that the mycelium is getting what it

518
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:07,259
needs to to go through its own life

519
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:09,980
cycle

520
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:12,298
um I think another thing is just very

521
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,159
exploratory I think there's like let's

522
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:17,579
say these side benefits

523
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,919
of mycelium and what it's doing within

524
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:22,579
our soil so

525
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,020
for those mycelium to be

526
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:29,399
exploring the soil they're really

527
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:33,359
contributing to soil structure

528
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,519
um to water infiltration which also

529
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,879
helps preventing runoff

530
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:41,579
and providing climate resistance

531
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,100
so I think there's um there's a big role

532
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:46,678
for them there

533
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:49,619
um if I can go back to my mycorrhizal

534
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:53,298
fungi for a moment our muscular

535
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:56,939
mycorrhizal fungi they release a

536
00:22:53,298 --> 00:23:00,359
glycoprotein it's called glomalin and

537
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,058
that is just this incredible protein

538
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:06,178
that helps to

539
00:23:02,058 --> 00:23:09,960
aggregate soil and that's really

540
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:11,700
fascinating not only for this

541
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,279
um you know helping to keep soil

542
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,819
structure and the water water

543
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:21,599
infiltration but it also can hold on to

544
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:24,839
carbon when your soil has more structure

545
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,339
to it and then those nutrients are more

546
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:28,918
available

547
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:32,099
so I think that there's

548
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,259
um a really big role for mycelium

549
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:38,219
to play and

550
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:40,740
some of this nutrient cycling

551
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:45,240
excuse me we also

552
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:47,099
we also know that some mycelium will

553
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,140
actually excrete

554
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:51,359
secrete enzymes

555
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,340
and that can help make a lot of

556
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,379
different nutrients more biologically

557
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:57,178
available ones that wouldn't be

558
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,640
otherwise

559
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:01,320
and then it's it allows you know the

560
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,140
soluble nutrients to actually be

561
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:05,939
absorbed and then transported to the

562
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,240
plant

563
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:12,120
um so there's

564
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,099
I think that these are some of some of

565
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,259
the main ones just right away that I'm

566
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:18,000
that I can think of

567
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:22,440
um let's talk about the transportation

568
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,798
of uh nutrition so I'm realizing now

569
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:28,860
that of some of what I imagined

570
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:31,379
um mycelium networks doing which would

571
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:36,959
be like moving nutrition between

572
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:40,740
different plants that's probably a a a a

573
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,779
larger role than mycelium is doing and

574
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:46,980
that might be more of a saprophytic

575
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:48,619
fungus role is is the mycelium going to

576
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,960
be mostly

577
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:55,319
moving nutrition from the surrounding

578
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,480
soil environment and just bringing it

579
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,519
back to

580
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,400
um the the root Zone

581
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:04,259
um as essentially to the mycorrhizae

582
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,120
which is going to interact with the with

583
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:09,900
the plant

584
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:13,379
um uh so it's it's kind of like it is it

585
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,700
is out searching for nutrition for its

586
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,799
own

587
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,580
um

588
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:23,940
uh life benefit but then by doing that

589
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:26,339
it is also bringing that nutrition back

590
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,740
to the mycorrhizae which is which will

591
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:31,558
will discuss more in detail later is

592
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,259
then is in interacting with the plant is

593
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:35,480
is my range of where it's doing that

594
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:38,220
nutrition

595
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,558
work do I have that right where it's a

596
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,919
bit closer to the root Zone

597
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:46,379
yeah so I think the the saprophytic

598
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,659
fungi and the micrizal fungi they're

599
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,240
really working together so the

600
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:54,179
saprophytic fungi that those fungi may

601
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,278
be able to break down

602
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:59,820
um you know specifically more carbon

603
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:01,980
than the mycorrhizal fungi and as we

604
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:03,778
know Microsoft fungi they they're really

605
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,058
associating with plants because they

606
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:08,159
can't they're not able to access the

607
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:09,778
carbon on their own that's that's the

608
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,179
exchange

609
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:14,339
um I'll save this for the next session

610
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,000
really but

611
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,639
um

612
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,200
so let's say the saprophytic fungi their

613
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,538
primary role is going to be decaying

614
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,640
this dead organic matter

615
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:26,819
um you know making carbon available for

616
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:30,020
the plant but then the fungi or the

617
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:33,058
mycorrasal fungi they're they're more

618
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:35,960
exploratory and they're actually able to

619
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:40,200
deliver the nutrients to the plant

620
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:43,140
through their symbiosis right so

621
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,819
the saprophytic fungi they may make some

622
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,740
of these nutrients biologically

623
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:49,259
available but they don't really have

624
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,140
that delivery mechanism unless they're

625
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:54,900
very close to the plant root Zone

626
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,000
so the mycorrhizal fungi and they're my

627
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:01,278
celial network is really incredible

628
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,619
because they can increase the root

629
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:08,778
absorption Zone like our plants can only

630
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:12,839
reach so far mycelium is so much smaller

631
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:15,538
in size than a plant root right and then

632
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:18,058
they can travel for so much longer than

633
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:22,640
our plant roots can so they can really

634
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:22,639
become exploratory in the soil

635
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,278
entry areas that our plants cannot and

636
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,440
then they're able to access nutrients

637
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,159
that the plant isn't and then their

638
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,720
mycelium is like a little Highway

639
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,720
of nutrients going to the plant

640
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,580
um I do also want to mention which I

641
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,380
just think is interesting that

642
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:48,658
mycorrhizal fungi you know there's

643
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,539
evidence to suggest that they've evolved

644
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:54,900
from saprophytic fungi so some

645
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:58,798
mycorrhizal fungi still do hold the

646
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:01,980
genes that can do these other types of

647
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,000
breakdown of nutrients

648
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,339
um so I just think that's really

649
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,579
interesting because

650
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:10,918
some mycraisal fungi we say are obligate

651
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:13,558
they have to have a plant hose because

652
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:17,400
they can't access their own carbon but

653
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:19,918
then we know some mycrazal fungi are not

654
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,320
obligate and they could they still

655
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,240
maintain some of some of these genes so

656
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,639
that they can exist without the plant

657
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,319
host

658
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,360
so so

659
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:33,119
um you know we're big supporters of the

660
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:36,298
soil of the soil food web explanation

661
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:39,439
for looking at soil here what role does

662
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:42,000
mycelium play in the soil assisting

663
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,460
microbe communities and and other life

664
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,259
in the soil because I'm I'm guessing

665
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,860
that it isn't just a relationship

666
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:51,778
between you know uh Breaking Down

667
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:54,000
Nutrition and transporting nutrition

668
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:55,859
towards the root Zone

669
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,700
um I'm guessing that that all the

670
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:02,099
inhabitants of the rhizosphere have got

671
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,380
varying relationships with mycelium that

672
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:07,619
are beneficial

673
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,539
certainly well we did talk you know

674
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:13,019
briefly about

675
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:15,720
soil structure and water infiltration

676
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:16,619
right and this hyphy

677
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,240
um

678
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:24,178
you know going through the soil and

679
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,220
allowing that infiltration of water and

680
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:29,759
then just helping the soil actually hold

681
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:33,538
the water right and then we did speak a

682
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:37,440
little bit about how when you have this

683
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:40,319
really more positive let's say soil

684
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,860
structure it can hold on

685
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:48,058
um to carbon more readily and so we know

686
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:49,979
that our soil organic carbon is food for

687
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:52,259
microbes right so if you have an

688
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,720
increased amount of soil carbon you

689
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:56,940
typically see an increase in in the

690
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,360
microbial activity

691
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:02,820
so I think mycelium plays it's like

692
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:05,819
cyclical right so they grow and they

693
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:08,278
explore and then carbons held onto and

694
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:10,439
then these microbes are like oh this is

695
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:12,119
awesome you know I'm gonna we're gonna

696
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,038
there's gonna be more microbes because

697
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:16,439
we have more food and

698
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:18,058
and then they Thrive and then the soil

699
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,038
just becomes

700
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:22,678
um just more it's just more and more

701
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:27,359
healthy right right everybody gets fed

702
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,360
when mycelium is doing its job right

703
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:33,778
um so I know that some people talk about

704
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:35,940
how mycelium can help remediate the soil

705
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:39,000
that's been contaminated by a whole

706
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,740
range of things but specifically I'm

707
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,220
curious about

708
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,659
um a pathogenic funguses like that that

709
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,819
cause like you know

710
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:52,760
um fusarium root rot and things like

711
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:56,339
that can can our Ally mycelium clean up

712
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:59,099
pathogens like that in the soil

713
00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:01,139
yeah that's such a great question

714
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:03,599
um you know I told you I really like the

715
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:07,020
protagonist fungi so my my Plant

716
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,819
Pathology is it is up to speed but it

717
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:11,339
just made me think of

718
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:13,678
um you know there's there are products

719
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:16,319
out there that are

720
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,019
they're well those are more bacterial

721
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:21,778
that are kind of fighting the fungi I'm

722
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:24,599
trying to think of these this activate

723
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:26,278
you know that's a product that

724
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:29,158
um but it's bacterial and that's

725
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:31,200
fighting off the fungi I don't know I

726
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:34,380
think that's such a good question but I

727
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,298
do remember this one little project I

728
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:40,740
did when I was living in Hawaii with a

729
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:42,538
friend and he was really into im04s and

730
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,740
um you know his knowledge is so much

731
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:46,319
greater than mine so I'm not going to

732
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,899
try to explain anything like that but

733
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:52,379
we were traveling around to these coffee

734
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:55,759
plantations that had this pathogenic

735
00:31:52,380 --> 00:32:00,778
fungi that occurred on the coffee leaf

736
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:03,119
and we made a solution of the imo4 and

737
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:05,819
it's hard to say exactly which component

738
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:09,298
maybe was fighting but we we just

739
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:11,700
sprayed this on the coffee

740
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:14,220
um you know trees that had this fungal

741
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:17,700
infection and came back and scored it

742
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,919
and the ones that we scored there was a

743
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,220
significant impact and reduction of that

744
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:27,720
fungal infection now we know im04s don't

745
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,399
just contain fungi right so

746
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,460
um you know it was a fun little project

747
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:35,158
but still kind of hard to say and I'm

748
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,380
not really sure of the research on that

749
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:39,179
yeah that's that's fair enough and and I

750
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,059
think that that your answer points to

751
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:45,480
two things number one for folks who are

752
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:49,379
interested in in well cannabis but but

753
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,700
uh networks in general and are just kind

754
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,320
of coming up

755
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,140
um you know and and through University

756
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:58,678
there is a lot of research around

757
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:00,360
cannabis and soil science and fungus to

758
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,220
be had you know this is this is a great

759
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:04,619
time to become you know have an interest

760
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,839
in cannabis and become and be coming out

761
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:09,418
of school and then and then the second

762
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:11,099
thing that your answer points out is um

763
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,620
you know we're always talking about the

764
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:15,658
power of of

765
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:19,139
industrial indigenous microorganisms

766
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:21,000
here and Imo for you know while it has

767
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,100
got a significant representation of

768
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
fungus in it it's this magical

769
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:28,558
combination of nature that just just

770
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,679
rebalances things like in in your

771
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:34,918
example and uh and you know so many of

772
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,679
us uh container based cannabis Growers

773
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:40,019
um we struggle with fusarium so anytime

774
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,659
I talk to somebody who focuses their

775
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:44,278
work on on the root Zone I kind of ask

776
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:47,159
everybody hey do you have a good

777
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:48,659
solution for fusarium and and and you

778
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,159
know everybody kind of says the same

779
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:52,019
thing like like like you know the

780
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,940
research hasn't actually found a really

781
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:56,460
good one yet and generally you should

782
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,200
just replace your soil but but this is

783
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,120
the first time that im04 has been

784
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,798
brought up and and that makes a lot of

785
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:04,439
sense it would be interesting if if

786
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:07,019
somebody were to have you know say and

787
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,800
say like it like an installed

788
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:13,320
you know large-scale bed where it would

789
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,179
be a real pain in the butt to replace

790
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,039
the soil unlike you know like a 20

791
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:18,599
gallon pot or something which is really

792
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,639
easy

793
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,820
um you know doing uh doing a significant

794
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,460
application of im04 might be one might

795
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,019
be one fusarium solution so all right

796
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,240
well I don't want to get too distracted

797
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:32,039
off on the fusarium thing but but while

798
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,779
we while we're there um you know I

799
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:36,119
figured we might as well hit it so so

800
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,919
all right great so um so so now that we

801
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,559
are understanding what the mycelium

802
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,480
networks are doing and that they are are

803
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:46,739
breaking down nutrition and bringing it

804
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,240
back to the the rhizosphere where where

805
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:50,158
um I guess I'll say for the moment it

806
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,678
gets handed off to mycorrhizae that does

807
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,838
the exchange with the plant that we will

808
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,700
pick up on set two so let's go ahead and

809
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:58,039
take our first short break and then we

810
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:00,659
come back we will start talking about

811
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:02,820
mycorrhizae you are listening to shaping

812
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:05,159
fire and my guest today is Mycologist

813
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,380
Stephanie Garcia and you know without

814
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:09,358
these advertisers shaping firewood not

815
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,338
happen so please support them and let

816
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:11,889
them know you heard of them on shaping

817
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:15,000
fire

818
00:35:11,889 --> 00:35:17,338
[Music]

819
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,679
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

820
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:21,599
growing is so valued by Farmers is

821
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,639
because the mycelium networks in the

822
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,160
soil remain established from year to

823
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:27,900
year and we know these fungal networks

824
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,239
are essential because they are the

825
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,460
nutrient super highways that extend far

826
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:35,039
and wide in the substrate to feed your

827
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,440
plants the trouble with growing in New

828
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,659
Living soils or Blended cocoa substrates

829
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,059
is that it takes most of the plant's

830
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:44,480
life just to create these mycelium

831
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:46,500
highways

award-winning cannabis seeds that come

their high THC seeds are extraordinary

881
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,400
in that they will start to flower at 16

882
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:52,380

883
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,500
the typical 14 and a half hours of

884
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,480
daylight that means in most regions your

885
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,760
plants will start to flower outdoors in

886
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,338
the middle of July instead of the middle

887

my guest today is Mycologist Stephanie

00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,219
Garcia so

977
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:29,338
um during the first set we learned all

978
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:32,039
about mycelium and that it is also not

979
00:41:29,338 --> 00:41:34,380
saprophytic fungus and all of the

980
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:36,719
wonderful things that mycelium do

981
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:39,180
um first for itself then for the plant

982
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:42,179
but then also for everybody else who

983
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:43,858
hangs out in the in the root zone so now

984
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:47,598
we're going to talk specifically about

985
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:51,179
the symbiotic relationship between

986
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,940
mycelium networks and plants that are

987
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:57,419
expressed through uh through mycorrhizae

988
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:59,338
so so we touched on mycorrhizae a bit at

989
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,420
the at the beginning of the first set to

990
00:41:59,338 --> 00:42:06,559
separate endo mycorrhizae and

991
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:09,599
ectomycorrhizae based on how they

992
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:12,179
interact differently with with the with

993
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,960
the root Zone with roots themselves

994
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:16,199
um

995
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:20,519
let's start with how does

996
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:23,219
um mycorrhizae colonize the plant root

997
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:25,739
system of cannabis from from what I

998
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:29,519
understand you know there is a point

999
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:31,739
when a when a plant is I don't know new

1000
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:35,880
or young where

1001
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:38,519
um it is not it is not fully colonized

1002
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,660
by mycorrhizae

1003
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:44,460
um

1004
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:46,618
by by Fungus that is is is boy it's hard

1005
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:49,139
to talk about it once once mycorrhiza is

1006
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:51,240
not a noun once it's a description of a

1007
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:54,838
symbiotic relationship it's a lot it's a

1008
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:58,259
different way to talk about it so so

1009
00:42:54,838 --> 00:43:00,358
how does how do you talk about it

1010
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,220
Stephanie I didn't realize it like like

1011
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:04,500
how do you talk about it in the in in in

1012
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:05,879
as a professional who talks about this

1013
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,858
all day

1014
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,260
yeah I mean I guess you could you know

1015
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:12,838
instead of maybe just focusing on the

1016
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,060
mycorrhizae or my you know microsal

1017
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:18,539
fungi you can say the mycorrhizal hyphae

1018
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:21,420
or the fungal hyphy honestly so using

1019
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:25,199
the word mycorrhizae as a as a as a

1020
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:28,380
description of of of of of the type of

1021
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:30,239
fungus so so it'd be appropriate to say

1022
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,599
um you know Stephanie uh would you

1023
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,699
explain to us how mycorrhiza fungi

1024
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,900
colonize the plant root system of

1025
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:39,659
cannabis

1026
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,240
yeah yeah all right okay sure I'll take

1027
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:45,659
that all right we'll go with that thank

1028
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:49,439
you yeah so yeah sure so

1029
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:53,039
so when we think about the beginning of

1030
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,440
the symbiosis we first want to ask

1031
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:58,800
ourselves how is this High fee growing

1032
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,579
where is this coming from right

1033
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,200
um

1034
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:05,160
so

1035
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:08,818
now in nature hyphy is the greatest

1036
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:12,598
let's say propagule that we have and so

1037
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:13,318
when we say profile we're talking about

1038
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:15,720
um

1039
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:19,139
if we think about cannabis a propagal

1040
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:21,959
for cannabis is its seed right when we

1041
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:23,818
think about fungi there can be a few

1042
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,460
different types of propagules and

1043
00:44:23,818 --> 00:44:27,539
specifically our vascular mycorrhizal

1044
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:32,400
fungi

1045
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:34,619
so in nature hyphy or mycelium is the

1046
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,139
greatest propagule in nature

1047
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:38,880
so we can start with

1048
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:41,879
um we can start with fragments of

1049
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,740
mycelium we can start with spores that's

1050
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,240
another thing that would be considered a

1051
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:47,639
propagule right we're trying to

1052
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:51,838
propagate this

1053
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:54,358
um life form and however it propagates

1054
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:57,059
it should be able to then become an

1055
00:44:54,358 --> 00:45:00,179
adult or you know go past this

1056
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:03,659
vegetative stage so we've got um we've

1057
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:05,940
covered the mycelium the Spore and then

1058
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:09,299
our vascular mycorrhizal fungi are

1059
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:12,420
interesting in that pieces of Roux or we

1060
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:16,200
can call Root fragments that previously

1061
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:19,318
contained or were colonized by the

1062
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:22,559
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can also

1063
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:24,960
act as a propagule so some of these

1064
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,599
structures that are inside the root like

1065
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,720
hyphy

1066
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:34,260
they are produced within the root those

1067
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:35,779
can also act as propagules so if you

1068
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:40,099
were

1069
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:44,280
incorporating some mycorrhizal inoculum

1070
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:47,338
into your growth system you're going to

1071
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,500
have some of these propagules you put

1072
00:45:47,338 --> 00:45:52,440
right and you're probably going off this

1073
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:55,559
label recommendation

1074
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:58,740
uh to my understanding there aren't any

1075
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:00,259
products currently in the US that

1076
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:04,019
claim

1077
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:07,500
mycelium as a propuol and I think that

1078
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:10,858
has something to do more with shelf life

1079
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:13,619
um possibly with how you quantify it you

1080
00:46:10,858 --> 00:46:15,420
know how it can be regulated things like

1081
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:17,460
that so

1082
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,500
um primarily if you were to like let's

1083
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:21,539
say get some mycorrhizal inoculum and

1084
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,480
look at it under the microscope you're

1085
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:26,759
going to see spores and you'll probably

1086
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,460
see pieces of root

1087
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:33,540
so you're going to start with that right

1088
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:34,338
and then from that the mycelium will

1089
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:37,139
grow

1090
00:46:34,338 --> 00:46:38,880
that's going to be growing you know

1091
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:42,139
within your soil

1092
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:46,680
there's a lot of research about you know

1093
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:48,838
the signaling that goes on for these

1094
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:51,960
fungi and how do they actually connect

1095
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:53,818
with the plant root right

1096
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,800
um that's really fascinating stuff

1097
00:46:53,818 --> 00:47:00,480
because way back when it was really

1098
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,280
understood or thought you know believed

1099
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,358
that

1100
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:08,940
um the plant regulated the symbiosis so

1101
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:11,338
we know that Plants release through

1102
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,780
exudates

1103
00:47:11,338 --> 00:47:15,559
um we know that there's a lot of other

1104
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:19,140
types of biochemical signaling going on

1105
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:22,739
but now some of the people researching

1106
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:24,960
the signaling are realizing that it's a

1107
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:28,318
it's a lot more complex than we thought

1108
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,599
initially and that potentially the fungi

1109
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:34,139
has a little bit more say in how it

1110
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:37,500
connects I used to think of it like

1111
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:38,879
you know the plant is there the fungus

1112
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:43,079
approaches like it's trying to get into

1113
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,880
a party and the plant's like okay you

1114
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:47,519
know you can bring in nutrients you

1115
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,500
could bring in beverages for me or you

1116
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:52,199
know whatever I was taught too yeah

1117
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,539
right like come on in

1118
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:57,000
um and why would the plant not want to

1119
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:59,460
accept that it's almost like an

1120
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,280
insurance policy for the plant that is

1121
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:04,800
going to be getting enough nutrients and

1122
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:07,980
um you know water and things like this

1123
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,619
but now there's some you know research

1124
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:13,019
going on to say that there's um it's a

1125
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:16,680
lot more complex communication between

1126
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:20,940
the fungi and the plant but we do know

1127
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:22,078
that root exudates are released I think

1128
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,019
we're still really trying to understand

1129
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:27,180
root exudates I know currently there's

1130
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:29,579
about a hundred thousand compounds that

1131
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:30,299
have been identified

1132
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:32,099
um

1133
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:35,099
you know that roots are putting out

1134
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:38,818
there but we know that they play a role

1135
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:39,599
in the germination of spores

1136
00:48:38,818 --> 00:48:42,358
um

1137
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,519
and then for that ultimate connection

1138
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:48,779
right

1139
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:51,420
so yeah once the once the mycelium

1140
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:54,720
approaches the root there's a very

1141
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:56,400
complex conversation that occurs and

1142
00:48:54,719 --> 00:49:00,419
then ultimately they're able to

1143
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:03,300
penetrate into into the root system

1144
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:05,880
and then they continue to grow and it's

1145
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:08,579
actually a physical penetration it is

1146
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,800
that's not just like symbolic it

1147
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:15,960
actually you know because of the size

1148
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:19,560
relationship uh the mycelium strands can

1149
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:24,240
actually enter the root itself not just

1150
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:26,400
the root Zone yep that is correct and it

1151
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,500
was even just today we were looking for

1152
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,079
these uh special structures that they

1153
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:34,920
make when they penetrate it's a

1154
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:39,000
hypopodium and it's a just small piece

1155
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:42,539
of tissue and it anchors the mycelium to

1156
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:46,739
the roots itself but yep it completely

1157
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:50,818
penetrates that and just continues to

1158
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:53,159
to explore you know this idea of of uh

1159
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:55,440
these these endomycorrhizae spending

1160
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:58,139
some part of their life

1161
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,420
um inside the plant root

1162
00:49:58,139 --> 00:50:02,400
um totally reminds me of the of the

1163
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:04,500
bacterial rhizophagey cycle that we

1164
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,160
discussed in detail with uh Jeff

1165
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:12,480
lowenfels back on shapingfire 96.

1166
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:14,759
um you know our our are these two I

1167
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,920
don't know areas of science related in

1168
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,660
science at all or is it just in my head

1169
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,338
because they're just two different

1170
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:21,480
things that enter the plant for a part

1171
00:50:20,338 --> 00:50:24,480
of their life

1172
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:27,179
yeah I think everything's connected and

1173
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,920
you know in ways like that and I know

1174
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:31,318
that there's a lot of research on now

1175
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,000
with their uh I don't know if this is

1176
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:36,480
really a term that's been coined but

1177
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,219
mycorrhizae helper bacteria

1178
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,880
um so I think things are definitely

1179
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:43,259
working synergistically and

1180
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,900
um so yeah I think that that's a fair

1181
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:49,260
comparison right on so let's talk about

1182
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:52,260
one of the one of the the the roles that

1183
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:54,480
the mycorrhizae play uh in this in this

1184
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,760
relationship with the plant

1185
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,980
um uh the first one that I ever learned

1186
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,900
about and I I'm certainly not suggesting

1187
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,900
I I know a lot about it is is the the

1188
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:06,119
sugar water for the sugar and water for

1189
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:08,639
minerals exchange

1190
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:12,059
um and would you walk us through that

1191
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:15,480
that like Cornerstone process yeah sure

1192
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:16,920
so that that really is at the heart of

1193
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,099
this exchange at the heart of this

1194
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:23,039
symbiosis so we talked a little bit in

1195
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:26,539
the earlier segment about

1196
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:30,179
um how mycorrhizal fungi

1197
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:32,699
they are reliant on the plant host for

1198
00:51:30,179 --> 00:51:34,919
their carbon and that's all coming

1199
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:37,019
through photosynthates through that

1200
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,358
photosynthetic process

1201
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:42,059
and um so that's really what the fungus

1202
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,980
wants from the plant uh we know that

1203
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:47,760
some fungi can exist some of the

1204
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:51,059
mycorrhizal fungi can exist

1205
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:54,420
um without the plant host but primarily

1206
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:57,480
most of these species are dependent on

1207
00:51:54,420 --> 00:52:00,420
their carbon acquisition through photos

1208
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,420
and photosynthes

1209
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:06,780
um so that's really what they're after

1210
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:10,920
and the plant is willing to engage in

1211
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:13,619
this relationship because they know and

1212
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:16,920
you know they somehow know that the

1213
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:19,800
fungi is able to deliver different and

1214
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:21,800
it's not just the you know more minerals

1215
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,839
or micronutrients but even

1216
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:26,818
macronutrients right so

1217
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:28,558
um they they know that the if they allow

1218
00:52:26,818 --> 00:52:32,460
this relationship to occur that they're

1219
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:34,500
also going to benefit in this other way

1220
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:38,838
um that maybe they wouldn't be able to

1221
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:42,480
to do as well on their own

1222
00:52:38,838 --> 00:52:45,000
I guess when somebody shows up with all

1223
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,760
of these you know quality inputs you

1224
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,318
you're all you get used to it right

1225
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:52,460
right and why would you not why would

1226
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:55,880
you say no it's like yeah let's go

1227
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:59,159
so um Can does does

1228
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:03,000
mycorrhizae have the ability to live in

1229
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:06,838
the soil without a root or something of

1230
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,599
some a root or other uh in order to do

1231
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:11,460
this uh symbiotic exchange like you know

1232
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,559
it might not be cannabis but perhaps

1233
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:17,579
it's you know you know a dandelion or

1234
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,859
something else but can the mycorrhizal

1235
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:22,859
fungus

1236
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:24,858
survive without a root

1237
00:53:22,858 --> 00:53:24,858
um

1238
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:31,619
things that are obligate

1239
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,679
mycorrhizal fungi so they have to have a

1240
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:36,300
plant host to carry out their life cycle

1241
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:39,299
now

1242
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:42,180
if they didn't have access to a plant

1243
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:44,880
can they go dormant certainly I see

1244
00:53:42,179 --> 00:53:47,338
that's what um how long would that last

1245
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,519
I'm not sure

1246
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:53,219
um but yeah we know that there are many

1247
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:55,579
fungi many micrizal fungi that they just

1248
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:58,078
simply cannot carry out their life cycle

1249
00:53:55,579 --> 00:54:01,640
without their plant host so they're

1250
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:04,019
gonna need that root system yeah

1251
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:06,420
while preparing and doing my background

1252
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:08,759
research for the episode it was really

1253
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:10,680
interesting to read

1254
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,300
um all the different I'll just throw

1255
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:16,858
them I guess in a big basket of

1256
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:20,339
processes that mycorrhizal fungi

1257
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:23,039
um are able to do like you know you know

1258
00:54:20,338 --> 00:54:25,139
that Cornerstone sugar waters for

1259
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:29,099
mineral exchange I'm kind of like

1260
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:32,159
picturing this this mycorrhizae in the

1261
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:34,260
middle like you know kind of acting like

1262
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,578
like a bartering agent you know going

1263
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,140
hey you got those there you got those

1264
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:39,059
here I'll give those here okay all right

1265
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:41,519
go you know gotta like kind of like you

1266
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:43,800
know directing traffic almost right

1267
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:46,318
right but then but then as you continue

1268
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:49,380
to read it's like oh also mycorrhizae

1269
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:51,300
can and can do this chemical uh

1270
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:53,640
transition and then also if it finds

1271
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:57,420
this it can do this and like the more I

1272
00:54:53,639 --> 00:55:03,199
read I'm all like it the mycorrhiza has

1273
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:03,200
got this whole toolbox of of of

1274
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:10,139
biological transitions And Trades I

1275
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:13,920
guess that it can do to make sure that

1276
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:16,739
the signals and the nutrition and and

1277
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,960
the water and everything is all being

1278
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:21,118
transferred back and forth and I got to

1279
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,740
tell you that that it kind of makes them

1280
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,660
pretty badass because they're

1281
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:26,098
essentially making their own tools right

1282
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:29,159
there's all these different things that

1283
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:32,579
they can do would you explain some of

1284
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:36,058
the ways that mycorrhizae defends the

1285
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:38,519
cannabis plant itself from like disease

1286
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:41,040
and pathogens and and other things that

1287
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:43,980
might do the plant harm

1288
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:45,599
yeah yeah it really is fascinating when

1289
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,159
you when you think about them and it's

1290
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,680
one reason I just think the kingdom

1291
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:52,199
fungi is so incredible and why we do

1292
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,899
need more people to step into the field

1293
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:56,699
right and how would also like when you

1294
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,400
start reading it it really does start to

1295
00:55:56,699 --> 00:56:01,139
read like it's intelligent you know like

1296
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,760
it really like like it's really amazing

1297
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:04,980
especially when you like see like a tick

1298
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,559
tock or something that shows fungus like

1299
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:10,318
beating puzzles and stuff and it's like

1300
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:12,359
damn you know so anyway uh plea please

1301
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:14,699
how how does the mycorrhizae actually

1302
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:16,920
defend the cannabis plants from diseases

1303
00:56:14,699 --> 00:56:20,399
and pathogens by using these various

1304
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:22,380
methods it has yeah yeah there's a few

1305
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,800
things that come to mind right away I

1306
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:28,980
mean I would say the overall if you have

1307
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:32,818
a plant that's receiving you know more

1308
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:35,760
water more nutrients than the plants

1309
00:56:32,818 --> 00:56:37,920
able to acquire on its own the plant

1310
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,380
Health overall is just going to be

1311
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,119
better right so

1312
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,140
you're just going to have a more robust

1313
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:45,059
plant

1314
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:47,879
um a plant that's maybe more resistant

1315
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:50,220
to an infection

1316
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,318
um things like that so that's one thing

1317
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:54,659
that just comes to mind right away is

1318
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:57,000
that if your plant overall is more

1319
00:56:54,659 --> 00:56:58,799
healthy then it's going to be able to

1320
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,380
fight off different things that might

1321
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:04,318
come its way

1322
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:08,519
um one thing that is pretty well

1323
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:13,739
researched is tolerance to not only

1324
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:17,880
things like saline soils but also heavy

1325
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:21,598
metals so if for some reason

1326
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:24,740
um that is happening for you

1327
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:28,740
um the fun the fungi they can actually

1328
00:57:24,739 --> 00:57:31,199
mitigate how that is delivered to the

1329
00:57:28,739 --> 00:57:32,699
plant and essentially hold it within its

1330
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:36,598
mycelium

1331
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:40,558
so so it like Pockets it away so that

1332
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:42,680
away from the mechanics of the plant so

1333
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:45,839
so that the plant is shielded from it

1334
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:48,719
yeah I think and it's interesting I mean

1335
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:50,039
outside of cannabis growing or

1336
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:52,919
um you know things like that there's a

1337
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:56,940
lot of saline soils and you know in our

1338
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:58,740
world so that's pretty fascinating we've

1339
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:00,780
done some experiments where we we're

1340
00:57:58,739 --> 00:58:03,899
just straight feeding in Plants salt

1341
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:07,619
water and the you know mycorrhizal

1342
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:11,338
colonized plants are just they just look

1343
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:13,500
so good and so we haven't done too much

1344
00:58:11,338 --> 00:58:15,058
on the heavy metals but there's there's

1345
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,400
quite a bit of research on heavy metal

1346
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:19,619
uptake and mitigation of those heavy

1347
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,318
metals

1348
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:24,780
um so I think that that's really an

1349
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:27,539
interesting aspect and things that they

1350
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:30,019
can do for your plants

1351
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:32,759
I know that there's other research on

1352
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:34,019
prevention of infection

1353
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,720
um

1354
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:39,179
and I I don't know if that's just due to

1355
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:41,098
an increase in overall plant health or

1356
00:58:39,179 --> 00:58:44,338
if there's some other mechanism behind

1357
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:46,980
that that we don't fully understand yet

1358
00:58:44,338 --> 00:58:47,818
right on so

1359
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,920
um

1360
00:58:47,818 --> 00:58:51,779
looking at the next question I have for

1361
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,599
you I have a feeling that this is going

1362
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:57,298
to be one that you say ah Shango that's

1363
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:58,859
for safrophytic fungus but I'm going to

1364
00:58:57,298 --> 00:59:00,539
go ahead and ask you anyway because I'm

1365
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:03,119
super curious of the answer even if it

1366
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:04,619
is saprophytic so so so I was going to

1367
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,838
ask you that you know cannabis

1368
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:10,079
cultivators love ground cover and

1369
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:12,838
companion plants for lots of reasons one

1370
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,880
being that you know the plants can all

1371
00:59:12,838 --> 00:59:18,480
talk to each other and trade nutrients

1372
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,740
and you know create pest defense and

1373
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,460
then I was going to say would you

1374
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:25,618
explain how mycelium you know processes

1375
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:29,818
the signaling system but that's probably

1376
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:31,380
not mycelium in retrospect is it

1377
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:33,420
um I guess I'm having a hard time

1378
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:35,519
understanding on the signaling system

1379
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:37,920
between the plants yeah I'll give you an

1380
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:39,298
example like like we hear about when

1381
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,119
groups of plants even if they're

1382
00:59:39,298 --> 00:59:45,659
different varieties are planted together

1383
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:48,838
um uh uh you know that an aphids will

1384
00:59:45,659 --> 00:59:50,879
Attack One uh the plants will signal to

1385
00:59:48,838 --> 00:59:53,338
the other local plants that it's getting

1386
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,858
chomped on by aphids so the individual

1387
00:59:53,338 --> 01:00:00,659
plants can use whatever its strategy is

1388
00:59:55,858 --> 01:00:02,880
to not get aphids oh sure sure

1389
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:04,558
um yeah I don't really know about that I

1390
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,858
wouldn't necessarily give all this

1391
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:09,180
saprophytic fungi credit for that but it

1392
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:11,159
definitely tells me that like you know

1393
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:12,779
since you study mycorrhizae and you

1394
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:14,639
don't know this particular thing that

1395
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,859
that I definitely have put this activity

1396
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:20,279
in the wrong bucket well I know that

1397
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:23,098
there some signaling of

1398
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,619
and from tree to tree that are colonized

1399
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:28,798
you know by fungi into you know increase

1400
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:31,260
defenses or transfer nutrients over here

1401
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:33,000
because now this plant is infected so I

1402
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:34,380
know that there's Communication in that

1403
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,599
way

1404
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:38,519
um so I wouldn't put it past that I just

1405
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:40,140
don't know if I could speak to that yeah

1406
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:41,818
fair enough fair enough

1407
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:44,098
um so

1408
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:46,679
um let's see here

1409
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:50,838
so the more we talk today the more I get

1410
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:53,818
this sense that mycelium is more about

1411
01:00:50,838 --> 01:00:56,759
transport and and Breaking Down

1412
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:59,579
Nutrition and and moving it on a highway

1413
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:02,460
towards the root Zone

1414
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:05,760
um but when the Trish but but when the

1415
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:08,039
nutrition gets to the root Zone the the

1416
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,160
mycorrhiza

1417
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,159
um

1418
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:18,599
symbiosis with the plant kind of takes

1419
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:21,559
over and and does the actual barter

1420
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:24,599
transmutation or process of of

1421
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:27,839
bringing that nutrition into the plant

1422
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:28,798
through this mutualistic relationship

1423
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:32,639
um

1424
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:34,798
and then the plant is then you know

1425
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:38,578
sending the nutrients that it's sharing

1426
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:40,318
back down to the mycorrhizae to the

1427
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:42,559
mycorrhizae

1428
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:46,199
activity

1429
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:48,900
mycelium and then that goes back down

1430
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:51,480
the line what I would like to know is

1431
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:54,838
there is there anything physiologically

1432
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:58,380
different at that connection point

1433
01:01:54,838 --> 01:02:01,679
between the mycelium

1434
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:05,640
and the plant root

1435
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:08,879
um where where we would say oh that is

1436
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:11,699
mycorro that's mycorrhizal fungus you

1437
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,280
can tell by looking at it versus does it

1438
01:02:11,699 --> 01:02:18,298
just look like regular mycelium that's

1439
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:20,760
just doing a different activity

1440
01:02:18,298 --> 01:02:22,380
so when you're looking at the mycelium

1441
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,839
itself yeah

1442
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:28,280
yeah you know I don't think I could

1443
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:28,279
really tell a difference

1444
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,680
um that's really that's really

1445
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,240
interesting because the way that all of

1446
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,219
us I mean and we can't as people we talk

1447
01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:37,500
about a lot of stuff wrong right

1448
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:40,078
um but but it we always talk we talk

1449
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:42,900
about you know mycorrhizal fungi as if

1450
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:44,460
it is like like you know an an

1451
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:46,858
absolutely different type of type of

1452
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:50,099
fungus and and the more we talk the more

1453
01:02:46,858 --> 01:02:53,699
that I realize that that kind of as a as

1454
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:56,599
a as an industry we talk about it wrong

1455
01:02:53,699 --> 01:02:58,858
um now I will say with um like

1456
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:01,380
ectomycorrhizal fungi we talked a little

1457
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:04,199
bit about this mantle of mycelium that

1458
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:07,798
covers the root system you can certainly

1459
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:11,279
find Roots like that and you can know

1460
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:13,920
for sure like this is mycelium that is

1461
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:17,180
from this is an ectomycorrhizal fungi

1462
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:20,280
right it's very obvious where the

1463
01:03:17,179 --> 01:03:22,259
endomycorrhizal fungi or AMF that's a

1464
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,540
little bit more tricky because they

1465
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:28,319
don't make this like mantle it's like

1466
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:30,358
this matte of mycelium over the root

1467
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:32,699
system

1468
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:34,980
um so there is that you know I just like

1469
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:38,159
kind of had that thought in there but

1470
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:40,619
yeah I mean if you saw this mat of

1471
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:43,259
mycelium next to your plant and next to

1472
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:46,500
the plant roots and that would be hard

1473
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:48,240
for me to know unless I went I collected

1474
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,838
some roots and then I went through the

1475
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:54,298
process of clearing the pigmentation

1476
01:03:50,838 --> 01:03:56,940
staining it right and then visualizing

1477
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:59,579
it under the scope

1478
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:01,380
right on well oh go ahead I didn't I

1479
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:03,119
thought you were done go ahead no pretty

1480
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:06,780
much there was just you know to make

1481
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:09,180
sure that this is this was this was the

1482
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:11,460
mycorrhizal fungi that was

1483
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:13,798
responsible for all that other mycelium

1484
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:15,480
I saw but to distinguish it yeah I think

1485
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:18,539
would be kind of challenging right on

1486
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:21,240
thank you all right so um so to to to

1487
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:24,179
end this second set

1488
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:27,000
um I just want to ask you one uh Ecto

1489
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:28,919
mycorrhizae question because when I read

1490
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,420
this preparing for the show it caught me

1491
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,639
way off guard and I would like to learn

1492
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:35,159
more about this if you know about it I

1493
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:36,739
read that ectomycorrhiza have been known

1494
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:40,558
to lure

1495
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:43,338
springtails to obtain nitrogen from them

1496
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:46,019
how the heck does that happen

1497
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:48,659
I don't know I don't know anything about

1498
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:51,000
that but certainly going to look into

1499
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:53,159
that after this have you ever heard

1500
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,838
outside of this particular example have

1501
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:57,659
you ever

1502
01:04:54,838 --> 01:05:01,139
um uh you know come across examples of

1503
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:04,019
of mycorrhizae you know acting like they

1504
01:05:01,139 --> 01:05:06,000
are are are trapping anything like that

1505
01:05:04,019 --> 01:05:08,159
I mean when we learned how like you know

1506
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,099
you know aphids farm and things like or

1507
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:13,078
no no it's the the ants Farm the aphid

1508
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:15,059
larva but like that's that's some really

1509
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:18,660
interesting stuff to happen at that that

1510
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:20,400
level of biology right and so so have

1511
01:05:18,659 --> 01:05:22,019
you heard you know of any other examples

1512
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,358
of mycorrhizae doing that sort of thing

1513
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:27,838
you know it makes me think of like

1514
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:30,358
cordyceps and how that can drive

1515
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:32,519
um certain insects like it can take over

1516
01:05:30,358 --> 01:05:34,679
the neurological system drive them to

1517
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:38,400
the top of the canopy

1518
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:41,338
um eventually consume them completely uh

1519
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:44,160
I haven't ever heard that with the ectos

1520
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:45,659
uh but I do know that ectos have a lot

1521
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:48,000
more claims

1522
01:05:45,659 --> 01:05:50,399
um to prevent like let's say insect or

1523
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,338
bivory I don't know if that's just

1524
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,619
because that mantle is you know covering

1525
01:05:53,338 --> 01:06:00,358
the root system so it's like this

1526
01:05:55,619 --> 01:06:02,700
physical Shield of defense for the plant

1527
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:04,558
um but just knowing that there are other

1528
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:06,838
mechanisms

1529
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,819
like the cordyceps

1530
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:10,440
you know I'm kind of a romantic when it

1531
01:06:08,818 --> 01:06:13,980
comes to fungi though I'm like they can

1532
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:16,500
do anything right so I'm definitely

1533
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:18,960
curious about about what you read there

1534
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,699
and now I want to look into that but

1535
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:23,460
it's not something I'm really aware of

1536
01:06:20,699 --> 01:06:24,538
right on well I got I got it uh just

1537
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:26,760
from an article I found through

1538
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:29,160
Wikipedia so it's there if you want it

1539
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:31,559
you know it is really interesting too to

1540
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:33,358
uh to look at all the different tools

1541
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:35,579
that the mycorrhizae has you know it's

1542
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:37,380
got It's got different processes it's

1543
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:38,700
got It's got barters that it can be in

1544
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,079
the middle of to get what it needs to

1545
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:41,578
get done

1546
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,599
um you know it's got It's got you know

1547
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:47,640
like like the the soil version of like

1548
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:49,619
you know chemical signals and and what

1549
01:06:47,639 --> 01:06:51,420
you know and smells I think of terpenes

1550
01:06:49,619 --> 01:06:53,579
they may or may not be root terpenes but

1551
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:55,318
but the idea of like all these all these

1552
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:58,079
different tools it's got I I imagine

1553
01:06:55,318 --> 01:07:00,538
like oh yeah the Ecto mycorrhizae is you

1554
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:02,519
know excreting some chemical that that

1555
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:05,160
springtails love and then when it gets

1556
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:07,259
close enough I imagine like how the hell

1557
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:09,358
does a how how does fungus move move

1558
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:10,920
fast enough to catch a springtail you

1559
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:12,960
know but again you already said you

1560
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,000
don't know so it's it's hard to not

1561
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,818
Wonder though you know well it it kind

1562
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,639
of just reminds me of

1563
01:07:17,818 --> 01:07:22,940
um enzymes that are released right there

1564
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:26,519
they are these types of like digestive

1565
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:28,579
enzymes you can think of them like that

1566
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:31,579
um to break down

1567
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:34,740
the you know non-biologically available

1568
01:07:31,579 --> 01:07:38,640
nutrients so but yeah when you think

1569
01:07:34,739 --> 01:07:40,019
about how slow the fungi move which is

1570
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,179
you know one reason I like them they

1571
01:07:40,019 --> 01:07:44,099
just like stay put right but

1572
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:46,500
um but yeah that's that's a good

1573
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:48,960
question and yeah we'll have to we'll

1574
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:53,219
we'll have to try to get somebody that's

1575
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:55,139
listening and enlist in a PhD project on

1576
01:07:53,219 --> 01:07:56,879
this right on excellent all right so

1577
01:07:55,139 --> 01:07:59,219
let's go ahead and take our second uh

1578
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,079
commercial break we'll be right back you

1579
01:07:59,219 --> 01:08:03,058
are listening to shaping fire and my

1580
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:04,140
guest today is Mycologist Stephanie

[Music]

1583
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,559
there are so many seed banks nowadays

1584
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,900
that you really have options and who to

1585
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,940
choose not only that if you pick the

1586
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:17,338
wrong seed bank you could be in for a

1587
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:19,920
really sketchy ride and that's only one

1588
01:08:17,338 --> 01:08:21,838
of the reasons I recommend Gas Lamp

01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:29,159
already know Gas Lamp seeds as hemora

1592
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,259
genetics hemra recently changed their

1593
01:08:29,159 --> 01:08:33,899
name to Gaslamp seeds

1594
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:36,420

seed banks who will take your money but

1612
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:19,380
have no customer service I invited

1613
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,420
Gaslamp to advertise on shaping fire

1614
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:24,000

the cannabis seed Market is filled with

1640
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:23,339
big name and hype breeders fighting to

1641
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,779
get your attention and occasionally you

1642
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:26,340
discover a breeder who is breeding

1643
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:28,380
because it is the only thing they care

1644

to do and they would be doing it even if

1645
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:32,460
they never made a dime

1646
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:34,920
that's my friend Craig hartsaw who makes

1647
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:36,840
seeds as magnetic genetics

1648
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,460
Craig comes from five generations of

1649
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,500
farmers and is earning his master's

1650
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,600
degree in Horticulture right now he's

1651
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:44,219
been growing cannabis for 15 years and

1652
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,260
been breeding for nine

1653
01:10:44,219 --> 01:10:48,119
he hasn't sold many seats because he

1654
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:49,619
really isn't a sales guy but I've

1655
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:51,658
personally been growing his seeds for

1656
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:54,119
years and I know I can always rely on

1657
01:10:51,658 --> 01:10:56,698
his seeds to germinate Thrive and smell

1658
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:58,679
and taste great I suggested to Craig

1659
01:10:56,698 --> 01:11:01,019
that he should probably sell some seeds

1660
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:03,719
and asked if he had enough stockpile to

1661
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:06,420
bother much to my shock he was sitting

1662
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:08,158
on five full menus in Cold Storage that

1663
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:10,380
he produced in the last two years and

1664
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:13,799
hadn't even tried to sell any of them he

1665
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:15,480
was simply too busy breeding well we his

1666
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,460
friends convinced him to make his damn

1667
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:18,419
seeds available to the people and now

1668
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,399

1669
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:22,859

host shangelos and my guest today is

1752
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:27,779
Mycologist Stephanie Garcia so here we

1753
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:30,779
are in the third set during the first

1754
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:33,059
set we we talked about mycelium networks

1755
01:14:30,779 --> 01:14:35,300
and and the roles they do and don't play

1756
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:38,039
in the soil and then we talked about

1757
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:41,159
mycorrhizae symbiosis between the

1758
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:45,060
mycelium and the plant and all the

1759
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:47,579
Myriad tools that mycorrhizae

1760
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:49,739
um have got in the toolbox to be able to

1761
01:14:47,579 --> 01:14:51,899
to do all the various processes that

1762
01:14:49,738 --> 01:14:53,158
they're responsible for well here in set

1763
01:14:51,899 --> 01:14:56,279
three we're going to talk about

1764
01:14:53,158 --> 01:14:59,339
supporting mycelium and the mycorrhizae

1765
01:14:56,279 --> 01:15:01,559
symbiosis in your garden so we're going

1766
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:03,980
to talk about some best practices and

1767
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:06,960
some maybe some less than best practices

1768
01:15:03,979 --> 01:15:09,238
so so Stephanie you know to today we've

1769
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:11,460
been mostly talking about living soil

1770
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:13,559
because that's mostly what shaping fire

1771
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:15,119
you know talks about as a show but lots

1772
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:18,600
of cannabis Growers

1773
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:21,779
use soilless mediums like like Coco coir

1774
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:24,840
and peat or rockwool do mycelium

1775
01:15:21,779 --> 01:15:26,519
networks grow in these other non-living

1776
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:30,440
soil mediums

1777
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:30,440
yeah yeah they certainly can

1778
01:15:30,539 --> 01:15:36,719
um is it the it

1779
01:15:33,539 --> 01:15:39,539
so right so you say they can so so do

1780
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:43,140
they because you don't have as complex

1781
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:45,539
of a biological environment in some of

1782
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:48,360
these soilless mediums as you would have

1783
01:15:45,539 --> 01:15:50,039
in living soil

1784
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:52,500
um do they present themselves

1785
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:55,079
differently or are there only particular

1786
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:56,520
strains of mycelium that can take to

1787
01:15:55,079 --> 01:15:58,679
that environment

1788
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:00,840
um maybe I'm wrong but it just seems to

1789
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:03,600
me that like with with

1790
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:06,179
um so much less of the biology that

1791
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,579
happens in living soil that's not in

1792
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:13,020
Cocoa peat and rockwool that there would

1793
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:14,880
be some kind of differences between how

1794
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:17,460
um mycelium and mycorrhizae present

1795
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,980
themselves but but perhaps it's not

1796
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:22,920
yeah you know I think one thing we've

1797
01:16:19,979 --> 01:16:24,479
done we've done a few hydroponic studies

1798
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:26,219
um not with cannabis but I know that

1799
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:28,859
there have also been some hydroponic

1800
01:16:26,219 --> 01:16:31,679
studies in cannabis with um with

1801
01:16:28,859 --> 01:16:35,099
mycorrhizal fungi and

1802
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:37,739
um I know that they're they're able to

1803
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:39,719
establish in that type of system and

1804
01:16:37,738 --> 01:16:42,178
maybe

1805
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:45,239
um you know maybe they're not as reliant

1806
01:16:42,179 --> 01:16:47,600
on the nutrients because they're really

1807
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:50,099
communicating with the plant root system

1808
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:52,579
I know in these studies that I've read

1809
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:56,039
about with cannabis that

1810
01:16:52,579 --> 01:16:59,460
they um they've shown to increase plant

1811
01:16:56,039 --> 01:17:01,619
Vigor and so

1812
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:03,779
um yeah I would think that they would

1813
01:17:01,619 --> 01:17:06,479
act somewhat different but as far as the

1814
01:17:03,779 --> 01:17:08,939
benefit to the plant these studies

1815
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:11,000
suggested that they were you know they

1816
01:17:08,939 --> 01:17:14,819
were still able to perform

1817
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,500
so I want to ask about uh water and

1818
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:18,359
mycelium networks again but not like

1819
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:21,060
what we talked about a water earlier

1820
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:23,039
about about how mycelium helps create

1821
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:25,080
good soil structure which allows the

1822
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:27,420
water to get through it and and how by

1823
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:28,738
it retaining water it helps the plant

1824
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:31,020
you know

1825
01:17:28,738 --> 01:17:32,698
um you know not not dry out in drought

1826
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:35,820
conditions it does all these really good

1827
01:17:32,698 --> 01:17:39,779
water retention aspects I want to talk

1828
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:43,439
more about uh we as cultivators watering

1829
01:17:39,779 --> 01:17:45,479
the plant I can imagine that

1830
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:48,299
um you know like anything even water

1831
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:50,339
that is helpful can become dangerous if

1832
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:53,279
it's given too much of it and I imagine

1833
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:56,400
that if we you know over water it'll

1834
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:58,738
cause the mycelium networks to rot and

1835
01:17:56,399 --> 01:18:00,420
then if we under water

1836
01:17:58,738 --> 01:18:02,339
um you know maybe they'll they'll you

1837
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:04,679
know dry out and cyst up so now they're

1838
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:06,300
not working either and so as cultivators

1839
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:08,520
we kind of want to get this Sweet Spot

1840
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:10,860
somewhere in the middle where we're

1841
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:12,719
providing enough water for everything to

1842
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:15,839
thrive but not enough to throw the

1843
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:18,899
mycelium Network out of balance so do

1844
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:21,900
you have any advice around that for us

1845
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:25,198
yeah sure so I think one thing to

1846
01:18:21,899 --> 01:18:28,079
consider is the the mycorrhizal fungi

1847
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:30,539
they're they're actually really good at

1848
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:33,300
um helping the plants resist drought

1849
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:36,600
right so there's a lot of mechanisms

1850
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:39,960
they have where the mycorese helps store

1851
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:41,640
the water they can also explore for it

1852
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:45,539
so

1853
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:48,060
it's not I think as big of an issue for

1854
01:18:45,539 --> 01:18:49,800
them to be a little bit underwatered

1855
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:52,500
right

1856
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:54,360
um they seem to perform the plants seem

1857
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:57,719
to perform really well with a reduction

1858
01:18:54,359 --> 01:18:58,979
in water I know there's been a lot of

1859
01:18:57,719 --> 01:19:02,640
research and we've done a little

1860
01:18:58,979 --> 01:19:04,979
research with the group I'm with

1861
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:07,199
um on watering them out and some people

1862
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:09,059
would suggest you don't have to water as

1863
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:13,079
much if you you know have this

1864
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:15,239
mycorrhizal Association going

1865
01:19:13,079 --> 01:19:17,760
um not really sure how people would feel

1866
01:19:15,238 --> 01:19:21,419
about that reducing their watering and

1867
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:25,260
everything like that but um I think that

1868
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:27,779
if they have these root system systems

1869
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:30,780
established then

1870
01:19:27,779 --> 01:19:32,639
um they're just really well equipped to

1871
01:19:30,779 --> 01:19:34,738
face that

1872
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,900
um you know the stresses of drought and

1873
01:19:34,738 --> 01:19:39,299
they can bounce back even if water

1874
01:19:36,899 --> 01:19:42,779
becomes less and less available I think

1875
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:46,260
that's a really good example of of why

1876
01:19:42,779 --> 01:19:49,619
um mature uh soil environments like

1877
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:52,079
whether it's a in a pot or a bed or like

1878
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:56,039
a raised bed or something that that

1879
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:59,399
mature soils with with lots of uh fungal

1880
01:19:56,039 --> 01:20:01,679
networks that are mature are just really

1881
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:03,479
going to give you a lot more of a buffer

1882
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:05,640
as a cultivator

1883
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:10,678
um because

1884
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:13,739
um it it's more flexible than a pot that

1885
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:16,219
we that we we just mixed some soil and

1886
01:20:13,738 --> 01:20:20,459
threw it in and put our clone in there

1887
01:20:16,219 --> 01:20:23,760
and and now that pot is going to be uh

1888
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:26,158
have much fewer defenses than a mature

1889
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:28,440
pot that's packed with mycelium networks

1890
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:30,719
yeah

1891
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:33,000
yeah and you know even thinking about

1892
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:35,939
this over watering

1893
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,880
just like we talked about some of the um

1894
01:20:35,939 --> 01:20:41,099
you know saline soil and the heavy metal

1895
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:44,340
or you know heavy metal uptake

1896
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:47,340
mitigation the mycelium can also help

1897
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:49,619
with uptake mitigation of water so say

1898
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:51,239
you're over watering

1899
01:20:49,619 --> 01:20:54,539
um I think mycelium is really good at

1900
01:20:51,238 --> 01:20:57,479
holding that and just helping to deliver

1901
01:20:54,539 --> 01:20:59,640
this like really nice amount of water to

1902
01:20:57,479 --> 01:21:01,559
the plant

1903
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:03,900
um now I'm not saying you can over water

1904
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:06,000
and the mycelium is just going to take

1905
01:21:03,899 --> 01:21:08,399
care of it you know we have to be

1906
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,619
conscientious of that as well

1907
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:13,619
but your bandwidth of success is going

1908
01:21:10,619 --> 01:21:15,119
to be wider with more mycelium yeah

1909
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:17,158
absolutely

1910
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:19,019
um uh two more or one another question

1911
01:21:17,158 --> 01:21:20,460
about water quality

1912
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:23,280
um does does

1913
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:25,619
um does the pH water or how much mineral

1914
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:27,960
content it has on it have any impact on

1915
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:29,698
the mycelium Networks

1916
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,439
I mean they don't you know they're

1917
01:21:29,698 --> 01:21:33,000
they're similar to other things that we

1918
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:35,399
grow where they they kind of want that

1919
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:38,158
neutral pH right

1920
01:21:35,399 --> 01:21:40,319
um we do see responses if they have a

1921
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:42,899
really low PH or really high pH that

1922
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:44,880
they don't colonize and they don't

1923
01:21:42,899 --> 01:21:48,000
perform very well

1924
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:51,239
I've had this idea which um is not

1925
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:54,420
scientific just based on observation

1926
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:56,459
um that uh I wonder whether or not high

1927
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:59,279
mineral water

1928
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:01,800
um would be more difficult for mycelium

1929
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:03,599
to transport because of its high mineral

1930
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:05,159
nature I think of it as like chunky

1931
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,079
water

1932
01:22:05,158 --> 01:22:10,979
um and and perhaps the mycelium either

1933
01:22:07,079 --> 01:22:13,439
needs to a separate out the the minerals

1934
01:22:10,979 --> 01:22:14,879
that are in the water or B just refuses

1935
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:17,039
to use it

1936
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:19,199
um do you have anything to offer on this

1937
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:22,500
on this idea of mineral water

1938
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:25,979
yeah the only thing I would imagine is

1939
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:27,779
if I was the fungal hyphy or even if I

1940
01:22:25,979 --> 01:22:29,698
was the mycelium in there and the water

1941
01:22:27,779 --> 01:22:31,259
was too chunky for me to deal with I

1942
01:22:29,698 --> 01:22:34,079
would probably try to secrete some

1943
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:36,360
enzymes to break it down to make it

1944
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:39,719
easier to transport

1945
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:42,059
um yeah it's an interesting Theory so

1946
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:46,739
after we break up the soil say for

1947
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:48,840
example uh you know we tend to encourage

1948
01:22:46,738 --> 01:22:50,698
um you know no-till as a general idea

1949
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:52,980
but you know sometimes we're in

1950
01:22:50,698 --> 01:22:54,719
positions where we just want to refresh

1951
01:22:52,979 --> 01:22:57,000
a pot and we want to we want to pop out

1952
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:58,859
the soil and we want to break it up and

1953
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,238
maybe we amend it and then and then

1954
01:22:58,859 --> 01:23:02,460
maybe maybe we're putting it in a new

1955
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:03,718
pot because our pots are getting old and

1956
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:08,039
janky

1957
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:11,880
um and so the soil is aged soil and it

1958
01:23:08,039 --> 01:23:15,119
and and until we broke it up it had a

1959
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:17,219
pretty complex mycelium network but then

1960
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:18,140
we broke it up and so now we've got all

1961
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:21,300
these

1962
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:23,159
propagules strands right and you were

1963
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:26,579
telling us earlier how any one of those

1964
01:23:23,158 --> 01:23:27,799
strands can you know start a new a new

1965
01:23:26,579 --> 01:23:31,019
network

1966
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:34,140
how long would you suggest that it's

1967
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:36,360
going to take from the the day that I

1968
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:39,500
pop out the soil and break it up and

1969
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:42,599
amend it and put it back into a pot

1970
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:45,899
until those

1971
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:48,360
um uh pieces of mycelium you know find

1972
01:23:45,899 --> 01:23:50,579
each other and get themselves uh

1973
01:23:48,359 --> 01:23:53,279
reassociated and then are functioning

1974
01:23:50,579 --> 01:23:56,219
and doing their job again

1975
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:59,579
so and is in this scenario we're

1976
01:23:56,219 --> 01:24:01,859
thinking of you've replanted a plant

1977
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:03,719
there's a plant in there yeah there's a

1978
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:06,479
cannabis start in there is there okay

1979
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:09,840
yeah yeah beautiful so

1980
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:12,359
this is a this is a great question

1981
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:15,600
um I know that if we're growing these

1982
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:17,579
fungi in vitro culture so if we're in

1983
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,440
the lab doing this this can take a

1984
01:24:17,579 --> 01:24:22,198
couple weeks two to three weeks before

1985
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:24,960
the plant or yeah before the plant and

1986
01:24:22,198 --> 01:24:27,000
the fungi come together and create that

1987
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,380
symbiosis

1988
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,840
um

1989
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:34,380
in this one study I'm thinking about and

1990
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:37,380
it was with cannabis it was about it was

1991
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:39,800
suggested that it's about six weeks but

1992
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:43,980
that there were these benefits that were

1993
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:46,619
noticed even ahead of that time right so

1994
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:51,119
when we run our bio assays we usually

1995
01:24:46,619 --> 01:24:53,279
Let It Go eight weeks and that

1996
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:55,079
that's the timeline that we've stuck

1997
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:57,539
with to see this was a really good

1998
01:24:55,079 --> 01:25:00,300
colonized root system right

1999
01:24:57,539 --> 01:25:01,979
so you know we know that in those lab

2000
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:04,560
conditions everything is like perfect

2001
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:06,899
you know we have this

2002
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:09,420
Spore right next to this root organ

2003
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:10,799
culture and it's connecting like we're

2004
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:12,840
putting it right in this like perfect

2005
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,279
condition right and we can see that in a

2006
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,020
couple weeks

2007
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:18,179
um we run those bioassays for eight

2008
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:20,100
weeks we have a study here that says six

2009
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:22,739
weeks so

2010
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:24,539
um it's a little more challenging if you

2011
01:25:22,738 --> 01:25:27,479
have something that doesn't go very long

2012
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:30,119
like some of our hydroponic studies for

2013
01:25:27,479 --> 01:25:32,218
example we we're looking at lettuce well

2014
01:25:30,119 --> 01:25:34,198
after a month of growing lettuce

2015
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:36,480
hydroponically it's time to harvest it

2016
01:25:34,198 --> 01:25:38,819
right so it was really hard for us to

2017
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:40,979
find really good colonization throughout

2018
01:25:38,819 --> 01:25:43,259
and all of the like this huge root

2019
01:25:40,979 --> 01:25:46,259
biomass that It produced

2020
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:47,400
so yeah I think we generally tell people

2021
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:50,159
to

2022
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:54,658
that you wouldn't see any type of

2023
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:57,119
effects for you know three or four weeks

2024
01:25:54,658 --> 01:25:59,698
um so that's so that's exactly what I

2025
01:25:57,119 --> 01:26:02,039
was going for and the follow-up is I

2026
01:25:59,698 --> 01:26:04,738
really think that this makes a case that

2027
01:26:02,039 --> 01:26:06,840
if we are going to do any kind of that

2028
01:26:04,738 --> 01:26:10,500
Rejuvenation of pots where we're going

2029
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:12,900
to be breaking up mature pots uh mending

2030
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:15,359
them maybe re-soiling some and then

2031
01:26:12,899 --> 01:26:19,138
putting them back in that um we really

2032
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:23,519
want to do that either much earlier in

2033
01:26:19,139 --> 01:26:26,520
the spring or even the prior fall and in

2034
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:29,159
in either case either add like a small

2035
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:31,739
cover crop I love of small plants or or

2036
01:26:29,158 --> 01:26:33,960
maybe like a or maybe like comfrey or

2037
01:26:31,738 --> 01:26:37,379
something to be a placeholder for our

2038
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:39,719
cannabis plant so that by the time

2039
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:42,600
um you know end of May comes and we want

2040
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:45,420
to start planting our cannabis starts

2041
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:48,179
into the soil that that work of

2042
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:51,960
reconnecting all of the mice celial

2043
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:55,020
strands has already been done because as

2044
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:57,539
as you and I are discussing it you know

2045
01:26:55,020 --> 01:27:00,780
a lot of people will will you know break

2046
01:26:57,539 --> 01:27:02,579
up the pots do the amendment fill up the

2047
01:27:00,779 --> 01:27:04,099
pots and then and then put their

2048
01:27:02,579 --> 01:27:08,158
cannabis plants in there within a week

2049
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:10,860
and that tells me that through at least

2050
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:14,759
um you know most of their veg period

2051
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:17,339
that plant is living in a sub Optimum

2052
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:19,860
living environment because the mycelial

2053
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:21,360
mycelium networks are broken at that

2054
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:23,519
point

2055
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:26,158
yeah absolutely and when you think about

2056
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:28,260
some of these like you know we're we're

2057
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:30,299
more in this like agricultural I mean

2058
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:33,960
more in this agricultural type industry

2059
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:35,159
and when we talk about regenerative AG I

2060
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:37,679
mean that's the thing you know you're

2061
01:27:35,158 --> 01:27:39,960
trying for minimal disturbance right

2062
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,880
no-till or strip tillage but if you

2063
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:44,760
can't do that okay you can't do that

2064
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:47,520
right but like what you're saying makes

2065
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:49,619
so much sense because you can you know

2066
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,360
do your amendments do whatever you know

2067
01:27:49,619 --> 01:27:53,939
you're you're thinking you really need

2068
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:56,399
to do to the soil and then plant that

2069
01:27:53,939 --> 01:27:59,819
cover crop let it sit there I mean

2070
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:01,799
having living roots even with your crop

2071
01:27:59,819 --> 01:28:04,920
right we're leaving this type of

2072
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:06,600
compaction and things like that

2073
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,619
um it makes sense it's same thing with

2074
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:10,260
like

2075
01:28:07,619 --> 01:28:11,698
um crop diversity right or like a

2076
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,800
rotation

2077
01:28:11,698 --> 01:28:16,019
right you kind of want to get away from

2078
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:19,380
that I've always planted this one plant

2079
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:21,960
and this soil it takes the nutrients

2080
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:23,400
different right and then try to

2081
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,619
replenish it with like a type of cover

2082
01:28:23,399 --> 01:28:27,599
crop

2083
01:28:25,619 --> 01:28:29,279
um you know one thing I was thinking

2084
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:32,039
when

2085
01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:33,479
you were saying this was and asking

2086
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:35,219
these questions and something that just

2087
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:38,099
kind of came to mind is

2088
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:41,279
it's really interesting that we will

2089
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:45,320
we'll let these bioassays go for eight

2090
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:48,059
weeks right but there's been so many

2091
01:28:45,319 --> 01:28:51,658
experiences I've had where

2092
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:54,239
I inoculate in transplant and I've seen

2093
01:28:51,658 --> 01:28:57,839
a clear impact

2094
01:28:54,238 --> 01:29:01,198
of a reduction of transplant shock

2095
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:04,380
so it's I'm not really sure exactly what

2096
01:29:01,198 --> 01:29:07,439
that's due to is this some type of

2097
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:08,159
carrier effect

2098
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:10,738
um

2099
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:12,899
to somehow the plant know this fungus is

2100
01:29:10,738 --> 01:29:15,359
there and they're releasing some other

2101
01:29:12,899 --> 01:29:17,279
types of fruit exudates but that's

2102
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:21,000
something that I've witnessed quite a

2103
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:24,179
bit at applying mycorrhizal fungi and

2104
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,079
this inoculum is you see this transplant

2105
01:29:24,179 --> 01:29:27,199
um

2106
01:29:25,079 --> 01:29:29,698
shock like resistance

2107
01:29:27,198 --> 01:29:30,839
and that's just something interesting to

2108
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:33,238
me because if we don't see that

2109
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:36,659
symbiosis occurring for

2110
01:29:33,238 --> 01:29:38,158
however long it might not occur for but

2111
01:29:36,658 --> 01:29:40,319
then we're still seeing some type of

2112
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:42,599
positive impact it just makes me wonder

2113
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:44,340
what else is going on yeah you know

2114
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:46,500
below the ground for sure it does for

2115
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:49,560
sure again more more room for research

2116
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:51,719
for the people coming up absolutely

2117
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:54,239
um Are there specific soil amendments

2118
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:58,020
that either help or hinder

2119
01:29:54,238 --> 01:30:00,000
um mycelium and the mycorrhiza symbiosis

2120
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:02,100
um you know the answer may just be well

2121
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,840
keep your soil generally balanced and

2122
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:06,120
healthy and and that that's reasonable

2123
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:07,980
but but there also could be like some

2124
01:30:06,119 --> 01:30:10,019
amendment that you're like oh this is a

2125
01:30:07,979 --> 01:30:12,419
key building block

2126
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:14,100
um you know for mycelium networks and

2127
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:16,699
and you should make sure that you add

2128
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,699
this or something

2129
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:23,659
literature about biochar being helpful

2130
01:30:23,039 --> 01:30:28,260
um

2131
01:30:23,658 --> 01:30:31,799
and you know increasing colonization

2132
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:34,560
um I know that we really avoid having

2133
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:38,219
anything really high in phosphorus so

2134
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:41,760
high phosphorus contents can really

2135
01:30:38,219 --> 01:30:44,520
um reduce the level of colonization

2136
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:47,039
so I just say to consider definitely

2137
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:49,139
consider the phosphorus content it's

2138
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:52,260
interesting because mycorrhizal fungi

2139
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:55,079
are so wonderful at acquiring phosphorus

2140
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:57,480
that's like their Flagship nutrient but

2141
01:30:55,079 --> 01:30:59,399
if you plant it and if you plant this

2142
01:30:57,479 --> 01:31:01,619
plant in this really phosphorous Rich

2143
01:30:59,399 --> 01:31:03,719
environment the mycorrhizal fungi

2144
01:31:01,619 --> 01:31:06,300
doesn't establish maybe because it

2145
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:10,020
thinks why do I need to be here

2146
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:12,600
yeah my job would be redundant right so

2147
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:16,500
there's a lot of research on

2148
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:19,739
um on on phosphorus levels and

2149
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:22,020
um even fertilizing with a lower p

2150
01:31:19,738 --> 01:31:24,178
when that's becoming established right

2151
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:25,920
right on um and I and I've got a

2152
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:28,500
fertilizer question to follow up that

2153
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:30,359
with um you know while we focus mostly

2154
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:33,960
on natural farming techniques on shaping

2155
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:36,299
fire many folks uh choose the ease of

2156
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:38,819
using you know salt-based fertilizers

2157
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:41,699
and a plus b kind of stuff for indoors

2158
01:31:38,819 --> 01:31:45,479
how how did these sort of like sodium

2159
01:31:41,698 --> 01:31:48,238
fertilizers impact mycelium and the

2160
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:50,779
mycorrhiza symbiosis in any way

2161
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:50,779
well we

2162
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:56,039
really but I know that we had to use

2163
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:58,980
some of that material in our hydroponic

2164
01:31:56,039 --> 01:32:01,800
study and the lettuce that study wasn't

2165
01:31:58,979 --> 01:32:04,079
as successful but we also worked with

2166
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:06,420
basil and it seemed to still

2167
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:08,158
you know it's still it was still able to

2168
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:10,679
work with it we just made sure that the

2169
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:12,779
Pu was low

2170
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:16,679
um because that's really important

2171
01:32:12,779 --> 01:32:17,698
so so to kind of wrap this up a little

2172
01:32:16,679 --> 01:32:19,560
bit

2173
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:22,619
um you know this

2174
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:25,620
the more I prepared for this show the

2175
01:32:22,619 --> 01:32:28,139
more complex I realized that my mycelium

2176
01:32:25,619 --> 01:32:30,238
networks and mycorrhiza symbiosis is

2177
01:32:28,139 --> 01:32:32,520
right I'm like I was like you know you

2178
01:32:30,238 --> 01:32:34,678
know a couple days into into building my

2179
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:36,840
question path for this episode and I'm

2180
01:32:34,679 --> 01:32:40,380
like holy crap this is like two episodes

2181
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:42,600
like and and a college course right like

2182
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:44,340
there's so much here and you of course

2183
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:47,219
is somebody who's dedicated themselves

2184
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:48,840
to studying fungus knows this so so

2185
01:32:47,219 --> 01:32:52,079
um as kind of a wrap up there are there

2186
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:55,560
are certainly things that that I didn't

2187
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:57,779
ask you because I didn't know to ask you

2188
01:32:55,560 --> 01:33:00,719
because I don't have the the the depth

2189
01:32:57,779 --> 01:33:04,619
that you have got and and if our goal

2190
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:07,819
with this show was to you know have

2191
01:33:04,619 --> 01:33:12,300
cannabis cultivators be more aware of

2192
01:33:07,819 --> 01:33:15,840
mycelium networks to consider them more

2193
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:18,119
um and and how to support them when they

2194
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,699
are growing either in beds or in

2195
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:23,760
containers and and and then and then

2196
01:33:20,698 --> 01:33:26,279
understand the mycorrhizae symbiosis and

2197
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:28,139
and the importance of it so so we

2198
01:33:26,279 --> 01:33:31,259
continually

2199
01:33:28,139 --> 01:33:33,420
um you know respect the role that that

2200
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:34,800
the living soul is playing soil is

2201
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:38,279
playing

2202
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:41,039
um what would you uh say is that

2203
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:44,819
something that I may have missed that

2204
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:47,158
would be helpful to cultivators in in

2205
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:50,039
making sure they've got uh healthy and

2206
01:33:47,158 --> 01:33:51,539
functioning mycelial Networks

2207
01:33:50,039 --> 01:33:53,340
yeah

2208
01:33:51,539 --> 01:33:57,238
um I mean I think you asked some amazing

2209
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:59,279
questions I think that you've covered

2210
01:33:57,238 --> 01:34:01,019
um things really well especially I mean

2211
01:33:59,279 --> 01:34:03,179
everything from the mycelium to

2212
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:04,800
describing mycorrhizal fungi their role

2213
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:06,899
everything like that I think one thing

2214
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:10,500
that we didn't

2215
01:34:06,899 --> 01:34:12,899
um necessarily touch on was just

2216
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:15,779
um mycorrhizal products and not to put

2217
01:34:12,899 --> 01:34:18,119
any not going to put any type of plugs

2218
01:34:15,779 --> 01:34:20,759
in there for any particular product but

2219
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:25,619
what I would tell people to be aware of

2220
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:27,480
is label claims right so if you're if

2221
01:34:25,619 --> 01:34:31,579
you want to incorporate mycorrhizal

2222
01:34:27,479 --> 01:34:35,279
fungi by going out and buying a product

2223
01:34:31,579 --> 01:34:38,420
look at the claim don't just look at

2224
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:41,399
this soil contains mycorrhizae because

2225
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:41,940
one thing I've really noticed

2226
01:34:41,399 --> 01:34:44,039
um

2227
01:34:41,939 --> 01:34:46,319
through my time with with the company

2228
01:34:44,039 --> 01:34:49,198
I'm working with now is there's a lot of

2229
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:52,019
products out there that will claim we

2230
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:54,059
have mycorrhizae right

2231
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:56,040
um but when you look at their claim it's

2232
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:59,219
extremely low

2233
01:34:56,039 --> 01:35:00,198
and so you know if you're having a

2234
01:34:59,219 --> 01:35:03,658
fraction

2235
01:35:00,198 --> 01:35:04,678
of you know a fraction of a propagule

2236
01:35:03,658 --> 01:35:06,960
for

2237
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:08,399
you know a cubic inch of soil like

2238
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:12,539
that's really not going to do you any

2239
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:14,279
good right so just be aware

2240
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:15,539
um that there are a lot of products out

2241
01:35:14,279 --> 01:35:18,479
there that might have a really really

2242
01:35:15,539 --> 01:35:21,600
low claim and so you may think you're

2243
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:24,839
introducing mycorrhizal fungi through

2244
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:27,600
soils or different inoculums but just

2245
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:29,279
try to educate yourself on

2246
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,440
on the levels

2247
01:35:29,279 --> 01:35:33,840
and if you see something coming in at a

2248
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:36,000
fraction of a propagule it's probably

2249
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,779
not delivering what you're hoping it

2250
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,179
will

2251
01:35:36,779 --> 01:35:41,219
right on that is really insightful I'm

2252
01:35:39,179 --> 01:35:43,859
glad that you added that and you know

2253
01:35:41,219 --> 01:35:45,179
this is um this is also something that

2254
01:35:43,859 --> 01:35:46,738
we talk about when we're talking about

2255
01:35:45,179 --> 01:35:49,619
microbe communities right because

2256
01:35:46,738 --> 01:35:52,279
there's there's all these like you know

2257
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:54,439
new to the market you know

2258
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:57,779
microbe Community

2259
01:35:54,439 --> 01:35:59,579
infusion products right and and and and

2260
01:35:57,779 --> 01:36:01,920
and people just buy them and because

2261
01:35:59,579 --> 01:36:02,819
they they like the marketing of it but

2262
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,800
then

2263
01:36:02,819 --> 01:36:07,198
you know you you know if somebody with

2264
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:09,300
with a with a bio biology background

2265
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:12,359
looks at the label they're all like you

2266
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:14,760
know what is this you know you know and

2267
01:36:12,359 --> 01:36:17,099
and and I think it's it's all it's good

2268
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:20,940
for all of us to be uh Savvy and a bit

2269
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:22,739
skeptical uh consumers when it comes to

2270
01:36:20,939 --> 01:36:25,619
um you know science that we may not may

2271
01:36:22,738 --> 01:36:27,299
not be entirely familiar with yeah I

2272
01:36:25,619 --> 01:36:30,960
mean really with all of our products

2273
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:33,719
right but but and you know

2274
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:36,658
even seeing claims that you think are

2275
01:36:33,719 --> 01:36:37,679
okay cool this seems like a decent

2276
01:36:36,658 --> 01:36:39,420
enough

2277
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:42,060
um level

2278
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:44,158
um I'm more of a fan of over inoculating

2279
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:47,639
as long as the carrier isn't going to

2280
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:50,698
cause any type of phytotoxicity

2281
01:36:47,639 --> 01:36:53,520
um you know sometimes companies will say

2282
01:36:50,698 --> 01:36:55,079
you know apply this much and this is

2283
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:57,480
what's best you know on the business

2284
01:36:55,079 --> 01:36:58,380
aspect but

2285
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:01,859
um

2286
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:03,900
I'm I'm a bit more of a fan of giving it

2287
01:37:01,859 --> 01:37:06,359
a little extra let's just put it that

2288
01:37:03,899 --> 01:37:08,638
way right on right on so another another

2289
01:37:06,359 --> 01:37:10,139
good point to know your carrier know

2290
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:11,880
what your filler products are in

2291
01:37:10,139 --> 01:37:14,520
whatever products you're using right

2292
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:16,739
yeah so so Stephanie thank you so much

2293
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:18,900
for uh spending your time with us today

2294
01:37:16,738 --> 01:37:21,899
and and sharing your insight into

2295
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:23,099
mycelium networks and the mycorrhizae

2296
01:37:21,899 --> 01:37:24,658
symbiosis

2297
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:27,360
um uh I know that I learned a lot

2298
01:37:24,658 --> 01:37:30,779
especially about the mycorrhizae

2299
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:32,939
symbiosis like when when when you know I

2300
01:37:30,779 --> 01:37:36,599
really got to wrapping my head around

2301
01:37:32,939 --> 01:37:37,799
that that it is a process more than a

2302
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:40,020
thing

2303
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:42,480
um I mean clearly it broke my brain

2304
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:44,179
there in set one but but um you know

2305
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:46,799
throughout the rest of the show I I

2306
01:37:44,179 --> 01:37:48,359
realized that the impacts that that has

2307
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,920
as far as how I've been taking care of

2308
01:37:48,359 --> 01:37:52,439
