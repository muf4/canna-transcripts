141
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,240

um YouTube videos that explain every

143
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,840
single step of of collecting IMO and

144
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,759
then and then you know I don't know

145
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:44,079
upconverting it through imo1 1234 so so

146

you know for for people who don't know

147
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,439
IMO this information is available to

148
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:53,279
them at at your website biomay dos

149
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:56,959
solutions that said we need to start out

150
00:05:53,279 --> 00:06:01,679
with a quick run through of IMO so as we

151
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:04,680
talk about how to adapt Imo um as a

152
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,560
pesticide as it were um uh we need to

153
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,918
give people like a thumbnail so that we

154
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,918
can work with this so I I know that me

155
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:14,680
asking you to summarize IMO in you know

156
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,038
just a few paragraphs is like impossible

157
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,879
ask for me but but yeah will you do that

158
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:23,199
anyway will will you give us a a short

159
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:25,360
introduction to IMO indigenous

160
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,439
microorganisms so that we we get

161
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,759
everybody on the same page and then we

162
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:36,959
can push forward yeah absolutely and

163
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:43,319
um yeah the IMO is

164
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:46,598
um in its best form a snapshot of uh the

165
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,520
entire Community that's existing in a

166
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:52,719
wild place and when I say wild Place

167
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:56,680
ideally this is a u multiple

168
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:00,759
Generations um in in human time uh

169
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,360
undisturbed land so um

170
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:07,160
places that didn't get you know pushed

171
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,919
with a bulldozzer to make a housing

172
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:15,919
complex and now have a nice park with

173
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:17,918
some things growing in the shrubs uh a a

174
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:21,519
genuinely uh

175
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:25,159
established um old ecosystem is what

176
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:28,719
we're going for and a snapshot of that

177
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,599
balance that's been struck over a long

178
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,160
period of time between the organisms

179
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:37,199
that causes the life and the plants to

180
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:42,000
thrive or maybe the limited life in a

181
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:47,759
desert place like Mojave um to thrive

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,680
um we go there and we coax onto an augur

183
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,120
of rice because it is uh a great fungal

184
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:58,478
food and um many organisms can dwell

185
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:02,519
there um and we get a snapshot a bit of

186
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:06,240
the bacteria ye stara fungi Etc not so

187
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:11,038
much the macro bigger organisms um and

188
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,038
we put those um immediately into so Step

189
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,240
One is is kind of coaxing them onto that

190
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,878
auger step two imo2 would be immediately

191
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,759
putting them to borrow a Sci-Fi term

192
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:27,400
into cryofreeze we we stop their um

193
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,520
development we stop their replication by

194
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:31,318
um mixing them with brown sugar the

195
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,679
cosmotic pressure the dryness of the

196
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:38,038
sugar creates kind of a saltfish on a

197
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:42,158
long sea Voyage scenario where things go

198
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:45,278
pretty um stable and um and can last for

199
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,799
a long time so a farmer can have imo2

200
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,759
collections on their Shelf ready to go

201
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:52,359
to the next step for three plus years

202
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,200
without ever having to go out and

203
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,839
collect again um and that's that's

204
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,519
actually a really positive thing for a

205
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:03,320
farmer in their workflow um imo3 and

206
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,959
four are growing it out on substrate uh

207
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,720
is is three substrates uh that that I

208
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:11,879
love right now is uh rice brand and oats

209
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,519
mixed with wood chips um for imo3 and

210
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,240
then IMO 4 is that plus some soil which

211
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,839
brings in some

212
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,039
macroorganisms um that complete um

213
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,120
material that im4 is now shelf stable

214
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,559
really indefinitely if it's kept in a

215
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:32,440
dry cool place and that is used as a

216
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:35,719
farmer diverse inoculum key being

217
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,560
diverse um that they can use to enliven

218
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,639
their soil and prevent disease and pests

219
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:44,239
awesome thank you Chris the only part

220
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,120
that I want to expand a little bit is um

221
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,799
for anybody who's unfamiliar with

222
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:53,000
collecting IMO the idea of a a of

223
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,559
coaxing microbes onto an augur of rice

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,679
is probably a little vague and I'll tell

225
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,719
you a listener that essentially what

226
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,439
he's talking about is is taking some

227
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,759
cooked White rice and putting it in a in

228
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,680
a in a sterile uh wooden box with an

229
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,679
open top and then setting it out in

230
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:11,239
nature so that all of the things that

231
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:14,479
are you know in your natural habitat

232
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,639
land on the rice and can start to

233
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,839
colonize the rice thus coaxing these

234
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:23,600
microbes onto a food source is that a

235
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,440
good summary yeah yeah it's it's um the

236
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,839
the rice is falling out of the bottom

237
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,519
onto the ground so there's a little

238
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,279
stairway of Heaven of food from that you

239
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,440
find like a fungally rich area so that

240
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,958
there's literally a Stairway of rice

241
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,240
leading up into this box of rice and

242
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,879
fungi will grow up in a week time you'll

243
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,440
have some blooms that actually grow up

244
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:47,439
into it um you put some in on top and

245
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,440
and uh things can fall through the paper

246
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,920
towel that is the only barrier between

247
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,200
your rice and the outside world and yeah

248
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,199
it is it's uh it's that you you

249
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,879
clarified that wonderfully yeah sorry

250
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,519
for the tech term oh it's it's all good

251
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,159
you're used to speaking with people who

252
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,600
are who have some familiarity with it

253
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,600
and and I just want to make sure that

254
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,040
everybody we bring everybody along so so

255
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,360
what we're trying to do is we're we're

256
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:15,319
trying to capture some of the prevalent

257
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,159
local microbes and then through this

258
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,200
process of imo1 and two we essentially

259
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:23,319
incubate them to have them reproduce so

260
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,040
we've we've got this inoculant that we

261
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,639
can use on our farm or or deck patio or

262
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,439
even in even indoors in a in a indoor

263
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,919
growing situation but they are the

264
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,639
microbes that are popular to your

265
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:40,159
particular locality so so your IMO that

266
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,519
that you have on Hawaii uh is going to

267
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,039
be different than the IMO that I have on

268
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:48,078
Vashon Island and and so it's it very

269
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,679
much captures the sense of place of the

270
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:53,599
place so yeah and and why that why

271
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:57,799
that's important Shango uh just last uh

272
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,879
thought indigenous is important because

273
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:03,319
when you go through all this

274
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:06,519
to get these microbes from you know

275
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:10,720
across town or up in the hills uh around

276
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:12,759
your uh bio region or just your

277
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,079
surrounding area some healthier place

278
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:18,759
maybe than your farm is um and you get

279
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,519
it established in your farm because it

280
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,919
likes that barometric pressure that

281
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,078
rainfall that temperature that soil type

282
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,159
um that General region um it's

283
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,599
indigenous to there um it will

284
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:34,399
self-perpetuate meaning you could apply

285
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,720
once and 10 years from now find it there

286
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,000
thriving and serving your your crop

287
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,560
whereas when we buy things from a jug

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,720
that was grown in a lab um it's it's

289
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,879
well known that we have about 6 months

290
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,920
Max that that will even be

291
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:53,799
found and um you know we can't really

292
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,360
move these imos around because of the

293
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:57,958
the difference in environment if we took

294
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,680
an IMO that I made here on Bashon Island

295
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,879
and I took it on vacation

296
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,759
to my buddy's place in New Mexico well

297
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:07,000
our our environments are so different

298
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,600
than all my um indigenous microb species

299
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,039
are probably all just going to die at

300
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,639
his house and and and vice versa so it's

301
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,198
really important for you to be able to

302
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,879
um have both you know Lo in in each

303
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:21,759
locality yeah and and yours would

304
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:23,278
perform on that vacation trip yours

305
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,399
would perform much like when you buy a

306
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,559
jug it would have some benefit on the

307
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,278
short term but you're not going to get

308
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:34,039
that community that now works for you

309
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:36,838
Builds on its own and becomes actually

310
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:38,958
um a thriving soil with with very little

311
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,720
additional input you know other than you

312
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,759
know getting uh plants to grow in it

313
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,480
right on okay so now now we got

314
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,759
everybody on the same page and and if

315
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,199
you're you know if you're already into

316
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,000
Korean natural farming and you already

317
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:51,278
know all this stuff well I appreciate

318
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,720
your patience through this while we got

319
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,879
everybody along so so now let's talk

320
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,199
about like the the primary reason why um

321
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:02,439
we're talking today Chris which what is

322
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:05,120
is taking this IMO and and turning it

323
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,959
into something that that um uh I've been

324
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,839
calling predatory IMO um I've heard you

325
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:11,679
call it a couple different things uh

326
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,519
since you are the from as far as I'm

327
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,879
aware the inventor of it are is that the

328
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,560
term you're using as predatory IMO or or

329
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:21,399
have you got a different phrase that you

330
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:23,958
prefer yeah we call it IPO um so

331
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:27,799
indigenous predatory microorganism I

332
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:32,919
also love the acronym kind of playing on

333
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:36,120
the um I IPM and Imo together yeah

334
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:38,799
integrated Pest Management um so so yeah

335
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,639
it's uh the acronym works for me but it

336
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:46,278
is it's a um inop pathogenic fungi so

337
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:50,440
it's a it's a predatory or insect eating

338
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:52,159
fungi all right so so you know mostly in

339
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,800
second set but throughout the show today

340
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:59,120
we're going to talk about IPO in detail

341
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,078
but but just to give people a good

342
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,320
context with which to put all of this

343
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:05,758
information we're about to give them in

344
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:10,000
will you just give us a cursory

345
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:15,120
explanation of of um what

346
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,958
IPO does and then second the experience

347
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,839
that you had that made you realize that

348
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:25,719
the the pests and Imo could be brought

349
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:29,759
together for a beneficial

350
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:34,480
solution yeah absolutely um

351
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:37,000
IPO uh what it does for a farmer um I'm

352
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,240
here in Hawaii at the moment I actually

353
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,440
uh um was out right before this

354
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:50,959
interview placing some boxes of IPM Mo

355
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:55,000
so um because I have a client um that is

356
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:59,679
uh uh the largest uh kind of uh Kaa

357
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:04,440
coffee um producer here in in Hawaii

358
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:07,399
and they deal with a coffee bore Beetle

359
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,560
uh along with several other pests and

360
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,679
they hired me to help them overcome some

361
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:16,638
of their pest and some of their disease

362
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:18,159
problems um what our IPO has done um in

363
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,198
the last six months they've only been

364
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:26,039
running a program here for six months

365
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:28,278
they are pest free they're um cute

366
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:32,480
wonderful sorry I shouldn't say cute

367
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:35,720
he's a um elderly man Colombian uh

368
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,920
lifetime kind of coffee uh expert that

369
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,879
runs their coffee is tickled pink he is

370
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:43,879
so stoked because when we started I told

371
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:46,720
him he wouldn't have to buy all these

372
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:50,720
expensive products he was buying to try

373
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:55,160
and unsuccessfully manage his pests but

374
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:58,360
now with IPO application they are pest

375
00:16:55,159 --> 00:17:01,919
free and they are uh tickled pink they

376
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:04,798
are very very happy clients and so when

377
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:11,359
I send them my bill they are uh happy to

378
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:16,078
pay it uh but um IPO is a fairly lowcost

379
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:20,958
uh solution to um managing uh several of

380
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:22,639
not all um well I don't know if not all

381
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:27,199
is actually accurate because a healthy

382
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:30,120
plant is also pest resistant but um IPO

383
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,640
is uh something that has the potential

384
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:35,599
to stay established in your

385
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:40,160
farm once

386
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:44,159
applied and give you a reoccurring um

387
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,840
resistance to or buffer against um

388
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,759
really kist insects or insects that have

389
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:53,399
some degree of exoskeleton or kiten in

390
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:55,839
their body um which is a lot of our pest

391
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,240
that we deal with especially since

392
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,319
you're on shaping fire and we're

393
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,558
primarily talking about cannabis like

394
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:05,399
that's the vast majority of ours yep y

395
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:09,399
yep absolutely all right so um uh you've

396
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,960
told me uh uh the cool story about where

397
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,240
the idea originally came to you so why

398
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,000
you know I know you've told the story

399
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,000
publicly before but but why why don't

400
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,960
you give it to people because it's a

401
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,079
pretty good story yeah absolutely so I

402
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,600
um I started natural farming um because

403
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,000
we needed a better way to farm or a more

404
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:31,279
profitable way to farm in one of the

405
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,640
most expensive places to farm in the US

406
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:37,000
which is big island of Hawaii or Hawaii

407
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:42,960
in general and uh our crop is macadamia

408
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,720
nuts um and um I made a scaled natural

409
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:50,038
farming uh made a lab for our 750 acre

410
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,519
uh Macadamia farm and uh we

411
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:57,839
were uh years into

412
00:18:53,519 --> 00:19:02,558
um the um successful operation of our

413
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:04,678
natural farming uh Madame nuts and um

414
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,399
while running our natural farming I I

415
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,919
set it up uh to be by and large run by

416
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,519
one person so all our natural farming

417
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,400
operations were a one person kind of

418
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,679
operation

419
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,519
um I was doing that plus I had a lot of

420
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:25,080
responsibilities um as a manager so I

421
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:28,240
was busy all that to say and um I came

422
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:31,798
to our um natural farming lab and we

423
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:36,960
were almost out of our IMO which we're

424
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:39,279
using to make a liquid IMO a um a foler

425
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,840
spray of this indigenous

426
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:46,359
microorganism and

427
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:49,639
um I went to make some more in my um

428
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:53,558
material that uh the substrate I take

429
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:57,600
that imo2 and grow it out um on you know

430
00:19:53,558 --> 00:20:01,279
200 lbs of uh fat-rich grains um and

431
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:03,359
wood chips had weevils in it my my seed

432
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,240
stock my feed stock had weevils in it

433
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:09,359
weevils are these little tiny beetles um

434
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,079
that get into grains and um they're

435
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:15,319
about the size they're smaller than a

436
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:18,480
grain of rice and I was like oh no uh my

437
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:20,960
grain's bad you know and because I'm on

438
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,880
an island with limited access to things

439
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,880
I knew it was going to be like 2 weeks

440
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,919
before I was going to be able to get it

441
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:32,159
ordered and get down you know an hour to

442
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,159
pick it up get back and make some and so

443
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,200
that was a that was going to be a huge

444
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,000
significant uh cost because that means

445
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,519
our spray program was going to be put

446
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,400
behind by a couple weeks and um with our

447
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:48,119
achorage and just one teab Brewer 500g

448
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,919
te Brewer that was a long time so I said

449
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:53,879
it was I'm I'm saying all this to say it

450
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,720
wasn't totally uh um just because I

451
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,320
didn't I was being lazy but I said you

452
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,558
know what whatever I'm going to make it

453
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:04,038
with uh some weevils anyway and

454
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:06,879
um went through the normal process I

455
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:10,000
have all these uh 12 IMO collections I'm

456
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:13,520
using to put in their IMO 2s and uh made

457
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,038
my imo3 and I'm mixing it uh daily

458
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,960
making sure it's going right and I saw

459
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:22,759
these like bright white puff balls

460
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,440
showing um on the surface of my imo3 I

461
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:28,158
can still see it in my mind's eye um

462
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,960
because it was really um striking I've

463
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,120
done this a lot and this was a total

464
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,558
change and

465
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,119
um I look at this because I'm curious by

466
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,000
nature and in the center of these white

467
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:42,918
puff balls is one of the

468
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,079
weevils and um they're scattered out

469
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,720
throughout so the weevils are growing

470
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,759
white puffballs and I'm like wow that's

471
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,200
really cool super interesting but I

472
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,000
don't have time to look into this right

473
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,960
now so I continued finished my IMO made

474
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,880
a liquid IMO and um that process of it

475
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:04,159
going out uh 20 acres at a time

476
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:08,720
continued and like a good farmer I

477
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,640
aspire to be I walked through my 20 acre

478
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,278
um plot that had just gotten sprayed the

479
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,320
day before or two days before whatever

480
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:17,880
it was and um just seeing how the trees

481
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,240
respond you know it's just something you

482
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:27,960
got to check up on periodically and

483
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:30,400
um out on the trees in our Orchard um in

484
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,519
the crook of a tree I saw a white

485
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,360
puffball very similar to what I had seen

486
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,240
in my

487
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:42,798
imo3 and I what is going on I look

488
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:45,960
closer and it is a um green stink bug uh

489
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:48,879
little uh Beetle creature which is one

490
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,000
of our primary pests in

491
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:56,960
Macadam um something that almost took

492
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,839
our farm under years ago um and I I was

493
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,319
like yes I'm still busy I don't have

494
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:05,439
time to like look into a curiosity but

495
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:07,639
now with a connection to what was

496
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,679
happening there and what I'm seeing in

497
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,400
the orchard now that it's transferred

498
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:17,600
here I'm like oh dang so I did a deep

499
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:21,679
dive of research and pursuit of what is

500
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:24,199
going on to find um that Beatles one of

501
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:29,559
their primary insects of the

502
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:31,720
whole Kingdom of Krist insects is fungi

503
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:35,678
and so I

504
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:39,798
deduced um and now we know 10 years

505
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,120
later more um induced accurately that we

506
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:44,359
had

507
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:46,879
wildcrafted a predatory

508
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:50,678
fungi and gotten it

509
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:57,039
to apply onto our Orchard where we were

510
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:59,240
getting now um this kill and um so I

511
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:01,440
loved it but then I was like well I

512
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,679
don't actually have to do anything it

513
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,600
just keeps happening now because I have

514
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,960
a whole box and we're spraying it out

515
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:12,359
and so I was like done our our pest

516
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:16,919
problem is going to decrease and um I

517
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:20,918
just kind of left it um to uh you know

518
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:23,200
benefit us passively uh forever and then

519
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,480
um I had a friend that needed help he

520
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,319
had um a locust population descending on

521
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,278
their Farm in Zimbabwe and he's like hey

522
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:36,079
is there anything natural farming that

523
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:40,000
will help and uh I said no but I did

524
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:42,960
discover this thing um a few years ago

525
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,880
and uh we've been seeing great results

526
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,640
and um walked them through it we did the

527
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,520
trials there with it and he had 100%

528
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,440
kill uh well the farm surrounding him

529
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:58,359
got devastated by Locust and um he had a

530
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,399
full crop went to all the way to Market

531
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:02,839
they were doing hemp 100 acres of hemp

532
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:06,199
there and so he had he had basically a

533
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:10,240
shield on his on his crop um that was

534
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,840
basically a Minefield for Locust of uh

535
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,599
their Predator it's like filling a

536
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:19,720
filling a tank of piranhas and you know

537
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:22,278
being the uh yeah like I I dare you to

538
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,640
land on my property exactly

539
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:27,960
exactly um so so let's break this out

540
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,360
just a little bit um for people so they

541
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,640
can see the application in Zimbabwe so

542
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:36,759
they had locusts so what your friend in

543
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,080
Zimbabwe would have done would have been

544
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:45,359
to make

545
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:49,720
IMO with the body of a couple dead

546
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:51,079
locusts set upon the rice in the IMO

547
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,120
collection is that

548
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:56,599
accurate yeah pretty much um you can

549
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:59,319
cook it um with the rice inside so you

550
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:04,000
can get a handful of those focus and put

551
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:07,519
it in the rice um you can also put um

552
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,359
insects in the um in the next stage that

553
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:14,960
imo3 stage um but it is less likely that

554
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:18,278
you're going to get what I had happen

555
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,679
um in unless you start with that first

556
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:23,519
step that I am a one so yeah we've kind

557
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:26,000
of we've kind of Jed it over the last uh

558
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:30,960
10 years and the best practice has been

559
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,440
to um to put your for your pest into

560
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,960
your rice and cook some I I also put

561
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,679
some uncooked in there so I'll cook my

562
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,200
rice with some in insects in there which

563
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,080
does smell a little bit if your insects

564
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,319
are smelly and then uh and then I'll

565
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:50,319
also take some uncooked insects and toss

566
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:52,599
them in as a as a topping on top before

567
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,038
we put them Mountain we're really just

568
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:58,359
uh putting the food source of the guys

569
00:26:55,038 --> 00:27:00,398
we're trying to get to um colonize our

570
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,599
rice box right on you're saying you're

571
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:06,439
saying you know hey you molds that love

572
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:08,319
to eat the my target pest we've got you

573
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,278
we've got some of your favorite food on

574
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:13,359
top of some uh delicious rice why don't

575
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:17,000
you kind of come over here and colonize

576
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:19,639
this rice and you can eat of the pred of

577
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,558
the insect and also of the rice and you

578
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,679
can make this your house and then you're

579
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,440
like yeah and then and then you uh

580
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,919
incubate it from that point yep then I

581
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,880
then I have it as an inoculum

582
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,679
um and it isn't guaranteed that where

583
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,480
I'm going to put my rice box uh with

584
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:41,240
this insect in it that there is even a

585
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:43,319
predatory fungi to colonize it so that's

586
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,599
the that's one of the things to note

587
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:49,158
here this is um ends up being a little

588
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:52,439
bit of a numbers game where you want to

589
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:56,519
put out six boxes in various locations

590
00:27:52,440 --> 00:28:00,440
um and what you can do visually is

591
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:03,880
notice when a carcass or uh some kist

592
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,519
insect has a unique Bloom on it or you

593
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,120
can really see that the fungi is chewing

594
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:12,440
on that creature in the collection box

595
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:16,759
in the collection box yeah so so

596
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:20,840
visually you can kind of verify um right

597
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:22,879
on so um I'm I'm sure that uh you know

598
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:25,720
different cannabis cultivators who are

599
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:30,240
listening are thinking about this in

600
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,679
regards to their own local pests right

601
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,200
where you are in the country you know

602
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,559
you've got different kinds of pests um

603
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,679
and I know that you do a lot of you know

604
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,558
General agriculture but you've been

605
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:45,399
helping those of us in cannabis for

606
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:49,200
years so um what are some of the pests

607
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:51,079
that you um you know know are are good

608
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,798
for this kind of process that that

609
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:55,839
affect the cannabis

610
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:58,839
plant yeah well

611
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:04,119
um I would say maybe

612
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:06,038
it is it's best if you can get a um one

613
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:11,479
of your local pests to put in the rice

614
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:15,398
box also not totally necessary so there

615
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:18,679
is um some challenge for some people to

616
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:21,639
get a pest also if you have cannabis you

617
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:23,840
don't necessarily want to produce a ton

618
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,840
of a pest just so you can put it in a

619
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:28,798
rice box yeah that's a good point too

620
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:32,119
yeah so one of the things you can do is

621
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:35,278
just buy insect frass um insect frass is

622
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:38,639
a product that gets sold um as a

623
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,880
byproduct from um insect production so

624
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,759
some place that produces crickets for

625
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:49,039
your local snakes or or your snake pets

626
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:51,798
or whatever um those um those places

627
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:55,519
will sell their kind of broken body

628
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:58,558
parts of their of their um Prime product

629
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,919
um in a bag so you can just order off

630
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:04,158
Amazon a bag of insect trash or pick it

631
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:07,720
up at your local um Garden store that

632
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:10,000
can be a substitute for using your own

633
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:14,200
um actual pest well that's interesting

634
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,839
so are you suggesting that um car you

635
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,960
know a carrus of an insect I'm just

636
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:23,359
assuming that they're all made out of

637
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,679
kiten and if this is true um you know I

638
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,599
could use some of my insect frass from

639
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,440
talab in my Imo

640
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:34,678
because I don't want to cause a plant to

641
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,360
be covered in for example mites so that

642
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,240
I can capture them so I'm like okay well

643
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:44,079
I might not want to breed mites for my

644
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,278
to make this pesticide but if I use you

645
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,678
know some kind of other insect's frass

646
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:50,880
that also has a carrus that it will

647
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:54,278
cross over to my target might is that

648
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,559
what you're saying absolutely right on

649
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:57,119
yeah that's that's really convenient I

650
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:59,278
hadn't thought about that I can imagine

651
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,839
that actually sourcing some of the

652
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:04,798
things especially insects that are so

653
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:10,439
small that we can't even see

654
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:12,319
them yeah yeah exactly and um and

655
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,480
speaking of insects that are so small

656
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:19,759
you can't see them um and um insects

657
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:24,038
that are big enough to see them um you

658
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:25,599
can also grab insects like maybe you

659
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:28,240
don't have anything on your cannabis

660
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,879
plant but uh you're growing some squash

661
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,679
outside and there's squash beetles all

662
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,679
over it from you know the summer and you

663
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,038
could grab a handful of those and put

664
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:40,200
them on your rice and you're Off to the

665
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:42,319
Races so you don't have to buy insect

666
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,399
Fass you don't have to have your exact

667
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:50,000
pest um it is more that that uh tasty

668
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:52,319
protein uh that we understand now there

669
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,519
are things I'm sure I don't understand

670
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:58,398
about how nature works and so using some

671
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,638
of your actual pests could be best

672
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,518
practice I would strongly encourage if

673
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:04,759
that's possible to do that use them if

674
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:08,278
you got them use them if you got them

675
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:10,240
right on so so those of us who have who

676
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:12,720
have followed you and your education and

677
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,558
learned from you for years like I have

678
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,759
um uh we know that you are um a student

679
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:22,960
of Master Cho and you are both educated

680
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:26,919
in and are educator of uh Korean natural

681
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:31,159
farming does this process fit neatly

682
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:34,559
into KF already or is this more like

683
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:37,399
yeah the IMO collection is is knf but as

684
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:40,200
soon as I added the the pest we moved on

685
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:42,479
to something else or or is or is this

686
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,960
like new ground for knf that actually

687
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,200
fits in that in that um educational

688
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,159
family

689
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,399
easily yeah definitely not something I

690
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:57,278
was taught in Korea nor is there really

691
00:32:53,398 --> 00:33:01,278
precedent for it um in in that education

692
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:04,960
however it um it's not

693
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:08,278
um I have uh students and friends that

694
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,960
learned about this they grow cannabis

695
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:15,558
and uh they love the benefit of IMO and

696
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:19,360
have for years and learned about IPO and

697
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:24,200
now they just do IPO to like or not two

698
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:26,119
um they just do IMO IPO because um with

699
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,798
the insects in it because they're

700
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:30,038
getting the benefits still of IMO

701
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:34,119
because there's a lot of other things

702
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:36,158
that grow in the rice um in addition to

703
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:39,798
um the benefit of of some predatory

704
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:43,440
fungi so um a lot of people that have

705
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:47,359
adopted it are just um doing IPO now

706
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:51,440
because um they could kind of both and

707
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:53,879
um I am uh cautious to say that's best

708
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,320
practice because um when you add

709
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,440
something like cooked insects into the

710
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:01,119
rice it kind of changes

711
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,639
um the the nitrogen kind of density of

712
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:06,119
the rice it changes some things you know

713
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:08,480
depending on the insects you use or or

714
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:11,719
the stinkiness of the insect frass some

715
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:15,679
insect frass is pretty smelly um it

716
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:18,759
could really be changing um some of it

717
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:22,000
so I wouldn't uh outright say just do

718
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,000
IPO it's better than IMO but um I do

719
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,719
know that that has become standard

720
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,960
operating procedure for a bunch of

721
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:31,638
cannabis Farms right on so um before we

722
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,280
go to our first break um I want to just

723
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,039
confirm with you um this seems like

724
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,480
there there isn't any reason that we

725
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:40,719
couldn't use this indoor right like like

726
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,800
we prefer to be growing Outdoors Under

727
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,519
the Sun and under perfect situations

728
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,280
that's wonderful but there's lots of

729
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:49,119
people who don't have an outdoors and so

730
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,800
they're growing in a greenhouse or or or

731
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:55,838
home cultivating in a tent and is there

732
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:59,760
any reason why um we could not uh

733
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:02,559
cultivate a local Imo for ourselves um

734
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,240
you know either using you know say for

735
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,920
example spider mites or or or often a

736
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:10,519
big problem in indoor um and throw those

737
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,838
in there and then just spray it indoors

738
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:13,800
as well like it'd be great to be

739
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,239
outdoors but we don't have to so this is

740
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,160
actually a solution for indoor

741
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:23,039
cultivators too y yeah foler foler

742
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:27,239
application um weekly is kind of the SOP

743
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:29,400
for um for yeah bug free disease free

744
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:33,519
and then people cut that off depending

745
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:36,000
on your region of

746
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:38,320
um growth and whether or not you're

747
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,159
you're submitting for testing uh in the

748
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:45,400
legal Market um some places uh they're

749
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:49,118
you know um parts per million of

750
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,519
microbes is um you know more strict than

751
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,160
others I know like Colorado is twice as

752
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:59,000
strict as California um so there they'll

753
00:35:55,159 --> 00:36:02,039
stop um that spray um um uh right before

754
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,440
flower you know so though you know and

755
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,838
then other places um you know like

756
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,318
Washington that they don't have quite as

757
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:12,559
strict as Colorado they're spraying

758
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:14,358
through flour with no um negative

759
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,799
results maybe cutting off right before

760
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:21,799
Harvest so yeah it is definitely um

761
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:27,119
great for indoor and outdoor um I

762
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:32,440
actually have a uh a fun bit um as an

763
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:35,079
alternate food source then uh there's

764
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:40,159
um there's this really cool thing that

765
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:44,599
happens in uh in seed um

766
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:46,719
germination uh a germinating seed um

767
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:50,280
that uh and I don't think I've talked

768
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:52,199
about this much uh um publicly so just

769
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:57,640
for you Shango

770
00:36:52,199 --> 00:37:01,759
nice germinating seed um in its very

771
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:05,358
beginning of its germination um is um so

772
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,960
like malted grains if you will um that

773
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:12,639
that just beginning of germination

774
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:14,838
produces kitase protein so right when a

775
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:19,358
seed starts if you have it in the ground

776
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:25,039
in nature um it's producing A protein

777
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:28,000
that is good food for predatory fungi so

778
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:30,920
if a if a seed is uh new new to the

779
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,920
block um human or just make a human

780
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,480
analogy and they're trying to make

781
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:38,039
friends with those people that would

782
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:42,639
protect them

783
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:44,920
um they would uh you know give gifts uh

784
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:49,400
that they're new friends would like so

785
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:51,800
you know sending my 5-year-old to uh

786
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,400
kindergarten with a box of Oreos you

787
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,119
know he's going to be uh real popular at

788
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,559
lunch uh time as he shares with new

789
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,599
friends

790
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:07,519
um in a similar way um germinating seeds

791
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:09,800
will put out um nutrients to invite uh

792
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:12,960
relationships in their root Zone that

793
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,880
will be uh there for their whole lives

794
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,639
so if a seed grows in this uh wild

795
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,119
forest as it begins making root

796
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:25,759
relationships with fungi which is how

797
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,760
nature Works um it um will then maintain

798
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,720
a lot of those relationships as it grows

799
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:34,240
into a large tree or shrub or whatever

800
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:36,679
seed it is um so in the early stages of

801
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:38,399
its development it's putting out this

802
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:42,199
protein that it doesn't put out any

803
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,880
other time and that protein um then

804
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:47,598
becomes kind of a invitation for uh

805
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,200
relationship with something that's going

806
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:54,240
to protect it from

807
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:57,799
pests so when I go out into nature and

808
00:38:54,239 --> 00:39:02,519
look for a good spot to potentially find

809
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:04,680
these predatory fungi I also will um if

810
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:06,719
I have the opportunity look for a place

811
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:10,199
where seeds are falling and

812
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:12,039
germinating um because there will be an

813
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:16,000
additional food source for these

814
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:19,599
predatory fungi um so like I was just

815
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,318
out today uh placing an IPO box and I

816
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:26,599
found a spot that has Ki nuts macadamia

817
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:29,519
nuts and um Ironwood trees which drop

818
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:32,519
these little Pine cones with uh seeds in

819
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:36,199
them I was seeing on the germinating

820
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:38,719
pine cone seed uh germinating pine cones

821
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:40,960
where the seeds are germinating uh fungi

822
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:43,959
blooming out of the germinating pine

823
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,920
cones and so I'm like oh cool and I'm

824
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,679
placing my boxes here one because

825
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,119
there's a bunch of fungi around so I'm

826
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:54,358
looking for that normal kind of mycelial

827
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,280
mat and health but also I'm like in

828
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:58,039
addition I know that there's a ton of

829
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,560
this kiten protein

830
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:01,880
um happening every time one of these

831
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:06,039
seeds starts to germinate in the ground

832
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:09,480
and so um yeah a little bit on uh how to

833
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:12,358
find also if you wanted to grow it out

834
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,199
sorry getting verbose but uh if you

835
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:19,000
wanted to grow it out an imo3 having

836
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:22,159
sprouted grains um could be a way to

837
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,760
increase the food source for these um

838
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:26,199
predatory fungi right on good and you

839
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,240
know it's interesting to hear you talk

840
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:32,519
about the location where these seeds

841
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:36,879
fall um you know I know that our IMO

842
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:39,119
collection is is um you know bio U

843
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,838
biomimicking nature but it's really

844
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,400
funny because when you describe it my

845
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:46,119
brain said oh that's like that's like

846

nothing added real fish poop is

871
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:52,199
extraordinarily complex not only are you

872
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:53,799
adding the nitrogen phosphorus and

873
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:55,679
pottassium your plants need to build

874
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,440
mass transport nutrients and enhance

875
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,719
flavor but fish waste is also packed

876
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,318
with biological activity and

877
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:05,519
micronutrients when you add fish poop to

878
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:08,119
your irrigation water you are adding

879
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,719
life force probiotics and active

880
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:12,960

881
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,639
wealth of various bacteria and protozoa

882
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,440
which further enhance nutrient

883
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,759
availability for the plants because

884
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,039
plants are limited by the absence of any

885
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,599
essential micronutrient these Trace

886
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,558

and help our audience get in contact

985
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,559
with you it's pretty simple really

986
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:28,159
advertising does not have to be all

987
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:30,160
whizbang smoke and mirrors nowadays I

988
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:32,639
find that people prefer just to be

989
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:35,039
spoken to calmly accurately and with

990
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,920
good intentions if you want to make your

991
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,759
own commercial spot well you can do that

992
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,680
too during these pandemic days

993
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,280
conventions and cannabis events are

994
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:45,719
pretty poorly attended but podcast

995
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,680
listening is

996
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,480

1014

shaping fire I am your host Shango Los

1015
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,680
and my guest today is natural farming

1016
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:39,078
innovator Chris Trump so before the

1017
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:43,000
break we talked a lot about generally

1018
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:45,000
what IPO is and uh where it came from

1019
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,880
where Chris originally got the idea and

1020
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,039
then a little bit of how to um adapt

1021
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,800
your IMO collection for it and and a

1022
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,679
little bit how to use it so if you're

1023
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,000
still here it means that you actually

1024
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:58,558
care about this and and welcome and we

1025
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,280
are about to get real specific with our

1026
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:06,240
questions so um so Chris let's start

1027
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:10,280
with this um you know uh does the

1028
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:13,838
inclusion of pest carapaces so their

1029
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:17,599
outside shell influence the microbial

1030
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:19,838
diversity in IMO compared to traditional

1031
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,920
methods you talked a little bit about

1032
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:26,159
this in the first set that um perhaps

1033
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,760
you would recommend U doing traditional

1034
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,679
Imo

1035
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,760
alongside

1036
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:34,838
IPO because if you're going to if you're

1037
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,960
going to do the version of IPO where you

1038
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:40,279
cook the pest with the rice you're

1039
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:43,199
really changing the rice it's not like

1040
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,400
neutral rice that will take all comers

1041
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:45,439
so you're not going to get a really

1042
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,599
great

1043
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,240
snapshot of the natural world around you

1044
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:54,480
because because you've influenced the

1045
00:48:51,239 --> 00:49:00,479
rice whereas if you do the version where

1046
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:03,679
you just put the Target pest on the rice

1047
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,838
when you lay out the box um you've got

1048
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:09,159
most of the rice is which is just

1049
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:11,880
neutral rice and and you're going to

1050
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:13,879
collect all comers on the rice but then

1051
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,079
you're going to Target the molds that

1052
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:19,000
are going to be on the carpas if I if

1053
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:22,760
I've understood you correctly um like

1054
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:26,960
like like how how do you think the the

1055
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,839
IMO might be influenced if you only did

1056
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,760
the

1057
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:34,199
IPO yeah this is a really really good

1058
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:38,440
question um I think uh one of the things

1059
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:41,318
to say um and help me stay on track but

1060
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:45,720
before I even answer that is how

1061
00:49:41,318 --> 00:49:49,358
important um some of the details of IMO

1062
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:52,358
um there are lots of ways to compost

1063
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:56,279
there are lots of cool things we can do

1064
00:49:52,358 --> 00:50:02,480
with microbial life in um you know in

1065
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:05,519
farm mean um but IMO is a fairly nuanced

1066
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:09,039
um think of it as a very Boutique you

1067
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:14,000
know the difference between Jose quero

1068
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:17,199
and uh absolute topshelf tequila like um

1069
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,880
all the ingredients you know are similar

1070
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:24,558
you know the process is similar um but

1071
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,160
one will be painful uh when you wake up

1072
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,519
in the morning and the other will be

1073
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:33,598
smooth and might even uh you know

1074
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:38,838
nourish your body um the the difference

1075
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:43,798
between um you know IMO and something

1076
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:46,519
where you've changed details um um is

1077
00:50:43,798 --> 00:50:51,519
much more impactful than uh the example

1078
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:55,079
I gave there with tequila um the um the

1079
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,400
details matter in IMO the um the

1080
00:50:55,079 --> 00:51:00,680
difference between producing a bunch of

1081
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:04,480
bacteria and um really giving the

1082
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:10,519
opportunity for fungi to grow out in a

1083
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:12,358
um uh feed stock or a substrate um is um

1084
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:15,798
is just a little bit of difference you

1085
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:20,598
know how much water you use um you know

1086
00:51:15,798 --> 00:51:25,079
your how much carbon Etc so um you know

1087
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:29,920
now going to adding this other um type

1088
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:32,680
of uh feed stock into that first step um

1089
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:35,838
really can have an effect now we want to

1090
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:38,798
do it because we found we can produce a

1091
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:41,838
predatory fungi and uh have effect on

1092
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:45,599
our farm which affects our bottom line

1093
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:47,599
gives us a healthier crop um so

1094
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:51,559
definitely we're here talking about it

1095
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:54,640
because it's good um and if I were to

1096
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:57,119
give you maybe what I think could be a

1097
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:59,279
way that you could cuz here here's the

1098
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:02,000
thing yes we can say you have to do it

1099
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:05,000
just like this but natural farming I'm

1100
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,838
constantly faced with a balance between

1101
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,679
quality of what we're producing and the

1102
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:14,679
efficiency or or the time in a farmer's

1103
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:17,000
life you know and and uh these are those

1104
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:22,558
are important things on two sides of a

1105
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,559
scale um you know um and so I'm uh of

1106
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,559
the

1107
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:31,040
opinion that one of the most efficient

1108
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:36,079
and effective ways to do good IMO and

1109
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:39,159
still do IPO is um to produce your

1110
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:42,280
IPO second stage so you put out your

1111
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:44,679
rice with your insect carapus in it and

1112
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:48,400
you put it in

1113
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:49,199
cryofreeze um uh theoretically or I mean

1114
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,880
uh

1115
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:54,598
metaphorically um with the sugar and now

1116
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:59,039
it's a inoculum on your shelf when you

1117
00:52:54,599 --> 00:53:02,720
make imo3 that next stage you can use

1118
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:06,759
some of that IPO as long as well as some

1119
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:10,480
regular imo2 rice and grow that all out

1120
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:16,200
together um I kind of hinted at a a feed

1121
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:18,240
stock um being in your imo3 for um IPO

1122
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:21,078
to grow out on and I think that that is

1123
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:24,519
also um a good option having a little

1124
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:26,960
bit of sprouted grains or um some insect

1125
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:30,400
carrus in your imo3 can be great thing

1126
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:34,358
too um yes can totally change it short

1127
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:39,358
answer but um not too worried about that

1128
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:43,558
being um bad um as long as you have some

1129
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:45,318
regular imo2 um going into your imo3 you

1130
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:47,359
know like a lot of hobbies say for

1131
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:50,199
example baking you know it's really

1132
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:52,119
important to follow the rules very

1133
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:55,480
specifically until you don't need to

1134
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:58,920
follow the the the recipe anymore um you

1135
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:01,880
know right on the not yeah I'm very ADHD

1136
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:04,200
man and I uh I'm a fantastic cook but

1137
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,720
I'm I'm I'm an awful Baker because

1138
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:09,558
you're supposed to follow the directions

1139
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:12,078
directly and and I'm that is not my

1140
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:14,319
strong point um and I ran into the same

1141
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,400
thing with IMO the first two times I

1142
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:20,199
made it you know I cut Corners I I tried

1143
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:23,000
to improve on your teaching myself you

1144
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:25,078
know doing it the first time and um I

1145
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,159
got I got garbage twice and then I

1146
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:30,039
realized you know what let's just do it

1147
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:32,199
the way Chris says the first time and

1148
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:33,838
and I and I and so I I I did it and I

1149
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:35,318
struggled and I did it without making

1150
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:38,759
any changes and the damn thing worked

1151
00:54:35,318 --> 00:54:41,358
beautifully right and and so um I think

1152
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,960
it's the same kind of thing with this

1153
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:47,279
like if if somebody is is wasn't very

1154
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:49,199
interested in IMO before but now that

1155
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,559
it's a now that it's a very healthy

1156
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:55,000
pesticide if you will um now they want

1157
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:58,680
to do it um I think it brings us back to

1158
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:03,119
um make your

1159
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:06,318
IPO as intended following the IMO recipe

1160
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:09,559
and adding the predatory in or at at our

1161
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:12,639
Target insect all following the

1162
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:14,200
directions the first time and then as

1163
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,118
you get familiar with it you'll have

1164
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:18,480
more Fidelity with it and you know just

1165
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:20,400
like a baker you know eventually you can

1166
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,199
bake stuff without even measuring stuff

1167
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,920
right because you just unknow it that

1168
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:27,639
well well you know I just recommend that

1169
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:30,400
people start by actually following the

1170
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:32,679
IMO protocol specifically because

1171
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,639
there's so many ways that seem minor

1172
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:36,199
that you can totally screw up and most

1173
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,719
of the stuff that we're working with we

1174
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:42,598
can't visibly see because they're

1175
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:44,879
microbes and molds and stuff yeah I I

1176
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:48,760
love that whole commentary Shango I

1177
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:52,240
think you're you're dead on and the um

1178
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:56,920
yeah I can't I can't stress enough like

1179
00:55:52,239 --> 00:56:01,358
don't change anything at all um and the

1180
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:05,000
reason I'm I'm definitely um particular

1181
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:07,920
in uh in a lot of things I also love to

1182
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,679
cook and if I'm going to bake something

1183
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:14,720
I know like I wanted to learn how to

1184
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:17,038
cook mering and I took time like studied

1185
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:20,439
the recipe played with the you know the

1186
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:22,559
details people put in the and uh and I

1187
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,599
got to be great at cooking Marines

1188
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:27,920
little bit gooey in the middle but if

1189
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:31,640
you change anything in recipe including

1190
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,838
like a dirty spoon you know it mering

1191
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:36,759
won't won't work and so I I uh I think I

1192
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:43,199
love that analogy

1193
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:47,280
um I also just a little um detail if I

1194
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:51,879
could uh make a request that is uh we

1195
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:55,640
don't ever call IPO a

1196
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,440
pesticide because it isn't um really it

1197
00:56:55,639 --> 00:57:01,798
is a a re-

1198
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:06,440
enlivening of your environment to uh the

1199
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:10,159
semblance of Nature and um we are

1200
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:11,960
actually um uh cultivating life we're

1201
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:14,598
not trying to kill anything we're

1202
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:17,679
cultivating life in such a way that we

1203
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:21,119
actually have the Natural Balance and

1204
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:24,440
pressure that nature allows you know uh

1205
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:27,240
we don't see um complete Devastation and

1206
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:29,960
annihilation of all plants due to an

1207
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:33,479
outbreak of spidermites in the forest

1208
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:35,400
you know and it's because there's the

1209
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:39,159
sufficient life that creates the

1210
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:43,400
ecosystem of balance and um alternating

1211
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:46,000
pressure um that causes you know

1212
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:48,079
everything to perpetuate so um also

1213
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,719
there are some things that you can run

1214
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:53,480
into if you start calling things a

1215
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:56,759
pesticide um and you have to talk to

1216
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:58,760
somebody from the EPA and you know it's

1217
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,119
a whole thing so yeah I follow that all

1218
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,000
right that's that's good and you know

1219
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:03,599
what when I said pesticide earlier you

1220
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,920
may have heard me even slow down and

1221
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,119
pause I'm like a this isn't the right

1222
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,480
word but I'm not sure what to use so

1223
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:14,079
yeah yeah it sounds like using the the

1224
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:18,400
IPO phrase itself is the is the more

1225
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:20,760
accurate yeah and it sorry I I'm I'm not

1226
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,639
actually bothered by it but also we're

1227
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,960
we're teaching this right totally we

1228
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,400
want to do we want to set people up

1229
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:29,119
right and we don't want them talking to

1230
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,960
um people as if it's a pesticide and and

1231
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,519
and something that I know you will get

1232
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,720
that you and I would agree on is it

1233
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:38,798
we're trying to teach a paradigm here

1234
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:41,558
and it's not about pesticides and

1235
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:44,199
coating stuff in chemicals and going out

1236
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:47,519
there and just like kill all the things

1237
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:50,358
including the target what we're in doing

1238
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:53,599
is we're essentially encouraging the

1239
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:53,598
enemies of our

1240
00:58:54,358 --> 00:59:01,440
enemy right put that on the label

1241
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,960
yeah and so and so you know it's it's

1242
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,039
it's not like we're not going there and

1243
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:09,960
dropping a bomb we're just we're just

1244
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:13,240
sending some help to to to our

1245
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:16,000
teammates yeah I mean it's uh it's

1246
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:19,639
that's great I love it yeah it's uh it's

1247
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,920
it's really it's it's not an issue um

1248
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:24,400
except that we have governing bodies

1249
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,280
that uh and and the there's things with

1250
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,079
the same name if we call it a PES

1251
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,839
there's things of the same name that

1252
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,480
have nothing in common to what we're

1253
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:34,078
talking about you know yeah it's

1254
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:36,000
strategically and like I don't know

1255
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,960
about ethically but but strategically

1256
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,639
totally different approach yeah all

1257
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,280
right so let's move on you were talking

1258
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:45,759
about your mering and how if you um if

1259
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,880
you use a dirty spoon it'll destroy the

1260
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,799
mering let's talk about that same thing

1261
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:52,440
about collection collecting our Target

1262
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,880
in insects because in in preparing for

1263
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,798
this I was talking to my buddies while

1264
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:59,599
we were uh big leafing the other day

1265
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:02,000
and um and and we were talking about you

1266
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,519
know the difficulty or the challenge

1267
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:09,119
with um

1268
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:11,759
uh uh contaminating IMO and we were

1269
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:15,079
thinking about ways that we might

1270
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:18,359
contaminate the IMO by

1271
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:20,720
contaminating the target pest so let's

1272
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:22,078
let's use the Locust since um we can

1273
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:24,879
pick those up with our fingers and we've

1274
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:27,599
already been talking about the Locust um

1275
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:30,880
have you developed any practices for

1276
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,400
collecting the Locust for example or the

1277
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:36,760
spider might for

1278
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:40,318
example so that um we don't in some way

1279
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:43,119
contaminate the the the target insect

1280
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:44,838
and thus screw up our IPM o we were

1281
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,838
talking about like man I really think

1282
01:00:44,838 --> 01:00:49,318
that when I collect these bugs I'm going

1283
01:00:46,838 --> 01:00:53,880
to want to wear

1284
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:55,038
gloves um I I think gloves gloves would

1285
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:58,280
be great there's nothing wrong with

1286
01:00:55,039 --> 01:01:00,480
using gloves um I think that might be

1287
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:04,280
unnecessary Clean

1288
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:06,000
Hands um you know simply wash your hands

1289
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,680
rinse them well make sure there's not a

1290
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,760
bunch of soap on them or anything like

1291
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:13,440
that um uh would be enough like um a

1292
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,799
contamination one of the number one

1293
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:19,639
contaminations humans spring is a

1294
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:21,920
slightly less than well washed hand

1295
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:24,480
after using the restroom you know and

1296
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:27,639
that's you know that's enough to make

1297
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:31,798
people sick and a little e ecoli to your

1298
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:37,078
IMO exactly it'll liquefy your rice and

1299
01:01:31,798 --> 01:01:39,038
that is uh um when you see um I am a one

1300
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:42,599
that's been liquefied in the middle it

1301
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:46,079
is probably uh eoli or a similar uh

1302
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:50,559
small fast replicating bacteria um and

1303
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:53,559
so that is one IMO collection people are

1304
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:56,240
like well it's so like hard to know

1305
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:58,839
what's good and you know there's you

1306
01:01:56,239 --> 01:02:02,038
know uh detail sometimes you say you

1307
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:05,078
know colors can be fine you know as long

1308
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:07,559
as it's not all one color um but one

1309
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:13,200
thing I say 100% of the time you never

1310
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:18,278
want to use an IMO that has um gooey

1311
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:20,798
middle or or liquefied rice or or slimy

1312
01:02:18,278 --> 01:02:23,719
in in any part of it because that will

1313
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:28,679
never make good imo3 so word to the wise

1314
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:31,239
you want to exclude one um I am a one

1315
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:33,159
type as it finishes one way that it

1316
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:37,639
looks that you're like okay I know for

1317
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:43,838
sure that's wrong is gooey middle slimy

1318
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:45,078
um but um another thing um to avoid uh

1319
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:49,880
quote unquote

1320
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:52,798
contaminating your um insects would be

1321
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:56,880
not um bringing much of their

1322
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:59,639
environment or um their poop

1323
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:03,400
um one of the things that happens if you

1324
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:05,239
harvest a bunch of living insects is um

1325
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:08,318
and you leave them in a bag for a couple

1326
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:11,278
days and they're alive um is they will

1327
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:14,400
defecate in the bag and then you have

1328
01:03:11,278 --> 01:03:17,679
insects plus all their little defecation

1329
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:20,680
that gets pretty funky pretty quick so

1330
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:22,838
um something you can do is Clean Hands

1331
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:25,239
throw them in a bag and then immediately

1332
01:03:22,838 --> 01:03:27,199
when you're done harvesting throw it in

1333
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:29,278
the freezer

1334
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:32,199
so throw them in a Ziploc throw the

1335
01:03:29,278 --> 01:03:35,838
Ziploc in a freezer you'll kill them

1336
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:38,439
without damaging them and they won't go

1337
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:42,599
through you know the process of funking

1338
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:44,400
funking up their environment um so yeah

1339
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:48,680
that's that's kind of how I go about it

1340
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:51,798
I was out um the other day um in my I am

1341
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:56,038
growing Ginger and uh I was out there

1342
01:03:51,798 --> 01:03:58,358
and um I was harvesting Japanese rose

1343
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:01,400
beetle cuz they're devastating the

1344
01:03:58,358 --> 01:04:07,078
leaves and so I'm going to make an IMO

1345
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:10,599
an IPO and uh foler spray them uh uh

1346
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:13,599
next week and

1347
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:17,318
um uh the I went in there to kind of

1348
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:19,079
take off some of the bits of um leaf and

1349
01:04:17,318 --> 01:04:20,838
stuff that I had Harvest with because

1350
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:22,400
you're grabbing this Beetle off a leaf

1351
01:04:20,838 --> 01:04:25,400
and then you're grabbing a piece of leaf

1352
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,639
and I don't want to put that in the rice

1353
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:30,559
and uh they're all alive so they started

1354
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:33,798
flying out of the bag and so uh I threw

1355
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:36,240
them in the freezer um and uh yeah that

1356
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:37,278
was that um I I want to point out

1357
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:39,479
another thing that you said that

1358
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:42,079
deserves to be hit again and you pointed

1359
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:44,358
out um you know wash your hands sure but

1360
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:47,400
make sure there's no residual soap and I

1361
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:49,798
want to double down on that because um

1362
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:53,000
uh hand sanitizer is so much more common

1363
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:57,278
too and we don't want anything that

1364
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,838
kills microbes in the Imo box so if you

1365
01:04:57,278 --> 01:05:02,278
have a residual soap on your hands maybe

1366
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:05,159
you use like a thick uh liquid soap in

1367
01:05:02,278 --> 01:05:07,679
your bathroom maybe or maybe you use

1368
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:09,480
some hand sanitizer and that stuff like

1369
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:12,078
that stuff leaves a lot of residue on

1370
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:15,960
your fingers and then you go and you

1371
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:18,480
pick up your your you know um Locust or

1372
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:22,119
whatever and then you put the Locust on

1373
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:26,798
top of your IMO rice you actually have

1374
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:29,920
put Locust and micro

1375
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:33,880
killing Agents from your fingers into

1376
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:36,480
your IMO and so you know clean hands are

1377
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:39,440
good clean residue residue of

1378
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:42,679
cleanliness is not

1379
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:47,318
good let there be no record of gaminess

1380
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:49,480
yeah um so the um number one reason

1381
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:51,318
where why people fail to make uh in the

1382
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:54,639
Camis cannabis industry they call it

1383
01:05:51,318 --> 01:05:56,920
Labs lab lactic acid bacteria which a

1384
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:59,278
lot of people use to to treat and

1385
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:01,278
prevent powdery mildew you can totally

1386
01:05:59,278 --> 01:06:04,400
just use Liquid IMO cuz it already has

1387
01:06:01,278 --> 01:06:06,000
labs in it but um people you know will

1388
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,160
send me pictures and they're like blah

1389
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,559
blah blah what went wrong and I did this

1390
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:14,038
I did all the things you said I cleaned

1391
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:17,359
my jar I said did you make sure that you

1392
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:19,440
had no soap scum left in your jar did

1393
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:21,880
you double rinse it and they like oh no

1394
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:25,000
probably not that that is that is the

1395
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:27,960
leading reason why people's lab does not

1396
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:30,159
develop is a little bit of soap and you

1397
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,920
will not produce any lactic acid

1398
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:35,598
bacteria your milk will just go funky

1399
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:38,039
and so yeah it's it's um it's there's

1400
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:39,838
precedent for double-checking that you

1401
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:42,119
don't and so even if you have a

1402
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:44,519
collection box that you've made and you

1403
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:47,200
cleaned it out with some soap that can

1404
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:50,119
go right into the wood and now you can

1405
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:55,719
have a soap filled box that will um

1406
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:59,000
inhibit microbes um baskets um that have

1407
01:06:55,719 --> 01:07:03,239
a bunch of shellac or like coating on

1408
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:06,480
the on the Wicker um Can can uh off gas

1409
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:09,118
when you get it kind of warm with um

1410
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:13,278
microb development and that off gassing

1411
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:15,920
can wipe out your community um and uh

1412
01:07:13,278 --> 01:07:18,400
and then you know people go through all

1413
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,240
this effort um sorry I'm going down the

1414
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:23,639
ways that it can go wrong here are the

1415
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:26,159
ways that it can go wrong um people go

1416
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:28,679
through all this effort and they get

1417
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:30,639
their rice right and they got their

1418
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:33,639
their bugs and then they put it in a

1419
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:36,639
plastic container without any holes and

1420
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:40,679
all this life that starts going in there

1421
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:44,679
now starts breathing and producing um

1422
01:07:40,679 --> 01:07:47,239
buildup of water and uh then it rots the

1423
01:07:44,679 --> 01:07:49,199
edges and it'll fail every time even

1424
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:51,598
though it started great because you had

1425
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:54,960
all the right things just the fact that

1426
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:58,640
it doesn't breathe will be enough so um

1427
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:01,838
some sort of natural material um

1428
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:06,159
untreated baskets or um I make little

1429
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:10,000
wood boxes um that is really really

1430
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:13,440
important um when you're doing your

1431
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,239
imo1 um so you know most of us

1432
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:19,158
understand that traditional IMO when

1433
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:24,039
it's time to go and apply it um we will

1434
01:08:19,158 --> 01:08:27,679
do a folar spray um uh over the tops and

1435
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:30,880
bottoms of the leaves of the plant and

1436
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:33,000
um I'm going to guess that the IPO is

1437
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,119
applied the same way as if it was

1438
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,719
regular IMO is that

1439
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:41,920
accurate absolutely um IPO can be

1440
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:45,480
applied if you're making IMO 4 uh with

1441
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:47,920
IPO it can be applied topically a lot of

1442
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:50,000
uh pests have a ground dwelling phase or

1443
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:54,239
at least a phase where they interact

1444
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:57,079
with the soil so just having um that

1445
01:08:54,238 --> 01:09:01,479
predatory fungi in your soil around your

1446
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:03,079
plants is enough um to um actually

1447
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:04,439
especially if you can if you look into

1448
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:07,119
their life cycle and they have a ground

1449
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:10,318
dwelling phase you might not need to

1450
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:13,519
ever even apply ful early to have 100%

1451
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:15,839
prevention in your substrate oh my God I

1452
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:18,440
I I'm going to guess that fungus gats

1453
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:23,198
have got a carapace how awesome would it

1454
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:26,838
be to have a resident of the soil be the

1455
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:29,639
mold that loves to eat fungus s

1456
01:09:26,838 --> 01:09:33,158
larve this is this is accurate and you

1457
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:37,199
can definitely have uh prevention from

1458
01:09:33,158 --> 01:09:41,798
IMO however um you can have thriving

1459
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:44,960
soil in your indoor living soil bed and

1460
01:09:41,798 --> 01:09:47,880
overwater the top of it um and still

1461
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:52,359
produce fungus Nets I I know that is

1462
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:55,600
possible so beware of um surface

1463
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:57,360
overwatering um because um you can still

1464
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,600
achieve fungus nuts if you try hard

1465
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,599
enough even with great

1466
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:05,600
soil if you try hard enough you can

1467
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:09,158
bring fungus Nets anywhere

1468
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:13,079
man I got them in my

1469
01:10:09,158 --> 01:10:15,479
kitchen so um so the you know I was

1470
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:17,559
trying to think of of any downsides to

1471
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:20,079
IPO because it sounds awesome I want I

1472
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:23,640
already wanted IMO everywhere in my life

1473
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:25,039
and in the nature and everything and IPO

1474
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,440
sounds great to have everywhere in my

1475
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:31,760
garden and then it occurred to me that

1476
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:33,799
um I am a beneficial insects user and um

1477
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,159
you know we're natural farmers and and

1478
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,159
none of us really want to be using

1479
01:10:35,158 --> 01:10:40,158
chemical pesticides even if they're air

1480
01:10:37,158 --> 01:10:41,879
quotes natural pesticides um we want to

1481
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:46,399
encourage nature and so I encourage

1482
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:48,880
Nature by adding the pests that eat my

1483
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:51,759
pest adding the insects that eat my

1484
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:54,719
pests but um it sounds like if I'm going

1485
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:57,360
to use IPO it's really a one or the

1486
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:00,800
other because if the

1487
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:04,158
IPO kills my target mites it's also

1488
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:07,640
going to kill my beneficial mites yeah

1489
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:10,519
yeah it's um this is possible and uh the

1490
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:13,520
cool the good news is if you're making

1491
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:16,400
IPM well and it is killing your

1492
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:20,040
beneficial mites um you won't have any

1493
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:23,119
mites um you can you can have a great

1494
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:25,840
protocol with total kill um so that's

1495
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:30,079
the good news um another bit of good

1496
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:31,880
news is a lot of these bigger creatures

1497
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:35,359
um or some of these bigger creatures

1498
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:38,279
have um like bees for example if you

1499
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:43,119
take IPO and you direct apply it on a

1500
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:46,759
flying bee or a bee on a on a um on a

1501
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:51,279
flower you can kill that bee but if you

1502
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:54,960
apply it um all over your flowers and

1503
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:57,158
the bees come uh the next day they will

1504
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:01,239
have it'll have no effect on them uh we

1505
01:11:57,158 --> 01:12:04,920
have um 140 hives here uh on the farm

1506
01:12:01,238 --> 01:12:09,158
and uh with I pmo applications around

1507
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:13,399
their hives to prevent um Ro uh hive

1508
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:16,279
beetle um there has been only positive

1509
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:18,799
effect on our bees our our hives Thrive

1510
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:21,519
our beekeeper loves our hives because he

1511
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,079
comes and he um splits them or takes a

1512
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,560
bunch of bees out of them for his other

1513
01:12:23,079 --> 01:12:27,439
hives other places that are struggling

1514
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:30,199
um because we're always over producing

1515
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:32,439
bees but however because a bee is

1516
01:12:30,198 --> 01:12:34,279
capable of cleaning itself right so

1517
01:12:32,439 --> 01:12:38,519
there are creatures that can clean

1518
01:12:34,279 --> 01:12:42,599
themselves and um Can can navigate uh in

1519
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,960
really healthy soils but yeah you um and

1520
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:47,000
we still have

1521
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:49,000
a I don't know how or or exactly how it

1522
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:53,600
works but we still have abundance of

1523
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:57,279
insects um but I think that um that leaf

1524
01:12:53,600 --> 01:13:02,199
surface that place where our pests go to

1525
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:06,359
eat um that soil um I I I I'm not

1526
01:13:02,198 --> 01:13:10,158
totally sure of how it all works um but

1527
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:13,279
um yeah the the pests are no more and we

1528
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:15,439
still have a thriving ecosystem so uh

1529
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:17,119
I'm I'm P don't understand I'm going to

1530
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:18,799
push even further on that and the answer

1531
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:20,399
might also be that neither of us knows

1532
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,760
the answer to this but but I'm going to

1533
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:26,599
push anyway um you know that reminds me

1534
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:29,119
of of you know very often especially

1535
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:31,520
early in my cultivation you know we you

1536
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,158
know I used whatever was being sold for

1537
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:36,520
whatever aphids or something and you

1538
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:38,279
know mostly I make my own um sauces now

1539
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:41,080
but you know you you you get the sauce

1540
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:42,519
and you you put it on and you know and

1541
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:44,079
and it just kills everything on the

1542
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:46,960
freaking plant right the good guys the

1543
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:49,880
bad guys everybody which which creates

1544
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:51,840
this environment where there is a um

1545
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,840
there's a vacuum right there's no

1546
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,679
there's no good guys or bad guys which

1547
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:59,159
creates an opportunity

1548
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:03,520
and I wonder if if we sprayed IPO on our

1549
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:07,279
cannabis plants in veg and it kills all

1550
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:11,560
of the insects good and bad that have

1551
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:15,359
got a carapace is is are we creating a

1552
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:19,520
weakness in our ecosystem that that

1553
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:20,960
another type of nonc carapus insect

1554
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:25,120
might or I guess it wouldn't be an

1555
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:27,920
insect yet non nonc carapace pest might

1556
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:32,840
be able to fill that

1557
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:38,158
space um yeah I have not experienced uh

1558
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:42,239
a downside here um so um we have there's

1559
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:46,238
a a farm I helped um develop in Colorado

1560
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:50,959
they're in their fourth year now they're

1561
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:56,919
um uh leading the industry in in hash uh

1562
01:14:50,960 --> 01:15:01,399
quality um and um they have

1563
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:03,960
um it's like 1,800 plants times 4 or

1564
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:06,879
five no they have one B building that's

1565
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:11,600
times four and one that's 1,00 plants so

1566
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:16,520
five and um they have a protocol of just

1567
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:19,679
uh um uh liquid IMO on the regular um

1568
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:25,360
and uh they have a thriving like their

1569
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:29,920
soil life um has abundance of insects um

1570
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:33,920
and uh they don't have pests um I don't

1571
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:37,279
know why um that is the case that theirs

1572
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:40,960
can still be um and it may be plant

1573
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:43,319
Health it may be oh here's something

1574
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:50,960
fun

1575
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:54,719
um the presence of the um the protein of

1576
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:55,600
insects being processed with fungi um

1577
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:59,600
that

1578
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:02,840
um that IPO uh having those those

1579
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:05,679
proteins in it actually triggers an

1580
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:08,840
immunal response in our plants too

1581
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:13,000
making them aware that they may

1582
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:15,760
encounter an outbreak of their pests oh

1583
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:21,158
my gosh it increases their immune

1584
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:23,360
system whoa yeah so um and if you do if

1585
01:16:21,158 --> 01:16:27,439
you go really heavy with that you can

1586
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:31,119
actually um you can actually trigger a

1587
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:34,119
um extreme fruiting response or

1588
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:38,119
flowering in a flowering plant where

1589
01:16:34,119 --> 01:16:42,198
you'll get an increase in um flour and

1590
01:16:38,119 --> 01:16:45,960
frutin just by um introducing them to

1591
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:49,519
the proteins and their pests um and fol

1592
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:53,158
early and that can um cause them to be

1593
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:55,360
hey I'm going to die soon there's go

1594
01:16:53,158 --> 01:16:58,679
hard there's this outbreak of pest I

1595
01:16:55,359 --> 01:17:02,000
need to perpetuate my species by

1596
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:06,279
fruiting um uh in abundance and they'll

1597
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:08,840
double down on um their um yeah their

1598
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:12,439
fruit production so I've seen real

1599
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:15,760
extreme flowering um in my Macadam nuts

1600
01:17:12,439 --> 01:17:21,079
and also studied this

1601
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:23,000
um um phenomenon uh because of it um and

1602
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:26,519
seen it in other crops so it's it's

1603
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:29,158
really uh kind of fun that there's um

1604
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:31,679
more than one dimension to all of this

1605
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:34,879
and those beyond our understanding so

1606
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:40,319
far as well so at what point in the

1607
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:43,319
process would you um uh choose to spray

1608
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:47,119
the IP pmo and when do you stop so I'm

1609
01:17:43,319 --> 01:17:51,639
looking for when start when stop and how

1610
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:55,840
often um so if your

1611
01:17:51,639 --> 01:17:59,400
yeah if your pest is um has a ground

1612
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:02,679
dwelling phase um you're pretty safe to

1613
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:04,839
just apply a solid state IPO which is a

1614
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:06,119
little more expensive per application

1615
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:08,560
but you don't need to apply it very

1616
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:10,319
often um your plant Health's going to go

1617
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:14,560
up their immune response is going to go

1618
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:16,840
up um if you're um dealing with or

1619
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:22,280
seeing the possibility of that

1620
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:25,119
foler um um pest um maybe doesn't have a

1621
01:18:22,279 --> 01:18:27,079
ground ground dwelling phase then a week

1622
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:29,039
application especially if it's already

1623
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:32,439
showing up a weekly application is kind

1624
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:34,600
of the SOP so you're applying weekly or

1625
01:18:32,439 --> 01:18:39,198
um by weekly if you want to go serious

1626
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:42,560
go hard um if um if everything's

1627
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:47,000
copasetic you know applying um every

1628
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:51,320
other week or applying monthly um can be

1629
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:53,880
a thing I would say that a IPO if you're

1630
01:18:51,319 --> 01:18:58,920
worried about killing beneficials could

1631
01:18:53,880 --> 01:19:03,279
be something that you do um uh as needed

1632
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:06,600
or that you do uh monthly um whereas an

1633
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:08,719
IMO a liquid IMO maybe where you don't

1634
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:10,639
have that in um is something I wouldn't

1635
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:12,279
worry about at all meaning you could

1636
01:19:10,639 --> 01:19:15,679
apply it every week you're going to get

1637
01:19:12,279 --> 01:19:18,639
the nutritive response so there's um a

1638
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:21,480
nutrient quality in IMO or liquid IMO

1639
01:19:18,639 --> 01:19:23,440
there's a bunch of food in the water um

1640
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:26,158
so you're feeding them you're giving

1641
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:30,839
them their probiotics you're preventing

1642
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:33,559
disease um by coding their tissue in

1643
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:36,000
beneficial life which out competes or

1644
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:38,840
takes up the territory preventing the

1645
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,359
vacuum um nature doesn't tolerate a

1646
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:46,679
vacuum so preventing the vacuum um which

1647
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:49,799
would allow another um something like um

1648
01:19:46,679 --> 01:19:55,600
powdery mildew by applying IMO you have

1649
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:59,000
this protected Leaf um I have not

1650
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:01,679
in my opinion as a farmer that has to

1651
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:06,639
pay for things and my bottom line

1652
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:08,520
matters if I can make this you know

1653
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:10,600
extremely

1654
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:14,560
inexpensive liquid

1655
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:17,039
application um pest prevention and um

1656
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:21,360
plant Health uh

1657
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:28,039
spray um and I get to

1658
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:32,599
not pay $800 a box box for my monthly

1659
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:35,399
Rove Beetle or whatever then I'm stoked

1660
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:39,639
yeah that's that's kind of where I've

1661
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:42,158
come to but um I also have experienced

1662
01:20:39,639 --> 01:20:45,880
that the living soil guys both indoor

1663
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:48,079
and outdoor are still have thriving uh

1664
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:51,960
bug ecosystems the pill bugs are still

1665
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:54,198
going you know um well maybe not as much

1666
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:57,079
the pill bugs some of those get eaten

1667
01:20:54,198 --> 01:21:00,319
too um but you're you're you're still

1668
01:20:57,079 --> 01:21:02,119
you're still seeing Abundant Life um and

1669
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:07,559
uh the

1670
01:21:02,119 --> 01:21:13,399
um the indoor um soil in that Colorado

1671
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:16,679
Farm um when I did some um uh soil

1672
01:21:13,399 --> 01:21:20,279
analysis uh last time I was there is the

1673
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:22,840
most diverse soil samples I have ever

1674
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:26,319
looked at under a microscope and I've

1675
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:30,600
been looking under a microscope at soil

1676
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:34,399
and and media um since

1677
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:35,679
2010 and um in a lot of different places

1678
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:39,519
and different places in the world

1679
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:42,279
different types of crops and uh just

1680
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:45,560
stuff we put together with compost and

1681
01:21:42,279 --> 01:21:48,679
Imo applications is the most diverse

1682
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:52,080
material I've ever seen and

1683
01:21:48,679 --> 01:21:54,639
um it's because of diverse collections

1684
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:58,279
we had every time we did IMO there was

1685
01:21:54,639 --> 01:22:01,079
20 plus uh different IM o2s that went

1686
01:21:58,279 --> 01:22:03,519
into the the batches and and really it's

1687
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:07,760
self-perpetuated and and stayed living

1688
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:09,719
so um yeah I mean I I uh yeah I don't

1689
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,119
know I don't know the the bottom line is

1690
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:14,920
I don't know the answer to what your

1691
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:17,719
beneficial uh life is going to look like

1692
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:20,520
and and uh how to find that balance but

1693
01:22:17,719 --> 01:22:22,399
I'm down to pursue it with the community

1694
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:25,360
have ideas and yet you've been doing

1695
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:27,719
this for going on a decade and you still

1696
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:31,119
have plenty of life in your living soil

1697
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:33,079
so it's like you might not know why why

1698
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:34,439
it's happening but you know that it is

1699
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:37,439
happening you're you're you're you're

1700
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:39,719
not like nuking any of these pots you're

1701
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:42,079
actually encouraging life in these pots

1702
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:45,439
just not with

1703
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:47,760
carapace um insects insects yeah yeah

1704
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:50,319
and and we're we're not we're also

1705
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,520
getting um you know we're not we're not

1706
01:22:50,319 --> 01:22:56,719
seeing aphids or or things that aren't

1707
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:58,679
carabis mhm uh do you do you agree that

1708
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:00,399
the the time or I'm just guessing since

1709
01:22:58,679 --> 01:23:03,239
I haven't done this but is the time to

1710
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:04,198
stop week four of flower like like most

1711
01:23:03,238 --> 01:23:11,119
uh

1712
01:23:04,198 --> 01:23:14,399
folur for me um I think if you are not

1713
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:19,479
doing um microbial

1714
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:23,479
testing um microbial testing um you know

1715
01:23:19,479 --> 01:23:26,799
uh prevents us from weird stuff that uh

1716
01:23:23,479 --> 01:23:31,799
builds up um the dust in a dirty

1717
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:36,960
environment causing um uh a funk to

1718
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:40,679
happen um or due to humidity um proper

1719
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:44,920
um decomposition molds happening in

1720
01:23:40,679 --> 01:23:48,480
flour um that can make us sick um fresh

1721
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:51,239
applied liquid IMO a balanced um uh

1722
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:54,039
microbial Community with lab doing the

1723
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:56,439
cleanup and all this stuff that um it

1724
01:23:54,039 --> 01:23:59,158
just means means there will be uh Colony

1725
01:23:56,439 --> 01:24:05,279
forming units it doesn't mean um that

1726
01:23:59,158 --> 01:24:08,679
they're going to make us sick so um the

1727
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:12,439
um the right before Harvest or or a

1728
01:24:08,679 --> 01:24:15,480
couple weeks before Harvest um is um as

1729
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:17,238
far as like not having a bunch of stuff

1730
01:24:15,479 --> 01:24:20,439
that could affect your flavor or

1731
01:24:17,238 --> 01:24:22,519
anything um would be what I'd say you

1732
01:24:20,439 --> 01:24:25,719
don't want to apply it and then harvest

1733
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:29,280
the next day because without the plant

1734
01:24:25,719 --> 01:24:32,198
being alive it's not working with

1735
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:34,599
microbes and you know doing symbiosis

1736
01:24:32,198 --> 01:24:37,319
with them now the microbes are just

1737
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:39,719
there without the exodites of the plant

1738
01:24:37,319 --> 01:24:42,319
coming out their uh Leaf tissue in the

1739
01:24:39,719 --> 01:24:44,520
mornings Etc you don't have a thriving

1740
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:46,719
ecosystem so you don't want to take a

1741
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:49,400
hanging plant and spray a bunch of

1742
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:52,600
liquid IMO on it because now you're

1743
01:24:49,399 --> 01:24:54,799
you're pursuing composting of that plant

1744
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,639
not symbiosis does that make sense yeah

1745
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,600
yeah I

1746
01:24:55,639 --> 01:24:59,840
follow and so the the answer is is kind

1747
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,400
of like the same way it is with

1748
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:03,600
everything we spray is that when your

1749
01:25:01,399 --> 01:25:05,599
flowers get thick enough where you're

1750
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,719
actually just making them wet and you

1751
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:11,800
could be causing molds and other things

1752
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:14,079
stop so you know as soon as as soon as

1753
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:16,760
the flowers are going to grab on to

1754
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:19,000
whatever you spray on it and and and

1755
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:22,119
tuck it away inside its folds it's it's

1756
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:25,039
the time to stop spraying well I I might

1757
01:25:22,118 --> 01:25:28,319
I might disagree with that it with that

1758
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:31,479
uh I I I appreciate that you're bringing

1759
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:34,439
in a concise answer for the listener but

1760
01:25:31,479 --> 01:25:37,079
I I maybe want to leave it a little more

1761
01:25:34,439 --> 01:25:40,079
vague because if you have good material

1762
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:43,920
meaning like um a a actual healthy

1763
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:46,559
liquid IMO or good lactic acid bacteria

1764
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:50,000
in going in and you're watering um

1765
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:54,719
that's going to actually um often act as

1766
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:57,238
a cleaning agent uh uh Tiding and making

1767
01:25:54,719 --> 01:26:00,279
fresh you know stuff that is healthy

1768
01:25:57,238 --> 01:26:03,439
alive like our bigger organisms they

1769
01:26:00,279 --> 01:26:05,880
make fresh they keep the funk away if

1770
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:10,000
you will they are the prevention to the

1771
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:12,239
bad mold um and so as long as you're

1772
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,800
doing it well you're not cutting Corners

1773
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:18,519
you are in fact uh producing a material

1774
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:22,320
um then it's really not going to hurt a

1775
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:27,440
living plant um it's going to um enliven

1776
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:30,118
and help um and I have my best friend um

1777
01:26:27,439 --> 01:26:35,079
uh he's no longer farming cannabis but

1778
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:37,039
he did for 15 years and uh he he sprayed

1779
01:26:35,079 --> 01:26:41,559
right up to a couple weeks before

1780
01:26:37,039 --> 01:26:46,639
Harvest um on his outdoor um Four Four

1781
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:51,119
Seasons or four years um and had just

1782
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:55,440
amazing amazing results and the Colorado

1783
01:26:51,118 --> 01:26:59,519
Farm has to cut off going into flower

1784
01:26:55,439 --> 01:27:01,919
because Colorado is so intense with

1785
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,960
Colony forming units that basically

1786
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:06,679
they're saying you have to be producing

1787
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:10,198
cannabis in a sterile manner meaning you

1788
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:14,920
have to be killing all things or you

1789
01:27:10,198 --> 01:27:18,439
won't pass our rags and so for them yeah

1790
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:22,960
cut off definitely find a way to pass

1791
01:27:18,439 --> 01:27:26,359
those Rags um for the outdoor Washington

1792
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:30,439
farmer he he's stoked that his plants

1793
01:27:26,359 --> 01:27:32,559
are disease free and bug free because he

1794
01:27:30,439 --> 01:27:36,359
he's got a a functioning protocol and he

1795
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:38,679
never had mold so yeah it's it's um it

1796
01:27:36,359 --> 01:27:41,519
kind of depends on your environment and

1797
01:27:38,679 --> 01:27:42,719
uh and really what is the material

1798
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:45,280
you're producing if you're cutting

1799
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:48,760
corners and you're making witches brew

1800
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:51,079
and calling it Chris's liquid IMO then

1801
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:53,800
yes I would say absolutely do not spray

1802
01:27:51,079 --> 01:27:55,319
that at all in flour and one other thing

1803
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:59,000
sh go this is

1804
01:27:55,319 --> 01:28:02,960
important are you producing a are you

1805
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:05,800
trying to feed your plants with a foler

1806
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:09,600
spray or are you trying to produce

1807
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:13,520
microbes with a foler spray mhm so if

1808
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:16,320
you're putting a bunch of food in your

1809
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:18,400
um to make tea and you're trying to

1810
01:28:16,319 --> 01:28:22,198
break down that food so it's planned

1811
01:28:18,399 --> 01:28:25,559
available that is now compostable

1812
01:28:22,198 --> 01:28:28,399
material unprocessed nitrogen

1813
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:31,159
unprocessed nutrients and those getting

1814
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:34,079
into the crevices of your flowers now

1815
01:28:31,158 --> 01:28:37,559
need to compost or be further broken

1816
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:40,840
down that will can purify on your plant

1817
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:43,880
and and so if you're so this is my big

1818
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:45,600
clarification is it a food tea or is it

1819
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:47,719
a microb tea if you're doing a really

1820
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,880
great job and it's really lightweight

1821
01:28:47,719 --> 01:28:51,319
meaning you're not putting a bunch of

1822
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:54,359
foods in it it's just for producing

1823
01:28:51,319 --> 01:28:56,279
microbes that's there's no buildup but

1824
01:28:54,359 --> 01:28:58,439
if you're putting a bunch of like food

1825
01:28:56,279 --> 01:29:00,840
stuff like you're adding these things

1826
01:28:58,439 --> 01:29:03,559
that people say are a good idea now that

1827
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:05,400
goes on it's not fully processed it's

1828
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:08,480
going to process on your plant material

1829
01:29:05,399 --> 01:29:11,559
and it's going to rot MH

1830
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:13,559
wow I can't believe that that I've I

1831
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:16,480
have interviewed so many people about

1832
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:18,800
spraying nutrition foliarly and this has

1833
01:29:16,479 --> 01:29:21,479
never come up that this this this

1834
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:24,960
nitrogen residue on the plant is going

1835
01:29:21,479 --> 01:29:28,559
to eventually compost on your plant and

1836
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:30,198
and create a um funky ass

1837
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:33,600
environment

1838
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:34,759
huh all right well uh might as well go

1839
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,600
to commercial I'm not going to be able

1840
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:39,840
to top that one so uh let's uh let's

1841
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:42,039
continue this conversation when we come

1842
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:44,159
back uh you are listening to shaping

1843
01:29:42,039 --> 01:29:47,760
fire and my guest today is natural

1844
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:47,759
farming innovator Chris

1845
01:29:48,198 --> 01:29:52,238
Trump one of the challenges with buying

1846
01:29:50,439 --> 01:29:54,319
Autoflower seeds is that often you'll

1847
01:29:52,238 --> 01:29:56,919
have as many different fenos as you will

1848
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:59,759
have seeds in a pack that can be fun

1849
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:02,000
sure but so many varieties in one pack

1850
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:04,880
is a sign of an immature seedline that

1851
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,560
hasn't been worked enough I prefer my

1852
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,560
autof flowers to be worked enough that

1853
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:10,520
each pheno in the pack really captures

1854
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:13,440
the aspects that the breeder was

1855
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:15,159
intending this is why I recommend gnome

1856
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:17,359
automatics to my friends and listeners

1857

1861
01:30:24,439 --> 01:30:29,039
tested in a wide range of conditions and

1862
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:32,039
taken to a level of maturity that each

1863
01:30:29,039 --> 01:30:34,118
plant will be recognizable by its traits

1864

the emphasis is on sharing what I've

1944
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,639
learned in a way that you can replicate

1945
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:44,479
it in your own garden your own hash laab

1946
01:33:41,639 --> 01:33:46,679
or for your own canopic health so I

Los and my guest today is natural

1953
01:33:57,399 --> 01:34:02,118
farming innovator Chris Trump so Chris

1954
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:05,520
during the break I was thinking and you

1955
01:34:02,118 --> 01:34:09,519
know um I got me wondering if if we're

1956
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:15,679
going to spray the IPO on our cannabis

1957
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:18,280
plants and um the the the the Allied

1958
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:22,480
fungus that we're working with is on the

1959
01:34:18,279 --> 01:34:24,519
plant and um and then it it it kills

1960
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:27,519
these pests whatever ever they are and

1961
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:29,679
they turn into little fungal puff balls

1962
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:31,480
like they did in the IMO that we were

1963
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:33,760
talking about is this going to leave

1964
01:34:31,479 --> 01:34:35,319
like little puffy Carr Paces all over

1965
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:38,320
our

1966
01:34:35,319 --> 01:34:41,759
plants um I mean if you have a major

1967
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:45,279
outbreak of a pest and it is all over

1968
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:50,280
your plants um in some way you're going

1969
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:52,000
to need to um get that off and so

1970
01:34:50,279 --> 01:34:54,399
hopefully you have enough time maybe

1971
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:57,880
you're doing fuler watering

1972
01:34:54,399 --> 01:35:03,079
but um yeah I mean insect buildup in a

1973
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:05,440
sticky flower is a um Bad scene man it's

1974
01:35:03,079 --> 01:35:09,079
a bad scene yeah I mean even even

1975
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:12,000
overuse of um ladybugs is a major

1976
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:13,600
problem for people as far as buildup

1977
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:18,000
goes or as far

1978
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:21,079
as um insect residue and and can cause

1979
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:25,118
real problems so overuse of uh even

1980
01:35:21,079 --> 01:35:27,719
beneficials but um no the

1981
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:34,000
excuse me the

1982
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:37,118
um the puff ball uh is going to be a

1983
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:41,359
really short-lived Bloom and then that

1984
01:35:37,118 --> 01:35:45,039
will fall apart and um and as far and

1985
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:50,198
and the insect itself um if it has been

1986
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:55,319
predated uh By A fungi um the insect

1987
01:35:50,198 --> 01:35:59,439
will fall apart much easier or or uh

1988
01:35:55,319 --> 01:36:03,118
dissolve um more likely to happen if it

1989
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:06,319
has um encountered a fungi that that

1990
01:36:03,118 --> 01:36:10,238
attacks it so uh you're probably in a

1991
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:13,039
better scenario um if they've been

1992
01:36:10,238 --> 01:36:16,479
killed first of all than if they're all

1993
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:20,319
there um and it's going to be easier for

1994
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:23,599
um uh some degree of you know uh shaking

1995
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:24,920
off or or fol or wash right on it sounds

1996
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:28,159
to me like there's like there's like

1997
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:31,359
three layers of of use it's like number

1998
01:36:28,158 --> 01:36:33,920
one IPO is going to be far best used as

1999
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:38,039
a preventative because then you don't

2000
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:40,000
have to deal with all of the adult pests

2001
01:36:38,039 --> 01:36:42,238
uh fuzz balled and having to you know

2002
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,719
clean up the evidence right so do

2003
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:46,158
everything as a preventative is going to

2004
01:36:43,719 --> 01:36:47,880
be better and then our secondary is that

2005
01:36:46,158 --> 01:36:49,719
uh oh i' I've got an outbreak I'm

2006
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:52,480
experiencing pest

2007
01:36:49,719 --> 01:36:54,118
pressure and then you you know you're

2008
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:56,759
using it as a full

2009
01:36:54,118 --> 01:37:00,679
and and maybe even as a soil drench if

2010
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:03,400
they've got a uh soil period of life and

2011
01:37:00,679 --> 01:37:06,239
you know hopefully they will you know

2012
01:37:03,399 --> 01:37:08,759
fall fall off the plant I hope it's in

2013
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:11,158
veg for you or or maybe you're picking

2014
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:13,280
them off by hand something like that and

2015
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:15,238
but at least they're dead right um but

2016
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:17,519
then your third version is you've got an

2017
01:37:15,238 --> 01:37:19,479
outbreak right you got spidermites that

2018
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,560
are building tents on your plants and

2019
01:37:19,479 --> 01:37:24,359
that's just about being a big kid and

2020
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:26,520
realizing that plant's got to be removed

2021
01:37:24,359 --> 01:37:30,198
right and so really you're you're trying

2022
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:33,280
to save the rest of the crop by getting

2023
01:37:30,198 --> 01:37:35,599
rid of these um uh pests so that they

2024
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:38,479
don't spread and or put down like

2025
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:42,599
serious anchor roots in your cultivation

2026
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:45,839
location so so you know is this spray a

2027
01:37:42,599 --> 01:37:47,840
Panacea um uh it is in if you if if youd

2028
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:50,639
use as a preventative but if you're

2029
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:53,679
using it after you know your pest has

2030
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:56,118
already taken over your plants the plant

2031
01:37:53,679 --> 01:38:00,039
well may be done so so you know be

2032
01:37:56,118 --> 01:38:03,238
mature about what you expect the the IPO

2033
01:38:00,039 --> 01:38:04,679
to do versus how colonized your plants

2034
01:38:03,238 --> 01:38:09,598
are with the

2035
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:13,118
Enemy yeah and and the IPO like process

2036
01:38:09,599 --> 01:38:15,560
takes time so if you're in like freak

2037
01:38:13,118 --> 01:38:17,118
out you know takeover you're you're

2038
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:20,400
probably not going to want to spend a

2039
01:38:17,118 --> 01:38:23,759
couple weeks uh 3 weeks you know getting

2040
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:26,000
all set up to be spraying I IPO if you

2041
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,639
haven't started yet um not to mention

2042
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,880
learning curve if you've never done it

2043
01:38:27,639 --> 01:38:33,840
before so this let alone if you haven't

2044
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:36,679
made it yet yeah exactly yeah so this is

2045
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:39,279
this is definitely something as uh you

2046
01:38:36,679 --> 01:38:41,560
know uh integrated Pest management

2047
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:43,158
system you know uh you know you're

2048
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,920
you're these are these are things you're

2049
01:38:43,158 --> 01:38:49,198
thinking about ahead of time what is my

2050
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:52,520
IPM for this coming crop year you know

2051
01:38:49,198 --> 01:38:54,839
um that is uh um the the right way to go

2052
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:57,840
about this also so yeah it does it does

2053
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:59,800
work to kill things and uh don't isn't

2054
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:02,840
isn't that what's all in in those Vape

2055
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:04,039
carts Shango they sell the dispensary

2056
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:06,880
yeah man they're all they're all they're

2057
01:39:04,039 --> 01:39:10,198
all filled with like spiderm and you

2058
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:13,599
know dear Lord there's a place for that

2059
01:39:10,198 --> 01:39:16,960
come on there someone will buy

2060
01:39:13,599 --> 01:39:18,520
it dear Lord um that's a good point

2061
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:20,520
though you said you know you you might

2062
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:24,080
not be able to get a solution as fast as

2063
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:27,280
you want um how What what is the

2064
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:30,679
the protocol cycle if you will um if you

2065
01:39:27,279 --> 01:39:32,880
are using IPO for an outbreak clearly

2066
01:39:30,679 --> 01:39:35,039
the preventative starts at the beginning

2067
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:38,159
but but if if you're coming to this

2068
01:39:35,039 --> 01:39:40,118
because you've got an outbreak how like

2069
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:41,839
let's assume that I already have the IPO

2070
01:39:40,118 --> 01:39:45,559
already made and let's say that I'm

2071
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:49,279
starting to uh do light foler today how

2072
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:54,039
long should I expect it to take for the

2073
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:55,840
fungus to take up um colony and to start

2074
01:39:54,039 --> 01:39:59,920
uh munching on all my

2075
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:05,360
pests um yeah if you have a a total

2076
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:10,279
outbreak um and irr um regardless of

2077
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:15,399
what your pest is um a and this you do

2078
01:40:10,279 --> 01:40:20,000
in fact have um a actual IPM Mo then um

2079
01:40:15,399 --> 01:40:23,479
you can apply it uh every four days for

2080
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:26,520
in three applications would be like a

2081
01:40:23,479 --> 01:40:28,079
full cycle kill you know so if you have

2082
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:31,040
different there's different life cycles

2083
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:34,279
on different pests but uh hitting pretty

2084
01:40:31,039 --> 01:40:36,079
much the across the board pests um if

2085
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:37,800
you apply it every 4

2086
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:41,279
days

2087
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:44,960
um sorry that's not right once a day for

2088
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:48,840
four days um would be uh every pest

2089
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:51,039
would be hit in their adult or or in um

2090
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:53,920
and then um and then you can take a

2091
01:40:51,039 --> 01:40:57,479
break um of 3 days

2092
01:40:53,920 --> 01:41:02,319
and do it again um so uh eight

2093
01:40:57,479 --> 01:41:06,598
applications over a period of 11 days um

2094
01:41:02,319 --> 01:41:09,679
would be like I H I'm really worried I

2095
01:41:06,599 --> 01:41:11,319
have it on my shelf I wasn't using it we

2096
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:14,279
have the beginning of an outbreak we

2097
01:41:11,319 --> 01:41:17,118
want to make sure we get everything um

2098
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:19,679
apply it every day for 4 days and then

2099
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:21,880
uh give it a a three-day rest and then

2100
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:26,319
do it again so that would be kind of

2101
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:29,039
your whole Gam bit of pests um killed

2102
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:33,039
all right um do you see any benefit in

2103
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:36,760
doing like a dip um maybe or or or a

2104
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:41,880
heavy foler for incoming

2105
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:45,000
clones um no I I say so the the again

2106
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:47,319
back to sop for natural farming using

2107
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,118
liquid IMO provided you're making it

2108
01:41:47,319 --> 01:41:53,519
well is once a week so once a week

2109
01:41:50,118 --> 01:41:58,639
through veg um a lot of natural farmers

2110
01:41:53,520 --> 01:42:01,280
are um adding um the their the veg

2111
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:04,560
formula would be adding in that FAA fish

2112
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:06,840
amino acid or that real um Rich um

2113
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:10,199
highly plant available nitrogen that

2114
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:12,360
doesn't need to compost on your Leaf so

2115
01:42:10,198 --> 01:42:14,638
that that uh that nitrogen we talked a

2116
01:42:12,359 --> 01:42:17,598
little bit last segment about how these

2117
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:20,239
like unprocessed nutrients have to go

2118
01:42:17,599 --> 01:42:22,920
through a processing phase even like

2119
01:42:20,238 --> 01:42:25,799
fish hydrolysate or or fish Emulsion

2120
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:28,359
it's been Blended it's been chopped up

2121
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:31,360
really fine but there's still a

2122
01:42:28,359 --> 01:42:34,158
uncomposted fish particle that will now

2123
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:40,759
land on your leaf and need to process

2124
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:44,920
there um and uh whereas FAA went through

2125
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:47,800
the belly uh metaphorically of or or

2126
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:51,000
literally of a microbe completely

2127
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:54,599
processed and now is the processed

2128
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:57,359
version of that same nutrient the amino

2129
01:42:54,599 --> 01:42:59,719
acid kind of form and that really

2130
01:42:57,359 --> 01:43:04,118
doesn't have any more processing it can

2131
01:42:59,719 --> 01:43:06,719
be taken up or pass through that um uh

2132
01:43:04,118 --> 01:43:11,118
tissue into the plant as

2133
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:14,079
is um and so that that you do in veg so

2134
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:16,118
a regular you know weekly application of

2135
01:43:14,079 --> 01:43:18,519
liquid IMO would be great and then maybe

2136
01:43:16,118 --> 01:43:20,799
every other week or every week you're

2137
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:24,000
putting in the nitrogen um you don't

2138
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:28,159
Brew with nitrogen in the liquid IMO

2139
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:31,560
though so um also

2140
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:36,158
um it may be that we're not getting a

2141
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:41,320
ton of replication of IPO in the water

2142
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:44,439
column so um sorry I'm rabbit trailing

2143
01:43:41,319 --> 01:43:46,399
Shango should we stop and clarify sure

2144
01:43:44,439 --> 01:43:48,158
actually I'm gonna I think that we have

2145
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:50,359
made that point really well and I'm

2146
01:43:48,158 --> 01:43:53,679
going to ask you the follow-up question

2147
01:43:50,359 --> 01:43:57,799
which is um do you see any reason why we

2148
01:43:53,679 --> 01:44:02,480
can't Target more than one variety of

2149
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:05,000
pest in um the IMO so is it possible

2150
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:08,399
that we're collecting the IMO and okay

2151
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:10,479
we're going to put um uh you know pest

2152
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:12,439
one in there but I also have a problem

2153
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:15,519
with pest two in my area and so I'm

2154
01:44:12,439 --> 01:44:18,479
going to put that pest on my rice as

2155
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:22,360
well and so I'm going to have a a double

2156
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:26,598
duty IPO or or you are you more of the

2157
01:44:22,359 --> 01:44:29,639
line of no no no one IPO per Pest and

2158
01:44:26,599 --> 01:44:32,159
then rotate them through uh great

2159
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:34,880
clarifying question I really appreciate

2160
01:44:32,158 --> 01:44:41,879
that so

2161
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:45,639
um if you put one carest insect um in

2162
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:49,319
with rice and it gets colonized or um

2163
01:44:45,639 --> 01:44:50,920
gets chewed on um that is your

2164
01:44:49,319 --> 01:44:54,920
broadspectrum

2165
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:57,560
IPO complete meaning there is not

2166
01:44:54,920 --> 01:45:03,279
another now that doesn't mean that you

2167
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:06,520
can't um do um potentially better by

2168
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:09,519
having your Locust and your Beetle both

2169
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:12,760
in your rice and you know maybe it's a

2170
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:14,880
you know that one fungi really likes

2171
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:19,320
that uh that Beetle flavored you know

2172
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:23,440
soft drink um you know but really it's

2173
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:29,198
it's not um a lot of these uh anop

2174
01:45:23,439 --> 01:45:33,598
pathogenic fungi um are um broadspectrum

2175
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:37,439
if you will they they they go for kind

2176
01:45:33,599 --> 01:45:39,760
of um whatever has that protein and

2177
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:43,479
every time it when it passes them or

2178
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:46,400
they blow by on the wind and land on it

2179
01:45:43,479 --> 01:45:48,439
um that is going to go after whatever it

2180
01:45:46,399 --> 01:45:52,679
finds that has that protein has their

2181
01:45:48,439 --> 01:45:55,279
food source I see oh yeah go ahead so so

2182
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:57,840
I get so you're saying all right so you

2183
01:45:55,279 --> 01:46:00,960
you know if you want to add multiple

2184
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:04,440
pests to your rice like you you can't

2185
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:06,599
you fine but really the the the picture

2186
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:09,039
the context is bigger than that it's

2187
01:46:06,599 --> 01:46:11,880
it's not that oh I want to Target pest

2188
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:14,599
one and and Target pest two because the

2189
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:17,920
IPO isn't targeting the pest it's

2190
01:46:14,599 --> 01:46:21,440
targeting kiten which is what the carpes

2191
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:24,039
is made of so as as far as the um our

2192
01:46:21,439 --> 01:46:26,799
partner fungus is concerned they're the

2193
01:46:24,039 --> 01:46:29,679
same pest because they both are carrying

2194
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:32,639
its food around on its back yeah and if

2195
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:34,520
it's a seed in early germination it's

2196
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:37,319
the same food

2197
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:38,520
source man I'd be really tempted to

2198
01:46:37,319 --> 01:46:40,559
actually

2199
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:44,119
spray

2200
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:46,639
germinating seeds or or or even just

2201
01:46:44,118 --> 01:46:50,519
like just after germination to spray

2202
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:54,039
them with the IPO so that it replicates

2203
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:58,400
as the plant grows

2204
01:46:54,039 --> 01:47:03,079
absolutely or or even better you put the

2205
01:46:58,399 --> 01:47:06,279
seed in soil that's been treated with

2206
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:08,639
IPO thriving ecosystem dude totally

2207
01:47:06,279 --> 01:47:10,719
which is what Nature's doing right right

2208
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:14,199
yeah cuz then the the soil is already

2209
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:17,560
housing um our our partner fungus plus

2210
01:47:14,198 --> 01:47:19,399
all of like its helper you know you know

2211
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:22,000
biology and yeah and it's well

2212
01:47:19,399 --> 01:47:24,960
established at that point so start so

2213
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,639
start building I pmo into your soil oh

2214
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:31,840
God that's a great addition to a soil

2215
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:34,239
recipe right there boy mhm yes gosh um

2216
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:35,960
all right so um I you've already hit on

2217
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:37,799
this but I want to make it really clear

2218
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:41,800
for for anybody who still has this

2219
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:44,039
question um I pmo plays nicely with all

2220
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:47,639
the other forms of Korean natural

2221
01:47:44,039 --> 01:47:52,039
farming correct yes great I just wanted

2222
01:47:47,639 --> 01:47:53,960
to make that nice and clear um so um

2223
01:47:52,039 --> 01:47:56,519
let's see here what have I what do I

2224
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:59,880
still have that I have't here

2225
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:02,760
um oh yeah um so so you know this show

2226
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:05,800
is about cannabis right but but um but

2227
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:08,800
but most of us who grow cannabis love

2228
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:10,079
cultivating plants as well and and I am

2229
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:13,199
definitely one of those people that

2230
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:14,920
cannabis was a gateway to food farming

2231
01:48:13,198 --> 01:48:16,799
right you know for most of my life I've

2232
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:19,199
just been growing this one plant that I

2233
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:22,279
have this special relationship with but

2234
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:24,399
you know as as as we saw you know access

2235
01:48:22,279 --> 01:48:27,880
to food get questionable there a few

2236
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:31,638
years back um I've dove into food

2237
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:34,800
farming and um uh this is something that

2238
01:48:31,639 --> 01:48:36,880
we can use on on all of our food crops

2239
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:38,920
right is there is there any crop that

2240
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:41,118
you have come across where this is not a

2241
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:41,118
good

2242
01:48:41,238 --> 01:48:47,839
idea that's a pretty broad question

2243
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:51,760
about I just asked you but yeah no um

2244
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:53,520
again I I um I have worked a bunch in

2245
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:57,199
the Cannabis industry

2246
01:48:53,520 --> 01:49:01,760
but um most of my work is not most of my

2247
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:07,279
work is with food Farmers um and

2248
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:11,639
um I cannot um I can't see a downside um

2249
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:14,719
again we're not doing anything wild uh

2250
01:49:11,639 --> 01:49:16,440
in as far as nature goes right we're

2251
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:21,319
we're just taking something that's

2252
01:49:16,439 --> 01:49:24,079
already there and um and making sure it

2253
01:49:21,319 --> 01:49:28,319
gets on our crop that we're growing

2254
01:49:24,079 --> 01:49:31,238
because sometimes when we are growing

2255
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:33,960
wherever it is we're growing we've

2256
01:49:31,238 --> 01:49:37,439
tilled it and it actually used to be

2257
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:39,359
lawn or um we actually bought it in bags

2258
01:49:37,439 --> 01:49:41,879
and brought it indoors you know there

2259
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:44,439
hasn't been the establishment of life so

2260
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:50,960
really we're

2261
01:49:44,439 --> 01:49:53,799
um we're uh Not Afraid uh I I will say I

2262
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:56,039
will bring I I think uh if I can maybe

2263
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:58,440
uh take Liberty with your question and

2264
01:49:56,039 --> 01:50:01,079
go a little more broad sure go ahead um

2265
01:49:58,439 --> 01:50:03,399
I will give a caution uh that I think is

2266
01:50:01,079 --> 01:50:08,840
really important and I appreciate the

2267
01:50:03,399 --> 01:50:14,638
trigger um or the the nudge we

2268
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:18,119
um we are collecting microbes without um

2269
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:21,359
specifying um our collection right we're

2270
01:50:18,118 --> 01:50:24,079
in in natural farming we're doing

2271
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:28,359
a um

2272
01:50:24,079 --> 01:50:30,800
uh a broad uh a broad uh invite by

2273
01:50:28,359 --> 01:50:32,598
putting out this food and by getting it

2274
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:34,000
from different places ideally we have a

2275
01:50:32,599 --> 01:50:38,960
bunch of different places we've got our

2276
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:42,279
microbes from and then we're uh further

2277
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:46,800
cultivating it and when we finish

2278
01:50:42,279 --> 01:50:49,479
imo3 um it dries out and is really

2279
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:51,159
almost like a powder and if I look at it

2280
01:50:49,479 --> 01:50:53,598
under a microscope what that powder

2281
01:50:51,158 --> 01:50:57,078
consists of is a bad of marbles that's

2282
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:59,400
packed with fungal spores so in an ideal

2283
01:50:57,078 --> 01:51:02,799
you did really great great job making

2284
01:50:59,399 --> 01:51:06,078
imo3 under a microscope now that it's

2285
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:08,639
all dried we've used up all the water um

2286
01:51:06,078 --> 01:51:11,279
we have desiccated fungal bodies meaning

2287
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:13,199
they ran out of water so they sporulated

2288
01:51:11,279 --> 01:51:16,359
they pushed their nucula into a fuing

2289
01:51:13,198 --> 01:51:17,960
head and made a bunch of spores they're

2290
01:51:16,359 --> 01:51:19,639
now sitting there waiting to be

2291
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:24,158
reintroduced to water so they can wake

2292
01:51:19,639 --> 01:51:28,760
up but all those spores um

2293
01:51:24,158 --> 01:51:32,279
are great for the forest but they we

2294
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:35,800
have made a concentrate just like if you

2295
01:51:32,279 --> 01:51:37,359
have a a new cannabis smoker and you're

2296
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:41,239
uh you're about to introduce them to

2297
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:43,639
your dab rig you say now this is uh

2298
01:51:41,238 --> 01:51:46,000
concentrated maybe more than nature

2299
01:51:43,639 --> 01:51:49,920
would normally give you on your first to

2300
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:53,039
you know take it easy um we have a super

2301
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:56,039
concentrate of fungi um and fungal Spore

2302
01:51:53,039 --> 01:52:01,599
specifically in an IMO 3 or an IMO 4

2303
01:51:56,039 --> 01:52:05,599
that's dried um or a liquid IMO and so

2304
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:07,960
um there though it's safe I've drank my

2305
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:13,400
liquid IMO now

2306
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:17,800
uh throughout the year for uh 12

2307
01:52:13,399 --> 01:52:23,559
years um I've bathed in IMO and eatting

2308
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:28,119
imo2 any chance I get um and uh and uh I

2309
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:31,920
know many people that have um IMO is um

2310
01:52:28,118 --> 01:52:36,198
really just a if done well a replication

2311
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:44,158
of a forest floor um that said sorry

2312
01:52:36,198 --> 01:52:47,960
long long leadup to um it can be um uh

2313
01:52:44,158 --> 01:52:51,000
overly um concentrated for an immunal

2314
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:54,319
compromised person you know to breathe

2315
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:58,560
in to inhale a massive amount of

2316
01:52:54,319 --> 01:53:03,279
microbes albeit beneficial microbes um

2317
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:07,159
the the reality is that good microbes

2318
01:53:03,279 --> 01:53:10,599
can have a negative impact on a person

2319
01:53:07,158 --> 01:53:13,118
um in various you know Health too much

2320
01:53:10,599 --> 01:53:15,319
anything isn't great you know right so

2321
01:53:13,118 --> 01:53:19,639
so we have a concentrate so I just I

2322
01:53:15,319 --> 01:53:23,840
think a general caution that you are um

2323
01:53:19,639 --> 01:53:26,199
producing a massive quantity your your

2324
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:28,760
the the goal with imo3 is that we're

2325
01:53:26,198 --> 01:53:33,000
really um we're

2326
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:35,560
we're uh multiplying again and again to

2327
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,880
um produce our our microbes I have a

2328
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:40,760
friend um Poncho he's on one of my

2329
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:43,118
videos on my YouTube uh I haven't talked

2330
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:45,360
to him in a while which is definitely my

2331
01:53:43,118 --> 01:53:50,880
fault not his

2332
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:53,359
um and um he can't be around imo3 or

2333
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:56,480
four production that dust gets in the

2334
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:58,439
air he's you know he's a longtime rocker

2335
01:53:56,479 --> 01:54:01,479
he was Crazy Horse Neil Young Crazy

2336
01:53:58,439 --> 01:54:03,399
Horse and for whatever reason that has

2337
01:54:01,479 --> 01:54:06,158
put him in a state where starts

2338
01:54:03,399 --> 01:54:08,519
breathing that he itches and has a a

2339
01:54:06,158 --> 01:54:11,638
like a autoimmune

2340
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:15,119
response you know whereas I have no

2341
01:54:11,639 --> 01:54:17,599
negative uh effect and so I think just

2342
01:54:15,118 --> 01:54:22,598
in general though I'm not so worried

2343
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:26,560
about a plant um I am concerned uh that

2344
01:54:22,599 --> 01:54:30,239
uh we just be beware for humans

2345
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:32,039
especially um elderly I have encountered

2346
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:35,238
um two or three people in my whole

2347
01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:39,118
journey that IMO makes them itch and and

2348
01:54:35,238 --> 01:54:43,399
they're all you know over 50 um over 60

2349
01:54:39,118 --> 01:54:44,920
um humans and and so um yeah just uh

2350
01:54:43,399 --> 01:54:47,000
that's the that's the big caution I

2351
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:48,840
guess sorry for the long-winded

2352
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,479
explanation but well at least we at

2353
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:53,599
least we understand why and I think I'll

2354
01:54:51,479 --> 01:54:57,039
even throw this in there is that even

2355
01:54:53,599 --> 01:55:00,119
though people um drink their um their

2356
01:54:57,039 --> 01:55:01,599
preps um to kind of like prove a point

2357
01:55:00,118 --> 01:55:03,198
um you know it doesn't matter who you

2358
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:05,239
are you should be wearing a mask when

2359
01:55:03,198 --> 01:55:06,678
fol oring this things because just

2360
01:55:05,238 --> 01:55:08,439
because you can drink it does not mean

2361
01:55:06,679 --> 01:55:11,319
that it plays well in your

2362
01:55:08,439 --> 01:55:13,759
lungs and so you know anytime doing

2363
01:55:11,319 --> 01:55:17,319
foler if it's not just water It is Well

2364
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:19,520
advised to wear some sort of mask yeah I

2365
01:55:17,319 --> 01:55:22,039
I think uh I think it goes back to what

2366
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:24,719
did you actually produce did it go well

2367
01:55:22,039 --> 01:55:27,719
and if I'm making it I feel safe you

2368
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:29,639
know to to breathe it in but uh but yeah

2369
01:55:27,719 --> 01:55:31,840
if you're making it for the first time

2370
01:55:29,639 --> 01:55:34,000
or you tried something new or whatever

2371
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:36,880
yeah it's just a general you know take

2372
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:39,479
care of yourself um these are

2373
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:41,319
concentrates right on all right so

2374
01:55:39,479 --> 01:55:43,399
here's our last question uh Chris so I

2375
01:55:41,319 --> 01:55:46,118
want to take I want to take you a step

2376
01:55:43,399 --> 01:55:49,279
back from all the specificity that we

2377
01:55:46,118 --> 01:55:53,078
have had today and and and think about

2378
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:56,238
the student who is um considering I TMO

2379
01:55:53,078 --> 01:55:59,279
for the first time and has just listened

2380
01:55:56,238 --> 01:56:00,919
to all of the details that we have given

2381
01:55:59,279 --> 01:56:03,279
you know move moving from different

2382
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:06,000
types of science to different kinds of

2383
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:08,039
like processes to make it uh maybe

2384
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,000
they've experimented with IMO maybe they

2385
01:56:08,039 --> 01:56:11,639
haven't but but maybe they're they're

2386
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:15,158
probably feeling you know a little bit

2387
01:56:11,639 --> 01:56:17,639
overwhelmed with like I really want IPO

2388
01:56:15,158 --> 01:56:19,399
but holy F there there's a lot of

2389
01:56:17,639 --> 01:56:21,279
science here I have to remember and

2390
01:56:19,399 --> 01:56:23,000
there's a lot of steps and yet we want

2391
01:56:21,279 --> 01:56:25,679
to we want to support them because this

2392
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:28,359
is this could really radically improve

2393
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:30,000
their cultivation or their farm and so

2394
01:56:28,359 --> 01:56:33,719
here here's my question for you handing

2395
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:36,039
you the the mic for a nice nice Dismount

2396
01:56:33,719 --> 01:56:38,800
what advice would you give to someone

2397
01:56:36,039 --> 01:56:42,719
just starting to make an experiment with

2398
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:44,920
predatory IMO in the garden to to help

2399
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:47,520
like I don't know soothe their

2400
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:49,800
nervousness about the complexity of it

2401
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:53,320
and to kind of like assure them that

2402
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:58,520
that they can freaking do it

2403
01:56:53,319 --> 01:57:01,158
absolutely um so in eight days from

2404
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:07,639
listening to this you can

2405
01:57:01,158 --> 01:57:12,158
foler a um a a liquid IPO and and have

2406
01:57:07,639 --> 01:57:14,760
it be 100% exactly as I would do it um

2407
01:57:12,158 --> 01:57:17,359
it's it's it's really doable and that

2408
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:21,079
would be using your imo2 to make a

2409
01:57:17,359 --> 01:57:24,078
liquid IMO but you basically um get a

2410
01:57:21,078 --> 01:57:27,920
natural M uh material container you know

2411
01:57:24,078 --> 01:57:31,719
like a box and cook some rice um

2412
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:38,520
actually I have a fun uh uh bomb to drop

2413
01:57:31,719 --> 01:57:39,920
uh Shango you inviting me to do um a uh

2414
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:46,159
IPO

2415
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:49,599
interview um inspired me to make a IPO

2416
01:57:46,158 --> 01:57:51,920
howto oh that's fabulous it does not

2417
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:56,679
have all this science we talked about I

2418
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:59,078
kep it super truncated and short um uh

2419
01:57:56,679 --> 01:58:01,158

2422
01:58:03,238 --> 01:58:06,118
portion of it this morning before we

2423
01:58:04,679 --> 01:58:07,679
jumped on the call that's why I was

2424
01:58:06,118 --> 01:58:12,519
maybe going to be late I got stuck in

2425
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:14,560
the woods but uh but no it's uh um yeah

2426

going to be on my YouTube channel uh it

2427
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:20,079
will be uh By the time they're listening

2428
01:58:16,439 --> 01:58:22,198
to this so yes it is there and um yeah

2429
01:58:20,078 --> 01:58:24,559
it'll it'll it'll take you through just

2430
01:58:22,198 --> 01:58:27,719
the practical but you don't have to

2431
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:31,480
watch it to uh take the interview and uh

2432
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:32,279
go right into it literally rice cooked

2433
01:58:31,479 --> 01:58:37,319
al

2434
01:58:32,279 --> 01:58:40,238
dente placed um just like an IM A1 and

2435
01:58:37,319 --> 01:58:42,840
um if that succeeds mixing it with brown

2436
01:58:40,238 --> 01:58:46,678
sugar taking a handful of that putting

2437
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:49,239
it in a a sock or something with an

2438
01:58:46,679 --> 01:58:52,158
AirStone um because these are aerobic

2439
01:58:49,238 --> 01:58:55,678
organisms and Brewing it for 24 hours

2440
01:58:52,158 --> 01:59:01,479
and sprain it on and you will have uh

2441
01:58:55,679 --> 01:59:05,118
your IPO foler um it's that simple so

2442
01:59:01,479 --> 01:59:09,118
um and uh the

2443
01:59:05,118 --> 01:59:13,920
um the uh

2444
01:59:09,118 --> 01:59:16,078
downside is um is really not there um

2445
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:17,960
you know as long as you uh go through

2446
01:59:16,078 --> 01:59:20,198
that process um you're going to be

2447
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:22,158
putting wonderful nutrients again I'm

2448
01:59:20,198 --> 01:59:27,519
going to return to something we said in

2449
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:31,158
in um uh earlier in the interview and I

2450
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:37,440
just can't say enough do

2451
01:59:31,158 --> 01:59:39,839
not um add lib do not uh do not uh shoot

2452
01:59:37,439 --> 01:59:43,678
from the hip do not come up with your

2453
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:44,960
own IPO recipe um and that's where

2454
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:47,199
because that's the only way you could go

2455
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:49,800
wrong if you just try and hone in on

2456
01:59:47,198 --> 01:59:53,799
what we're talking about and um how to

2457
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:57,079
do it it's really excess ible and um

2458
01:59:53,800 --> 02:00:01,880
what I love about natural farming I I am

2459
01:59:57,078 --> 02:00:03,759
a I'm super nerd in um this stuff I love

2460
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:06,400
to learn about it there's a lot to learn

2461
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:09,920
about it

2462
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:12,759
um you don't have to know all the

2463
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:16,000
science to follow a

2464
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:18,639
recipe um you don't have to understand

2465
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:21,599
every detail and hold all of this in

2466
02:00:18,639 --> 02:00:24,239
your head and heart to have the benefit

2467
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:27,279
for your plans you just have to be good

2468
02:00:24,238 --> 02:00:30,279
at doing step one through four

2469
02:00:27,279 --> 02:00:34,118
and literally just experience the

2470
02:00:30,279 --> 02:00:37,198
benefit or experience the outcome of um

2471
02:00:34,118 --> 02:00:41,598
yeah the uh what nature is already doing

2472
02:00:37,198 --> 02:00:45,000
um nature um I love that it is more

2473
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:48,480
complex than uh we understand or than

2474
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:50,760
our understanding and at the same time

2475
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:52,959
you don't have to know a darn thing

2476
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:54,639
about the complexity of nature to walk

2477
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:57,679
up to an apple tree pick an apple and

2478
02:00:54,639 --> 02:01:00,440
eat it and say this is good it feeds me

2479
02:00:57,679 --> 02:01:02,039
so that's what we're doing here right on

2480
02:01:00,439 --> 02:01:03,919

2484
