2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,000
it has been debated since the beginning

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,638
of science whether who you are is seated

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,480
in the mind or the soul in fact the

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:17,439
debate gets muddled really quickly as

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,920
philosophers discuss if perhaps the mind

7
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:22,800
is in the soul or the adverse perhaps

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,439
idea of the soul is part of the mind

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,640
without any doubt whichever

10
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:29,359
interpretation you tend to lean towards

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,560
the physical squishy bioelectrical brain

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,719
is an essal part of the picture and an

13
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,479
essential part of however it is that we

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,239
function make lunch make inventions and

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,558

75
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,000
classes during the first set today we

76
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,120
will understand what neurogenesis

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
consists of and which can abono

78
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,439
encourage and support the creation of

79
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,199
new brain cells in the second set we

80
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,878
will learn about neuro protection and

81
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,759
how can avonoids help us keep the brain

82
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,000
cells we already have alive and

83
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,840
functioning and during the third set we

84
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,439
will focus specifically on cannabis

85
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,000
supplementation including dosing

86
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:00,519
protocols for folks interested in Health

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,560
and Longevity as well as canab patients

88
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,959
experiencing Alzheimer's disease and

89
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,560
dementia welcome to shaping fire

90
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,479
Satan I'm grateful to be here really

91
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,719
glad to have you so let's get right into

92
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,359
it you know when we say that kabid

93
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:19,919
causes

94
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,920
neurogenesis what exactly do we mean by

95
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:25,318
neurogenesis that CBD promotes the

96
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,400
creation of new brain

97
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:31,238
cells and is it is it all types of brain

98
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,640
cells or is it only particular varieties

99
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,959
of brain cells that canabidol can uh

100
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:40,279
cause to be

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,840
produced well I think we need to explain

102
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,239
what neurogenesis is and then break down

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,158
how CBD plays a role in this

104
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,080
process

105
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:54,199
please all right so if we're going to

106
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:57,079
break neurogenesis down into four

107
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:59,399
different I guess you could call them

108
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,079
stages and we're just we're you know

109
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,680
we're figuring this out it wasn't until

110
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:08,680
1965 that we found in the dentate gyus

111
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,040
of the hippoc Camus that neurogenesis

112
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,480
actually occurs so we've been doing a

113
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,280
lot since then to figure out how CBD can

114
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:18,639
play a role and look we're still

115
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,358
figuring out but if we were to begin to

116
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,759
address your question where these cells

117
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,319
multiply or begin to split is in the

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,479
pation

119
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,120
phase and that this might be a stretch

120
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,519
and I'm going to try to make an analogy

121
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,959
with cannabis because this takes a

122
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:38,680
similar amount of time for a cell a

123
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:41,799
neural stem cell to multiply and then

124
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,560
become a neuronal cell so in the

125
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,600
proliferation stage where these newborn

126
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,439
neuro stem cells and the hipocas begin

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,000
to multiply we could compare this to the

128
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:53,600
flower and tops of the cannabis plant

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,839
and these neural stem cells could be the

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,320
seeds inside this flower and top and

131
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,000
they begin to

132
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:03,360
multiply in about 2 weeks then this

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,918
integration stage takes place and that's

134
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,680
after say the seeds transverse to the

135
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,478
ground and these neuronal stem cells

136
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,879
migrate to certain areas within the

137
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:16,159
brain they begin to differentiate and

138
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:18,240
start to spread out their aons and

139
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,840
dendrites forming these neuronal like

140
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,600
projections and becoming more

141
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:25,638
specialized as a neuron aligo dendrite

142
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,680
or asite so that's sort of the phase

143
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:33,360
where they change their specific

144
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,240
function in the neurogenesis uh process

145
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,439
and that's very similar to say like a

146
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,600
cannabis seed sprouting in the ground

147
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:43,439
forming its roots and also beginning to

148
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,520
project its fan-like leaves up towards

149
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,800
the the

150
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,839
sunlight to receive photosynthesis and

151
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,600
also nutrition from the soil and then as

152
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,959
these neural cells differentiate they

153
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,800
actually start to receive communication

154
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,519
from other neuronal cells uh and

155
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,759
stabilize and begin attempting to

156
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,120
establish functional connections such as

157
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,919
receiving neurotransmitter signals as

158
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,360
well as trophic support which is the

159
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,038
feeding and nutrition and also pro-

160
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,319
survival factors which we'll talk a

161
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:13,360
little bit about throughout this

162
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:16,800
conversation such as blood to trive

163
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,360
neurobic factor neurog growth factor and

164
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,120
a couple other chemicals that float

165
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,598
around and sort of support this uh

166
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,560
maturation process and it ends up in the

167
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:28,240
best case scenario about 6 to8 weeks

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,720
which you might be able to educate me a

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,720
little bit more on which is in my uh

170
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,800
understanding is about the same amount

171
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,080
of time it takes a seed to turn into a

172
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,960
cannabis

173
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,478
plant so that make any sense oh six to

174
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,399
eight weeks for flowering probably

175
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,879
another four if you include veg but yeah

176
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,079
we're with you and and since we're

177
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,319
talking about time frames I'm really

178
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,399
surprised that there are like we're

179
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,000
looking at this

180
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:57,478
neurogenesis um timeline on a scale of

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,399
weeks the facts the fact that this um

182
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,318
this this you know this brain stem cell

183
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:04,159
cell gets created and then it takes time

184
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,520
to um you know split and mature and

185
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,960
migrate and then become the type of cell

186
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:16,079
it's going to be in my mind you know

187
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:18,079
when I see um uh you know illustrations

188
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,758
on on you know TV or the internet all

189
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,159
this stuff happens like really fast

190
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,240
right the thing just moves and goes and

191
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,360
it happens the fact that anything in the

192
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,680
brain might take you know two to four

193
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,879
weeks to develop and get to where it's

194
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:35,720
going seems like a glacier Pace to me

195
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,120
for the brain but you know uh I I'm I'm

196
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,599
a novice at at understanding um

197
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,519
Neuroscience right so it would make

198
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,839
sense that I would have some incorrect

199
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:47,359
expectations I mean but the

200
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,560
multiplication phase you know from my

201
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,360
research I can say that it happens quite

202
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,478
quickly where I'll see cells double or

203
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,639
triple within two to three days in the

204
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,399
lab um and that's probably the most

205
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,720
tangible thing that I can say as far as

206
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:05,878
being able to see it happen um in real

207
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,440
time versus reading about it so yeah

208
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,759
it's uh I think we're all learning about

209
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,478
the exact timeline of this I can imagine

210
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,199
as a research scientist that when you're

211
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:19,680
in the lab and you're visibly watching

212
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,759
these neuronal stem cells um splitting

213
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,478
over these two or three days that it's a

214
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,400
kind of exciting and B maybe even makes

215
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:28,839
you feel like you're having like kid

216
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:30,638
like oh these are my babies you know

217
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,278
these are my I you know I'm growing

218
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,759
these for research and I got to take

219
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,080
care of them and make sure they're fed

220
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,599
correctly and everything I would think

221
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,120
that that you would have a lot of um

222
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,800
like care emotions for them I don't know

223
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,679
maybe I'm anthropomorphizing too much

224
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,359
but I think I would care yeah I would

225
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,239
say so I'm sort of my life is sort of

226
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,039
dictated by them uh I don't really have

227
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,278
a schedule my schedule is based off of

228
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,958
the cell growth and um and also if I

229
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,958
decide to differentiate them that's

230
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,958
another 48 hours with certain chemicals

231
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:03,518
so yeah yeah the fact that they run your

232
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,479
life is making them sound more like

233
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,679
kids all right so let me get you back

234
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,600
into your timeline so so we we've under

235
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,120
we've understood what happens you know

236
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,639
regularly so um I think where you were

237
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,759
going next was um what adding uh

238
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:22,240
canabidol CBD to this interaction does

239
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:24,879
to uh encourage it probably yes so we'll

240
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,399
talk first about the indirect way and

241
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:30,278
then the direct way so the indirect way

242
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,039
that CBD can help in the proliferation

243
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:36,519
phase and the multiplication phase is by

244
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:39,000
increasing anandamide which is the Bliss

245
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:43,159
molecule that is an endogenous

246
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,799
canabo and it does this by sort of

247
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:49,559
blocking fa or fatty acid amide hydrase

248
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,759
which is an enzyme that breaks down the

249
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:55,039
mahide and

250
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,039
aide has the ability to bind to the CB1

251
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,719
and the CB2 receptor which has been

252
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,799
shown to promote cell proliferation M so

253
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,639
that's in the first phase so I would say

254
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:08,919
the

255
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:11,838
CBD you know has its way to sort of tone

256
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:13,639
up the endoc canabo system to promote

257
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,040
the first stage of

258
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,958
neurogenesis and then CBD can influence

259
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,639
cell

260
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:24,639
peripher directly by binding to the

261
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,838
transient poent potential vanilla loid

262
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,519
type one or let's just call these things

263
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:33,200
trpv1 receptor and the 58 t1a receptor

264
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,879
which is the serotonin receptor which is

265
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,360
demonstrated to help you know the cell

266
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:41,278
proliferation is also also blood derived

267
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,560
neutop factor which uh CBD can also

268
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,159
promote not only helps with cell

269
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:49,039
proliferation but also with the

270
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,240
activation of uh the

271
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,639
differentiation and also helping the

272
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,959
dendra complexity which would form into

273
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,839
the maturation f as well as synaptic

274
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,799
formation and plasticity of these

275
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,600
newborn neurons

276
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:05,278
so through these

277
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,159
trpv1 receptors the 5 ht1a receptors and

278
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:12,159
the blood derived neut Tropic sort of

279
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:15,360
promotion it has different stages of uh

280
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,958
helping the neurogenesis process that

281
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,919
was a great explanation I really enjoy

282
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:23,439
having hardcore research scientists who

283
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:26,679
are in the lab all the time on the show

284
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,680
because you know the fine mechanics and

285
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:30,559
and we're really interested in that and

286
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,359
and we're trying to figure it out it's

287
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,199
really complicated well yeah I mean we

288
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,959
all know that the science is active

289
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,680
right but it's it's it's a lot different

290
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:41,039
than talking to um a lay person who will

291
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:43,159
give you the story of how it happens

292
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,039
like like when patients talk to me right

293
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:46,759
like like I I might be able to describe

294
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,439
those three things happening but I'm not

295
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:50,559
going to have the Mastery of the

296
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,200
language like you have that I think just

297
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,199
makes us all feel like a bit more

298
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,120
confident that that we're learning the

299
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,320
good stuff right so so I appreciate that

300
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,320
so so as far as thinking about those

301
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,839
those those three um those three ways

302
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,079
that that canabidol supports

303
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,800
neurogenesis um is it is it a fair model

304
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,638
to think that what what happens when we

305
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:17,000
take CBD is we are essentially like

306
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,000
turning up the governor on the engine a

307
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,559
little bit because your brain will

308
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,759
naturally do these three processes but

309
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:29,719
when you add CBD it makes the whole

310
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:32,559
process happen um with more G

311
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,560
and and so like maybe maybe quicker and

312
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:39,239
more yeah that's a a good way to look at

313
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:41,239
it I was going to explain it as a if you

314
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,278
if you play guitar so you're like tuning

315
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,399
your guitar um while the chords of each

316
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:47,559
the guitar or while the strings of each

317
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,120
guitar actually you're on a different

318
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:52,679
note when you tune them correctly and

319
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,919
you play that note that sound travels

320
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:58,399
with more precision and actually has a

321
00:12:54,919 --> 00:13:00,719
chord or a a tone and so I would say

322
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:05,919
that c C BD helps with the

323
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:08,000
overall uh tone of neurogenesis ah so by

324
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,879
your description what then one of the

325
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,399
things that CB does is increase the

326
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,838
efficiency of this whole thing yep got

327
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,078
it because all these things are

328
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,720
happening regardless of with CBD in or

329
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:20,278
out of the body by putting it in like

330
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,839
you said to rev up the engine it's

331
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:26,958
actually like turning up the the volume

332
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:29,399
slightly through a coordination of

333
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:33,078
events I get it so

334
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,958
everybody is where they need to be when

335
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:37,159
the performance starts and everybody's

336
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,799
got all the resources they need so the

337
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:43,480
whole manufacturing team is just

338
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:44,359
efficient and ready to go y got it so um

339
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,320
you

340
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:53,278
know when we talk about neurogenesis in

341
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:56,320
the um cannabis World um we're we're

342
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,240
usually exclusively talking about CBD

343
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,160
because that's what most people are

344
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,240
familiar with with as a cannabinoid that

345
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,679
causes

346
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,000
neurogenesis um but I know that we're

347
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:09,919
continuing of course to expand our

348
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,360
research to other novel canabo um are we

349
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,278
familiar with any other cannabinoids

350
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,759
that cause neurogenesis in addition to

351
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:22,078
CBD

352
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:24,919
yet yeah I would go with uh Delta 9 THC

353
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,919
as the

354
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,639
other major phyto canabo that has been

355
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:35,519
recognized IED as a promoter of

356
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:38,959
neurogenesis in alignment with its

357
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:42,959
function like anandamide and its ability

358
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:46,239
to have an affinity to that CB1 CB2

359
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:48,799
receptor which along with that brain

360
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,560
derived neut Tropic factor is what

361
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,559
causes that first stage of neurogenesis

362
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:58,239
and in a r model I think it was around

363
00:14:54,559 --> 00:15:01,399
1.5 milligrams a kilo which they called

364
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,159
uh somewhat lower dose acute and

365
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,519
chronically ministered for a certain

366
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:07,919
amount of time they did show that it

367
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,679
enhanced neurogenesis cognitive function

368
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,240
and

369
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:15,039
performance and so if we looked at the

370
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,720
sort of function of Delta 9 THC i' maybe

371
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,639
extend that maybe it's a bit of a

372
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,360
stretch to Delta 8 because it does have

373
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:25,839
some binding ability to CB1 and CB2 and

374
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,120
maybe even CBN which even has a lesser

375
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,160
degree of binding ability to those two

376
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,959
receptors

377
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,719
so when we're when we're looking at the

378
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,919
other

379
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:43,519
um uh significant

380
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:47,159
neurogenesis agent in in D9 THC um is it

381
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:50,639
essentially um helping

382
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:54,360
neurogenesis in the same three areas of

383
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:58,278
process as the CBD or is it mostly just

384
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:01,759
at the first step since both CBD and D9

385
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:04,318
t TC are acting on the anandamide which

386
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,159
which helps that first step is is THC

387
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:08,078
helping all the way in the all the way

388
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,679
down the line in those three different

389
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:14,120
time frames like CBD does or is it

390
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:16,799
really mostly just there at the

391
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,799
beginning it's a good question I would

392
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,000
have to look into you know how much

393
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,078
Delta 9 plays a role in differentiation

394
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,480
and integration as well as the

395
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,879
maturation of the brain cell I think

396
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,480
that could get into some of that contra

397
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:35,720
versial application of uh THC in time

398
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,800
frames in life but my guess would be yes

399
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,759
it does play a role in the development

400
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:44,278
of the brain cell interesting all right

401
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,440
so um let's let's switch sides of the

402
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,679
equation here so so up to this point

403
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,800
we've been talking about the the you

404
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:55,359
know the CBD and THC helping and and and

405
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:59,639
making this neurogenesis process more

406
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:03,360
efficient and more robust um these these

407
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:06,199
these neuronal um stem cells that split

408
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,919
split split and then they mature and

409
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,839
then they migrate to where they're going

410
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,280
to become the kind of cell they're

411
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:18,198
they're going to become

412
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:22,160
um Can these neuronal stem cells um turn

413
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:24,679
into any sort of cell in the brain or

414
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,959
are they only particular

415
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:30,480
flavors when you mean particular cell of

416
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:34,679
the brain they can become a neuronal

417
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:38,599
cell an alod dendrite or an astroy from

418
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:41,559
my understanding and to a certain degree

419
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:44,159
different areas of the brain uh I think

420
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,319
it was we just recently saw how this

421
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,440
this kind of occur in the hypothalamus

422
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,839
the Statum the substantia Negra and I

423
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,279
think we're finding maybe some more

424
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,678
areas of the brain where this does occur

425
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:58,558
all right on that is a good answer and

426
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,798
and I'm also going to change my question

427
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,678
a little bit to get at something a

428
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:04,720
little different which is um what if I

429
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:09,200
were to change the question and say are

430
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:13,400
there any brain cells that cannot be

431
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,400
replaced by this neurogenesis that we

432
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,400
described like areas of the brain that

433
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,519
can happen yeah the idea what I'm what

434
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,120
I'm trying to get to is that you know

435
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:24,359
neurogenesis is great and if it can

436
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:26,519
replace all the parts of our brain

437
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,759
that's even cooler but if there are some

438
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,879
parts of our brain that that just can

439
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:33,558
never benefit from neurogenesis I'd be

440
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,440
curious to know what it is yeah that's a

441
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,639
good question and I can't answer that

442
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,720
specifically but I have hope that the

443
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,440
answer is yes okay fair enough fair

444
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,200
enough and you know and and this is what

445
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,880
happens when we do an interview on the

446
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,960
edge of of the science we know right so

447
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,440
we're probably going to run into some

448
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,440
stuff like

449
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,960
that okay so if if we're clear now that

450
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,279
uh CBD and THC can help along the

451
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,640
neurogenesis and and we know that

452
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:06,399
neurogenesis can uh replace an entire

453
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:10,400
variety of uh of of different types of

454
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:14,280
of of brain cells um uh I want to look

455
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,320
at a potential um other limiting factors

456
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,720
that could slow down this neurogenesis

457
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,678
since kind of the point of today is what

458
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,839
is neurogenesis and how can we you know

459
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:26,440
encourage it right so so um are there

460
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:28,480
other inputs and and there might be too

461
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,880
many to mention I'm open to this but but

462
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:36,279
are there other inputs that need to be

463
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:40,000
present um uh that um if not present is

464
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:45,000
going to reduce the ability of canabidol

465
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,640
and THC to do this um increase of

466
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,519
efficiency an increase in robustness of

467
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,559
this process and and and what I imagine

468
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:58,400
you might say is oh it needs this

469
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,879
particular um brain chemical 5htp and so

470
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,200
you know we encouraged people to take

471
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,799
supplements to also encourage

472
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:09,640
neurogenesis along with the CBD and

473
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:12,599
THC I think the easiest way to answer

474
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,840
that would be Health oh right on whole

475
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:18,439
food diet but

476
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:21,558
but let's uh break Health down into

477
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,360
three categories we'll start with oxygen

478
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:26,079
which you know we we got to have that

479
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,719
you hold your breath and you eventually

480
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,038
no brain cells will be doing much

481
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,960
anymore

482
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:35,720
uh next thing we need is hydration or

483
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:38,319
h2o or you know water and uh nutrients

484
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,679
and so more specifically when we sort of

485
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,200
say okay well we can get air and water

486
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,120
we sort of take that a little bit for

487
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,319
granted hopefully it's both clean air

488
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:48,239
and water and we get into nutrients I

489
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,839
would say probably the number one would

490
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,679
be longchain fatty acids particularly

491
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:57,119
Omega-3s play a a pretty good role in uh

492
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:59,480
some of these processes that promote

493
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,000
neurogenesis the second one would be

494
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,319
polyenals

495
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,759
uh more specifically

496
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:08,879
flavonoids and then the third would be a

497
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,919
healthy microbiome and we we can get

498
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,200
into those three if you'd like and what

499
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:16,520
supplements maybe would be best if that

500
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,798
wasn't part of your whole food diet

501
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:21,879
approach right on let's hold on uh on

502
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:24,000
that that next protocol question and

503
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,919
like what and how much to take for the

504
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,240
third set cuz I've got that I got that

505
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,919
sitting down there to talk about so all

506
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:35,798
right so um so assuming all these

507
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:41,000
components are in place um do we know

508
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:43,720
about a dosage threshold for uh CBD to

509
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,119
cause neurogenesis essentially how much

510
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,720
do we need to take for this process to

511
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:52,199
be improved at

512
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,960
all oh well I think most of our research

513
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,038
that could get around a dosage comes

514
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,079
from either inv vitro which means

515
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:05,919
cellular or inv Vivo which is basically

516
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:08,038
rrap models and if I was to condense

517
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,240
everything I've read up to this point it

518
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:14,919
would be around 3 to 10 millgram per

519
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:19,079
kilogram and that becomes pretty hard to

520
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:22,038
translate in a human due to the

521
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:24,960
bioavailability and uh as well as where

522
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:27,240
we're at with understanding how it even

523
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,640
interacts different inside the human

524
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,000
versus

525
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,400
other uh

526
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,759
creatures um me meaning that um you can

527
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,679
make this guesstimate based on the lab

528
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:44,679
science but but you just doing like a

529
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:48,080
quick scale up based on your experience

530
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:49,400
you're saying upfront that it would be

531
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,480
hard to defend this number because we

532
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:56,960
don't really know yet correct okay got

533
00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:00,319
it but CBD is a a relatively safe

534
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,720
molecule so it's

535
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,960
therapeutic range is probably going to

536
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,558
be best

537
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:12,679
uh gauge at what condition you might be

538
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:15,038
trying to use it for um and I think the

539
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,640
idea of using it for neurogenesis is

540
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,960
really unexplored especially in humans

541
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,200
so we we have

542
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,720
to you know Traverse slowly with that

543
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,278
recommendation yeah I I I understand

544
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,679
that I mean that's one of the reasons

545
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:32,200
why I I it took so long me for me to

546
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,440
find you and hunt you down in Australia

547
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,159
right there's just not a lot of people

548
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,600
who are doing this particular work that

549
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:43,039
you're working on um around canabo and

550
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,639
neurogenesis um you know uh I'm going to

551
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,000
ask you a quick math question just

552
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,919
because you play with these numbers all

553
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,919
the time um but you know the 3 to 10

554
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:54,080
milligrams per kilogram a day you know

555
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,480
the very rough guest mid that you gave

556
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,079
do you have an idea of how many

557
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,558
milligrams a day that is for say

558
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:01,480
somebody who's 50 lbs we don't do metric

559
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,440
here so I haven't gone back and forth

560
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,599
between you know I think that's around

561
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:10,278
about 70 kilos so you say that upper

562
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:13,278
threshold times 10 700 milligrams a day

563
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:15,319
cool thank you ler threshold let's just

564
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,400
say you weigh more and make the numbers

565
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:20,720
easier say you weigh 100 kilos and 3

566
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,919
milligram dosage would be on the lower

567
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:27,159
end around 300 uh I think a recent study

568
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,600
just came out that synthesized all the

569
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:30,960
literature that they've done in human

570
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:35,519
studies and said the safe dose is around

571
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,519
60 to 100 milligrams per day

572
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,759
so 60 to 100 milligrams per day when we

573
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:43,879
were talking about 300 to 700 yeah

574
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,038
that's more the therapeutic range I see

575
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:49,440
I see yeah so we talk a lot here on

576
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:53,440
shaping fire about the compare and

577
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:56,080
contrast between um isolates and whole

578
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,720
plant medicine and you know anybody who

579
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:01,319
listens to to the show knows knows that

580
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,240
uh I'm no I'm no stranger to be pushing

581
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:05,960
whole plant medicine versus isolates

582
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,399
while while definitely also

583
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,640
understanding that isolates have their

584
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:11,678
place for example if you need a novel

585
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,640
cannabinoid and it makes sense for you

586
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,399
to spike your your Canabis oil because

587
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,520
you're you need a canabo that's very

588
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:21,000
hard for you to get or to grow or

589
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,480
something like that um like like many of

590
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,558
us did in the early days before we had

591
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,798
access to CBD plants but we could get

592
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:30,558
CBD isolate from Europe um

593
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:33,200
and and I and I also know that most of

594
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:35,519
these studies are using isolates because

595
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,919
the studies um you know are they're

596
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,558
looking to set up future

597
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,399
pharmacology and they want the isolates

598
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,119
so that they can you know reproduce

599
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:47,959
their results and also it's just you

600
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,839
know a lot easier and and less um I

601
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,159
don't know sloppy to work with isets

602
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:56,158
than it is trying to deal with you know

603
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:59,559
a a direct whole plant resin all of that

604
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,200
said we also know that you know we're

605
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:04,798
big Believers in the Entourage effect

606
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,679
and the fact that having you know groups

607
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,720
of various canabo together they they

608
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,278
they act synergistically with each other

609
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,720
um so that everybody can do their job

610
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,480
better so all this just sets up this

611
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,798
question

612
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:27,440
um do you think that you would get um a

613
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:30,879
a a better play from your CBD if you're

614
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,840
um taking it in a whole plant cannabis

615
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,159
oil you know commonly known to as like

616
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:38,599
an RSO or something or do you find

617
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,159
there's or or from your research would

618
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,439
you expect there's not going to be any

619
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,278
difference between the isolate and the

620
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,278
whole plant or perhaps even it's it's

621
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:47,240
favoring the isolate which will make me

622
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,599
cry but I'll believe

623
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,798
you I mean that's a that's a big

624
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,398
question but we'll go with uh let's just

625
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:58,319
look at CBD as a molecule first so we

626
00:26:54,398 --> 00:27:00,918
could call that an isolate or CBD and

627
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:03,200
what we've learned on a molecular

628
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:06,278
functional level has mostly to do with

629
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,519
the isolate so if we were to say that's

630
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:11,599
you know

631
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:14,558
the the backbone and we were to go whole

632
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:17,359
plant uh that it we maybe have to look

633
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:19,720
at extraction methods and what is in

634
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,918
that uh whole plant extract but let's

635
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,759
say that whole plant extract could be

636
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,240
broken down

637
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:30,759
into uh CBD

638
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,399
maybe some small small amounts of other

639
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:37,759
canabo tpin which could be you know

640
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:39,639
quite a few maybe can Flav 15 something

641
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,319
and then you have your can of flavens on

642
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,200
top of that

643
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:48,359
and each of those has a little bit of a

644
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:51,120
role in therapeutic uh targets so I

645
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:53,199
would you know I'm a I'm a whole plant

646
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,839
um promoter as well I would think you

647
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,798
would get a some sort of synergistic

648
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:01,519
effect from a whole whole plant extract

649
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:04,359
and then we can get into maybe the

650
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:07,000
bioavailability that it would enhance uh

651
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:09,759
because tpin do play a role in you know

652
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,159
enhancing the bioavailability of

653
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:15,480
cannaboids that's interesting so so um

654
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,919
we would think that the the the the

655
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,240
whole resin preparation um would just

656
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:24,480
you know join with our body systems at a

657
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,159
at an easier and less frictitious rate

658
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,759
than a straight icelet would I think so

659
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:33,399
I think our body would be able to handle

660
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:35,599
it more intelligently cuz that's if we

661
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:38,278
were to look at the you know the maybe

662
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:42,398
the potential of 10,000 years

663
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:44,200
of co-evolution with the plant and the

664
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:47,038
fact that we could have been using this

665
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,360
plant for that long then our body would

666
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,158
have more of an intelligence with it as

667
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:54,959
a whole plant extract than an isolate

668
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,840
right on so we have seen like an

669
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,558
observationally in patients with severe

670
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:01,519
epilepsy there have been notable

671
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:04,319
improvements with far lower doses of CBD

672
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,319
extract than purified CBD so there is a

673
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:09,599
little bit of uh clinical research

674
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:12,359
around that uh but not yet with

675
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,759
neurogenesis right on great thank you um

676
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:16,158
all right one more question before we go

677
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,960
to break and and and this one is kind of

678
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,919
a corollary question but doesn't really

679
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,759
stem from the last one so so we've been

680
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,080
talking about this neurogenesis process

681
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:28,720
that we like to uh you know turn up the

682
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:31,158
volume on by taking CBD and and THC and

683
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,038
so everything is happening more robustly

684
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:35,320
and um um I was going to say

685
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:39,640
aggressively it's probably not the right

686
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:43,439
word but robustly um I'm assuming that

687
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,000
there are some either

688
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,159
um

689
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,440
um resources the brain may need or

690
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:54,480
damage that may have occurred to the

691
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,519
brain that is impeding

692
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,278
neurogenesis that not even adding

693
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:03,159
canabidol can overcome and so what I'm

694
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:07,079
specifically looking for are any

695
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:10,440
suggestions you might have of of um you

696
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:14,798
know pre-existing damage to the brain

697
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,798
that might block CBD from doing its job

698
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:21,398
because that that brain issue is

699
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:25,200
actually shutting down the the neuro

700
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:27,839
Genesis in ways that the CBD cannot

701
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,759
overcome yeah I think that's when we

702
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,480
start getting into or this leads into

703
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:36,440
Alzheimer's disease you know once you

704
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:41,278
get beyond that point of dindra and uh

705
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:43,038
axonal breakage there isn't much of a

706
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,000
chance that anything is going to save

707
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,440
that neuronal cell and if we look that

708
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,599
as a collective hole or a neuronal

709
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,558
circuitry uh connection line and a

710
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:55,439
certain amount of it gets broken down

711
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,678
then you know the chances of recovery

712
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,399
are going to be pretty minimal to that

713
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:04,320
circuit uh so getting on board sooner

714
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:07,278
rather than later would make CBD more

715
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:09,759
beneficial right on now um I know your

716
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,638
specialty is more in Alzheimer's which

717
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:15,519
will be talking about at more length

718
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:17,558
later um but the the other disease that

719
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,919
I'm often talking to patients about that

720
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:23,158
involves neurogenesis is

721
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,440
Parkinson's and um you know I i' I've

722
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,278
been told by scientists you know just

723
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,558
you know standing at conferences and

724
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:33,000
stuff that that one of the reasons why

725
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:35,879
CBD helps Parkinson's patients is

726
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,919
because it causes neurogenesis because a

727
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,760
good deal of the impact from Parkinson

728
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,960
is because they are losing their

729
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:46,638
dopamine excreting neurons and and uh

730
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,079
that's a one-way trip if there's not

731
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:53,000
neurogenesis and so CBD is causing more

732
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:56,038
of these um these brain cells to come

733
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,558
into existence which um kind of like

734
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:02,519
holds the line on the Parkinson's to

735
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,678
hold it from from getting worse a do you

736
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:07,359
have any point of reference on this to

737
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:12,399
speak to it and and and

738
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:14,479
B does uh is that process potentially

739
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:17,879
similar like to the one that we just

740
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,919
described um around um

741
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:25,278
Alzheimer's yeah if we were looking at

742
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:28,080
um a level of dopa

743
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:30,119
majeric neurons and their ability to

744
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,759
produce dopamine which I just kind of

745
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:36,000
recently learned about 80% of

746
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,158
Parkinson's is is due to the lack of

747
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,638
dopamine and due to the lack of the

748
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,278
dopamine producing neurons so if we

749
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:43,439
could create more of these neurons

750
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:45,599
technically we could create more

751
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,960
dopamine and effectively treat

752
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,079
Parkinson's disease and Parkinson

753
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,960
disease also has a protein very similar

754
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,158
to Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's

755
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,759
disease the main pathological Hallmark

756
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,919
is ameloid beta and in Parkinson's it's

757
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:03,440
Alpha nucleon and CBD has shown or

758
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:06,080
demonstrated in preclinical research

759
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,519
that it stops the aggregation not

760
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,798
completely but it will help aument some

761
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:14,278
of the aggregation of these two proteins

762
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:16,558
that create quite a toxic environment

763
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:18,480
extracellularly which affects their

764
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,480
function and eventually creates cell

765
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,679
death or you

766
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,639
know the no longer functioning neurons

767
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,200
which connect to each other and create a

768
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:29,879
communication line throughout the brain

769
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,200
wow that's really interesting all right

770
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,120
cool well thank you for that ston um

771
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,399
let's go ahead and take our first of two

772
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:38,119
short breaks and we'll be right back you

00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,759
extraordinarily complex not only are you

780
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,679
adding the nitrogen phosphorus and

781
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,200

which further enhance nutrient

791
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:22,358
availability for the plants because

792
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:24,639
plants are limited by the absence of any

essential micronutrient these Trace

794

00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,880
avoid the use of chemical pesticides

828
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:48,799
when cultivating cannabis beneficial

829
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,838
insects have been used for decades by

830
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,280
the greenhouse vegetable and ornamental

831
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:55,039
plant industry and today many cannabis

832
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,920
cultivators are moving from sprays and

833
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:00,599
chemicals to beneficial insects

to reach people through advertising we

868
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,640
all know though that trying to reach a

869
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:26,078
cannabis audience with a quality message

870
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:29,159
is pretty difficult that's why many

871
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,920
people to advertise on the shaping fire

872
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:33,719
podcast advertising on this show allows

873
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,119
us time to talk about your product

874
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:38,399
service or brand in a way that really

875
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:41,640
lets people know what sets your company

876
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,599
apart from others bold people who own

877
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:45,639
companies know that getting into

878
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:49,000
relationship with their customers is

879
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:51,239
essential and that is what we offer we

880
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,280
will explain your service or product

881
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:57,039
what sets it apart as desirable and help

882
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,200
our audience get in contact with you

883
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,318
it's pretty simple really advertising

884
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:04,879
does not have to be all whizbang smoke

885
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:07,480
and mirrors nowadays I find that people

886
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,200
prefer just to be spoken to calmly

887
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,400
accurately and with good intentions if

888
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:14,159
you want to make your own commercial

889
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,400
spot well you can do that too during

890
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:18,239
these pandemic days conventions and

891
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,519
cannabis events are pretty poorly

892
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:23,799
attended but podcast listening is

893
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:25,719
skyrocketing with a commercial unshaping

894
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,318
fire you'll reach your customers in the

895

privacy of their headphones right now

and will continue to reach new listeners

catalog of episodes again and again for

899
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:42,239
years a spot on shaping fire costs less

900
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:44,519
than a printed postcard per person and

901

welcome back you are listening to

909
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,318
shaping fire I am your host Shango Los

910
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,960
and my guest today is phyto canabo

911
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:14,719
researcher State and laws so during the

912
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,079
first set we we brought ourselves to an

913
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:20,559
understanding of what neurogenesis is

914
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:23,240
and how CBD and THC and to a lesser

915
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:27,159
degree some other cannabinoids we think

916
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:30,399
um encourage and cause neurogen genis to

917
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:32,838
be uh more robust now here in set two

918
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,680
we're going to start talking about not

919
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:39,279
how to uh make these new um brain cells

920
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,559
we're going to talk about how to protect

921
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,079
the ones we've got so um so ston you

922
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:48,838
know let's move on from neurogenesis

923
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:52,839
which components of cannabis resin can

924
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:55,159
be considered neuro protectants and can

925
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:58,400
you give us a general definition of what

926
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,399
that means

927
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:06,400
yep so if we get back to that ability to

928
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:08,519
protect a neuronal cell from um cell

929
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,599
death or from

930
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:14,480
misfunctioning there are many

931
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,640
different constituents or chemicals

932
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,920
inside the cannabis plant that could be

933
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:23,318
made into a cannabis resin that will

934
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,920
protect neuronal cells from things like

935
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:26,920
the inflammatory

936
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,800
response and

937
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,240
uh free radicals such as reactive oxygen

938
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:35,280
species so they can either act as an

939
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:38,598
anti-inflammatory compound or an

940
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,519
antioxidant to protect neuronal

941
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:44,119
cells that actually when you when put

942
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:46,318
that when put that way you know the fact

943
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,280
that they are components of cannabis

944
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,199
resin that decrease inflammation and

945
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,839
free radicals that's a lot of different

946
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:55,159
stuff

947
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:57,719
actually yeah that's uh that's the the

948
00:40:55,159 --> 00:41:00,559
characterization of of one compound and

949
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:04,159
its ability to do multiple things in

950
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:06,318
different systems or places in the body

951
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,000
so so whereas when it comes to

952
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:11,440
neurogenesis looking at the variety of

953
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,679
all the components of the resin you know

954
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:18,079
it's it's primarily CBD certainly some

955
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:19,838
amount THC maybe a bit a few others but

956
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,440
when we talk about

957
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:25,920
neuroprotection um cannabis resonance is

958
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,800
just essentially a soup of of good

959
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,280
things that actually protect our brain

960
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,920
in various

961
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:36,000
ways um yeah I me if we start with the

962
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:40,599
545 identified compounds and we break

963
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,800
that into 140 tpin 104 cannabinoids 26

964
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:45,838
flavonoids 20 steroids and a whole bunch

965
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,359
of ligin sban stilbenoids and who the

966
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,559
hell knows what else we're finding

967
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:52,719
inside this in the next 20 years uh and

968
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:55,279
then we're mapping out their uh

969
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,199
potential to be neuroprotective uh

970
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,240
through all the different mechan

971
00:41:56,199 --> 00:42:01,799
mechanisms it gets really complex really

972
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:04,519
quickly but as a a blob uh cannabis

973
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,839
resin I think we we've got a few few

974
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:08,318
things we can

975
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:11,318
discuss um it seems to me like this

976
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:13,440
would be very uh since there are so many

977
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:14,639
uh participants in neuroprotection I

978
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,400
would think that it would be hard to

979
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:18,039
research them because you got to tease

980
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,599
them apart and they're all working

981
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:26,719
together in very high numbers and

982
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:29,720
symbiotically yeah yeah um all right so

983
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:32,039
so when I asked you you know what are

984
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:33,598
they protecting us from essentially the

985
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:35,960
the first two you mentioned was

986
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,200
inflammation and and free radicals is

987
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,039
that just like a huge bucket that that

988
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:41,719
holds just about everything or are there

989
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:43,920
a couple others that you could check off

990
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,919
for

991
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:50,200
us uh we can maybe if you want to talk a

992
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:53,318
little bit about the mechanisms but if

993
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:56,598
we were to look into diseases and what

994
00:42:53,318 --> 00:43:00,039
type of proteins might be causing the

995
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:02,920
inflammatory responses and free radicals

996
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:06,599
we could look at uh for Alzheimer's

997
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,960
disease amid beta and tal which are two

998
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:13,000
proteins that are forming to create

999
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,960
inflammation and free radicals on the

1000
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
inside the cell and also inflammation

1001
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,920
outside the cell and how CBD can play a

1002
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,519
role in reducing inflammation and also

1003
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,280
uh helping with

1004
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:30,838
the maybe even endogenous ability so the

1005
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:36,079
cell's ability to uh deal with these

1006
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:38,759
free radicals mhm um these

1007
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,960
um the

1008
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,000
the I don't like putting all I don't

1009
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,240
like putting like Alzheimer's and

1010
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,960
Dementia all in the in the same basket

1011
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:49,639
and I I don't like to generalize them so

1012
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:54,199
I guess I'll just stick with Alzheimer's

1013
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:56,558
um um do we understand um the

1014
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:58,679
functioning at this point of of

1015
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:01,839
Alzheimer's in the brain where we are

1016
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:05,960
able to get down to the specific

1017
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:07,880
mechanisms that um of cannabis neuro

1018
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,838
protection that's working you kind of

1019
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,720
you gave me a little a little bait there

1020
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:14,719
with the mechanism and and honestly if

1021
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:16,118
if you can make it um understandable to

1022
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,959
some degree to a lay person I'd like you

1023
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:21,680
to go through

1024
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:25,159
that yeah so if we looked at a protein

1025
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:28,799
in the brain that forms naturally amid

1026
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:30,000
beta is a naturally forming protein it

1027
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,519
it's just part

1028
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,599
of everybody everybody's got some of

1029
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:37,880
that floating around in the

1030
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:40,039
brain what happens is it begins to

1031
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,800
Aggregate and when it Aggregates it sort

1032
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:44,759
of clumps together and forms a plaque

1033
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,640
and when too many of these plaques build

1034
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:51,280
up inside the brain they begin to form

1035
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:53,519
inflammation they also begin to irritate

1036
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,559
the cells and they form reactive oxygen

1037
00:44:53,519 --> 00:45:00,719
species lipid peroxidation

1038
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:03,599
now one mechanism that uh

1039
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,199
CBD and some of the other turpins can do

1040
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:09,119
is actually

1041
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:13,000
to stop the aggregation of this protein

1042
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:15,800
therefore it will reduce the Cascade of

1043
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:20,280
negative effects from this protein by

1044
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:22,839
just becoming an anti- agory

1045
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,440
agent therefore protecting the cells

1046
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:27,239
from cell death either from an

1047
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:30,599
inflammatory Cascade

1048
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:33,439
of chemicals or from an over production

1049
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:35,000
of reactive oxygen species It All Leads

1050
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,920
to cell

1051
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,599
death all right um I've got two kind of

1052
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:44,280
corollary questions the first corollary

1053
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:49,838
question is um if if

1054
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:52,079
inflammation is um trying to inhibit um

1055
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:53,279
neurogenesis and by using cannabis we're

1056
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,599
decreasing the

1057
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,720
inflammation and and helping the

1058
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:00,440
neurogenesis you know I talk with so

1059
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:03,039
many patients that have got all these

1060
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:06,480
different inflammatory diseases from you

1061
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:08,239
know autoimmune and rheumatoid arthritis

1062
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,440
and you know just like you just like

1063
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:12,000
there's a whole list of these

1064
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:16,639
inflammatory diseases that are so common

1065
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:19,480
in our modern world are um will this

1066
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:23,159
body inflammation also be likely

1067
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:25,400
presenting in the brain and and you know

1068
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:27,199
the the rheumatoid arthritis patient

1069
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:30,519
with all the body inflammation and all

1070
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:33,358
their joints is probably also having a

1071
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:34,838
difficult time uh with neurogenesis but

1072
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:37,400
that's just not the part that's usually

1073
00:46:34,838 --> 00:46:40,159
talked about in their

1074
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,079
disease yeah it's a really complex one

1075
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:45,598
uh yeah I would say that if there are

1076
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:48,480
targets inside certain cell families or

1077
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,200
on the cell inside cell families that

1078
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,318
are the same similar Targets in the

1079
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:57,399
brain cells then we could say like one

1080
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:59,880
target that CBDs Prett pretty good at uh

1081
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:05,440
activating is the

1082
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:08,119
pp gamma uh receptor which once it's hit

1083
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,559
it sort of blocks this Cascade of

1084
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:13,000
pro-inflammatory Mo molecules such as

1085
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,880
you know like the tumor necrosis Factor

1086
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,920
Alpha the interlukin one and all these

1087
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:21,079
other cyto released which you know this

1088
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,119
does it is fueled by ameloid Beta but

1089
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:25,200
there are other factors that go on in

1090
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,640
different sort of areas of the body

1091
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:30,960
where this could be a target for CBD to

1092
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:33,879
reduce this inflammation um you know for

1093
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,000
a lot of lay folks um you know

1094
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,880
neuroprotection and

1095
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,480
neuroplasticity for a lot of folks are

1096
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,240
like synonymous and they kind of use

1097
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,880
them

1098
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:45,679
interchangeably um uh how much truth is

1099
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,318
there to that and and if they're not the

1100
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,679
same thing which I'm assuming they're

1101
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:51,318
not um would you explain what

1102
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:54,440
neuroplasticity

1103
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:56,400
is I can give it my best attempt with

1104
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:00,480
saying neuroplastic

1105
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:05,039
is the ability for the brain to

1106
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:07,679
communicate in a simple way so it's like

1107
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:10,199
a uh

1108
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,159
this communication that we're using

1109
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:15,000
right now on the phone if it gets real

1110
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:16,799
staticky then it's not very plastic

1111
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,079
We're Not Making Connections we're not

1112
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,160
communicating but if it's clear then

1113
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:24,039
we're having some good neuroplasticity

1114
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:27,078
which would involve function would

1115
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:29,440
involve uh communic it would also

1116
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:31,960
involve being able

1117
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,240
to you know because even cells can sort

1118
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:38,039
of change their shape to allow them

1119
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:41,199
to communicate better which might even

1120
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:43,759
fall in the form of resilience or

1121
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:46,919
neuroplasticity so I'd say it's function

1122
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:51,559
communication and adaption to different

1123
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:53,960
things that we learn or you

1124
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:56,519
know I guess we're still trying to map

1125
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,000
that one out but if the cell is healthy

1126
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:01,000
it's going to function better therefore

1127
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,559
it will be more plastic or neur

1128
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,559
neuroplastic using layman's terms I can

1129
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:09,079
see how canabidol would add to

1130
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,319
neuroplasticity since we often think of

1131
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:14,960
CBD as a signaling molecule and if at

1132
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:17,079
the heart of neuroplasticity is

1133
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,039
community communication and the ability

1134
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:22,720
to communicate you know throughout the

1135
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:26,318
cells it would seem that adding more CBD

1136
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:29,919
um would be able to you know encourage

1137
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:32,920
of more and more rapid communication

1138
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,519
between the different um you know

1139
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:39,400
neurons yeah yeah and one uh molecule in

1140
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:43,318
particular that I find interesting with

1141
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:46,079
cbd's abilities is to enhance acetyl

1142
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:49,119
choline which is sort of like the master

1143
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:52,640
Communicator between you know neurons

1144
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:56,318
and there's a particular enzyme acetyl

1145
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:59,920
ceras that breaks down acetyl

1146
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:02,199
and um if we can block acetool teras to

1147
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,358
a certain extent we can enhance the

1148
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:07,199
ability of acetylcholine in its

1149
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,199
communication between cell and cell

1150
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:12,318
which is actually some of the ad

1151
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:14,399
Therapeutics drugs that are out there do

1152
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:18,000
so and from that functional standpoint

1153
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,639
CBD does enhance the communication or

1154
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,760
the

1155
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:23,960
neuroplasticity between the cells so if

1156
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,119
if we're wanting to use cannabinoids to

1157
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,960
increase our neuroplastic

1158
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:32,720
can you give me a couple of examples of

1159
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:35,039
of things that either a things that we

1160
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:37,078
might do that might decrease the

1161
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,639
neuroplasticity or if you want to keep

1162
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:43,880
it on the molecular level the the kinds

1163
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:43,879
of things that can inhibit our

1164
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,200
neuroplasticity uh well there's lots of

1165
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:48,920
toxins that will get in there and block

1166
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:51,759
the

1167
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:56,240
communication I think if

1168
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:58,880
you overdo THC it can somewhat Crow the

1169
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:01,479
communication line or just you know stop

1170
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:05,640
it wanting to function altogether uh

1171
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:07,960
which has its benefit in in some degree

1172
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:09,838
uh but if we wanted to enhance the

1173
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,559
communication then we got to make these

1174
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:13,480
cells functional and as healthy as

1175
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:16,920
possible so there's a lot of factors

1176
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,880
that go into how to enhance this

1177
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,920
communication so it sounds like we're

1178
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,599
talking about like you know um you know

1179
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,880
everything environmental toxins um you

1180
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:26,680
know probably a lot of different types

1181
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,480
of

1182
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:31,399
pharmaceuticals um

1183
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,480
alcohol um you know huffing acetone you

1184
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:38,798
know there's probably Lots all of these

1185
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:40,679
things probably have uh would impact

1186
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:42,280
neuroplasticity in different ways so

1187
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:44,159
that we're kind of we're kind of back to

1188
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,519
the place where we were when first set

1189
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,159
we where we're talking about you know

1190
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:51,559
good living helps all of this stuff

1191
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:54,759
we're talking about for sure

1192
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:57,720
mhm all right so um let's let's now

1193
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:59,559
focus on the impacts of a brain um

1194
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:01,480
without neurogenesis which will kind of

1195
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:04,599
set us up for the third set talking

1196
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:07,599
about um um you know some of these ways

1197
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:11,838
that that we can help patients so

1198
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:14,920
um I've always just assumed that um

1199
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:18,239
decreasing neurogenesis is generally a

1200
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:21,639
part of aging and based on what we just

1201
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:24,118
said if we're doing more things that age

1202
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:27,118
us like you know smoking tobacco and

1203
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:30,440
drinking and and you know poor sleep and

1204
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:35,200
all these things that that um these will

1205
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:37,400
all impede neurogenesis um over time um

1206
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,759
is is is that true or is is there a

1207
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,639
particular mechanism at the heart of it

1208
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,319
that I'm

1209
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:47,000
missing no that in general I'm going to

1210
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:52,159
agree with you that just aging itself

1211
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:55,920
will promote the degeneration of uh

1212
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:58,118
neuronal cells and inhibit the ability

1213
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,440
for neurogenesis to

1214
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:03,358
occur but if we looked at say a toxin

1215
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,440
like even

1216
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:08,279
alcohol CBDs comes in there and we've

1217
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,920
seen that it can one reduce your

1218
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:13,720
Cravings to take

1219
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,599
it and two can also protect uh the liver

1220
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:16,959
from

1221
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:18,359
inflammation and even brain cells from

1222
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,440
oxidative

1223
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:24,798
stress uh

1224
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:27,400
so you know to some extent there is some

1225
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:30,199
things can't avoid but if CBD is coming

1226
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,280
around and you know showing us that hey

1227
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:34,159
this can show some neuroprotection

1228
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:38,680
alongside of a

1229
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:42,719
neurotoxin then uh we we have at least

1230
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:45,759
some defense uh that we can use outside

1231
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:48,399
of just you know

1232
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,880
lifestyle right on great well I don't

1233
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,358
think we need to bur um to to bang on

1234
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,798
the eat hold Foods get exercise Live

1235
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:58,279

[Music]

1250
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,599
there are so many seed banks nowadays

1251
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,920
that you really have options in who to

1252
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,960
choose not only that if you pick the

1253
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,400
wrong seed bank you could be in for a

1254
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,240
really sketchy ride and that's only one

1255
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,920

seeds one of the reasons why no till

1301
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,199
cannabis growing is so valued by Farmers

1302
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:45,318
is because the mycelium networks in the

1303
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,838
soil remain established from year to

1304
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:49,558
year and we know these fungal networks

1305
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:51,920
are essential because they are the

1306
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:54,119
nutrient superhighways that extend far

1307
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,760
and wide in the substrate to feed your

1308
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:59,559
plants the trouble with growing in New

1309
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,440
Living soils or Blended cocoa substrates

1310
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:04,319
is that it takes most of the plant's

1311
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:07,519
life just to create these mycelium

Los and my guest today is phyto canabo

1375
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:42,319
researcher State and laws so here we are

1376
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:44,960
in the big third set so ston you know at

1377
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:48,838
the end of last set we were talking

1378
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:50,679
about how aging and you know depending

1379
00:59:48,838 --> 00:59:52,599
on how fast we're aging because of how

1380
00:59:50,679 --> 00:59:55,598
much we're riding our body hard and

1381
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:57,640
abusing it you know all of those things

1382
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:01,359
will decrease our

1383
00:59:57,639 --> 01:00:04,358
neurogenesis and CBD and THC and some

1384
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:06,558
other canono can help support

1385
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:09,679
neurogenesis but um you know there's

1386
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:12,640
only so much can be done if if you know

1387
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:14,480
we're our body is aging right either on

1388
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:19,759
its own or because we've been living

1389
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:23,559
hard so would you explain a bit about um

1390
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:26,119
uh you know how this lack of

1391
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:28,079
neurogenesis um well actually before we

1392
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:31,519
go to that I want to ask a definitional

1393
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,680
question you know so so often people are

1394
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:34,559
they'll say something and then they'll

1395
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:36,919
just say Alzheimer's disease and

1396
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,760
dementia like like they'll group them

1397
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,720
together but they won't put them in the

1398
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,799
same bucket so if you could would you

1399
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:45,480
just give us a brief understanding of

1400
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:47,838
what's different between Alzheimer's and

1401
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:49,920
Dementia because as a lay person they

1402
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:51,358
kind of sound the same to me but people

1403
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,599
always talk about them separately so I'm

1404
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:53,519
guessing there's a difference that I

1405
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:56,359
just don't

1406
01:00:53,519 --> 01:01:01,358
know

1407
01:00:56,358 --> 01:01:03,960
yeah so dementia can be categorized into

1408
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:07,480
different forms but Alzheimer's disease

1409
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:10,920
is the most common form of dementia so

1410
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:13,318
if you were to say dementias where these

1411
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,039
protein aggregate start to form and

1412
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:17,960
cause memory loss

1413
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:19,720
or

1414
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,440
body

1415
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:25,639
dysfunction and how it

1416
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:29,720
operates as it progresses

1417
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:31,920
then it might form into a specific type

1418
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:33,919
of disease from dementia called

1419
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,358
Alzheimer's disease aler dise is kind of

1420
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,240
the end of the road of a form of

1421
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:40,960
Dimension it's the most common

1422
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:44,719
form so we talked a little bit about the

1423
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:47,679
mechanics uh last uh set about you know

1424
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:50,078
precursors to dementia and then

1425
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:52,960
Alzheimer's and you know how how it

1426
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:56,400
progresses um and and now you're talking

1427
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:58,838
about you know the the different um uh

1428
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:03,318
symptoms of the ailments you know um um

1429
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:05,558
uh forgetting things and um uh uh the

1430
01:02:03,318 --> 01:02:08,038
changing relationship with one's body

1431
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:10,839
can you just pick one or two of those

1432
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:13,400
and um and explain to us the mechanics

1433
01:02:10,838 --> 01:02:17,078
of what's going on with Alzheimer's to

1434
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:20,599
cause the symptoms so so moving from

1435
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:23,359
what causes Alzheimers to what does

1436
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:25,720
Alzheimer's

1437
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:28,318
cause

1438
01:02:25,719 --> 01:02:32,838
okay well I'll go with just the big

1439
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:37,000
definition and filter it down to what

1440
01:02:32,838 --> 01:02:39,480
what happens so if we have these natural

1441
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,679
ameloid beta proteins in the brain and

1442
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,240
they form

1443
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:46,118
Aggregates then at the same sort of time

1444
01:02:43,239 --> 01:02:49,399
inside the cell are these neuro fibular

1445
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:52,519
Tangles which consist of the hyper

1446
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:56,278
phosphated tal protein now this is

1447
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:58,920
partnered uh this deter I dilus part

1448
01:02:56,278 --> 01:03:01,599
part process is partnered with reactive

1449
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:03,519
oxygen species reactive nitrogen species

1450
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:06,920
which is your oxidative stress

1451
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:09,519
mitochondria damage uh red that's inside

1452
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:11,519
the cell outside the cell reduction of

1453
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:13,278
acetylcholine levels which we're talking

1454
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:15,318
about plays a role in the

1455
01:03:13,278 --> 01:03:18,880
neuroplasticity or the

1456
01:03:15,318 --> 01:03:20,960
communication then these networks begin

1457
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,599
to lose their connection so misplace

1458
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:26,519
networks am on neurons inside the hypoc

1459
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:29,160
Camus we've scene that that it actually

1460
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:32,199
shrinks and we get this chronic

1461
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:34,159
neuroinflammation causing memory loss

1462
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:36,078
and cognitive impairment eventually we

1463
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:38,759
can't even you know take care of

1464
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,278
ourselves in the

1465
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:45,119
end

1466
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:47,679
um this idea of misplaced networks um

1467
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,798
that's a really um that's a very

1468
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:52,000
efficient phrase because it really does

1469
01:03:49,798 --> 01:03:56,519
describe what I experienced when

1470
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,400
interacting with um Alzheimer's patients

1471
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:00,599
um and also there's something about that

1472
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,920
phrase that captures some of the sadness

1473
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:02,920
of it

1474
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:10,519
too yeah it's uh it can you know really

1475
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:11,880
take you down a road that affects you

1476
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:14,559
and your family

1477
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:17,880
members so all right so so this brings

1478
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:19,880
us to a place where we know neurogenesis

1479
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,798
and neuro protection are essential for

1480
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,480
our brain to function properly over the

1481
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:27,719
long term and when it slows down with

1482
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:31,039
age is leaves us open to debilitate

1483
01:04:27,719 --> 01:04:34,199
debilitating brain issues and we also

1484
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:37,200
know from first set that the Cannabis

1485
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:40,000
comp the Cannabis components um can

1486
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:42,159
support neurogenesis and neuroprotection

1487
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,400
so so obviously we've made the case like

1488
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:48,199
take some cannabis right so so um so I'm

1489
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:50,358
going to ask you about um some cannabis

1490
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:54,159
protocols that you think that might make

1491
01:04:50,358 --> 01:04:56,798
sense for someone who who still has

1492
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:59,078
brain health and wants to keep it and

1493
01:04:56,798 --> 01:05:00,759
then and then I'll kind of reapo the

1494
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:02,400
question again for somebody who's

1495
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:05,880
already

1496
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,680
experiencing um you know problems so so

1497
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:10,480
I guess this first one let's let's throw

1498
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:12,239
this kind of in the in the longevity uh

1499
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,400
bucket um I've been doing a lot of

1500
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:17,838
thinking about canabo as a as a

1501
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:20,039
longevity tool and and it really seems

1502
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:21,318
to work so so so let's say that like you

1503
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:22,680
know even though we know that

1504
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:24,759
everybody's got something wrong with

1505
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:26,679
them um let's say we're talking about a

1506
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,359
person who's generally brain healthy and

1507
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:30,519
they're not they're not experiencing

1508
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:32,920
Dementia or Alzheimer's at this point

1509
01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:35,239
but but they don't they don't want to

1510
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,639
right and and or or maybe they're like

1511
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:39,639
me and and some of that stuff runs in

1512
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:43,920
the family right so I want to I want to

1513
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:48,159
bio protect against it in advance so so

1514
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:50,838
what would you see as um a a a dosing

1515
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:54,639
protocol for somebody who is thinking

1516
01:05:50,838 --> 01:05:59,960
more about um uh longevity

1517
01:05:54,639 --> 01:06:04,278
and um and and you know long-term Health

1518
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:07,318
um before uh some something a brain

1519
01:06:04,278 --> 01:06:09,760
disease has has shown

1520
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:13,558
up um I guess we got to always throw

1521
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:15,599
that disclaimer alert out this is not

1522
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:19,079
your medical doctor

1523
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:22,079
or uh and make sure you see your phys

1524
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:25,359
physician before taking a

1525
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:27,839
substance that is new to your body thank

1526
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:30,880
you for that you beat me too that's

1527
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:33,838
usually my job but you got it thank

1528
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:37,400
you um and are we talking all can

1529
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:39,000
avonoids or just CBD um well um I would

1530
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,318
like to hear what your your blend would

1531
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,278
be if you're going to if you you know

1532
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:44,519
maybe you're going to tell me that a you

1533
01:06:42,278 --> 01:06:47,239
know a 20 to one of a of a certain

1534
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:50,599
potency taken every day or twice a day

1535
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:52,519
um you know at this point um you have

1536
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:54,640
got all of this various information

1537
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:57,159
already pre-existing in your head head

1538
01:06:54,639 --> 01:07:00,798
and so if if you were to put together a

1539
01:06:57,159 --> 01:07:03,239
best practice for a cannaboid supplement

1540
01:07:00,798 --> 01:07:07,038
to preserve uh brain health what would

1541
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:10,959
it look like I would probably start with

1542
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:12,799
just CBD personally uh if you'd never

1543
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:16,240
used cannabis you're like I've heard

1544
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:20,358
cannabis uh is going to help my brain as

1545
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:23,239
I age now I mean even we go back 20

1546
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:27,598
years from now that was the you know

1547
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:30,838
talking you know the devil's tobacco and

1548
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:33,440
uh now we're looking at it as a way to

1549
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:37,038
preserve our brain so let's start with

1550
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:38,639
CBD because it's probably the safest and

1551
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:41,039
I would almost have to say that if we're

1552
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:43,558
going to even ask this question then

1553
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:46,799
we'd probably be

1554
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:48,920
concerned around the age of 30 to 40 if

1555
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:51,278
we're if we're still healthy you know

1556
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,720
it's around about 65 is when demential

1557
01:07:51,278 --> 01:07:54,519
likee symptoms usually present

1558
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:58,118
themselves so we're beyond that

1559
01:07:54,519 --> 01:08:00,838
adolescent phase where THC is going to

1560
01:07:58,119 --> 01:08:04,318
be as harmful as what we've experienced

1561
01:08:00,838 --> 01:08:06,838
and so we're in that phase where either

1562
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:09,038
CBD or THC could be helpful so I would

1563
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:14,159
say starting with CBD because it can

1564
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:17,039
start to maybe help a nide do its uh do

1565
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:19,000
its thing with the CB1 and CB2 receptors

1566
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:20,278
plus there's some other benefits that

1567
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:25,399
come along with

1568
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:27,759
CBD now if CBD is not effective

1569
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:31,000
and you slowly increment your dose and

1570
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:32,960
you're you know taking a plus 100

1571
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,479
milligram a day and still not seeing

1572
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:38,719
anything then I would start adding THC

1573
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:42,000
in and like you're saying maybe starting

1574
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:46,279
at that 20 milligram of CBD to 1

1575
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:51,000
milligram of THC and maybe we start then

1576
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:57,199
we go 20 to five 20 Mig of CBD to 5 Mig

1577
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:59,838
of THC or maybe even go 50 CBD to 5 THC

1578
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:02,639
but I would slowly increment especially

1579
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:04,838
THC and even more specifically if you

1580
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:07,798
have an underlying psychiatric condition

1581
01:09:04,838 --> 01:09:10,158
with THC because it is quite

1582
01:09:07,798 --> 01:09:13,359
psychoactive and then finding that that

1583
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:18,119
right milligram dosage and you

1584
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:21,159
know uh THC has its own unique benefits

1585
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:23,479
all in its own right uh with helping the

1586
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:24,838
brain in many different facets outside

1587
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:28,079
of what

1588
01:09:24,838 --> 01:09:31,519
we've mapped out pharmacologically I

1589
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:34,960
believe so start slow see which one

1590
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:37,520
works best for you and generally having

1591
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,560
a higher amount of CBD to

1592
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,480
THC right on that's great and and you

1593
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,798
know if if if you're at home listening

1594
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,759
to this and you're thinking about

1595
01:09:43,798 --> 01:09:48,119
putting together you know a protocol of

1596
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:50,920
your own and you know maybe you are

1597
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:53,479
fortunate enough to be in in a location

1598
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,880
where you can you know grow your you

1599
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:58,359
know High

1600
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,600
CBD very low THC um you know plant some

1601
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:03,319
kind of high CBD hemp plant or something

1602
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:06,640
and make your own RSO um that that's

1603
01:10:03,319 --> 01:10:10,000
very fortunate and and don't be shy

1604
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:12,360
about um you know spiking it with CBD

1605
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,800
isolate because you know you can get

1606
01:10:12,359 --> 01:10:16,359
really high quality CBD isolate out

1607
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,640
there right now you know you got to shop

1608
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:20,960
around you know you know find find

1609
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,440
somebody who who stands by their

1610
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,920
cleanliness and their tests you know

1611
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:28,198
like like a future compound or somebody

1612
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:33,239
and um and then and then don't be shy to

1613
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:36,079
spike with that to get up to the the CBD

1614
01:10:33,238 --> 01:10:39,678
numbers that you're looking for um

1615
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:42,198
because for for most folks growing your

1616
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:45,800
own high CBD hemp plants and processing

1617
01:10:42,198 --> 01:10:49,000
it all um is just not going to provide

1618
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:51,880
you with you know 100 milligrams of CBD

1619
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,238
a day plus THC it's you know you know if

1620
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,640
you got a big farm like you know maybe

1621
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:58,639
maybe you're that much of a baller but

1622
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:00,480
for most people that's not the case and

1623
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,360
um and you know I used to talk trash

1624
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:03,718
about this approach but you know I think

1625
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:06,479
that part of what's important is that we

1626
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:09,000
all remain active Learners right and and

1627
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:11,559
while I would love there to be um so

1628
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,560
much you know CBD resin available to

1629
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:16,280
everyone at cheap prices that that we

1630
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:18,600
could only use that well you know when

1631
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:21,319
it comes to our health um you know

1632
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:24,079
sometimes sometimes we have to do it um

1633
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:26,000
in the way that works um not not the way

1634
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:29,039
that we necessarily want it to be so so

1635
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,719
anyway um I just share that because I

1636
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:34,439
had to turn a corner about using isolet

1637
01:11:31,719 --> 01:11:35,960
for some applications and and um it

1638
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:37,599
wouldn't surprise me if some of you were

1639
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:41,239
the same way so so there's that all

1640
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,920
right so um so so now that we've got

1641
01:11:41,238 --> 01:11:44,678
this so thank you for this protocol this

1642
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:46,520
was this was a this was exactly the

1643
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:51,000
level of specificity that I was looking

1644
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:53,639
for ston so so let's talk about a um a a

1645
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,319
a different protocol because now and and

1646
01:11:53,639 --> 01:11:57,279
who knows it might be it might end up

1647
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:59,920
being the same protocol for you but but

1648
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:03,639
now we're talking about somebody who is

1649
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,679
an Alzheimer's patient and you know they

1650
01:12:03,639 --> 01:12:07,239
they've already been talking to their

1651
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:10,079
family that they wanted to try this and

1652
01:12:07,238 --> 01:12:12,959
their family is in support of it I hope

1653
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:15,238
and everybody's working together um

1654
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,039
would you make any changes to this

1655
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:20,359
protocol to somebody who's already

1656
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:22,198
experiencing symptoms who's already on

1657
01:12:20,359 --> 01:12:25,920
this

1658
01:12:22,198 --> 01:12:29,079
path not really um cuz we just don't

1659
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:33,000
know how they're going to respond to

1660
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:35,639
either compound CBD or THC or the

1661
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,600
plethora of other phytochemicals in this

1662
01:12:35,639 --> 01:12:43,159
extract but you know if if one's

1663
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:45,600
extremely irritable then you know a

1664
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:49,000
faster acting lower dosage and what you

1665
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:52,000
can get your hands on um approach could

1666
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,439
be THC uh I mean because it's it's a

1667
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:58,760
tricky question to address this with so

1668
01:12:54,439 --> 01:13:02,039
many different countries Laws states and

1669
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:04,560
uh Financial burdens that getting a hold

1670
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:07,079
of these compounds will will do for that

1671
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:10,120
particular patient so I

1672
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:13,439
mean it's easy to recommend if if you're

1673
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:14,840
in a state that it's highly available

1674
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:17,119
but it's even more difficult to

1675
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,960
recommend when one can't even afford the

1676
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:20,519
medication especially when you're saying

1677
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,719
oh you know you might you need to be

1678
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:26,480
taking around 100 milligrams of CBD get

1679
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:28,480
any sort of effect from it when you know

1680
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:30,718
like here in Australia the average

1681
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:34,479
milligram is about 10 cents so you're

1682
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:36,760
looking at $100 a day for a medication

1683
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:39,158
that might work versus if you can get

1684
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:41,600
your hands on you know 100 milligrams of

1685
01:13:39,158 --> 01:13:43,000
THC and divide that between 10 days you

1686
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:48,320
might be getting

1687
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,800
more uh therapeutic targets ticked by a

1688
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:54,158
less

1689
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:56,400
expensive uh protocol so once again

1690
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:58,759
consult your medical doctor first and

1691
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:02,158
depending on where you live it it it

1692
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,440
could somewhat dictate this protocol so

1693
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:07,039
start

1694
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:09,439
slow CBD is a little bit safer but you

1695
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:11,800
might work better with THC especially in

1696
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:17,000
later stages of Alzheimer's disease

1697
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:21,800
right on so um what will our goal be um

1698
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:24,119
when the patient or uh is taking the the

1699
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:27,199
protocol um

1700
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:30,079
with with neurogenesis are we are we

1701
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:31,960
just trying to like hold the line or is

1702
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:34,800
it possible that we can

1703
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:38,000
improve the patient um

1704
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,840
because I believe that the the case is

1705
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,760
is that when we when we

1706
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:46,440
lose um neuron

1707
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,920
producing when our when our

1708
01:14:46,439 --> 01:14:53,399
neurogenesis flags and

1709
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:55,639
slows um it's it's it's harder to create

1710
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:58,638
new cells that do this and so what we're

1711
01:14:55,639 --> 01:15:01,840
just trying to do is is hold the line on

1712
01:14:58,639 --> 01:15:04,079
our ability to produce to cause

1713
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:08,319
neurogenesis where it is and just

1714
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:10,198
decrease the the sliding of it um is

1715
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:11,639
that a is that a correct understanding

1716
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:12,839
where where when we're supporting

1717
01:15:11,639 --> 01:15:14,400
neurogenesis we're just going to be

1718
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:17,480
supporting where we're not where we're

1719
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:22,039
at we're not necessarily going to be

1720
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:23,919
improving it in such a way where um you

1721
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:26,800
know we could pull somebody back from

1722
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:30,520
the grips of Alzheimer's for

1723
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:32,440
example yeah uh I've always got hope

1724
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:34,120
that no matter who you are out there

1725
01:15:32,439 --> 01:15:36,960
you're going to have the ability to

1726
01:15:34,119 --> 01:15:39,319
create more brain cells in the right

1727
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:42,198
environment let's just say through your

1728
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:44,799
lifestyle and through maybe some uh

1729
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:48,079
supplements that includes cannabinoids

1730
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:51,880
in the word supplements to your

1731
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:53,679
protocol now if you've got enough uh

1732
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,440
neurons that are fun functioning

1733
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,600
correctly and your goal here is to

1734
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:59,158
preserve these neurons we're looking at

1735
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:03,600
you know there's some potential for

1736
01:15:59,158 --> 01:16:05,960
these canabo to help these neurons from

1737
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,639
being affected by whether it is reactive

1738
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:09,639
oxygen species these cyto can storms

1739
01:16:08,639 --> 01:16:12,760
from

1740
01:16:09,639 --> 01:16:15,400
inflammation uh and also from acetool

1741
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:18,600
teray from breaking down acetycholine so

1742
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:21,039
with these exogenous

1743
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:23,440
cannabinoids they might help with our

1744
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:26,279
endogenous cabino such as CBD and

1745
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:29,919
anandamide or THC might go in there and

1746
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:32,238
help stimulate some more uh

1747
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,239
proliferation of these brain cells and

1748
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:36,519
they might protect the ones that we

1749
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:39,319
already have and the functioning or the

1750
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:41,480
neuroplasticity of these brain cells so

1751
01:16:39,319 --> 01:16:44,799
yes there's a lot of potential here for

1752
01:16:41,479 --> 01:16:47,319
this to help on a cellular level and

1753
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:50,880
then also on a behavioral level of why

1754
01:16:47,319 --> 01:16:53,479
these uh symptoms of let's just say

1755
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,639
Alzheimer's disease could be modified by

1756
01:16:53,479 --> 01:16:58,279
these

1757
01:16:54,639 --> 01:17:00,639
chemicals right on I follow that okay so

1758
01:16:58,279 --> 01:17:04,198
let's let's take um a step back one more

1759
01:17:00,639 --> 01:17:07,279
time uh as we're wrapping up here um so

1760
01:17:04,198 --> 01:17:09,719
so we've we've talked about neurogenesis

1761
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:12,319
and neuro protections we we understand

1762
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:15,039
how they work we understand how our

1763
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:17,519
ability to do that ourselves worsens

1764
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:21,719
with age and how we can support that

1765
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:24,960
system by using um by using cannabinoids

1766
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:27,359
excellent and and we've we've looked at

1767
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:29,439
the applications for you know just

1768
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:32,119
regular folks who want to take it as as

1769
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:34,719
a supplement and the very similar

1770
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:36,679
protocol for folks who are actually um

1771
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:38,840
showing the impacts of the lack of

1772
01:17:36,679 --> 01:17:42,239
neurogenesis in things like Alzheimer's

1773
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:45,239
and Dementia so so with all of that you

1774
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:47,678
know I I've not really seen it called

1775
01:17:45,238 --> 01:17:50,519
this but for me that sounds like we're

1776
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:54,158
describing CBD as a neotropic do you

1777
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:55,840
consider CBD be to be a neut tropic

1778
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:59,559
yeah if it can improve cognitive

1779
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:01,279
function then it would be uh I guess

1780
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:03,199
fitting underneath the umbrella of a

1781
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:05,039
neut Tropic yeah that's that's the way I

1782
01:18:03,198 --> 01:18:07,599
see it too and and so far I haven't seen

1783
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:09,479
it marketed that way but um it's it's

1784
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,400
interesting CU like neut Tropics are

1785
01:18:09,479 --> 01:18:15,638
like super hip for the you know the

1786
01:18:11,399 --> 01:18:17,119
longevity folks and and CBD is hip with

1787
01:18:15,639 --> 01:18:18,400
a different group of people but I

1788
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:20,840
haven't seen anybody like kind of

1789
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:24,399
Crossmark it to both groups and call it

1790
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:28,159
a neut Tropic so um what I'd like to to

1791
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:32,599
end the episode with uh Satan is that I

1792
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:35,679
know that uh you are um you

1793
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:39,480
know you are a research scientist and

1794
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:43,480
you are looking at the specifics of

1795
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:46,000
neurogenesis but I also know that um you

1796
01:18:43,479 --> 01:18:49,399
know you are a whole food Advocate and

1797
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:52,238
you are a Healer and and you know you

1798
01:18:49,399 --> 01:18:54,839
teach uh yoga and and so you're kind of

1799
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:57,399
like you know a holistically minded

1800
01:18:54,840 --> 01:19:01,679
researcher who's you know doing this

1801
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:03,158
this balance between holistic mindset

1802
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:06,319
and you

1803
01:19:03,158 --> 01:19:08,799
know Western medicine which is got to be

1804
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:11,238
a very interesting Balancing Act for you

1805
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,560
um but um because you think about this

1806
01:19:11,238 --> 01:19:15,119
all the time um I'd just like to like

1807
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:18,920
kind of hand you the mic and have you

1808
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:23,119
kind of take us out of um you know what

1809
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:27,840
advice would you give to a human who

1810
01:19:23,119 --> 01:19:31,000
wants to keep their brain um functioning

1811
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:33,600
as far into life as they can with all

1812
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,800
the benefits of neurogenesis and

1813
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:40,480
neuroprotection would you just describe

1814
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:42,600
some of the you know lifestyle

1815
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:47,678
attributes that this person may want to

1816
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:50,840
consider Beyond simply taking a a CBD

1817
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:53,840
and potentially THC protocol as we've

1818
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:56,400
described so are we addressing in just

1819
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,960
the general person that's after mind

1820
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:00,000
longevity are we addressing the

1821
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:02,000
Alzheimer's patient I would say just a

1822
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,279
regular person um some somebody who's

1823
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,679
not uh uh you know not experiencing

1824
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:09,479
Alzheimer's yet um just just somebody

1825
01:20:06,679 --> 01:20:11,399
who wants to you know keep their brain

1826
01:20:09,479 --> 01:20:14,079
healthy this is a general brain health

1827
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:16,638
question okay well we'll break it down

1828
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:18,319
with uh the Necessities again so we got

1829
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:21,520
to have

1830
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:26,599
oxygen water and

1831
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:29,159
nutrients so so oxygen with uh breathing

1832
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:33,120
we all can learn to breathe better

1833
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:35,479
that's the truth how we breathe you can

1834
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:38,039
get into the anatomy but simply if there

1835
01:20:35,479 --> 01:20:41,479
was one word I would say to use and to

1836
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:43,960
learn would be U breathing and that's a

1837
01:20:41,479 --> 01:20:46,158
yoga concept I can get into that if

1838
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:48,039
you'd like but basically it's it's a way

1839
01:20:46,158 --> 01:20:50,638
to take air in and out of the body with

1840
01:20:48,039 --> 01:20:52,399
more efficiency maybe just spell it

1841
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:53,960
because we won't go into it today but

1842
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:57,599
people might want to look it up I think

1843
01:20:53,960 --> 01:21:03,279
it's U uh sorry I didn't mean to do that

1844
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:07,120
to you J yeah it's funny u doublej a y

1845
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:10,279
i great uh second so what goes with yoga

1846
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:13,119
course is posture uh learning how to

1847
01:21:10,279 --> 01:21:15,119
lengthen the spine keep it straight

1848
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:18,198
which supports the blood flow or the

1849
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:20,760
nutrients into and out of the brain

1850
01:21:18,198 --> 01:21:22,079
which the next one would be

1851
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,880
understanding a little bit about the

1852
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:25,679
lymphatic system and helping the

1853
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,840
clearance of too much of these aggregate

1854
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:29,719
proteins throughout life so it's also

1855
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:33,319
making sure your body let's just call it

1856
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:36,840
clean and it uh is functioning to

1857
01:21:33,319 --> 01:21:40,279
deliver nutrients but also to remove or

1858
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:42,440
detoxify uh these

1859
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:44,079
potential proteins in the brain that are

1860
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:47,000
going to mess you up which is what some

1861
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:49,519
of the you know ad drugs recently come

1862
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:53,198
out to do is actually to remove the

1863
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:54,800
proteins so we've got uh breath

1864
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:58,359
good clean

1865
01:21:54,800 --> 01:22:00,119
water um and which considers you know

1866
01:21:58,359 --> 01:22:02,759
some electrolytes if it came from a

1867
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:06,039
really clean natural source to make cell

1868
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:10,400
you're hydrated have good posture and

1869
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:13,158
then we get into you know doing our best

1870
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:15,399
to not expose ourselves to too many

1871
01:22:13,158 --> 01:22:18,279
toxins so trying to live in a natural

1872
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:20,319
place trying to get outside and if we

1873
01:22:18,279 --> 01:22:22,359
looked at what can stimulate

1874
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:24,439
neurogenesis I think probably one of the

1875
01:22:22,359 --> 01:22:27,719
big biggest ones is

1876
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:30,039
exercise and uh in know

1877
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:33,039
exercise produces more of that brain

1878
01:22:30,039 --> 01:22:36,519
deted neut Tropic Factor it also creates

1879
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:38,760
more endogenous cannabinoids so those

1880
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:41,239
two combined together is what helps the

1881
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:44,079
cells proliferate then we can kind of

1882
01:22:41,238 --> 01:22:46,198
get into that neuroprotection side with

1883
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:49,840
uh some of the protocols of our

1884
01:22:46,198 --> 01:22:51,319
supplements that will help protect us so

1885
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:54,239
when we get into nutrients I'd probably

1886
01:22:51,319 --> 01:22:58,559
be looking at uh your mag Omega-3s like

1887
01:22:54,238 --> 01:23:01,119
E3 Live which is a it's um an algae

1888
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:04,000
that's quite high in DHA and EPA which

1889
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:05,920
is known to support brain function I

1890
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,760
look at making sure the diet is actually

1891
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,920
extremely high in plant secondary

1892
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,800
metabolites which those include a big

1893
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:14,679
pool of the polyphenols and if we looked

1894
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:18,039
at those specifically it would be the

1895
01:23:14,679 --> 01:23:21,920
flavonoids and you maybe look at getting

1896
01:23:18,039 --> 01:23:25,519
the microbiome up as far as the good

1897
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:28,600
bacteria so making sure you take some

1898
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:31,600
form of a probiotic on a regular basis

1899
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:34,199
whether it's through sauerkraut in the

1900
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,960
diet or whether it's through you know

1901
01:23:34,198 --> 01:23:39,119
active yogurt or something yeah

1902
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:41,439
something like that and maintaining that

1903
01:23:39,119 --> 01:23:44,079
with lots of fiber so you got your pre

1904
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:45,839
which is your fiber you got your pro

1905
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:47,319
which is your bacteria and you combine

1906
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:49,480
those two together and you get these

1907
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:51,799
postbiotics so having a healthy

1908
01:23:49,479 --> 01:23:53,198
microbiome these molecule or not

1909
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:55,960
molecules these

1910
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:59,519
bacteria in your gut will chew up fiber

1911
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:01,000
and basically create these postbiotics

1912
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,960
which are nutrients that they create

1913
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:05,079
that are good for the brain as well like

1914
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:07,279
for example a lot of these flavonoids or

1915
01:24:05,079 --> 01:24:09,238
polyphenols that we consume don't

1916
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:11,279
actually get into the body till they hit

1917
01:24:09,238 --> 01:24:13,238
the the gut bacteria and then they get

1918
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:15,279
turned into things that are going to be

1919
01:24:13,238 --> 01:24:18,279
good for us

1920
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:20,559
so uh and then you know being positive

1921
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:23,039
about life I think C probably could be

1922
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,600
the number one thing to have a bit of a

1923
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:27,319
passion for whatever you're doing in

1924
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:30,480
life whether it's doing the the laundry

1925
01:24:27,319 --> 01:24:32,439
or the dishes just you know being

1926
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:35,119
positive through the whole process

1927
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:37,198
having a will to live will ultimately

1928
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:39,639
expand your lifespan so keeping yourself

1929
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:42,279
healthy and feeling as good as possible

1930
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:44,800
definitely helps with that will to

1931
01:24:42,279 --> 01:24:46,840
live excellent I think that's a great

1932
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,719
list and and I got to admit some of it

1933
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:51,360
isn't you know like the exercise um

1934
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:53,719
isn't too surprising but to um to see it

1935
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:56,559
put together in in such a elegant

1936
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:58,960
package with explanations of about why

1937
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:01,440
um I I always I always find it easier to

1938
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:04,079
do the Healthy Choice when I understand

1939
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:05,678
why I'm doing it instead of just like

1940
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:07,840
feeling like I'm not allowed to have

1941
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:10,480
something anymore which um doesn't

1942
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:13,520
usually work super great for me but um

1943
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:15,079
but but but getting inspiration to go

1944
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,800
towards something I do want like

1945
01:25:15,079 --> 01:25:18,519
long-term brain health especially since

1946
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,920
I've already had a brain injury I don't

1947
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:22,679
really have anything to you know I don't

1948
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:25,399
have much left to lose you know I need

1949
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:27,840
to I need to protect what I've got so so

1950
01:25:25,399 --> 01:25:30,039
anyway um St you you've just been like

1951
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:33,880
absolutely delightful I appreciate your

1952
01:25:30,039 --> 01:25:35,880
ability to translate um a lot of this

1953
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:40,079
you know hardcore bench science that you

1954
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:43,359
do um you know at the University uh to

1955
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:46,118
translate it into lay language so that

1956
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:48,359
um you know you can bring some of um you

1957
01:25:46,118 --> 01:25:51,118
know some of our lay people along with

1958
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:53,039
the citizen scientists along with you

1959
01:25:51,118 --> 01:25:56,759
know the caregivers and the doctors who

1960
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:59,079
listen to show you kind of like provide

1961
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:01,480
um in information in a way that that we
