2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,759
know your dealer has been a drug culture

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,919
safety standard forever

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,399
as cannabis migrates towards whatever

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,480
potential legalization the future holds

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,399
one of the few but important advantages

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,719
of the licensed cannabis market is the

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,159
availability of analytics

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,160
it is very helpful to know which

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,320
cannabinoids are dominant in cannabis

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,320
products how potent they are what

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,039
terpenes are present and that they are

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,480
devoid of dangerous pesticides molds and

14
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,960
heavy metals

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,159
this is a modern equivalent of know your

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,239
dealer

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,799
we could do a whole episode on gaming

18
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,718
cannabis analytics to cheat but on the

19
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,878
whole having cannabis analytics

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,480
available to us is an important modern

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,960
win for cannabis patients and

22
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,799
enthusiasts alike

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,640
psychedelic mushrooms are following in

24
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,959
the footsteps of cannabis in so many

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,399
ways and because cannabis has already

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,719
laid the groundwork for mushroom

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,799
legalization many states are rushing to

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,519
develop legal frameworks healthcare

29
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,079
standards and manufacturing rules

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,760
similarly we have begun to recognize the

31
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,118
importance of analytical labs for

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,680
mushrooms too

33
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,840
all mushrooms are not created equal and

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,240
as patients enthusiasts and product

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,719
developers all have increased access to

36
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,798
psilocybin mushrooms the importance of

37
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,200
knowing what we are ingesting becomes

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,560
hugely important

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,159
if you want to learn about cannabis

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,920

washington state university

80
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,519
on today's episode we're going to get up

81
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,640
to speed on psilocybin analytical labs

82
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,640
because they are about to become

83
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,839
incredibly relevant just like cannabis

84
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,679
labs have

85
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,519
during set one we will look closely at

86
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,959
the components of mushrooms and get a

87
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,120
better understanding of what we are

88
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,039
looking for specifically during the

89
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,959
second set we will talk about prevention

90
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,239
of bad actors gaming the system and

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,920
trying to cheat like folks do in

92
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,000
cannabis labs along with some of the

93
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,199
mechanics of mushroom sampling and

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
during this third set we're going to

95
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,079
talk about mushroom storage at home and

96
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,400
specific varieties of potent mushrooms

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,080
welcome to shaping fire george

98
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,920
thank you very much shango i'm super

99
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,319
excited to be here right on well thank

100
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,158
you for bringing your um your rare skill

101
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,280
set to us because we're excited to talk

102
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,039
about it so

103
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,840
you know by now most of us understand

104
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,840
that with cannabis analytics we are

105
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,560
looking for potency of a range of

106
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,120
cannabinoids and terpenes to help us

107
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,439
understand the potency of our flower

108
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,599
and what we're curious to start with is

109
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,400
what are the constituents

110
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,919
of psilocybin mushrooms that we want to

111
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,719
measure

112
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,479
uh yeah there it is very similar we are

113
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,400
looking at a potency measure when we're

114
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,878
looking at the biomass of mushrooms or

115
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,158
an extract for example

116
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,719
there are alkaloids in mushrooms in the

117
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,158
psilocybin mushrooms that are our target

118
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,479
as opposed to cannabinoids and

119
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:09,199
terpenoids in cannabis and there are

120
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,039
five primary ones there's two that most

121
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,318
people know about which are silicen and

122
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,079
psilocybin

123
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,439
and then there's three additional ones

124
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,199
norcilisin baocystein and norbiocysteine

125
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,600
these are the five primary ones that

126
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,520
people look for there's also an

127
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,400
additional sixth analyte called

128
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,159
arginasine which can also be found in

129
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,359
the psilocybin mushrooms and that's

130
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,080
actually

131
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,479
so six total but five that people mostly

132
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,839
look at and then i have a feeling people

133
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,599
are going to be more interested in

134
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,839
organizing going forward i've heard a

135
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,919
couple people talk about

136
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,799
a hypothesis that they think that might

137
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,918
be

138
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,079
responsible for some of the the

139
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,680
wood lover mushroom issues like there's

140
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,319
uh you know toxins from wood lover

141
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
mushrooms that can make people sick so

142
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,959
and that's actually a pretty good segue

143
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,639
into why

144
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,478
we're doing this you know the main

145
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,038
reason is safety that's why i'm

146
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,038
interested in doing this is these

147
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,879
molecules are quite powerful and have

148
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,120
the ability to influence the way people

149
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,639
think quite substantially so

150
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,160
with this being introduced to a whole

151
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,038
new group of people with the

152
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,439
legalization of psilocybin in oregon

153
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,759
we want to make sure people are safe

154
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,519
so these other metabolites um you know i

155
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,680
feel actually quite rookie about this

156
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,719
because you know i'm familiar with

157
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,038
salosine and psilocybin but the other uh

158
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,120
what four that you mentioned like i've

159
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,240
never heard of any of them um you

160
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,038
mentioned one of them that um you know

161
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,400
it can be toxic so i'm guessing that

162
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,478
said that

163
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,000
i don't know for sure but i've heard a

164
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,599
couple people

165
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,199
you know mention that they think that

166
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,039
might be involved so yeah i don't know

167
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,919
for sure okay cool thank you for the

168
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:47,759
question

169
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,599
i don't want to put words in your mouth

170
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,520
for sure there's a lot of unknowns here

171
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,199
in this industry and in this in this

172
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,240
topic you know it's been in the dark for

173
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,080
so long being a schedule one substance

174
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,079
that people weren't allowed to do this

175
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,399
research for a fair a very long time but

176
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,719
thanks to you know organizations like

177
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,959
maps and people like rick doblin they've

178
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,479
opened up the ability for us to start

179
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,279
looking at these things again which

180
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:14,000
actually happened way back in the 60s so

181
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,599
so these these other constituents are

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,759
other than uh

183
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,000
soloson and psilocybin are those for all

184
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,560
things that you that that we are trying

185
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,759
to analyze and get potency for because

186
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,680
we want to encourage them because we

187
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,160
think that they are you know like

188
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,400
perhaps helper molecules for psilocybin

189
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,800
or something or are the are the other

190
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,120
other four really more things that we

191
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,400
want to track for potential negative

192
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,199
reasons

193
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,719
well for the north silicon bay cysteine

194
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,478
and north bay of cysteine i know that

195
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,039
people are definitely interested in them

196
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,560
as psychedelic molecules i do not

197
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,839
believe there's major toxicity

198
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,360
associated with those in larger doses

199
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:59,119
they're more minor alkaloids in the

200
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,120
mushroom compared to psilocybin and

201
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,038
silicon and

202
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,519
you know they're not found in every

203
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,478
species either i've definitely seen

204
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,719
um bail cysteine and norbiocysteine in

205
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,079
some uh samples from customers but i

206
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,960
have yet to see

207
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,198
norcillusin show up so um and some of

208
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,839
these molecules you know convert into

209
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,080
each other you know psilocybin converts

210
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,159
into silicon uh and all of these

211
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,439
molecules are very similarly related

212
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,439
structurally

213
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,399
it you know it reminds me right away of

214
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,639
the entourage effect in cannabis and

215
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,399
indeed you know um so oh good so that's

216
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,918
that's what i'm curious about do you

217
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,918
think that and again i know we're very

218
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,799
early in this research but do you think

219
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,879
we're gonna find that these um these

220
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,520
different constituents are working

221
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,918
together or do you think that they just

222
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,639
happen to sometimes co-occur

223
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:53,279
yeah i'd be hard-pressed to believe that

224
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,519
they don't have some sort of

225
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,038
synergy or interaction with each other

226
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,439
because you can make the analogy to

227
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,360
cannabis where you look at cbd and thc

228
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,519
for example they don't bind to the same

229
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,759
receptors that's why they have different

230
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,198
effects in the body and you know where

231
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,680
we know the

232
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,080
target for silicon and psilocybin

233
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
we may not know all the target receptors

234
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,680
for the other constituents and we might

235
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,679
not even know if silicon and psilocybin

236
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,439
touch other receptors either you know

237
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,879
there's uh

238
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,478
the experiments that are done in order

239
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,720
to figure this stuff out are pretty

240
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,878
complicated and involve like you know

241
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,199
binding kinetics with the analyte and

242
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,120
the receptor and it takes a great deal

243
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,759
of work to uh

244
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,399
to figure out and then you also when you

245
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,399
have lower affinity or what i mean by

246
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,799
that is like the interaction between the

247
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,759
receptor and the molecule is not very

248
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,439
high

249
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,600
it's like really low those can be

250
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,120
actually hard to discover that they're

251
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,720
binding to in cell or on the cells so it

252
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,759
takes even more

253
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,000
extensive work to discover the minor

254
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,278
receptors that they might interact with

255
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,240
wow that's really interesting all right

256
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,399
so

257
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,879
so

258
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,720
i know for me the four that you

259
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,519
mentioned other than silicon and

260
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,839
psilocybin were all new to me but to

261
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,839
people who are studying at your level

262
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,399
and understand these mushrooms

263
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,440
intimately

264
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,320
are you expecting there to be some or

265
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,720
many more constituents of the mushrooms

266
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,800
that that we discover and find out are

267
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,680
things that we do want to analyze like

268
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,799
like the so this is an ex the the number

269
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,879
of things we were going to be looking

270
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,079
for in these assays is expanding as we

271
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,039
learn more

272
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,959
exactly yeah there is some work going on

273
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,120
in israel where they have a very

274
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,518
advanced lab where

275
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,200
pardon me where they use a different

276
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,399
technique than we use and flourish to

277
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,560
look at these

278
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,159
analytes they're using a

279
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,799
mass spectrometry

280
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,480
and with a liquid chromatography coupled

281
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,679
with a mass spectrometer you can

282
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,600
identify molecules that are

283
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,759
super low abundance

284
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,200
and maybe a thousand fold more sensitive

285
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,600
than the hplc uv that i'm using to do

286
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,360
these quantitative analytics and i know

287
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,040
that they've discovered a host of new

288
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,879
molecules

289
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,879
in psilocybin mushrooms that

290
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,879
is in the literature and just really

291
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,879
isn't well known at all and then what

292
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,799
you need to do then is single out these

293
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,439
molecules and then do experiments with

294
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,240
each of them and this is a very massive

295
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,800
effort and you know um

296
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,919
one of the biggest deficiencies i have

297
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,439
right now

298
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,919
is uh

299
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,120
in this field is the time

300
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,799
to

301
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,039
dive really deep into the literature of

302
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,799
basic research most of my work right now

303
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,278
is involved with researching method

304
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,838
development because i'm setting up

305
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,519
additional tests outside of psilocybin

306
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,839
mushrooms which we can talk about later

307
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,639
if you're interested or maybe next time

308
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,640
but most of my time is spent developing

309
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,120
new tests for the lab so i'm a little

310
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,958
bit deficient on the newest

311
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,159
alkaloids coming out of

312
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,599
these mushrooms but that's actually

313
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,120
something we could probably talk about

314
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,720
in a single episode if you're ever

315
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,679
interested in the future

316
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,720
it's really interesting to uh experience

317
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:15,599
how much opportunity that there is in

318
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,399
mushrooms right now you know for for

319
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,519
somebody who sees themselves as an you

320
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,078
know a an organic chemist or you know

321
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,799
naturalist scientist to the idea that

322
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,319
there's you know all these species to

323
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,639
discover and then there's all these

324
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,720
species to then do um you know

325
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,159
experimentation within the lab

326
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,000
and then you know of course how they're

327
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:39,439
interacting with the human like what

328
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,360
what a time to be somebody early career

329
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,120
who is interested in this

330
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,560
yeah actually i have two answers to that

331
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,639
question first of all you said

332
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,479
additional species so right now i've

333
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,319
been talking mostly about the philosophy

334
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,839
mushrooms and one thing that i thought

335
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,519
was really interesting too is i've even

336
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,040
seen a reference where people have found

337
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,278
buffetinin

338
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,439
in the mushrooms that's the same ones

339
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,399
found in the toad right that's a really

340
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,760
powerful dmt molecule uh that's another

341
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,278
reference i'd need to follow up and

342
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,519
verify but i thought that was super

343
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:11,039
interesting but for other species there

344
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:14,399
are like gymnopolis and

345
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:16,639
foliota there are these molecules called

346
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,360
bisnor agonin

347
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,240
hispidin and then in ammonita there's

348
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,039
muscomol ibotanic acid and muscasone so

349
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,799
there's

350
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,278
there's a host of other molecules that

351
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,679
can be looked into as well you know

352
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,720
so just narrowing down on the philosophy

353
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,199
mushrooms

354
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,759
is super interesting but there's also a

355
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,480
lot more out there and to be honest when

356
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:42,078
we're talking about the fungal kingdom

357
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,079
there is so much we don't know i mean

358
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,879
unbelievable amount of information out

359
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,559
there to be mined by people to

360
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,120
figure out what's going on with these

361
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,919
absolutely incredible

362
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,120
organisms so i know that you know the

363
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,240
the few

364
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,720
labs that there are for for mushrooms in

365
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,720
the united states they you know they

366
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,720
they look different and they're run

367
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,639
different but i'm going to ask you like

368
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,560
a real general question from your

369
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,720
experience just kind of about all labs

370
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,278
in general which is

371
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,278
do you think that mostly labs are are

372
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,838
being set up at this point just for

373
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,759
philosophy or do you think that you know

374
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,760
both part of their business model to be

375
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,600
able to have a more variety of customers

376
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,399
but also the direction that interest is

377
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,959
going would you say that most labs are

378
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,720
are setting themselves up for the

379
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,838
amanita and all these you know these

380
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,759
other mushrooms that are coming

381
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,320
into popularity again

382
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,799
yeah well first of all most people are

383
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,800
going to be handcuffed by their laws so

384
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,719
it's only legal to mess with any of

385
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,559
these in very

386
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,839
few places in the country the state of

387
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,919
oregon

388
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,040
denver oakland

389
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,039
and

390
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,399
maybe i've heard of a lab in michigan

391
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,838
but i don't know if they're just doing

392
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,159
it without having the laws changed yet

393
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,279
so and there's a couple levels of of

394
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:05,759
this answer here so um to set up the

395
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:08,000
testing for psilocybin and silicon it's

396
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,838
not that difficult there's information

397
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,600
out there in the literature you don't

398
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,480
need a tremendous amount of equipment

399
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,879
you know you know 20 30 000 investment

400
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,839
and and you could get going

401
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,879
now

402
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,959
having the ability to do

403
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,519
you know analytical

404
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,278
method development and develop methods

405
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,720
for things that there might not be a lot

406
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,639
of information out there is going to be

407
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,199
a real challenge for anyone that doesn't

408
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,759
have a massive amount of experience in

409
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,958
chromatography method development with

410
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,198
hplc or lcms

411
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,198
so

412
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,559
what i've noticed is several of the labs

413
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,040
that are up and running well several

414
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:52,078
there's only a few

415
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,078
most of the people doing it are very

416
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,239
young scientists and by young i don't

417
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,559
mean their physiological age but the

418
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,278
amount of experience they have

419
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,599
with this type of work and the less

420
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,799
experience you have doing this the more

421
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,240
difficult it is to expand into different

422
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:12,719
um you know species or different tests

423
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,360
and me i've been doing chromatography

424
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,399
method development for 20 years you know

425
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,120
um it's kind of funny i i just recently

426
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,000
announced that i can test for cordyceps

427
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,320
and i got some cordyceps mushrooms from

428
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
a guy on instagram you know collaborated

429
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,600
with he gave me some material to help

430
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,159
develop my method and uh

431
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,000
i had this guy's uh mushroom and an

432
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,838
extract for gosh it must have been two

433
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,159
months and i've just been so busy in my

434
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,480
day job and all the other things

435
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:45,679
involved i'm a parent i'm a father uh

436
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,360
i'm a husband and uh

437
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,439
i just didn't have time to get to it and

438
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,199
then just last weekend you know i

439
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,240
developed a method for cordyceps in two

440
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,958
days

441
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,079
and um you know a lot of people are not

442
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,919
going to have

443
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,799
the base knowledge to do something like

444
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,479
that so quickly and then you know

445
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,319
validating the method and making sure

446
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,399
it's correct you know it takes a lot

447
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,560
more work after you develop it to make

448
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,679
sure that it's correct and you know we

449
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,159
can have

450
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,838
um really challenging issues where two

451
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,519
different molecules

452
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,040
have what's called the same retention

453
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,198
time

454
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,519
and what that means is when you have a

455
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,399
complex molecule say i do an extraction

456
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,440
of a mushroom and then i put it through

457
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,839
my machine we use a column that is

458
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,320
packed with a bed of what's called resin

459
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,320
which is basically a bed of

460
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,278
a bead that has a chemical functional

461
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,759
group or a chemistry

462
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,078
uh interactive group on the surface of a

463
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,759
molecule we take our complex

464
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:47,758
mixture of mushrooms and we pass it

465
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,320
through that mole through that

466
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,959
column and all the molecules in the

467
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,000
mixture interact with the surface of

468
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:58,159
that column resin in a different way

469
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,320
this is how they start to separate out

470
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,639
and resolve from each other

471
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,160
and so when you put a sample on a column

472
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,279
you can have stuff come out within a

473
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,279
couple minutes 5 10 15 maybe even 20

474
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,798
minutes to be even longer depending on

475
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,798
how fast the flow is and how uh how much

476
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,720
interaction occurs between the molecule

477
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:19,599
of interest and the resin bed of the

478
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,160
column so these retention times is how

479
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,759
you distinguish which molecule is which

480
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,839
because if you do everything the exact

481
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:30,240
same way every time they should come out

482
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:32,000
to the same retention time within 0.05

483
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,400
minutes of each other you know within

484
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
seconds they should be very reproducible

485
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,798
now if we have two molecules that are

486
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,319
almost identical for example silicon

487
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:46,319
then psilocybin is a very subtle change

488
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:49,439
where psilocybin loses a phosphate group

489
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,279
which is a phosphorus and four oxygens

490
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,240
and when you do that you actually get a

491
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:57,918
pretty big change in the physiological

492
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,679
uh behavior or the the chemical behavior

493
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,679
of the molecule and then you get these

494
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,120
to separate very easily

495
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,960
and then with cordyceps you're actually

496
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,678
looking at molecules where it's a subtle

497
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,400
of a change of a hydrogen

498
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,480
and an oh group so a hydroxyl to a

499
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,480
hydrogen and everything else on the on

500
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,400
the molecule is identical

501
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,079
so separating those when there's such a

502
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,600
subtle change

503
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,319
is critical right because you don't want

504
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,119
to tell people you're testing cortisone

505
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,839
but

506
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,159
it's actually that peak also has either

507
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,359
adenosine or two deoxy adenosine right

508
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,759
you'll be giving them the wrong

509
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,519
information so you have to make sure

510
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,679
that with your method development that

511
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,759
you have all your controls in place and

512
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,400
all your standards

513
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,160
separating at what is called a baseline

514
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,080
resolution so that you can actually

515
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,320
quantitate or give people the

516
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,639
concentration of these analytes in their

517
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,399
mushrooms right on that was a very clear

518
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,480
uh explanation and you know i i've

519
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,559
talked about this before when i was

520
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,798
talking to dr miyabi shields on this

521
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,759
show but i really like

522
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,279
um

523
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,879
uh i don't know the artisan approach

524
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,440
where by

525
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,840
by creating these lab processes right

526
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,519
kind of you're kind of inventing your

527
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:14,240
own tools um my you know all my my my

528
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:17,119
gran my grandpa and my uncles they were

529
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,120
all uh carpenters and i remember when i

530
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,119
was a kid the first time that i realized

531
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,359
that you know they needed to do

532
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,759
something in carpentry and so they

533
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:28,319
actually developed and made a tool

534
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,640
because that tool didn't exist and the

535
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,319
idea that you could like invent tools

536
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,240
was like fascinating to me as a kid it

537
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,359
still is cool to me yeah and that's

538
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,759
essentially you know what you're

539
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:40,159
describing is that all right we've got

540
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:43,038
we've got this new box of information

541
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,880
called mushrooms and you know we need to

542
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,440
come up with tools to be able to open

543
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,679
this box uniquely and um

544
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,120
i get pretty jazzed by that

545
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,960
um let's talk about uh terpenes um i've

546
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,959
only really understood that word that

547
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,798
there have been terpenes in mushrooms

548
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,519
for about three years after it came up

549
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,558
uh uh unexpectedly uh during an

550
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,639
interview

551
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,319
and so you know since that time i have

552
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,000
been trying to learn everything i can

553
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:12,558
about um mushroom terpenes um they all

554
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,159
they seem to be incredibly subtle they

555
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:19,678
certainly don't play as big of a role to

556
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,919
to humans as as an aroma attractant as

557
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,280
they do in our our favorite plant

558
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,559
cannabis um but but you know all of the

559
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,558
mushroom research i'm talking about

560
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,038
saying they're like you know

561
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:33,678
these terpenes are going to be a bigger

562
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:36,000
deal than we take them for now

563
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,600
and so i i would like to hear what you

564
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,319
have to say about

565
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,759
um you know the terpene like like you

566
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,599
know are you testing for mushroom

567
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,200
terpenes are there a few that are

568
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,918
particularly common

569
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,679
and uh in your conversations with your

570
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:54,240
customers um uh you know do you have any

571
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,240
you know status quo of where we're at as

572
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,640
far as understanding the role that

573
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,640
terpenes play in these mushrooms

574
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,200
your last question is the easiest one to

575
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,120
answer and the role that these terpenes

576
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,440
are playing for the most part we have no

577
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:10,399
clue this is a brand new area of

578
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,840
research i mean there might be a couple

579
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,600
labs around the world that would

580
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,519
disagree with me and say they know more

581
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,599
and they probably do but these are kind

582
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,038
of obscure and i don't really know too

583
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,959
much about them

584
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,158
i'm definitely not an expert in mushroom

585
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,840
terpenes

586
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,640
because

587
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:28,000
they're so new and one thing i'd like to

588
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,840
say is they're very different from the

589
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,759
cannabinoid terpenes as you said

590
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,279
cannabinoid terpenes are typically

591
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,759
associated with

592
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,440
uh odor and providing us with that

593
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,640
beautiful profile that we get from all

594
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,640
the diversity in the cannabis plants

595
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,919
the mush sorry the terpenes found in

596
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,038
mushrooms are generally called

597
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:50,159
triterpenes so they're much larger and

598
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:53,599
they're more complex often than the ones

599
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,440
we know about in cannabis and they do

600
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,199
not have odors associated with them

601
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,960
because they're not as volatile if

602
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,919
they're volatile at all

603
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,480
and

604
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,880
they're found in some species and not

605
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,120
others for example the rishi mushroom

606
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,720
has a large group of tri-terpenes that

607
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,359
are

608
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,240
people are very interested in and they

609
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,918
are much more complicated to test for

610
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,038
right now like first of all getting

611
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,400
standards for them uh can be a challenge

612
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,480
most people that are going to be looking

613
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,519
at terpenes are going to be using mass

614
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,279
spectrometry which uh these machines are

615
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,279
very expensive and

616
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,119
flourish is definitely planning on

617
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:36,000
buying one in the near future so that i

618
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:39,119
can expand into these more

619
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,359
lower abundant molecules and ones that

620
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,678
you might not be able to find uh you

621
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,279
know authentic reference standards for

622
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,519
because

623
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,399
using a mass spectrometer you don't

624
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,679
always need a reference standard well

625
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,000
you don't need a reference standard to

626
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,519
identify things there's these databases

627
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,759
that you can pay enormous amounts of

628
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,759
money to have access to and you can

629
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,240
basically find just about any molecule

630
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:05,119
that we know exists that way if you want

631
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,798
to use a mass spectrometer to quantitate

632
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,519
then you definitely need reference

633
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:11,599
standards so

634
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,359
but i have a feeling that these terpenes

635
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,119
these tri terpenes from mushrooms are

636
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,678
going to be

637
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,479
really important i have a feeling that

638
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,840
they're going to be critical

639
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,839
in the bioactivity and the medicinal

640
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,639
properties of these mushrooms i believe

641
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,519
there's also some found in turkey tail

642
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,038
and definitely in lion's mane as well

643
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,720
and some of these other

644
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,720
mushrooms they also have these unique

645
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,200
compounds associated with them that

646
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:43,278
aren't found in other species like uh

647
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,798
you know these arinasines and uh

648
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,839
oh what's the name of the other group of

649
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,200
the compound eranasines and hersinones

650
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,720
from lion's mane they're these

651
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,759
incredibly unique

652
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,000
uh

653
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,879
dye terpenoids from the mycelium of

654
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,480
lion's mane uh and also one's in the

655
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,600
mycelium i believe

656
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,079
that's the

657
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,319
uh iron acing and i believe the hersinos

658
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,639
are more abundant in the fruiting body

659
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,399
and paul stamets has talked about these

660
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,799
quite a bit on various podcasts he's

661
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,120
been on and and you know

662
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,960
these are responsible for neurogenesis

663
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,119
and well the hypo i don't know that i

664
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,960
should say that i know there's a very

665
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,439
strong hypothesis

666
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,440
that uh these things are helping you

667
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,240
know in vivo in humans there's

668
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,159
definitely in vitro work showing that

669
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,278
these lions main compounds actually

670
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,200
initiate neurogenesis and if

671
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,599
paul stamets is also referring to other

672
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,960
work that shows when you combine

673
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,839
psilocybin

674
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,840
and lion's

675
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,960
neurogenesis and also another thing that

676
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:49,918
he's sorry i just hit the mic um

677
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,558
another thing that he led on to on one

678
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,799
of the joe rogan podcast years ago is

679
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:58,319
the combination of these two molecules

680
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:02,240
and then you add in uh niacin or vitamin

681
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:05,038
b3 and what niacin is a vasodilator and

682
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,480
it can dilate the very

683
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,558
um

684
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,159
well it dilates all blood vessels right

685
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,158
but if you think about where you need

686
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,159
these molecules to work

687
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,679
if someone is dealing with neuropathy

688
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,159
from diabetes or from some uh you know

689
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,038
traumatic injury

690
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,960
and we want to get the psilocybin and

691
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,240
the lion's mane molecules to the

692
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,600
absolute depths of the periphery of our

693
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,519
of our uh

694
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:34,158
of our circulatory system these are the

695
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,918
capillaries all the the deep parts of

696
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,480
our brain you know like where the

697
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,640
neurogenesis is needed where the

698
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,960
neurodegradation has occurred

699
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,640
and by combining all these together

700
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,120
you're going to get a stronger response

701
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,440
by the combination of the iron acines

702
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:52,719
and herzenones with the psilocybin and

703
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,960
then using something like niacin to push

704
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,558
these molecules to the absolute end of

705
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,519
the circulatory system where they're

706
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:02,319
most needed and so i think that's just

707
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,440
absolutely fascinating and i was

708
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,519
actually

709
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,278
what actually precipitated the beginning

710
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,480
of flourish labs was i was thinking

711
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,359
about making a supplement with lion's

712
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,880
mane

713
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,199
and uh

714
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,600
niacin and then you know letting people

715
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,759
get their own psilocybin but then all

716
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:22,240
these laws changed and i thought about

717
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,400
you know making this as a product

718
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,798
and then i had a couple of friends say

719
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,559
oh i think you should make a testing lab

720
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,400
which i need to shout out both of those

721
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:33,759
people a couple of really good friends

722
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,240
one's been my friend since uh college

723
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,558
uh jeffrey thank you so much for

724
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,480
pushing me towards this lab and then

725
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:42,158
another guy that he's worked with and

726
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,240
i've become friends with

727
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,840
a guy named drew and i want to thank

728
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,278
both of those guys a lot because without

729
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,720
them i probably wouldn't be here right

730
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,720
now i would have missed the boat

731
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,558
um so let's let's come at the mushroom

732
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,960
from a different um direction oh before

733
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,519
before we do that i wanted to uh just uh

734
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,759
jump on the niacin bit um you know we've

735
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,119
talked about niacin and microdosing on

736
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,599
the show here a couple times and you're

737
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:10,000
the first person to explain why niacin

738
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:13,199
is in the stack so right so thank you

739
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,720
for uh explaining that that's really a

740
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,798
valuable um

741
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,000
insight so there's actually something

742
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:22,079
really interesting about that as well um

743
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,079
niacin if you take too much you can get

744
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,558
what's called a niacin flush i have done

745
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,879
this yeah it's not fun not super

746
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:31,119
dangerous but not fun and so one of the

747
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,679
cool things about using niacin in this

748
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:36,319
context is you can prevent people from

749
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,360
taking a whole bunch of not that you

750
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:39,839
right you don't want to be the

751
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,519
psilocybin police but you know by

752
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,720
putting niacin in the microdose you're

753
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,240
not going to take too many because

754
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,000
you're going to get a nice and flush way

755
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,159
before you start tripping if you want to

756
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,079
have a macrodose just you know grab five

757
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,000
grams of some good mushrooms and go for

758
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:54,000
it i see what you're saying yeah so that

759
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,359
so that once they are on store shelves

760
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,960
it decreases

761
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,199
the likelihood that people are going to

762
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,960
take their whole bottle of

763
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,038
dose at the same time yeah for

764
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,120
jurisdictions that are worried about

765
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,640
this you know that are more conservative

766
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,239
it might be a really good thing because

767
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,480
there are molecules you could add in

768
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,240
there that will dilate your blood

769
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,679
vessels without the nice and flush

770
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,440
there's some peptides and some other

771
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,120
molecules small molecules that'll do

772
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,600
that

773
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,719
so let's talk about adulterants right so

774
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:22,639
you know

775
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,038
again most of us have got cannabis

776
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,360
analytics as our framework in our head

777
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,519
and in addition to like the cannabinoids

778
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:32,398
and the terpenes that that were that we

779
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:36,000
want um we're also especially in the

780
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:39,199
licensed system uh looking at at molds

781
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,359
and heavy metals and um and like just

782
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,720
you know chemicals from like eagle 20

783
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,678
and things like this

784
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,798
um

785
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,240
you know

786
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:49,759
mushrooms are not grown the same way as

787
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,720
plants of course

788
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,158
so from your perspective um

789
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,360
what

790
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,559
what

791
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:02,240
substances might we be

792
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:04,480
searching for in mushrooms in the lab

793
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,440
that would suggest that they were

794
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,159
perhaps

795
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,360
grown incorrectly or in in an unclean

796
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,840
environment which would cause us to

797
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,959
reject batches of mushrooms i don't know

798
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,000
what that would be but i'm assuming

799
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,240
there are

800
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,398
there's yeah i'm i'm not a mushroom

801
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,200
grower i never have grown mushrooms so

802
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:22,959
i'm

803
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,798
a little bit

804
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,600
uneducated here the cool thing about

805
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,278
mushrooms if you screw it up my

806
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,918
understanding is a lot of times you

807
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,519
don't get anything like if you get a

808
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,600
contamination

809
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,158
a lot of times the contamination will

810
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,759
outrun the mushrooms that you're growing

811
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,799
so you basically just have to throw it

812
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,038
out

813
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,918
i'm i'm sure there are situations where

814
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:47,919
people are growing with

815
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,240
maybe substrates that might have heavy

816
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,360
metals in them or substrates that might

817
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,839
be contaminated with a

818
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:59,278
some sort of organism that would be

819
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:01,839
unhealthy for us and so i absolutely

820
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,759
plan on instituting this type of testing

821
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,079
at flourish labs

822
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:09,359
as well i believe when

823
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:12,879
it comes time for the regulated legal

824
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:15,599
testing under 109 you will be looking

825
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:19,278
for contaminants like heavy metals and

826
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,879
uh you know bacteria or other fungi that

827
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,359
could be dangerous to humans that might

828
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,399
be slow growing and we'll use a pcr

829
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,918
genetic test to determine these things

830
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,959
which is really pretty straightforward

831
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,880
not difficult to do

832
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,480
and going to be critical again because

833
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,360
you're taking you're basically making a

834
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,038
food

835
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,639
right or a medicine for somebody that

836
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,440
they're going to ingest in their body

837
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,200
and it has to be clean

838
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,038
right on so let's let's get back to the

839
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,200
analytics so

840
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,480
i understand that you know one of the

841
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,640
things that are interesting about

842
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,720
mushrooms is that not only do they have

843
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,480
um you know common

844
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,278
uh um

845
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,919
common constituents that are just used

846
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:03,119
in and applied in novel ways in fungus

847
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:06,640
but also there are some um constituents

848
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:09,839
that that um uh don't occur very often

849
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,840
except in mushrooms and the type of uh

850
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,759
labs that we're almost familiar with

851
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,839
they're they're using uh chemical

852
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:19,038
standards for

853
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:21,199
um for these constituents and then um

854
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:24,000
you know using the technology compare

855
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,319
against the standard um to then figure

856
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,679
out how much of it is in any particular

857
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,599
mushroom i'm i'm guessing that since um

858
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,679
you know the philosophy mushroom is

859
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,079
still a schedule one at the federal

860
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,798
level that some of these standards uh

861
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:41,278
might actually be challenging to get

862
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:43,038
your hands on but i'm willing to be open

863
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:45,440
to the path to the fact that maybe they

864
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:48,000
all already exist and it's just been

865
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,919
access to them for years and years so so

866
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,319
tell us a little bit about how difficult

867
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,360
standards are to be able to obtain to do

868
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,798
the work

869
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:56,879
yes this is one of the most common

870
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:58,839
questions i get from people and you'd be

871
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,278
surprised how easy it is

872
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:05,119
um so there's a philosophy here that is

873
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,038
pretty um

874
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:09,199
straightforward so

875
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:12,079
these molecules you you have to take a

876
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,919
certain dose right and so in order to

877
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,759
get the standards you contact these

878
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,080
chemical companies and they basically

879
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:21,278
have one milligram per milliliter

880
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,480
solutions that you can buy they're dea

881
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,119
exempt

882
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,200
because you're paying anywhere from 70

883
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,839
to a few hundred dollars for a single

884
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,919
milligram nobody's gonna be abusing

885
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,000
these things you're you're gonna you can

886
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,960
go down the street and find them for way

887
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,440
cheaper

888
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,480
right so they're dea exempt when it's a

889
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,159
milligram or less and they're often in

890
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,480
solvents you would never put in your

891
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,240
body so

892
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,839
it's too much of a hassle to try to get

893
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,159
these and abuse them it's super

894
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,079
expensive and no one would ever do it

895
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,240
that's why their dea exam now if you go

896
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,839
trying to buy five grams or you try

897
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,640
grand more than or you're drying up

898
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:01,439
trying to dry buy a powder then you need

899
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,640
a dea license but just for single

900
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,480
milligram

901
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,038
uh one mig per ml reference standards

902
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,839
all you need is a legitimate laboratory

903
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:08,798
and

904
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:10,558
uh

905
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,319
by legitimate laboratory

906
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,000
when you start a company like this or

907
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,720
you have a laboratory you're starting in

908
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,359
a non-profit or in a university you know

909
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,759
the companies vet your location like you

910
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,398
can't have a mail service you can't have

911
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,240
you need a legitimate commercial

912
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:27,918
laboratory location for them to even

913
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,759
send them to you so that's the that's

914
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,519
where the level of of uh sort of uh

915
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,519
regulation comes in by the actual

916
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,480
chemical companies they won't just sell

917
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,599
them to anybody also right on cool all

918
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,200
right so let's talk about um sampling um

919
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,599
as we all know

920
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,960
um people game the system all the time

921
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:50,879
in cannabis

922
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,960
by um by which flowers they choose to

923
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,278
send to the lab maybe they're just

924
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,759
sending colas or maybe they'll roll the

925
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,679
flower in keith first or you know

926
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,839
whatever they're going to do it's it's

927
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,720
not a representative sample which

928
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:07,038
scientifically is is actually quite

929
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,878
a process of having and having and

930
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:12,000
having um

931
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,759
a large lot all the way down to a small

932
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,159
lot but but when you're done

933
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,119
mathematically it's it's representative

934
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,480
of the entire lot um when it comes to

935
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,000
mushrooms though

936
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,800
um uh

937
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,519
i don't know what a sampling uh process

938
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,599
is like and so does it matter which

939
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,639
mushrooms you pick like can you game the

940
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,960
system

941
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,878
by sending like a larger or a smaller

942
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,079
one tell us a little bit about that

943
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:40,719
yes so uh one of the most interesting

944
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,399
things about these mushrooms to me is

945
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,279
the variability

946
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,878
of the alkaloid content from

947
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,679
flush to flush

948
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:52,319
from mushroom to mushroom and also

949
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,480
within the mushrooms themselves

950
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,480
so

951
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,160
i believe it's going to be a lot harder

952
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,519
to adulter them than with cannabis for a

953
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,319
couple reasons we can get to that in a

954
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:05,519
moment but i had a customer interested

955
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,400
in looking at the various uh structural

956
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,920
aspects of the mushroom and

957
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,079
so when the mushrooms are growing you

958
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,519
know the way that they grow

959
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,680
the the cap and the stem appear fused

960
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:19,599
for a really long time and some

961
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:22,559
mushrooms have a veil which is like a

962
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,960
little skirt around the uh the cap that

963
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:28,880
attaches to the

964
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:32,400
the stock and then when that opens then

965
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,119
the uh the spores are able to drop from

966
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,440
the mushroom cap now i've been told by

967
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,280
growers that and also seeing research in

968
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,599
the literature where

969
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,519
most likely the most potent time to

970
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,160
harvest is just before

971
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:48,400
the caps open and the veils open like so

972
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,920
everything is closed up

973
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,838
however

974
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,039
if you look even more carefully i had a

975
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:58,000
customer like section the mushroom

976
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:00,480
uh from the step the the bottom of the

977
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,039
stem up to the tip of the cap when we

978
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,400
looked at the lower part of the stem

979
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:08,719
and we looked at the the stem and

980
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,240
the junction of the stem and the cap

981
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:12,959
right there so it like

982
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:15,439
he took about i don't know a few

983
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,280
a half a centimeter to the right

984
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,200
of the stock side and about a half a

985
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,000
centimeter to the right of the left of

986
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,159
the

987
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,239
of the cap and he sliced that and then

988
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:26,078
he took the top of the cap and when we

989
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:27,759
looked at that that center piece where

990
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,079
the veil connected to the stalk and the

991
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,480
cap was by far the most potent part of

992
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,400
the mushroom oh that's interesting yeah

993
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,079
yeah like like twofold more potent than

994
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,920
the cap and maybe like two and a half to

995
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,519
three times more potent than the stem

996
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,440
that's a really funny answer because

997
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,920
everybody argues about whether or not

998
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,679
stems or caps are are the most potent

999
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,680
but actually it's it's where they join

1000
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:51,118
well in that instance definitely because

1001
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,078
i've also seen

1002
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,559
uh

1003
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,560
just recently a guy on instagram showed

1004
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:57,440
that the stock was more potent than the

1005
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:59,920
cap

1006
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,358
and so this opens up a whole host of

1007
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,079
questions around

1008
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:06,719
mushroom cultivation right so we've

1009
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,240
learned a ton about steering plants to

1010
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:11,519
produce molecules cannabis with thc or

1011
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,319
cbd

1012
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,519
other plants you know that like

1013
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,760
to produce

1014
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,960
compounds of interest for pharmaceutical

1015
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,960
or or industrial purposes

1016
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,039
i'm really interested to see if we can

1017
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,760
do this with fungi

1018
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:30,079
and once these growers get out of the

1019
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,680
basements and closets and start making

1020
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,560
these commercial facilities and they're

1021
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:37,598
able to control their environments with

1022
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,960
really high level um

1023
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,880
uh

1024
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,199
man i'm missing a lot of words today i

1025
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,720
totally apologize

1026
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:46,319
high fidelity control of their

1027
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:47,838
environment you know they can tune it up

1028
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,480
or down a couple degrees a couple

1029
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:52,719
percent humidity they control co2 oxygen

1030
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,960
levels light dark

1031
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,639
when the when the mushroom growers get

1032
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,960
these tools are they going to be able to

1033
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,759
produce highly consistent batches they

1034
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,519
might

1035
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,760
well they might not also because maybe

1036
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,320
the mushrooms control this in a way we

1037
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,720
don't understand

1038
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,800
i did briefly read an abstract of a

1039
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:13,118
paper last night where they claimed that

1040
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,280
they could influence the alkaloids in

1041
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,119
the mushrooms by

1042
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,880
growth conditions

1043
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,039
so it's definitely possible it's just

1044
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,440
going to take a massive effort

1045
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:26,159
of research and development on the on

1046
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,960
the mushroom grower part growers parts

1047
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:31,279
to

1048
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:34,240
you know normalize cultivation so that

1049
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,400
people that are producing products

1050
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:38,319
can grab a batch from the same grower

1051
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,200
every time and know more or less that

1052
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,519
their product is going to uh

1053
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,679
come out the way they expect

1054
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:48,559
now if this is not the case it's really

1055
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:50,799
good news for labs like myself because

1056
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,279
if they have a consistent batch every

1057
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,800
time you don't necessarily have to touch

1058
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,839
test every batch of raw material before

1059
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,760
you make a product right but if you're

1060
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:03,838
varying more than 10

1061
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,520
of your raw material batches they're

1062
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:07,199
going to have to test every batch so

1063
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:08,800
they know how to make

1064
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:11,039
their products so then i would be able

1065
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,720
to be testing pre-product formation and

1066
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:14,480
then i would be testing their products

1067
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,559
as well so

1068
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,240
for the growers and the product

1069
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:21,279
and the producers and people making

1070
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:23,039
product i hope that they can

1071
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,079
normalize to grow

1072
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,519
and get consistent batches

1073
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,039
it will just help them save a lot of

1074
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,559
money you know and the testing we're

1075
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,880
going to be there we're going to be

1076
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,039
required to test everything before it

1077
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,440
hits the shelves if there ever is retail

1078
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:40,320
or before it hits the clinic before it's

1079
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,519
given to patients so you know our niche

1080
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,119
is there

1081
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,039
but we're definitely available to help

1082
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,160
if that is the case where they need pre

1083
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:50,000
and post testing right on so let's go

1084
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,000
ahead and take a short break and when we

1085
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,599
come back we're going to continue down

1086
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,358
the same um

1087
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,440

00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,000
importance of home growing so you don't

1170
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:50,399
have to rely on others to feel healthy

1171
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,719
well the magical butter machine can

1172
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,880
empower your personal health by putting

1173
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,719
you in control of how you use cannabis

1174
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,960
in your daily life

1175
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:01,279
i've been making my own butters and oils

1176
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,119
on the stove for years and i much prefer

1177
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,839
the ease of using the magical butter

1178
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,680
machine i just set it and walk away

1179
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:10,400
with the simple touch of a button the

1180
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:13,199

choose not only that if you pick the

1206

no customer service

1231
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,680
i invited hembra to advertise on shaping

1232
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,520
fire after hearing so many good stories

1233
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:08,159
about them from my friends

1234
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:10,559
they have a plus customer service with

1235
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:12,480
lightning fast response times

1236
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:13,838

1240
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,920
most seed banks are simply not this

1241
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,880

1242

welcome back you are listening to

1256
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,519
shaping fire i am your host shango los

1257
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,640
and my guest today is biochemist george

1258
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:02,639
selhorn

1259
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:05,279
so during the first set we talked a lot

1260
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,279
about uh what is actually in mushrooms

1261
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,680
in general but specific philosophy that

1262
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,920
we want to test for and then we talked a

1263
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:13,679
bunch about the things that might be in

1264
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,039
mushrooms that we don't that mean that

1265
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:16,639
we want to test for that that we don't

1266
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,119
want to have in there

1267
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:20,480
um let's talk a little bit more about

1268
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,960
the mushroom

1269
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,280
itself and getting getting it prepped

1270
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,679
for the analytics um

1271
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:31,839
do mushrooms always have to be dried

1272
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:35,279
first to test or can we test them fresh

1273
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:38,880
and and do can we can we only

1274
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,240
compare fresh tests against fresh tests

1275
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,358
or can we

1276
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:45,759
compare fresh tests against dry tests

1277
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:47,279
because because the water aspect doesn't

1278
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,000
matter

1279
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,200
yes we can absolutely test wet or dry

1280
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,119
mushrooms

1281
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:56,239
dry mushrooms are a little easier to

1282
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,160
homogenize than a wet mushroom but it's

1283
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,239
totally possible and

1284
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:01,440
we control for moisture you know we do

1285
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,239
dry weights

1286
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,318
dry weight measurements in the end so

1287
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,159
basically if i were to get a dried

1288
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:10,719
mushroom from

1289
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:12,480
a batch and a wet mushroom from a batch

1290
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:15,759
what i would do is

1291
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,240
homogenize both individually

1292
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,319
and then you weigh out a sample

1293
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:22,799
and then you extract it and you do the

1294
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:26,318
hplc and you get your numbers

1295
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,599
and then i always ask for a little bit

1296
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:29,440
extra

1297
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,760
you know you need a portion of mushroom

1298
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,720
to do the analytics on and you need a

1299
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,440
portion of the mushroom to dehydrate so

1300
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:39,679
you can get the true dry weight so

1301
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,079
even when i get a dried mushroom from a

1302
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:44,159
customer i will take a small bit of it

1303
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,920
and you know i basically have a little

1304
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:48,239
dehydrating oven

1305
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,639
that will uh

1306
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,239
completely dry it out at i use 104

1307
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:53,358
degrees so it's not too hot and it

1308
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:54,719
doesn't matter right because i'm not

1309
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:57,679
actually testing the part that you

1310
00:47:54,719 --> 00:48:00,318
dehydrate you pull out a sample first to

1311
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:02,000
do the testing so it doesn't get any

1312
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:04,318
heat treatment light or

1313
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,800
oxidative degradation

1314
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,558
and just at the end all you do is a math

1315
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,318
adjustment to adjust for the loss of

1316
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,319
water just like in cannabis so it

1317
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,719
doesn't matter what the water content is

1318
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:17,039
you can compare any mushroom as long as

1319
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:19,439
you fully dehydrate a sample and

1320
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:22,719
calculate the dry weight percentage

1321
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,559
typically um how much of a sample

1322
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:27,118
in in dry weight because i'm figuring

1323
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:31,200
dry is is almost 100 of what everybody's

1324
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:33,280
using yeah but um uh how big of a sample

1325
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,399
do you think a lab is going to request

1326
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,200
most of the time

1327
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,200
um because uh you know same thing in

1328
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,439
cannabis having a little bit extra is

1329
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:43,279
helpful especially if something comes up

1330
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,440
and goes wrong yeah you have tests yeah

1331
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,319
exactly so what do sample

1332
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,240
samples volumes or sizes look like for

1333
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:53,358
mushrooms

1334
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:55,598
uh so for me i prefer two grams uh two

1335
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:57,598
grams is plenty for me

1336
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,519
i've seen other labs ask for three four

1337
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,480
and five grams which in my humble

1338
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:05,599
opinion is a little bit excessive uh but

1339
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,000
for for the way i do it is i get two

1340
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,160
grams from a customer and typically

1341
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,920
uh most people are fully dehydrating

1342
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:14,639
these things themselves

1343
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,200
uh i would say an average like

1344
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:19,598
you know air dried mushroom has about 10

1345
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:21,439
percent moisture but most of the ones

1346
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,119
that i'm getting for from people only

1347
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,200
have about one percent moisture so

1348
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,519
they're fully dehydrating before i get

1349
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:29,919
them so i usually make a very small dry

1350
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:32,880
weight adjustment but yeah two grams is

1351
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,240
plenty for me i keep one gram for the

1352
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,960
dehydration step and i keep one gram for

1353
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:43,199
analytics because for the analytics i

1354
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,039
use about 250 to 350 milligrams so that

1355
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,919
gives me at least two tests two

1356
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,920
extractions that if i had to extract

1357
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,280
their sample twice then i have plenty

1358
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,800
for the extractions and plenty for the

1359
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,559
dehydration

1360
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,119
one of the challenges that was very

1361
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,800
common with labs at the beginning of a

1362
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,079
licensed cannabis

1363
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,920
was

1364
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:06,160
testing edibles because um

1365
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,639
it's so much it's so much more difficult

1366
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:11,039
to target in on the cannabinoids when

1367
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,480
you've got you know god knows what else

1368
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:13,519
is in this brownie

1369
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,159
um

1370
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:18,719
is it uniquely more difficult to find

1371
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,480
mushroom metabolites in chocolate or

1372
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:23,039
other edibles because you know

1373
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,280
chocolates and honey and gummies seem to

1374
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,440
be the the three

1375
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,280
ways that um

1376
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,880
mushroom edibles are first coming to

1377
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,240
market

1378
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,280
right

1379
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:38,159
so there's an interesting chemistry

1380
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,119
problem here and it's both in cannabis

1381
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:41,598
and

1382
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,519
in uh mushroom stuff so real quickly on

1383
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,079
cannabis we know that the cannabinoids

1384
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:48,079
are fat soluble they're they're

1385
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,318
hydrophobic molecules which is why it's

1386
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,400
really easy to make a chocolate bar with

1387
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:54,480
cannabis because it has a bunch of fat

1388
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,720
in it whereas it's way more difficult to

1389
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,880
make a consistent gummy

1390
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:01,519
because you're putting a hydrophobic

1391
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,920
molecule into a water-based product a

1392
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:06,639
gummy now we flip this when we go to the

1393
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,559
mushrooms it's super easy to make really

1394
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:10,239
consistent gummies all the gummies that

1395
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,440
i've tested from people

1396
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,719
have been

1397
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,079
really consistent and then flip that the

1398
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:18,480
chocolate bar and now you're trying to

1399
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,599
put a water soluble molecule into a fat

1400
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,199
soluble product so the consistency in

1401
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:26,000
the chocolate bar is more challenging

1402
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:29,358
with an alkaloid than a terpene from

1403
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,838
cannabis and i test for both i have

1404
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:34,400
methods for edibles extracts and

1405
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:36,000
fruiting bodies so i can do all of those

1406
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,960
things

1407
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
i

1408
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,440
think

1409
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,440
this is the only lab in the country

1410
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,880
doing edibles but i'm not positive i

1411
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,880
haven't seen advertisements for anybody

1412
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,760
else doing edibles well that certainly

1413
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,119
explains why i'm seeing the growth in

1414
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,640
mushroom

1415
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,039
uh

1416
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:56,078
um you know gummies and gelatin based

1417
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,838
stuff uh you know traditionally

1418
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:01,039
chocolates have been incredibly popular

1419
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:03,920
but if the if the if the homogenization

1420
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:06,480
is a problem that's a that's a big deal

1421
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,838
breaker as far as consistency and and as

1422
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,880
we all know especially with a

1423
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:12,480
psychedelic yeah right yeah exactly um

1424
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,519
and and as we know like during the

1425
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,800
transition from um you know the the

1426
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:20,719
heritage market to the medicinal market

1427
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,280
you know the semi-legal medicinal market

1428
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:26,239
and then a licensed market in cannabis

1429
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,040
that you know the biggest reason

1430
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:32,078
uh to go in that direction is for

1431
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:34,400
consistency for patients right right and

1432
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:37,200
we're ju we're we're climbing that same

1433
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,800
mountain now with mushrooms trying to

1434
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:41,118
figure out what is that absolutely

1435
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:44,160
what's the best way to create repeatable

1436
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:46,000
results for patients um

1437
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,480
because you know that that's the that's

1438
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,039
the only reason for legalization in in

1439
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,318
my or not legalization but licensing

1440
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:54,000
because i don't i don't really believe

1441
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:57,119
that the state should be involved with

1442
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,519
licensing or taxing this at all but i do

1443
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,240
like the idea of there being consistency

1444
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,719
in the products uh because in the end my

1445
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:06,399
number one priority is is patience so

1446
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,639
yeah so that makes some sense here's why

1447
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,240
the gummies are kind of everywhere now

1448
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:14,318
yeah yeah and you know there's a

1449
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:17,598
downside to these edible things too like

1450
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:19,679
sugar is such a huge problem in this

1451
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,280
western culture and

1452
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:24,239
you know everybody wants to put it in

1453
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,720
this sweet candy it's just it's not the

1454
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,919
best route for medicine in my opinion

1455
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:30,558
yeah i'm with i'm with you on that

1456
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,318
that's why i've pushed um tinctures as a

1457
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,559
great primary thing because

1458
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:36,400
you know okay with capsules you're kind

1459
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,359
of uh well for cannabis anyway with

1460
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,800
cannabis uh capsules you're gonna have a

1461
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:42,558
whole bunch that are exactly the same

1462
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,559
and there's no variability from day to

1463
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,160
day and then you know all these people

1464
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:48,240
are eating all these 10 milligram

1465
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:49,920
cookies and you know that's not

1466
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:52,558
necessarily great for patients either

1467
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,920
yeah right so with mushrooms it's great

1468
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,000
right because it's water-soluble we

1469
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,880
could make teas and beverages without

1470
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,719
sugar you could even make a concentrate

1471
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,559
into a few milliliters like in it you

1472
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:04,000
could make like a shot size and just

1473
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,720
boom right there you know because it's

1474
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,199
so easy to get these alkaloids into

1475
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,239
water they're water soluble and there's

1476
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:12,558
actually a really interesting thing i'd

1477
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:13,759
like to add here something that i've

1478
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,800
discovered

1479
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:19,440
over the last six months since i started

1480
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:23,119
this company

1481
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,760
a one milligram dose in a gummy is not

1482
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:28,960
the same as a one milligram dose in a

1483
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,079
fruiting body and my hypothesis

1484
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,400
which is

1485
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,000
supported by the types of molecules that

1486
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,079
make up the fungal

1487
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,920
biomass

1488
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,798
mushrooms are essentially a time release

1489
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,358
pill

1490
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:43,838
we do not have enzymes in our gut to

1491
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:45,440
digest chitin which is the cell wall of

1492
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:46,159
fungal biomass

1493
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,920
so

1494
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:50,078
all of the degradation that takes place

1495
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,559
in the stomach and the gut is through

1496
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,760
the acidity of our stomach

1497
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:58,160
so the acid in our gut is going to break

1498
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,079
the mushroom down slowly and slowly

1499
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:02,399
release the alkaloid content of the

1500
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,720
mushroom over a period of time

1501
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,720
whereas you take a gummy and it has one

1502
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:08,159
milligram in it because it's been tested

1503
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:09,838
and we know it has one milligram of

1504
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:13,118
silicon in it

1505
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:14,798
or say 1.3 milligrams of psilocybin

1506
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,000
because there's a conversion factor

1507
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:18,719
there

1508
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,798
you can feel one milligram in a gummy

1509
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:23,279
you will not feel one milligram in an

1510
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:23,920
average potent mushroom

1511
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,000
so

1512
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,358
it comes down a lot faster too yes

1513
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,199
you're basically getting all of the

1514
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:30,880
alkaloid dissolving immediately you get

1515
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:33,039
this full milligram going into your

1516
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,480
bloodstream all at the same time it's

1517
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:36,880
going to hit your receptors and cause an

1518
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,719
effect so what i'm saying excuse me what

1519
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,640
i'm saying is for people out there they

1520
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:43,039
start getting a hold of gummies

1521
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,000
you know go easy first your mileage may

1522
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,759
vary

1523
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,880
yeah your mileage may vary take less

1524
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,960
than more

1525
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,720
initially and if it's been lab tested

1526
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,039
that'll give you a really good metric

1527
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,719
for your you know dosing yourself you

1528
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:56,079
know and i i think with cannabis that's

1529
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,480
been one of the coolest things is people

1530
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:00,240
like okay i know what one milligram five

1531
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,519
milligrams 10 milligrams is going to do

1532
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:03,199
to me now

1533
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:04,960
so let let's talk about what's in that

1534
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:07,279
gummy right not not the actual gummy and

1535
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,318
the sugar itself but

1536
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,160
you know

1537
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:13,199
if if what's in the gummy is not

1538
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:15,598
um

1539
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,598
pulverized and powdered mushroom it

1540
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:20,798
means that there is an extraction

1541
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:23,760
happening first and then the result of

1542
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:28,079
that extraction is what's going into the

1543
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:30,960
gelatin process what is that extraction

1544
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,839
it can vary um so a lot of people are

1545
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:36,240
using 100 ethanol or grain alcohol

1546
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:38,639
because for one it's uh you know you're

1547
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:41,199
allowed to consume it and for number two

1548
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:43,199
it's easy to evaporate off

1549
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:44,399
so um

1550
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:46,399
this is something i've actually been

1551
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,920
helping a lot of people uh with their

1552
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,920
product development i've been kind of

1553
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,920
doing consulting for people which i'm

1554
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,000
definitely open to doing if anybody's

1555
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,400
interested but because i have tons of

1556
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,480
extraction experience both in cannabis

1557
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,680
and in mushrooms and in plant material

1558
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,079
in general because i've done that my

1559
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:05,279
whole life in the lab and as a as a

1560
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:07,519
recreational cannabis user

1561
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,960
you can extract with water you can

1562
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:10,719
extract with

1563
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,119
acidified water

1564
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:16,078
you know add citrus juice or something

1565
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:19,200
you can extract with methanol ethanol

1566
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:21,599
acetic acid

1567
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:24,318
however you want to be able to

1568
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:26,079
obviously people don't use methanol when

1569
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:28,480
they're doing products like you're

1570
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:30,720
making anything to be consumed i use

1571
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,519
methanol in the lab because it's the

1572
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:35,199
best one for extraction for

1573
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:36,079
uh quantitation

1574
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:38,399
um

1575
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,920
my biggest i would

1576
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,039
say the best solvent to use for

1577
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:46,000
extracting mushrooms is 100 ethanol so

1578
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:48,880
grain alcohol you don't want to use lab

1579
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,838
100 ethanol because these are

1580
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:54,000
uh cut with really nasty adulterants to

1581
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:56,318
remove the last bit of water so

1582
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,559
everclear is the best

1583
00:57:56,318 --> 00:58:00,798
if you're at home and you're not sure

1584
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:03,839
what to use and the great thing about

1585
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:06,798
alcohol especially 100 alcohol

1586
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:09,679
is with very mild heat you can boil that

1587
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:11,039
off so say you have an ounce of uh of

1588
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:13,279
mushroom material that you want to

1589
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:16,239
extract as much as the psilocybin out as

1590
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,160
silicon and psilocybinators alkaloids so

1591
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:20,879
you will do a mechanical extraction

1592
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:23,199
either with you grind it up you can put

1593
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,200
it in a vessel you can just shake it

1594
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:28,078
with a shaker you can use a vortex you

1595
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:30,159
can use a more powerful method or like

1596
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,318
ultrasonication or some way to get the

1597
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:35,118
alkaloids out of the mushroom

1598
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:37,599
then you filter your biomass out and you

1599
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,720
have this liquid with your mushroom

1600
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,720
extract

1601
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:43,519
now fortunately

1602
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:47,039
the the alkaloids are pretty good well

1603
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:48,400
resistant to mild heat so you can add

1604
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:52,079
you know

1605
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:55,599
80 90 100 degree fahrenheit heat to this

1606
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:57,760
to this alcohol extract and boil it off

1607
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,280
until it's reduced to whatever volume

1608
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,200
you want

1609
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,640
and then you would add a little bit of

1610
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:04,399
water

1611
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,318
and then you boil off the rest of the

1612
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,920
ethanol and you have all of your

1613
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:09,920
alkaloids in distilled water

1614
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,798
and then you have a clean extract no

1615
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,000
harmful compounds unless there's

1616
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:17,358
something in the mushrooms you didn't

1617
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,280
know about unless there's something in

1618
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:22,719
your solvent you didn't know about but

1619
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,400
that's the cleanest way to produce a uh

1620
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:26,719
psilocybin extract and that also gives

1621
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,480
you control over concentration as well

1622
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:30,000
you know most uh sorry go ahead i was

1623
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,559
just gonna say and if that's how they

1624
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,798
are doing it um often when they're

1625
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:37,040
making these uh

1626
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:38,798
these edibles that's great but also that

1627
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:40,639
is a pretty simple process that is

1628
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:42,400
something that a citizen scientist or a

1629
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:44,159
home user would be able to do as well

1630
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,119
100 and that's kind of why i said it

1631
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:46,639
because

1632
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,400
mostly what i think people are doing is

1633
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:50,480
they're kind of afraid to work with

1634
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,760
solvents which you know very

1635
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,679
understandable

1636
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,400
but just pure grain alcohol is totally

1637
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:58,078
safe and

1638
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,400
a lot of people i believe are trying to

1639
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,559
extract in water

1640
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,240
and they're unable to reach these higher

1641
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,000
concentrations and there's other tricks

1642
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:08,159
you can do too right i said you have an

1643
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,519
ounce of mushrooms you extract into i

1644
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:14,480
don't know 100 milliliters of a solution

1645
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,280
you can filter that biomass out take

1646
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,599
that

1647
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:20,559
sample that you have your extract in and

1648
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:22,480
use a fresh mushroom batch to re-extract

1649
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:26,160
right because the the solvent has a

1650
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:27,679
certain capacity to hold alkaloids and

1651
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:31,039
you're never going to saturate that

1652
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:32,399
solution with one extraction so that's

1653
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:34,558
another way you can increase the

1654
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:38,240
concentration of your extraction by

1655
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:40,319
using the same solvent or water on fresh

1656
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:42,399
batches of biomass

1657
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:44,400
right and you combine that with the

1658
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,079
alcohol thing then you can achieve

1659
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,200
really high concentrations and and you

1660
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:51,760
know be able to make gummies or

1661
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:53,358
any kind of product by just diluting a

1662
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,359
little bit of it out

1663
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:59,598
that's the same way that i get my um

1664
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:01,920
cannabis tinctures for myself for

1665
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,359
treating my brain injury up to the

1666
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,119
numbers that i want them to be so i

1667
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:07,920
don't have to take like freaking five

1668
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:10,240
six eight squirts right um i'll do a you

1669
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:13,760
know not a single and not a double but a

1670
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:16,879
triple maceration so introduce the same

1671
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,240
ethanol to fresh plant material three

1672
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,519
times yes

1673
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,279
so and what did you call it it's

1674
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:22,838
carrying capacity

1675
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,240
um

1676
01:01:22,838 --> 01:01:26,400
uh what

1677
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:28,479
uh the uh whatever it wasn't supposed to

1678
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,960
be a quiz but but the the the total

1679
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,240
amount of cannabinoids the ethanol can

1680
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,240
hold because that that's where i want it

1681
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:36,000
to be right i want it to be at the

1682
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:38,239
highest so yeah the saturation point

1683
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,719
essentially yeah so so i don't have to

1684
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:42,318
take in any more everclear or you know

1685
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,639
whatever the ethanol is that i'm that

1686
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:46,159
i'm using for it right and some people

1687
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:47,920
you know especially

1688
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:49,440
uh you know recovered alcoholics or

1689
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,200
people that don't consume alcohol they

1690
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,599
don't want that yeah so you need to have

1691
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:54,318
an alternative and luckily we can boil

1692
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,760
off

1693
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:58,318
uh the

1694
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,160
uh solvent pretty easy

1695
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,400
and one thing i want to add to that real

1696
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,838
quick is uh

1697
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:08,079
i've seen studies where people

1698
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:10,639
treat the psybin alkaloids up to 60

1699
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:11,760
degrees celsius which is 140 degrees

1700
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:14,000
fahrenheit

1701
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,079
and even with you know relatively short

1702
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,159
treatments 5 10 15 20 minutes you don't

1703
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,798
get much degradation so that's why you

1704
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:22,960
can heat these up to 100 degrees

1705
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:25,119
fahrenheit and get almost no degradation

1706
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,838
if it's for a short time you could also

1707
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:29,838
institute a rotovap which is a rotating

1708
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:31,199
evaporator we use in the lab with mild

1709
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:32,880
heat and that you know if you've got the

1710
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,798
money to buy a road of app for example

1711
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,519
that will go even faster so there's

1712
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:39,679
tools out there to be able to do this

1713
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:41,838
i know that you've already said that

1714
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:43,838
you're not a mushroom cultivator so you

1715
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,199
may not have anything to say about this

1716
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:48,400
question but

1717
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:52,239
people will indeed be curious if if you

1718
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:55,119
have come across any ways um that

1719
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:58,239
cultivators can increase their potency

1720
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:00,400
um in you know in their growing bins

1721
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:03,038
perhaps from a conversation with you

1722
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,639
know a client of yours or something you

1723
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:07,599
know because people are always looking

1724
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:10,879
to increase potency and clearly you know

1725
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:12,640
getting good uh you know genetics is is

1726
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:16,400
you know probably the number one thing

1727
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:17,519
but do you have anything else to add

1728
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,280
i

1729
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:22,239
the one thing that comes to mind is i've

1730
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:25,359
heard people talk about co2 levels i

1731
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:26,399
believe co2 levels are important for

1732
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:28,318
triggering

1733
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,720
fruiting body formation

1734
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:33,920
and so i would imagine

1735
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:37,199
that um the air composition oxygen to

1736
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:39,599
co2 ratio and temperature are probably

1737
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:41,519
super important i saw this really

1738
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:44,640
interesting post last night on instagram

1739
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:46,639
that paul stamets put out and he was

1740
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:48,879
saying that

1741
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:51,759
the temperature of the mushroom is

1742
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,798
cooler than its surroundings

1743
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,400
and so

1744
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:56,880
it has like this

1745
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:59,760
endothermic behavior when the fruiting

1746
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,920
body is is forming and by endothermic i

1747
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,760
mean it actually absorbs is able to

1748
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,079
absorb heat because it's like a heat

1749
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,559
sink it's like a heat sink yeah so an

1750
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,839
exothermic chemical reaction produces

1751
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:13,760
heat and an endothermic

1752
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:15,838
reaction sucks heat out away from the

1753
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,280
reaction so for example

1754
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:19,920
um

1755
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,920
when you mix like acetonitrile and water

1756
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,720
together which is the solvents i use in

1757
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,000
the lab for analytics it gets cold and

1758
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:27,439
you have to let it warm up to room

1759
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,079
temperature before you use it that's an

1760
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:33,679
endothermic reaction so this chemical

1761
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:35,599
reaction occurs and then this mass now

1762
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:38,318
absorbs heat from the environment

1763
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:41,760
because the reaction like costs that

1764
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:44,480
biomass heat or that mass not biomass um

1765
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:47,039
but yeah so you know temperature

1766
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:49,280
uh co2 oxygen are probably the first

1767
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:51,920
metrics i would look at but again that's

1768
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,839
that's a hypothesis based on very

1769
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,798
limited information good enough we'll

1770
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:56,719
take that

1771
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:58,079
um so um

1772
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:01,038
this is i guess this is a little bit of

1773
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:02,480
a fanboy question but um you know what

1774
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,359
what varieties are you seeing

1775
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:08,079
consistently getting high potency

1776
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:10,400
results i mean online just from based on

1777
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:12,640
people's talking um i i think that most

1778
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:15,200
people would put uh you know whatever

1779
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:17,679
version of a penis envy at the top of

1780
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:20,480
that list but but you're you know you're

1781
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:22,159
in a unique place because you're

1782
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,480
interacting with people who are growing

1783
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:28,078
a wide variety and you're seeing the

1784
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,440
test results um and uh

1785
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:30,880
um

1786
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,599
yeah i think i'll just stop there what

1787
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,680
are you seeing yeah uh the most potent

1788
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:38,240
mushroom i've seen so far is an ape

1789
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:42,000
which i believe is a penis envy variety

1790
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:43,759
albino penis envy yep yep and uh

1791
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,880
i've actually seen some variability in

1792
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:49,839
different apes but uh the highest

1793
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,480
potency i've seen so far is 1.8 percent

1794
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:53,759
dry weight and uh

1795
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,400
um

1796
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:59,920
these beautiful apes that are just

1797
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,160
bluish and fat and beautiful so that's

1798
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,960
one thing i i i almost said something

1799
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:07,519
earlier about people's

1800
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,280
visual appeal to mushrooms and comparing

1801
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:12,000
it to how people just freak out about

1802
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,760
cannabis flowers but i know there's some

1803
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,960
mushroom geeks out there that totally

1804
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,200
love just looking at the different

1805
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,960
morphologies of these fungi and i find

1806
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:20,798
it super interesting as well

1807
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,400
but uh you know you can definitely see

1808
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:23,759
some people thinking oh

1809
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,200
yeah cannabis flower is way more

1810
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,520
beautiful than a mushroom but now i

1811
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:29,919
think that's uh to the in the eye of the

1812
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:31,519
beholder so to speak but what i see when

1813
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:35,280
i look at these uh

1814
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:36,159
these amazing natural organisms that we

1815
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,200
have

1816
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,558
i see

1817
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:41,519
um

1818
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:43,680
uh chemistry factories right like these

1819
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:46,079
this unbelievable ability to produce

1820
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:48,480
these chemicals that

1821
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:50,960
nature is providing and and it's so

1822
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:53,119
interesting too if you think about

1823
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,639
why plants are chemical factories and

1824
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:56,480
it's a pretty simple

1825
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:58,000
answer they can't run away they can't

1826
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:01,039
run away from their predators so they

1827
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,280
have to defend themselves chemically and

1828
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:06,640
then plants have been plant and fungi

1829
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:09,440
have been on this planet for so long

1830
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:12,078
they've had plenty of time to

1831
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:14,559
evolve mechanisms for defense which are

1832
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,760
super broad they've also had time to

1833
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,359
evolve

1834
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,119
uh

1835
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:22,159
molecules that

1836
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:24,240
affect organisms in other ways which is

1837
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,798
what we get to benefit from which is i

1838
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:28,879
find absolutely fascinating that these

1839
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:30,400
completely different organisms produce

1840
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,400
molecules that affect our brain

1841
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,720
chemistry that is

1842
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,119
just blows my mind

1843
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:39,199
right on so um let's go ahead and take

1844
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:41,680
uh our second commercial break and when

1845
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:42,558
we come back we're gonna talk about how

1846
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:45,279
the

1847
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:48,960
the new existence of

1848
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:50,720
mushroom analytics is actually changing

in the underground

1851
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,440
so

1852
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,959
we're going to take this short break

1853
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,639
we'll be right back you're listening to

1857
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:07,440
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

1858
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,280
growing is so valued by farmers is

1859
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,358
because the mycelium networks in the

1860
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,240
soil remain established from year to

1861
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:14,078
year

1862
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:16,158
and we know these fungal networks are

1863
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:18,560
essential because they are the nutrient

1864
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:21,439
super highways that extend far and wide

1865
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,679
in the substrate to feed your plants the

1866
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:26,000
trouble with growing in new living soils

1867
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,560
or blended cocoa substrates is that it

1868
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,439
takes most of the plant's life just to

1869
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:34,400
create these mycelium highways

1870
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:36,559
dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

1871
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:39,599
reduces that time and gets your plant

1872
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:41,520
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

1873
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,920
and it's three times the concentration

1874
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:46,799
of the other popular brand in the u.s at

1875

900 propagules per gram of two fungal

your dream job in cannabis and why we

1992
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:01,039
choose cannabis business even though the

1993
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,800
risks are so high as of today there's

shaping fire i'm your host shango los

2000
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,399
and my guest today is biochemist george

2001
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:19,279
salhorn

2002
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:22,719
so one of the interesting um

2003
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:25,279
i guess impacts from the the recent

2004
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:28,880
existence of mushroom labs

2005
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:30,238
is how it is impacting price

2006
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,159
in the

2007
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:35,359
i guess both the the underground

2008
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:37,599
mushroom market and also in the

2009
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:40,960
just blossoming

2010
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:43,120
um soon to be licensed market

2011
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:46,319
because up until

2012
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:48,238
labs existed a psilocybin mushroom was a

2013
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:50,399
psilocybin mushroom they were generally

2014
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:52,399
the same some had their you know people

2015
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:54,559
had their preferences because maybe they

2016
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:56,559
had a good trip on it one time or they

2017
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:59,360
liked how they looked more

2018
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,440
um and then uh and then and then people

2019
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:03,439
would be like oh these tend to be

2020
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:05,919
stronger than these other ones but it

2021
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:09,359
was really just conjecture and very

2022
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,960
anecdotal on uh uh and i first

2023
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:13,359
you know each person had their own

2024
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,399
opinion and there was no way to compare

2025
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:17,599
and contrast

2026
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:19,359
aha enter mushroom labs now

2027
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,719
and so

2028
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:24,799
now we actually know what's in them and

2029
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:26,480
so there's this new variety you know up

2030
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,640
until now it was you know people's

2031
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:30,319
preference and maybe maybe the mushroom

2032
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:33,440
had something desirable about it like it

2033
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:35,359
was albino or leucistic or or oh cool it

2034
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:38,399
looks like penises you know which is you

2035
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:41,198
know kind of kind of a a novel thing too

2036
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:44,079
so people were making decisions on you

2037
01:14:41,198 --> 01:14:45,919
know aesthetic choices but now

2038
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:48,399
we you know you can you can put them in

2039
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:53,119
a lab and say all right this this you

2040
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:54,879
know black cap albino penis envy is the

2041
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:58,079
most potent thing

2042
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:00,239
that you know we've gotten tested versus

2043
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:02,880
you know this brazilian

2044
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:04,479
which is beautiful and easy to grow and

2045
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,760
has these other attributes that we're

2046
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:08,319
attracted to

2047
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,320
but you know it's only point you know

2048
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:13,198
seven percent not point seven percent

2049
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:14,880
it's it's only seventy percent as potent

2050
01:15:13,198 --> 01:15:16,639
as the eight for example i just made

2051
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:20,239
that number up so but but just for the

2052
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:23,199
example and so that is now impacting uh

2053
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:26,158
pricing at the at the street and

2054
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:28,238
manufacturing level because people are

2055
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:29,279
starting to charge

2056
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:32,079
more

2057
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:36,079
for ultra potent mushrooms like these

2058
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:38,158
apes and that's very interesting

2059
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:41,198
what is your experience like behind the

2060
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:42,000
scenes with your customers because you

2061
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:44,559
know

2062
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,359
it's getting to be a bit like cannabis

2063
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:48,880
where

2064
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:50,559
the higher the thc the more likely it is

2065
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,440
to be sold

2066
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,640
well

2067
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:58,079
the potency of mushrooms is now um

2068
01:15:54,640 --> 01:16:00,560
becoming related to the price as well

2069
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,479
from both people who are taking it for a

2070
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:05,280
spiritual experience

2071
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:07,599
and for people who are planning on doing

2072
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:09,679
an extraction and putting them into a

2073
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,840
bunch of gummies or something

2074
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:14,319
right yeah i didn't even know that was

2075
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,159
happening to be honest because i don't

2076
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:17,519
you're in the lab yeah right yeah you

2077
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:19,119
know people

2078
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:21,840
pay me to take their mushrooms and test

2079
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:24,238
them so that's actually fascinating and

2080
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,719
you know it makes sense actually

2081
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:28,079
um because at least with mushrooms that

2082
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:29,520
we can touch on the cannabis stuff i

2083
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:30,719
have a pretty strong opinion about that

2084
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,080
one if

2085
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,439
if you want to hear it but with

2086
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:36,880
mushrooms

2087
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:39,519
i've tested stuff as low as 0.2 percent

2088
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:42,239
all the way to 1.8 percent

2089
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:45,040
so that's you know nine-fold difference

2090
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:45,839
in potency and you know if you go

2091
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:48,158
to

2092
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,360
a

2093
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:51,599
a bar

2094
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:53,599
and you want to buy a budweiser that's

2095
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,880
whatever i don't know one 1.5 whatever

2096
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,039
the percent of a budweiser is you're

2097
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,480
gonna pay a low amount of money and then

2098
01:16:57,039 --> 01:16:59,920
say there's like some eight and a half

2099
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:03,759
percent belgium you're probably going to

2100
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:05,199
pay more for that beer right because

2101
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,079
alcohol

2102
01:17:05,198 --> 01:17:07,439
is

2103
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:09,119
like we know what it does it has a

2104
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:12,238
linear effect you drink more you get

2105
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:14,960
more drunk right with mushroom alkaloids

2106
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:16,718
you take more you have a more

2107
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,399
interesting experience

2108
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:19,920
this is like linear the more you take

2109
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:22,559
the higher you get

2110
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:25,440
so it makes sense in the mushroom world

2111
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:27,679
and the only problem there is are people

2112
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:29,599
going to be saying oh this is an ape

2113
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,840
when it's really like a way less potent

2114
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,760
mushroom so you know ask for the lab

2115
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,000
test if they're if they're charging you

2116
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:38,159
based on on potency

2117
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,479
it's interesting how suddenly coas are

2118
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:42,079
very relevant in mushrooms now too yeah

2119
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,759
i've had people requesting them being

2120
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:45,519
made yep and and you know it's

2121
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,960
interesting there are arbitrage

2122
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:53,199
opportunities as well in this because um

2123
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:57,119
if you are manufacturing um you may not

2124
01:17:53,198 --> 01:17:59,759
necessarily choose an ape mushroom

2125
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:02,079
because they are at the the you know

2126
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:05,679
even though the potency is the highest

2127
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:06,800
100 percent it is also the highest price

2128
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:08,800
and so

2129
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:11,520
uh there would be good arguments to be

2130
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,920
made that you know you're looking for in

2131
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:16,719
a manufacturing environment you may be

2132
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,880
looking for a balance between

2133
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:22,399
um you know what mushroom has got the

2134
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:24,960
right balance of potency availability

2135
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:27,519
easiness to cultivate

2136
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:30,640
and then easiness to

2137
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:34,159
um you know uh break down and use right

2138
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:36,640
um yeah you're 100 right so so you know

2139
01:18:34,158 --> 01:18:39,039
most potent mushroom is not necessarily

2140
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,560
going to be best mushroom for

2141
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:43,920
for manufacturing

2142
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:46,159
and and these realizations are just

2143
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,840
coming to the industry and it's really

2144
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:49,679
interesting to watch them

2145
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,920
sort themselves out

2146
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:53,600
yeah no i totally agree because if

2147
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,440
you're running a business

2148
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,600
it's all about efficiency like how much

2149
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:59,759
does it cost me to do this and how much

2150
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,520
do i get back and how much product can i

2151
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:04,640
make from it

2152
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:07,440
so i could very easily see a scenario

2153
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,960
where there's a one percent mushroom it

2154
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:11,599
grows fast

2155
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,960
it's really easy to grow like you say

2156
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,960
it's it you know it's

2157
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:19,279
maybe it grows twice as fast as a

2158
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,399
mushroom that's 1.5 percent you know

2159
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:21,759
what i mean so it would be better to

2160
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:23,759
grow the one percent you get more

2161
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,159
biomass you and then your extraction

2162
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,480
efficiency is better with the slightly

2163
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:30,960
lower potent mushroom it you know it's

2164
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:33,039
going to be everybody's process is going

2165
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,560
to have to be worked out

2166
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:36,800
in that manner and that's what i would

2167
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:38,480
suggest people do is just don't go right

2168
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,560
off the bat and buy the most expensive

2169
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:42,799
potent mushroom you know get a couple

2170
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,560
different potency batches see how much

2171
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:47,520
it costs you to make your product and

2172
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:51,199
then you know make correct decision

2173
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:54,080
so um earlier in the in this uh second

2174
01:19:51,198 --> 01:19:57,279
set we were talking about um

2175
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:58,880
uh what part of the mushroom tends to be

2176
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:01,439
the most potent and you told me about

2177
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:04,560
the the single uh

2178
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:07,519
test case you have done where it was

2179
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:09,199
actually the junction of the stem to the

2180
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,920
cap that tested highest which was a

2181
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:14,079
really interesting um insight

2182
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,760
um and then and then you know as we as

2183
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:18,719
we worked our way out of the question

2184
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:20,639
you know i just mentioned that people

2185
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:23,439
argue quite a bit online about whether

2186
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:24,560
or not it's the cap or the stem

2187
01:20:23,439 --> 01:20:26,479
and you said yeah there's a lot of

2188
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,400
variability and we moved on but i want

2189
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:31,359
to come back to that because

2190
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:34,638
um uh you know you are the chemist and

2191
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:37,119
you are the person who is um you know

2192
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:39,600
doing these tests and granted most of

2193
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:41,920
your tests are on homogenized mushroom

2194
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,440
right so the the calf and the stem are

2195
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,920
all mixed together

2196
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:48,399
but um i i'm thinking that you have

2197
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:50,800
something to say even if it is there's

2198
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:53,439
no there's no hard and fast rule i just

2199
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:58,079
want to get your thoughts on

2200
01:20:53,439 --> 01:21:01,839
uh stem versus cap potency generally

2201
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:01,840
across all philosophy mushrooms

2202
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:05,678
that's such a difficult question to

2203
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:07,198
answer um

2204
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:09,600
you know i would feel comfortable if i

2205
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:12,000
tested at least 10 different

2206
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,760
mushrooms and looked at caps and stems

2207
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,679
and stuff but i've only done it once you

2208
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:18,079
know like an n of one is a classic

2209
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:19,119
example of not enough data

2210
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:20,238
decision

2211
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:21,920
um

2212
01:21:20,238 --> 01:21:23,678
but you know there's

2213
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,000
over the years people have looked at

2214
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:27,920
this in in different

2215
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,279
academic groups or different parts of

2216
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:32,480
the world where they're allowed to do

2217
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:35,759
this work and in general the theme is

2218
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:38,559
that the caps are more potent so i would

2219
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:40,320
probably lean to that being true

2220
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,159
there's always exceptions to rules like

2221
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:44,559
where we saw the guy have a more potent

2222
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:46,960
stem the other day but in general i

2223
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,880
would say the caps probably do have more

2224
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,679
alkaloid than the stem

2225
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,440
so

2226
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:53,440
if there was a fully mature mushroom

2227
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:56,319
right on that makes sense so so the rule

2228
01:21:53,439 --> 01:21:59,519
of your rule of thumb would be cap but

2229
01:21:56,319 --> 01:22:03,039
um but we know the variability between

2230
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:05,199
varieties is so significant that um you

2231
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:07,198
know don't put too much weight on the

2232
01:22:05,198 --> 01:22:10,158
rule of thumb yeah very good the best

2233
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:12,079
thing to do is just grind it all up in

2234
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:13,679
my opinion you know grind everything you

2235
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:15,920
have into a single

2236
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,840
powder and then it's going to be is

2237
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,359
pretty consistent because i've had a

2238
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:22,480
another customer where he took like a

2239
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:26,079
pound and ground the whole thing up and

2240
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:28,238
then he sampled it three different areas

2241
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:31,439
and called that a b and c

2242
01:22:28,238 --> 01:22:34,158
and then um he did that for four months

2243
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:36,158
every month he did a sampling like abc

2244
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:39,198
right and so he was looking for

2245
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:40,559
degradation over time and consistency of

2246
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:41,839
sampling

2247
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,000
and uh

2248
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,719
he found some really cool stuff like the

2249
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,920
the

2250
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:48,719
the sampling

2251
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:51,119
and the consistency was highly

2252
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:53,039
quality everything's was really close

2253
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:54,559
like every test i did

2254
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:56,960
um was

2255
01:22:54,560 --> 01:23:01,120
right around six milligrams per gram so

2256
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:03,840
0.6 percent and uh over time

2257
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:05,359
he barely lost anything so he had a

2258
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,679
really uh

2259
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:09,119
good storage conditions so

2260
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:10,560
if you're looking for consistency

2261
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:12,319
homogenize

2262
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:15,360
i think that the time when it comes up

2263
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:17,920
most of the time is when um there is a

2264
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:21,679
sales a sale taking place

2265
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:24,560
because um you know so often um a

2266
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:26,639
purchaser whether or not it is you know

2267
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:29,360
somebody who is trying to establish a

2268
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:32,400
business in oregon or if it's in like

2269
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:35,119
the traditional neighborhood market um

2270
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:37,119
you know there's always people want the

2271
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:40,319
caps because they look cool and they're

2272
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:42,719
kind of like ceremonially dope um but

2273
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:45,519
but so often you know if if you're the

2274
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:47,840
last person to buy mushrooms from your

2275
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,920
connection um there might be a lot of

2276
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:53,199
stems in the bottom and so you might end

2277
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:54,880
up with mostly stems and a few caps

2278
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:56,719
and um

2279
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:00,840
you know the fact that we don't really

2280
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:02,560
know um does help the position of the

2281
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:04,000
seller um

2282
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,520
so that's when i think that's when it

2283
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,359
usually comes up because anybody who's

2284
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,120
growing their own and it's not it's not

2285
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:10,719
changing hands

2286
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:13,039
we're just going to homogenize it like

2287
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:15,840
you said so it's so it seems to be

2288
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:18,479
either either in a in a licensed market

2289
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:20,719
uh or or about to be licensed to market

2290
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:22,959
where there is a professional cultivator

2291
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,719
selling to a professional manufacturer

2292
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:27,279
or when you're just getting mushrooms

2293
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:28,480
from your homie you know right right

2294
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:31,359
um

2295
01:24:28,479 --> 01:24:34,959
let's hit on uh the storage of mushrooms

2296
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:38,399
next because there is uh there there's

2297
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:41,359
the answer to how best to store your

2298
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:43,679
mushrooms has really evolved over the

2299
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:45,839
years and and um

2300
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,960
very much so over the last three years

2301
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:49,520
and so

2302
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:54,399
you know when when i was in college back

2303
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:56,320
in the early 90s uh we were told to um

2304
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:58,799
you know to you know put it in a ziplock

2305
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:00,479
and put it in the freezer and um you

2306
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,600
know that seemed to work but i'm

2307
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:03,759
understanding now that there's a lot

2308
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,679
more people doing this research now and

2309
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:07,360
it's evolved so so why don't you tell us

2310
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:09,039
a little bit about the varieties of

2311
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:11,599
storing our mushrooms

2312
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:13,600
and uh how we can get the most longevity

2313
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,360
about them and and probably in your

2314
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,920
answer include a little bit about uh

2315
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:18,960
what causes mushrooms to degrade too

2316
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,800
sure

2317
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:23,279
yeah so

2318
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:26,960
remarkably the best way to store

2319
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:30,000
mushrooms is in the dark sealed in a bag

2320
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:33,600
uh at about 60 to 65 degrees and you

2321
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,600
know moderate humidity

2322
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:38,639
i've seen people

2323
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,719
uh do freeze thaw studies like you said

2324
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:42,239
in the freezer and put them in the

2325
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:44,960
refrigerator

2326
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:47,439
and store them just at room temperature

2327
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,439
would be a little bit warmer than 60 65

2328
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:52,799
70 75 degrees

2329
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:54,559
and pretty much the best uh

2330
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,119
way to do it to

2331
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,800
to maintain alkaloid levels is uh

2332
01:25:57,119 --> 01:26:00,000
cooling in the dark

2333
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,119
right so

2334
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,238
um

2335
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:04,319
do we want to

2336
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:06,799
do we want to remove as much oxygen as

2337
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:09,920
possible like like if i was just going

2338
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:11,360
all right so so we're using like a um

2339
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,039
a vacuum seal that's what i'm trying to

2340
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:13,839
get to yeah that's that's a good move

2341
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:16,319
then

2342
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:17,679
yeah absolutely absolutely so the

2343
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:19,679
primary

2344
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:20,800
um

2345
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:23,600
uh

2346
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:26,480
issue is oxidation so

2347
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:28,159
if you take away the oxygen

2348
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:30,319
then you're gonna have way less

2349
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:33,039
opportunity for your mushrooms to

2350
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:35,119
degrade light and heat

2351
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:36,479
and oxygen are your enemies when it

2352
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:38,238
comes to this so

2353
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:40,559
oxygen is the molecule that does the

2354
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:41,759
damage but light and heat will speed it

2355
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,080
up

2356
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:47,840
so and the reason why the freezer

2357
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:50,479
doesn't work all that great is um

2358
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:52,800
when you freeze thaw

2359
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:54,079
biomass whether it be tissue from an

2360
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:57,679
animal

2361
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:59,359
plant bacteria fungi

2362
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:03,119
you when you freeze thaw something you

2363
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:04,639
cause some of the cells to lyse or burst

2364
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:07,359
and when you do that you're going to

2365
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:09,199
expose the contents to oxygen

2366
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:10,880
so that freeze thaw in and out of the

2367
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:12,399
freezer your every time you do it you're

2368
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,600
going to burst some of the cells and

2369
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:16,399
then that's going to lead to the

2370
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:19,600
degradation in the refrigerator it's

2371
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:21,359
probably a moisture thing as well

2372
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,039
so moisture also could be a problem so

2373
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:24,399
if you don't fully dry your mushroom you

2374
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:25,439
put it in the fridge the change in

2375
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:26,879
temperature is going to cause

2376
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:29,279
condensation

2377
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:32,239
if the biomass absorbs any of that water

2378
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:33,519
it will facilitate degradation as well

2379
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:35,759
whereas you keep them in a nice

2380
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,639
consistent dry dark environment and it's

2381
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,320
cool

2382
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:42,079
that seems to be the best way to

2383
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:45,920
preserve your mushroom potency over time

2384
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:49,119
so you suggested keeping them in a you

2385
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:50,880
know low 60s dark spot in a bag let's

2386
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:52,319
talk about that bag

2387
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,840
because you may have just kind of said

2388
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:55,359
that generally

2389
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:57,279
there's a difference of an opinion

2390
01:27:55,359 --> 01:27:59,759
between

2391
01:27:57,279 --> 01:28:01,599
a paper bag because some people say they

2392
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,520
need to breathe but i think that's just

2393
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,880
the opposite because of the oxidation

2394
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,400
aspect and then there's people that

2395
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,239
don't dry you don't need to breathe

2396
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:11,119
right on and then and then there's other

2397
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:12,559
people who talk about either using

2398
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:15,119
plastic or

2399
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:17,360
or because most plastic

2400
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:19,198
uh that's not a vacuum sealed breeze

2401
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:21,839
some people are suggesting

2402
01:28:19,198 --> 01:28:24,079
glass jars are the way to go so so what

2403
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,840
is the vessel that you recommend

2404
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:29,198
actually if you want to be really anal

2405
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:30,800
about it and give yourself little to no

2406
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:33,599
you know the best opportunity to

2407
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,920
preserve your your material a glass jar

2408
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:37,920
that seals would be great yeah

2409
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:40,960
and also if you want to go even a step

2410
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:43,440
further you can take an inert gas like

2411
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:46,239
nitrogen or argon and

2412
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:48,399
blanket the vessel with that and it

2413
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:50,638
pushes out all the oxygen now that's

2414
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:51,759
going a little far and beyond most home

2415
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:53,440
people aren't going to do that but in

2416
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,199
the laboratory or in a business you

2417
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:57,919
absolutely would want to do that because

2418
01:28:55,198 --> 01:29:00,238
you'll get much longer shelf life if you

2419
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:02,560
purge the oxygen from the storage vessel

2420
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:04,238
um a way to do that cheap at home

2421
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,840
without um

2422
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:08,479
adding the inert

2423
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:11,440
excuse me without adding an inert gas is

2424
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:13,359
um you know for these these um these you

2425
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:15,359
know food fresh uh

2426
01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:18,719
vacuum packs right um

2427
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:20,799
they've got these uh mason jar lid uh

2428
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:22,239
adapters which is what i use for my

2429
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,239
cannabis

2430
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:25,678
and so you know i know i know the stuff

2431
01:29:24,238 --> 01:29:27,919
that i'm gonna smoke soon and then i

2432
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:30,079
know the stuff that i've just taken out

2433
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:32,079
of cure that's probably gonna sit there

2434
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:34,319
until i get to it in two or three months

2435
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:36,800
right and so i put it in a large mouth

2436
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:39,519
mason jar and i think i paid like 20

2437
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:41,520
bucks for this adapter and it sucks the

2438
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:44,320
the all the air about it

2439
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:46,719
out of it and so i would think that that

2440
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:49,439
would also be a win for when i have

2441
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:51,760
mushrooms 100 and filling up the vessel

2442
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:53,519
with as much material as possible so

2443
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:56,960
there's no room for air

2444
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:58,639
right yep nope that's exactly uh the way

2445
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:00,560
you would do it if you're

2446
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:03,760
covering all your bases all right so

2447
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:07,199
let's talk about time for degradation

2448
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:09,679
for um the you know the most common way

2449
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:12,079
of keeping mushrooms versus

2450
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:14,560
the the the crazy way that we just

2451
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:16,880
described for like you know perfection

2452
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:19,120
so you know most people they're going to

2453
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:20,960
get their mushrooms in a ziploc and then

2454
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:23,198
they're gonna

2455
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,960
bring them home and let's let's not use

2456
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:26,799
freezer or refrigerator because we've

2457
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:28,639
already suggested that that is no one

2458
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:31,440
should be doing that so they want to

2459
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:32,880
keep it in a cool dark place so so fine

2460
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:33,678
it's good let's just put it under the

2461
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:37,119
bed

2462
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:38,639
so so it's dark it's cool and it's in a

2463
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:41,439
ziploc bag

2464
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:44,319
and let's say that the mushrooms when

2465
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:46,479
you receive them let's say that

2466
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:47,439
they were they were harvested two weeks

2467
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:51,359
ago

2468
01:30:47,439 --> 01:30:52,879
and they were dried properly and um

2469
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:54,639
you've got a very

2470
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:58,239
short supply chain between the

2471
01:30:54,639 --> 01:31:00,960
cultivator and and and me as the

2472
01:30:58,238 --> 01:31:04,000
as the mushroom enthusiast all right so

2473
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:07,359
so in that in in that scenario

2474
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:10,639
um how quickly are my mushrooms under

2475
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:10,639
the bed gonna degrade

2476
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,440
are we talking we have a nice cool it's

2477
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:16,880
like a 60 65 degrees yeah yeah let's say

2478
01:31:15,439 --> 01:31:19,599
the template let's say the temperature's

2479
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:22,400
right and it's dark um it's slow i can

2480
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:24,320
give you a an example that was not

2481
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:26,479
perfectly stored but when i first

2482
01:31:24,319 --> 01:31:28,399
started setting up uh the lab here and

2483
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:31,119
doing my r d and getting my method

2484
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:34,000
started i had a grower friend give me a

2485
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:36,479
nice bag of homogenized material so that

2486
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,279
i had a good amount of material to go

2487
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:38,399
back

2488
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:40,319
and check

2489
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:41,599
like so i could work on consistency

2490
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:43,920
right trying to make sure i was getting

2491
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,679
accurate results over time now i had

2492
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:48,079
that material and i did all my initial

2493
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:50,399
development about last september

2494
01:31:48,079 --> 01:31:54,079
uh or i mean uh sorry last

2495
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:57,439
december january is when i did that work

2496
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:59,760
and then i tested that stuff about a

2497
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:01,198
month ago so it was about six months

2498
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,719
where it sat

2499
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:05,279
um

2500
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:07,119
probably closer to 70 degrees

2501
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:09,359
it's just in a plastic bag in my closet

2502
01:32:07,119 --> 01:32:11,198
in my bedroom right

2503
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:12,719
and it went from about

2504
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:15,359
seven percent

2505
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:17,279
to about point five six percent so let

2506
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:19,359
me really quick what is that

2507
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:21,599
that is a

2508
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:24,880
yeah that's about eighty percent so it's

2509
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:26,719
like a twenty percent loss in six months

2510
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:28,800
and um

2511
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:30,000
that's not too bad because it's actually

2512
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,079
way better than i thought it was going

2513
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,399
to be it was elevated temperature so if

2514
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:35,920
you keep it at 60 degrees and that

2515
01:32:34,399 --> 01:32:38,079
probably could have warmed up in there

2516
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:40,639
above that if it got warm you know like

2517
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:42,479
a couple few weeks it's been warm

2518
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:44,159
recently so it could have accelerated a

2519
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:46,718
little bit towards the end there but

2520
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:49,359
that guy that i did the study with

2521
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:52,719
you know over four months i think the

2522
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:55,279
the potency changed by like two percent

2523
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:58,158
so very little yeah very insignificant

2524
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:59,759
the one of my friends who's a cultivator

2525
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:02,399
he was very concerned about this last

2526
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:04,639
year during the pacific northwest heat

2527
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:07,039
dome when it got to like 114 where he

2528
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:09,359
lives in eastern washington

2529
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:11,760
and um you know he said you know other

2530
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:14,399
people he knew were going to get ice

2531
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:17,440
uh in order to you know keep food or

2532
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:19,679
their pets or whatever cool and um you

2533
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:22,399
know he kind of you know how a double

2534
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:24,319
boiler you've got the the heat source on

2535
01:33:22,399 --> 01:33:26,399
the bottom and then a secondary thing he

2536
01:33:24,319 --> 01:33:28,238
he was actually taking all his storage

2537
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:31,198
of dried mushrooms and putting him in a

2538
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:33,198
in a vacuum packed bag and then put it

2539
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:35,039
in a cooler that had all ice in the

2540
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:37,519
bottom but then was sealed and then was

2541
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:40,880
on top and that's how he's all like he's

2542
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:44,400
like i don't know what the science says

2543
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:45,440
about how quickly these are going to

2544
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:48,158
um

2545
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:51,119
uh lessen potency he says but i want it

2546
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:53,198
to be zero and so he's like i may be

2547
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:55,119
sweating my ass off during the heat dome

2548
01:33:53,198 --> 01:33:57,279
he says but my mushrooms won't and i

2549
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:58,800
thought that was a pretty novel approach

2550
01:33:57,279 --> 01:33:59,599
this is a pretty clever approach yeah

2551
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,400
because

2552
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:05,199
what he did was smart because

2553
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:06,559
it allows him to put his mushrooms in

2554
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:08,238
the air

2555
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:09,679
above the cold

2556
01:34:08,238 --> 01:34:11,759
whereas if he would like laid it

2557
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:13,039
directly on the ice that super cold

2558
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,880
temperature probably would have caused

2559
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:16,639
some condensation to form inside there

2560
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,079
so it's almost like he just made a

2561
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:20,159
little bit of air conditioning for his

2562
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:22,158
mushrooms you know yeah and he like he

2563
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:24,158
describes it as a double boiler and like

2564
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:26,479
it's weird like like even though it's a

2565
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:28,158
radically different application of that

2566
01:34:26,479 --> 01:34:30,000
idea i totally got what he meant i'm

2567
01:34:28,158 --> 01:34:32,319
like oh yeah absolutely yeah he's

2568
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,079
letting the the ice at the bottom cool

2569
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:35,519
the chamber above

2570
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:36,719
and it's not going to drop it down to

2571
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,480
the ice temperature but it's going to

2572
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:40,079
keep it much cooler than ambient so

2573
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:42,638
that's pretty pretty clever like i said

2574
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:45,118
i like it right now

2575
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:48,079
so so let's talk about um you know since

2576
01:34:45,118 --> 01:34:51,118
we're talking uh about mushroom

2577
01:34:48,079 --> 01:34:53,760
analytics labs and you know primarily

2578
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:56,719
shaping fire talks about entheogens um

2579
01:34:53,760 --> 01:35:01,360
and you know evolution of mind and all

2580
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:04,158
um but there are um other mushrooms that

2581
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:06,639
people are all hot about now um you know

2582
01:35:04,158 --> 01:35:09,839
generally put in a you know chinese

2583
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:12,639
medici medicinal groups like you know

2584
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:14,639
reishi and turkey tail and lion's mane

2585
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:17,118
and all and all these other mushrooms

2586
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:20,159
that sometimes we use in cooperation

2587
01:35:17,118 --> 01:35:23,359
with philosophy mushrooms for for this

2588
01:35:20,158 --> 01:35:25,198
ailment or that um uh

2589
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:27,198
but also just just taking them for

2590
01:35:25,198 --> 01:35:29,839
general health seems to be pretty

2591
01:35:27,198 --> 01:35:32,399
appropriate um right uh

2592
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:35,679
can you talk a little bit about the

2593
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:37,118
awarenesses that you have um uh testing

2594
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:39,279
these other mushrooms as well i'm

2595
01:35:37,118 --> 01:35:41,118
assuming that you you you don't just

2596
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:43,519
test philosophy since you've talked

2597
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:45,759
about you know these other mushrooms and

2598
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,760
you have such intimate details with them

2599
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:50,320
i'm assuming that there's people who are

2600
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:52,480
are formulating you know a lion's mane

2601
01:35:50,319 --> 01:35:53,840
extract or something who's coming to you

2602
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:56,638
as well

2603
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:58,719
and um uh you know what are you seeing

2604
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:00,480
as far as like variability in the

2605
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:02,319
potency of these mushrooms because you

2606
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:05,519
know unless they're really degraded they

2607
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:09,198
all look the same and and and there's no

2608
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:10,400
real way for us as a consumer to know

2609
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:13,118
whether or not

2610
01:36:10,399 --> 01:36:16,238
this particular lion's main product is

2611
01:36:13,118 --> 01:36:17,759
is is as strong as this other one as a

2612
01:36:16,238 --> 01:36:18,559
consumer

2613
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,719
right

2614
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:23,360
yeah this is uh the direction that we're

2615
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:25,920
going um i'm in the process i just got

2616
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:27,439
the cordyceps testing set up

2617
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,118
however the testing for a lot of these

2618
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:30,559
other mushrooms is a lot more

2619
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:33,519
complicated

2620
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,039
sometimes you can use the hplc uv but

2621
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,840
for most of these you're going to need a

2622
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:39,679
mass spectrometer and you know those are

2623
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:41,679
exceedingly expensive over a hundred

2624
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:44,000
thousand dollars for the right machine

2625
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:45,118
to do that testing and i plan on going

2626
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,920
there that's

2627
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:47,920
uh

2628
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:50,560
i want to turn this business into a

2629
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:52,399
fully functional mushroom lab not just a

2630
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:54,000
psychedelic lab

2631
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:57,519
and i'm actually i've been approached by

2632
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:00,479
customers for things like mescaline dmt

2633
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:02,000
uh ayahuasca alkaloids like people are

2634
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:03,678
asking me about testing for all these

2635
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,399
things so in the long run i would like

2636
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:08,960
to be able to test for all of that and

2637
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:11,599
the coolest thing about being in oregon

2638
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:14,239
is with the decriminalization laws

2639
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:16,480
we we can test these as long as we have

2640
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:17,759
small amounts you know so it's it's

2641
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:19,279
really cool it actually gives you an

2642
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:21,119
advantage of being in oregon that the

2643
01:37:19,279 --> 01:37:22,960
other jurisdictions had only legalized

2644
01:37:21,118 --> 01:37:24,960
psilocybin they're not going to be able

2645
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,880
to touch yeah right on that makes a lot

2646
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,719
of sense and there's so much demand i

2647
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:31,359
mean like um

2648
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:34,480
even though cannabis is not normalized

2649
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:37,359
yet especially at the federal level um

2650
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:39,839
all these other entheogens that we love

2651
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:41,519
and humans have been using forever um

2652
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:44,159
they're coming in the door right behind

2653
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:46,560
cannabis in the same way um still gonna

2654
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:49,039
be politically and you know

2655
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,880
legally messy for a while but everybody

2656
01:37:49,039 --> 01:37:53,359
everybody knows that the doors are open

2657
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:55,679
and and it's cracked open pandora's

2658
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:58,559
snowball's rolling downhill yeah yeah

2659
01:37:55,679 --> 01:38:01,199
so um so i want to ask you a question

2660
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:03,280
about fruiting body versus mycelium

2661
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:07,519
potency because this is probably one of

2662
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:11,039
the the most asked questions i'm asked

2663
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:14,639
um when talking to folks about um

2664
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:17,118
uh chinese mushrooms and and such um

2665
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:21,359
you know there are people who fall on

2666
01:38:17,118 --> 01:38:24,719
the the it's okay to put mycelium in the

2667
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:27,118
caps um in the way that uh stamets does

2668
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:28,639
for his products and then there are

2669
01:38:27,118 --> 01:38:30,799
people who believe that

2670
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:34,079
mycelium-based

2671
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:37,199
medicine is is um

2672
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:39,519
you know snake oil and it's actually

2673
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:42,319
only the fruiting bodies that should be

2674
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:45,520
used um in kind of more of a you know

2675
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:47,840
real mushrooms uh company kind of way

2676
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:50,560
and um it you know

2677
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:53,119
someone's opinion really tends to fall

2678
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:55,679
on the fact of whether or not they what

2679
01:38:53,118 --> 01:38:59,118
their personal preference is um but

2680
01:38:55,679 --> 01:39:01,760
you're an analyst and and so um i wanted

2681
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:03,198
to hear what your thoughts are about um

2682
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,280
whether or not we should be buying

2683
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:08,238
products that are made from a fruiting

2684
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:12,238
body or from mycelium when we're talking

2685
01:39:08,238 --> 01:39:15,198
about non-philosophy medicinal mushrooms

2686
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:18,079
yeah this is uh super interesting and

2687
01:39:15,198 --> 01:39:19,118
this is the point where opinions don't

2688
01:39:18,079 --> 01:39:21,279
count

2689
01:39:19,118 --> 01:39:23,439
science counts

2690
01:39:21,279 --> 01:39:26,000
when you have data showing that there's

2691
01:39:23,439 --> 01:39:27,599
molecules present in a certain part of

2692
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,520
the biomass

2693
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:32,400
i don't care what someone's opinion is

2694
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:34,239
if if we know that lion's mane mycelium

2695
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:36,479
makes hersinone a

2696
01:39:34,238 --> 01:39:38,638
or our iron acine a

2697
01:39:36,479 --> 01:39:40,238
and the fruiting body doesn't

2698
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,279
then you can go eating the fruiting body

2699
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:42,799
all day and you're not going to be

2700
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:44,719
getting the iron acids you'll get the

2701
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,079
hersinose which i i believe that's

2702
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:48,158
correct that the ironaciens are

2703
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:50,399
typically found in the mycelium and the

2704
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:52,638
hersinones in the fruit if i have that

2705
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:55,118
switched i apologize to everybody who

2706
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:57,760
knows that off the top of their head but

2707
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:58,719
it you know this is where the science

2708
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:00,960
rules

2709
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:03,760
you have a good lab

2710
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:06,079
a good scientist that that knows how to

2711
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:07,920
do all the stuff properly and has the

2712
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:10,158
proper controls and the proper

2713
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:11,840
identification of these molecules

2714
01:40:10,158 --> 01:40:14,158
and you can even start looking at this

2715
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:16,719
on a genetic level too you could start

2716
01:40:14,158 --> 01:40:19,118
looking for gene expression

2717
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:21,359
in the mycelium versus the fruiting body

2718
01:40:19,118 --> 01:40:23,679
and that's another layer of evidence

2719
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:25,359
that it's being produced right so

2720
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:27,039
you can find the gene

2721
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:29,519
in both the fruiting body and the

2722
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:31,118
mycelium because the gene the dna is

2723
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,560
consistent from

2724
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:35,599
doesn't matter the structure of the

2725
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:38,000
mushroom or the mycelium but the turning

2726
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:39,840
on of that gene does matter so there's

2727
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,800
ways that we can look at that and then

2728
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:45,119
obviously if the molecule is present

2729
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,960
in so for example we grow some lion's

2730
01:40:45,118 --> 01:40:49,920
main mycelium

2731
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:52,719
and we have a boatload of biomass and we

2732
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:55,520
pull that out we extract it and we

2733
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:58,000
identify hersenone a using mass

2734
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:59,600
spectrometry it's there

2735
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,760
right so and then you go and you have

2736
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:04,480
the fruiting body of lion's mane you

2737
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:07,199
grind that up you do your analytics

2738
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:08,158
maybe the maybe erin acing isn't there

2739
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:10,319
so

2740
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:12,799
all i'm saying is there's different

2741
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:14,880
molecules made in mycelium and fruiting

2742
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:17,840
bodies for different species and i've

2743
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:19,440
heard paul stamets say this ad nauseam

2744
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:21,760
but some people just don't want to

2745
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:23,599
listen you know if if you don't want to

2746
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,719
follow the data and the science that's

2747
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,079
your

2748
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:28,800
right

2749
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:31,439
but it's not going to be correct in

2750
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:34,159
terms of what the contents are of those

2751
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:36,000
extractions or those biomasses i think

2752
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:37,759
it's also one of the reasons why we need

2753
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,920
to make this information more available

2754
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:42,800
to people right because i don't think

2755
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:46,000
that anybody well or very few people are

2756
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:48,239
intentionally making decisions that are

2757
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:51,359
anti-science i think that most people

2758
01:41:48,238 --> 01:41:53,439
just would never know where to find the

2759
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:55,679
data that you're talking about of people

2760
01:41:53,439 --> 01:41:57,919
testing mycelium versus fruiting body

2761
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:59,520
this information is just hard to get

2762
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:02,000
you need to be a scientist you need to

2763
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:04,159
be able to go on to pubmed and not just

2764
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,719
find articles that fit what you're

2765
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:07,839
looking for but be able to go into the

2766
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:11,520
article

2767
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:13,920
and read it from a critic's perspective

2768
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:16,639
and you know because every time a

2769
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:18,719
scientist reads a scientific paper

2770
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:21,039
you're putting that data to the test

2771
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:23,679
you're saying does the data that people

2772
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:25,679
have presented in this paper convince me

2773
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:26,880
of what they're trying to convince me

2774
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:28,158
and a lot of times you'll have a

2775
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:31,118
scientist read a paper and be like i

2776
01:42:28,158 --> 01:42:32,479
don't buy it that data's not convincing

2777
01:42:31,118 --> 01:42:34,799
look at what they did here they're

2778
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:36,959
trying to they're changing their axes to

2779
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:38,400
get you to think there's a bigger effect

2780
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,840
you know there's a lot of subtle things

2781
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:42,399
scientists can do to trick a

2782
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:44,719
non-expert

2783
01:42:42,399 --> 01:42:46,960
so that's why it's dangerous for like

2784
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:48,319
your average person to go into pubmed

2785
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,079
read a science paper and be like oh this

2786
01:42:48,319 --> 01:42:51,920
is what this means you know it's like

2787
01:42:50,079 --> 01:42:54,158
it's dangerous to do that because a lot

2788
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:55,679
of times

2789
01:42:54,158 --> 01:42:57,519
unfortunately

2790
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:59,199
there are plenty of scientists out there

2791
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:00,880
that have an agenda and they're being

2792
01:42:59,198 --> 01:43:02,238
paid by a company to get a certain

2793
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,400
answer and they'll do everything they

2794
01:43:02,238 --> 01:43:06,479
can to support it you know look at the

2795
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:07,279
food industry for goodness gracious i

2796
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:08,879
mean

2797
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:10,158
well we run into that in cannabis all

2798
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,679
the time because

2799
01:43:10,158 --> 01:43:13,279
people are people are reading these

2800
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:15,279
tests and even though and certainly

2801
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:17,840
people are fudging with their graphs but

2802
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:19,920
at the most basic level you know you

2803
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:22,239
really have to study whether or not they

2804
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:25,039
used and they used isolate or a whole

2805
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:27,359
plant resin in the patient's study

2806
01:43:25,039 --> 01:43:30,238
because they they act differently you

2807
01:43:27,359 --> 01:43:32,799
can't just say you know oh we use 200

2808
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:35,839
milligrams of cbd for this

2809
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:38,480
lupus patient because 200 milligrams of

2810
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:40,319
isolate is different than 200 milligrams

2811
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:43,198
of cbd

2812
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:44,880
in you know a whole plant residue oil

2813
01:43:43,198 --> 01:43:46,719
yeah totally and there's there's reasons

2814
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:49,199
for there's there's reasons to use

2815
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:50,800
either right so so you know even though

2816
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:53,759
i'm a whole plant guy i'm not trying to

2817
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:56,719
diss the isolate you just have to know

2818
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:58,480
what your goal is and understand um

2819
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:00,319
what was done in the study

2820
01:43:58,479 --> 01:44:02,799
100 and there's a really good example

2821
01:44:00,319 --> 01:44:04,719
for that too you know with exam cbd

2822
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:07,199
isolate versus a cbd

2823
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:08,239
extract you know children with dravet

2824
01:44:07,198 --> 01:44:11,359
syndrome

2825
01:44:08,238 --> 01:44:14,000
they need cbd isolate you know like the

2826
01:44:11,359 --> 01:44:16,479
cbd is what actually helps

2827
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,399
the the seizures you know you don't need

2828
01:44:16,479 --> 01:44:19,678
that other stuff and plus when you have

2829
01:44:18,399 --> 01:44:21,519
all that other stuff in there you might

2830
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:22,800
have to give the kid a little bit of thc

2831
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:24,560
which you might not want to do to a

2832
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,400
five-year-old or something you know so

2833
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:28,880
there's absolutely applications for

2834
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:31,759
isolates versus croods you know if

2835
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:33,600
you're going at something like a cancer

2836
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,520
or multiple sclerosis or some

2837
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:37,920
inflammatory thing you don't want

2838
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:39,199
isolate because all those other things

2839
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:42,158
in there are going to have different

2840
01:44:39,198 --> 01:44:44,319
effects and synergize and attack the

2841
01:44:42,158 --> 01:44:47,118
broad

2842
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:48,319
symptoms that someone that has cancer ms

2843
01:44:47,118 --> 01:44:50,639
or something like that as opposed to

2844
01:44:48,319 --> 01:44:52,319
something very specific like a dravet

2845
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:54,159
syndrome which is a very specific kind

2846
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:56,079
of epilepsy so

2847
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:57,759
and we transfer this to the mushroom

2848
01:44:56,079 --> 01:44:59,118
world and i guarantee there's going to

2849
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,840
be

2850
01:44:59,118 --> 01:45:02,960
ailments that uh well for example

2851
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:04,639
depression

2852
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:07,279
psilocybin

2853
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:11,118
pure psilocybin isolated in the lab even

2854
01:45:07,279 --> 01:45:12,399
maybe synthesized and used as a

2855
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:13,759
medicine for

2856
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:16,000
um

2857
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:17,760
uh depression that works a hundred

2858
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,600
percent you know like you don't need

2859
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:22,159
like a whole mushroom extract to pull

2860
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:23,039
that off so but there's definitely going

2861
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:24,319
to be

2862
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:25,920
something out there where we talked

2863
01:45:24,319 --> 01:45:27,679
about earlier with the five or six

2864
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,520
different alkaloids we're finding in in

2865
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:30,800
philosophy that are you know measurable

2866
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,639
by uv

2867
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,960
hpl cuv

2868
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:37,600
maybe a different proportion of those

2869
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:40,399
might have a better effect on ptsd than

2870
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:42,719
depression or a better effect on

2871
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:45,039
any of these other ailments that we're

2872
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:48,079
seeing psychedelic mushrooms being uh

2873
01:45:45,039 --> 01:45:51,198
effective on can we get an even better

2874
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:53,279
result by changing the ratio of bail

2875
01:45:51,198 --> 01:45:56,079
cysteine to silicon

2876
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:57,840
i'm really looking forward to us

2877
01:45:56,079 --> 01:45:59,920
you know actually having the research

2878
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:01,920
behind these other

2879
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:04,719
uh components of the mushrooms so that

2880
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:06,719
we can start even having this whole

2881
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:09,439
plant a whole mushroom conversation

2882
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:12,079
because at this point um

2883
01:46:09,439 --> 01:46:14,879
you know anybody who says that they know

2884
01:46:12,079 --> 01:46:17,198
is is is you know blowing smoke because

2885
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:19,440
the research isn't there like like

2886
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:22,158
i respect smart people's hunches

2887
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:23,039
but we're only in the early days of of

2888
01:46:22,158 --> 01:46:25,359
learning

2889
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:27,679
what's in the mushroom and so to say

2890
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:29,198
that we know all the ramifications is

2891
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:31,199
just unrealistic

2892
01:46:29,198 --> 01:46:34,079
yep the hunches and hypotheses put us on

2893
01:46:31,198 --> 01:46:35,198
the road to discovery right yeah exactly

2894
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:36,559
well it's kind of like the same thing

2895
01:46:35,198 --> 01:46:38,638
we're going through with cannabis right

2896
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:41,440
uh we all started with bro science and

2897
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:43,679
now we have to uh individually like

2898
01:46:41,439 --> 01:46:46,399
replace what we think we know

2899
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:49,679
with new things um as the as the

2900
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:52,319
research you know it gets established so

2901
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:54,800
of course yes well let's wrap up here so

2902
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:57,679
george thank you so much for uh sharing

2903
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:59,920
your unique expertise you know um with

2904
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:02,079
there only being three you know

2905
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:04,960
municipalities or not municipalities but

2906
01:47:02,079 --> 01:47:08,000
three three jurisdictions in the country

2907
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:09,840
that um you know it's it's it's legalish

2908
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,359
to do what you do at the you know at the

2909
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:13,679
state level but it you know it's still a

2910
01:47:11,359 --> 01:47:16,000
schedule one drug um

2911
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:18,158
you have got perspective and experience

2912
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,960
that is you know just exceedingly

2913
01:47:18,158 --> 01:47:23,839
difficult to find and and it took me a

2914
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:27,359
while to find you and then it took you a

2915
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:29,679
while to be comfortable to you know um

2916
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:32,000
you know be a little more public so so i

2917
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:34,800
appreciate you choosing to share your

2918
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:37,920
knowledge with us and um i wish you the

2919
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:39,440
best of luck on on on this research and

2920
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:41,760
the um

2921
01:47:39,439 --> 01:47:43,039
and your applications uh however you use

2922
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:44,320
it so thank you so much for being on

2923
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:45,760
shaping fire

2924
01:47:44,319 --> 01:47:47,439
yeah thank you so much for having me

2925
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:49,039
this has been super incredible and it's

2926
01:47:47,439 --> 01:47:51,118
the first time i've ever done anything

2927
01:47:49,039 --> 01:47:53,118
like this so it was uh

2928
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:54,399
it was great i had some closing thoughts

2929
01:47:53,118 --> 01:47:56,799
there for a second but they may have

2930
01:47:54,399 --> 01:47:59,759
just escaped me um

2931
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:01,679
uh other than oh yeah i remember so uh

2932
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:04,159
real briefly i could just kind of give a

2933
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:05,600
brief history of of my interest in this

2934
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:08,079
you know i started my psychedelic

2935
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:10,320
journey pretty young i took lsd for the

2936
01:48:08,079 --> 01:48:12,800
first time at 15 years old

2937
01:48:10,319 --> 01:48:15,679
and got very heavily into it for a

2938
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:18,000
couple years which had an enormous

2939
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:19,359
impact on my life for the better

2940
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,238
actually

2941
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:24,719
my my my younger days were pretty wild

2942
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:27,919
you know i grew up a skateboarder uh

2943
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:29,840
with a single parent that was a business

2944
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:32,800
owner so there was a lot of freedom and

2945
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:34,960
i got into a lot of things young and

2946
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:37,119
i was going down a track that probably

2947
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:40,158
wouldn't have been really beneficial to

2948
01:48:37,118 --> 01:48:42,479
my longevity and after experiencing

2949
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:44,079
psychedelics mostly lsd and then a

2950
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:45,519
little bit of mushrooms towards the end

2951
01:48:44,079 --> 01:48:46,719
there by the time i was finishing high

2952
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:48,960
school

2953
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:50,960
it completely changed me and put me on

2954
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:53,359
the academic track you know i i found

2955
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:55,039
some better people to be friends with i

2956
01:48:53,359 --> 01:48:57,439
got this amazing

2957
01:48:55,039 --> 01:48:58,880
young lady that i started dating and we

2958
01:48:57,439 --> 01:49:00,399
were together for 10 years that she

2959
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:01,840
helped steer me in the right direction i

2960
01:49:00,399 --> 01:49:03,759
ended up going to college going to

2961
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:05,119
graduate school getting a phd and all

2962
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:07,119
this stuff so

2963
01:49:05,118 --> 01:49:08,639
i really strongly believe that the

2964
01:49:07,118 --> 01:49:11,118
combination of

2965
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:13,679
cannabis and psychedelics

2966
01:49:11,118 --> 01:49:15,839
helped put me where i am today and uh so

2967
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:17,279
i've been involved with this counter

2968
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:19,360
culture

2969
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:22,238
for my whole life since i was about 15

2970
01:49:19,359 --> 01:49:24,559
and i'm 45 now so for 30 years i've been

2971
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:27,519
involved at the edge of counter culture

2972
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:29,599
as a skateboarder as a you know cannabis

2973
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:31,199
person and um

2974
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:33,039
very very

2975
01:49:31,198 --> 01:49:35,279
bullish on the ability of psychedelics

2976
01:49:33,039 --> 01:49:36,960
to do positive things to people and now

2977
01:49:35,279 --> 01:49:39,118
we're finally here all these years later

2978
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:41,840
where we're given the tools i happened

2979
01:49:39,118 --> 01:49:44,238
to get the education and now i can be

2980
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:45,440
put in the position to help a bunch of

2981
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:46,399
people

2982
01:49:45,439 --> 01:49:48,638
um

2983
01:49:46,399 --> 01:49:50,319
you know overcome challenges that might

2984
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:52,000
provide them with a better life down the

2985
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:54,719
road so that's kind of

2986
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,639
why i'm here how i got here and i just

2987
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:59,679
really appreciate the opportunity to

2988
01:49:56,639 --> 01:50:01,599
share uh what i know about the mushrooms

2989
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:03,440
and the analytics and the science behind

2990
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:05,440
it and i'm really excited to see where

2991
01:50:03,439 --> 01:50:08,158
all this goes in the future well thank

2992
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:10,399

2993
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:12,960
follow along with george

2994
01:50:10,399 --> 01:50:16,319
and his research there is but one place

2995
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:17,920
to go and that is the flourish lab's uh

2996
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,920

analytics but you're very interested in

01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:48,880
in keeping up with uh the science and

3008
