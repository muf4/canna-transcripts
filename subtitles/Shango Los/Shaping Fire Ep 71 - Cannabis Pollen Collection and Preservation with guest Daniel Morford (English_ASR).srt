2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,199
it's funny how some things are evil

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,480
until they are not when i was getting my

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,718
start in cultivation

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,160
male cannabis plants were a scourge they

6
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:17,519
essentially damaged the female

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,118
plants that we were trying to grow as

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,559
medicine and we had to be on the

9
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,559
constant lookout because they were

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,640
sneaky and they could get missed

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,079
my mentor hector enjoyed the hunt though

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,439
and catching the boys before they could

13
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,959
get at the girls

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,559
it wasn't long though before we started

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,280
thinking about crossing particular

16
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,238
plants to make a more reliable medicinal

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,320
plant

18
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,718
suddenly those male plants had a role to

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,119
play and the pollen was valuable

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,759
of course cannabis breeding is so hot

21
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,119
right now

22
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,199
and pollen is more valuable than ever

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,439
have you used cbg dominant cannabis

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,039
flower tincture or other preparations in

25
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,599
the last six months

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,160
dr ethan russo asked me to let you know

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
that he

28
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,759
and others are conducting a study to

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,878
determine the benefits and drawbacks to

30
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,960
cannabidirol

31
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,640
and they would love your opinion the

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,558
questionnaire takes about 10 minutes and

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,200
can be anonymous if you wish

34
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,920
the study is available at bitly forward

i'm your host shango los

67
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,359
my guest today is daniel morford of

68
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,118
heart rock mountain farm

69
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,719
daniel is a lifelong cannabis farmer

70
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,120
having learned from his dad who started

71
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,400
growing in 1976 on their family farm in

72
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,080
mendocino

73
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
daniel has been cultivating with a focus

74
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,319
on breeding for some 17 seasons now

75
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,759
and he and his dad continue to focus on

76
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,159
licensed cannabis breeding

77
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,919
with their california nursery license

78
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,919
the farm has earned the prestigious

79
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,479
dragonfly earth medicine den pure

80
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,399
certification for regenerative farming

81
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,000
today we'll be discussing the collection

82
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,760
storage and application of cannabis

83
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,159
pollen

84
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,079
one note on audio quality i migrated

85
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,840
shaping fire to new recording software

86
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,959
this week and i didn't get the settings

87
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,719
exactly correct

88
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,120
the next few episodes that we recorded

89
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,120
are all fine but this particular episode

90
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,000
included a bit of learning curve on my

91
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
part so the mic

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,080
doesn't sound as good as usual luckily

93
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,680
though daniel sounds fine and we're all

94
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,519
here to hear him anyway

95
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,280
so thanks for tolerating me recording on

96
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,120
the wrong mic and next week's show

97
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,719
sounds better than any shaping fire in

98
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,920
the past

99
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,400
welcome to the show daniel it's good to

100
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,799
be here

101
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,239
right on man so hey let's get right into

102
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,719
it you know historically

103
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,599
males have been shunned and destroyed by

104
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,759
everybody they've been

105
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,878
they were a threat to the garden for

106
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,359
those who are

107
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,039
new to this part of cultivation why do

108
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,640
we want to collect pollen in the first

109
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,959
place

110
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:29,039
uh you know to to make seeds is

111
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,519
the pretty much only use right now

112
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,000
although we have sent off pollen for

113
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,920
research

114
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,239
and development as a supplement to a

115
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,439
company in los angeles

116
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,599
i hadn't heard of that that's a pretty

117
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,878
cool idea but yeah to make seeds and so

118
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,759
that's that's why folks

119
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:46,878
want to do it um when when do we collect

120
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:49,439
the pollen from these males

121
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,719
well you know it depends if you're an

122
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,120
outdoor grower or

123
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,878
an indoor grower and i do outdoor

124
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,759
cultivation the males

125
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,560
generally flower before the females not

126
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,679
all of them

127
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,640
you know um so you know they'll start

128
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,159
coming in

129
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:09,359
sometimes a month before the females

130
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,280
depending on which cultivar

131
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,879
uh that must be kind of inconvenient for

132
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,280
nature right for the pollen

133
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,120
to be dropping so much earlier than the

134
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,319
the ladies are ready for it

135
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,879
um but they they keep dropping those so

136
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,120
you know

137
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,079
how my dad first acclimatized south

138
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,560
american

139
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,719
and mexican sativas to the climate here

140
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,199
in mendocino county was collecting that

141
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,919
first

142
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,560
pollen and putting it on just the

143
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:37,039
indicator hairs of these sativas

144
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,560
so the which grow off the main stock not

145
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,879
even in a bud and within a couple

146
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,120
generations of taking the earliest

147
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,120
males to those indicator hailers they

148
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,600
had acclimized

149
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,840
south american strains to the mountains

150
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,320
of medicinal county

151
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,519
so um so you said that they they keep

152
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,478
dropping though so

153
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,159
so with most yields they keep do we find

154
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,120
that they they're actually starting

155
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,320
early ahead of the female flowers

156
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,560
becoming mature

157
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,599
and then they're and they often are

158
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,918
dropping pollen

159
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
throughout the entirety of the blooming

160
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,799
process

161
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,360
yes they would yeah so yeah

162
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,840
go ahead and then what yeah that's why

163
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,120
and

164
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,198
when we talk later about the open

165
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,560
pollination projects but i'll eventually

166
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,560
cut the males down because they'll just

167
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,360
keep going and you want to make sure

168
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,199
that the seeds

169
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,199
that you have going will mature and not

170
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,560
just keep you know better

171
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,639
yes because so you want to cut down on

172
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,240
the immature seeds because

173
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,000
if the pollen keeps on dropping

174
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,560
throughout the summer

175
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,478
if if a plant if a female plant gets

176
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,319
pollinated at the end of the summer

177
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,560
there's no way that seed's going to ever

178
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,079
finish outdoors so it's better to just

179
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,600
prevent that

180
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,918
i mean it depends on where you are i

181
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,680
harvested a bunch of seed ranches

182
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,120
yesterday which is the latest i've ever

183
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,038
had them but we're in a little banana

184
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,199
belt for our region

185
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,038
yeah yeah for most parts of the country

186
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,038
uh here at the end of november

187
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,079
when we're recording this um everybody's

188
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:01,839
mostly done

189
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,758
and the plants you know being seasonal

190
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,879
have gone to mold already

191
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,919
um you know you said that your dad um

192
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:12,079
did a lot with early season pollen

193
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,599
is the is pollen essentially the same

194
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,918
whether it's early season

195
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
or late season it's it's all viable

196
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,120
right

197
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,478
right yeah yeah i mean it's just you

198
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,680
know

199
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,918
different expressions of genetics

200
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,879
oh it is so well wait with the it's it

201
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,599
can be

202
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,478
so so sometimes the the traits in the

203
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,960
pollen

204
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,000
change over the course of the year well

205
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,719
yeah i mean if you're

206
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,600
doing you know out let's say you have a

207
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,240
seed lot and

208
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,160
you know so you could select the later

209
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,000
flowering males in it or the earlier

210
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,360
flowering males or you know some

211
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
some you know it or like look for

212
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,479
specific

213
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,439
structure in the buds but yeah i mean

214
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,199
would they

215
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,120
say from plant to plant if there's

216
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,319
variety but not necessarily within the

217
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,959
same plant

218
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,039
and i found that in the females too even

219
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,799
a stable seed line you're harvesting

220
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:06,159
over two weeks

221
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,879
of you know of maturity and you know

222
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,360
in the female so you see a similar thing

223
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,879
in

224
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,879
the males and then sometimes you get

225
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,159
within that two-week window you get a

226
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,800
few

227
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,919
on two weeks above or before that window

228
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,038
with both males and females

229
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,478
so um is there any um

230
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,318
you know for people who will be doing

231
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,038
this for the first time

232
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,759
it's always interesting to see the male

233
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,159
flowers

234
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,280
form looking like you know little balls

235
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
and everything

236
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,559
and um and and then it seems like once

237
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,240
they

238
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,759
once they start to form if you're

239
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,038
excited about it sometimes it like takes

240
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,120
seems to take forever

241
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,560
for the first ones to pop open and start

242
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,918
pollinating you're like man is it time

243
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,918
yet is it time yet

244
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:53,839
um you know some people who are you know

245
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,159
maybe newish and aggressive you know

246
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,399
they start to mess with the balls to you

247
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,199
know the flowers to try to get them to

248
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,000
pop

249
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,478
um you know do you ever encourage that

250
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,478
or

251
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,758
are you very much to keep your hands off

252
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:09,519
the plant

253
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,520
oh it depends like uh

254
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,879
uh but it's usually i've only ever

255
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,960
really done it with like

256
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,160
you know the autoflowers or something

257
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,638
but yeah i have

258
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:25,120
actually you know picked off um ripe

259
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,199
male clusters that you know they have

260
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,319
like a more yellowish color and then you

261
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,800
can take those

262
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,439
before they open and you could just you

263
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
know

264
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,599
squeeze them a little bit and pinch them

265
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,959
and pollen will come out onto

266
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,479
and you can just pick off a bunch of

267
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,319
those male flowers and go right to the

268
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,919
female you want to pollinate and just

269
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,160
give it a little

270
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:49,039
uh pressure and and they'll

271
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,480
send out some fresh pollen we should

272
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,879
probably consider that to be

273
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,000
something that we do rarely right like

274
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,000
in extreme

275
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,600
stances though yeah or like when the

276
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,278
timing's right you go oh wow this male

277
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,040
is ready oh and i want to put it on this

278
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:04,639
female you could do that and

279
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,958
it does work in yeah so it's

280
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,080
you know it's it can be something you

281
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,000
can do

282
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,000
but definitely the majority of the

283
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,639
pollination isn't done that way

284
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,720
right on so uh we're going to talk a lot

285
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,439
about uh technique here in a little bit

286
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,360
but kind of generally um i'd like you to

287
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,000
talk to the idea of pollen being

288
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,480
fragile right because uh yeah you know

289
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,440
yeah

290
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,320
it's this it's this uh you know very

291
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,040
fragile

292
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,399
powder that we're working with and um

293
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,519
what are the ways that some of the ways

294
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,519
that we can damage

295
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,278
pollen and render it inert and not

296
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,320
useful

297
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,519
um you know moisture for sure you know

298
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,640
you want to make sure

299
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:48,799
that the pollen you've harvested is kept

300
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,799
dry and you know

301
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,838
and then i store it in a jar with you

302
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,959
know a moisture absorbent packet and

303
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,880
then also

304
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,399
during like you just harvested your

305
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,799
pollen

306
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,519
you don't want to put it in the fridge

307
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,679
and

308
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,360
unless you want to do long-term storage

309
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,039
and or the freezer for really long-term

310
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,839
storage your best just to keep it in a

311
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,199
constant

312
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,120
temperature like room temperature would

313
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,800
be fine you know i keep mine on the

314
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,639
kitchen table

315
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,159
by our air conditioner so it stays like

316
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,078
around you know 70 and

317
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,600
because you don't want to take it from

318
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:20,559
such an extreme environment like the

319
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,519
fridge out to

320
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,599
your garden where you're going to

321
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,360
pollinate because that that going back

322
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,000
and forth will limit the

323
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,959
viability of your pollen right because

324
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,879
you're you're you're

325
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,000
you know changing heat back and forth

326
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,639
and you're changing humidity

327
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,360
back and forth and um we don't want to

328
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,159
be changing

329
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,399
uh the state that much that's for sure

330
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,039
and

331
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,919
you know one of the longest cases of

332
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,120
viable pollen

333
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,879
i've heard was just from noaa from

334
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,399
golden figs this year he had pollen that

335
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,078
he'd harvested in april but it's

336
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,600
actually it's still in the male flower

337
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,479
he just dried the male flower and he

338
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,759
used that that fall

339
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,000
so he he kept it in the male flower

340
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,120
yeah he just dried the whole yeah that's

341
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,759
a pretty cool check i haven't heard of

342
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,000
that

343
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,039
i hadn't heard of it either first time

344
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,039
for me the most

345
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,639
dangerous aspect of collecting the

346
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,599
pollen and you know as far as its

347
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,240
fragility is

348
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,040
is just being careful to not have it

349
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,440
blow away

350
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,159
you know either by my breath or a breeze

351
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,760
or

352
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,360
somebody setting something down on the

353
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,720
table while i'm working with it it's

354
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,600
it's really remarkable i mean

355
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,680
it's designed to be carried by by light

356
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,680
breezes right and so it takes that job

357
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,759
bill seriously

358
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,439
yeah i i definitely find myself holding

359
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,679
my breath during certain aspects of

360
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,519
pollen collection

361
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,599
so so let's go ahead and get like into

362
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,039
that part of it so um you know

363
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,278
during the second set we're going to be

364
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:44,159
talking a lot more on like scaling

365
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,159
up a number of plants but we want to

366
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,000
make sure that we kind of go through the

367
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,240
simple version of this once

368
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,399
um for folks who are new to this idea

369
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,240
and patients and home growers and

370
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,000
and then second set we'll we'll hit it a

371
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,120
little harder for the for the you know

372
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,639
people who are

373
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,799
you know doing larger sips and

374
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,560
everything so

375
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,919
so will you will you walk us through it

376
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,919
assuming that um

377
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,519
you know that the cultivator has got one

378
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:08,799
male and one female

379
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,879
just take us through the whole process

380
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:15,838
from the very beginning

381
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,838
yeah so um

382
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,600
you know you can just pretty much leave

383
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,600
the mail alone

384
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,120
until it starts to get nice and chunky

385
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,120
you don't really have to worry about it

386
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,159
until it gets you know deep into flour

387
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,600
and then

388
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,120
you know depending on how you're

389
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,240
harvesting your pollen you want to check

390
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,240
it a couple times a day

391
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,399
before in you know you know some of the

392
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,399
easiest way someone can make seeds with

393
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,159
a with one male and one female would be

394
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,120
to have them in a five gallon pot and

395
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,278
just take them into the shower

396
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,879
yeah or the bathroom or somewhere you

397
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,320
know isolated from the rest of the

398
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,879
garden

399
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,800
you know and then that you know let the

400
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,480
the pollen get on the female

401
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,240
and then cut down the male rinse

402
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,879
everything off you know water destroys

403
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,278
pollen

404
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,120
pretty quickly and then you know give

405
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,600
that female

406
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,360
24 to 48 hours rinse her off take her

407
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,639
back out with the general population and

408
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,360
you're good

409
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,399
um another thing that the home grower

410
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,159
might want to look into

411
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,519
i've never used it but it is in some

412
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,360
reading books are the

413
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,320
i think they're on the internet they're

414
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,680
called um blossom bags and they're

415
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,519
they're used in seed making to not

416
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,879
have cross pollination between like

417
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,480
different varieties of tomatoes and

418
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,720
whatever and what you can literally do

419
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,560
is

420
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,160
you can prune up the mail a little bit

421
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,278
and put these blossom bags

422
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,199
over the male flower collect those

423
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,720
and then put that same bag over your

424
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,879
over the female branch you want to make

425
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,920
seeds on you know

426
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:47,679
one small branch can

427
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,278
yield you know 50 to 300 seeds

428
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:50,799
yeah so that you can you know then

429
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,480
there's a lot of fun in that too when

430
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,120
you're when you're just learning

431
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,720
how to collect and use pollen um it's

432
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,879
actually pretty cool you know you don't

433
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,240
have to do an entire plant sometimes

434
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,759
people will just take their

435
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,919
you know a few branches and maybe

436
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,600
pollinate it with you know two or

437
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,958
one female plant with two or three

438
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,040
different males

439
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,559
so this prime this branch will be this

440
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,519
cross and this branch will be another

441
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,919
cross

442
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,879
and and it's it's a great way to

443
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,799
practice to

444
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,000
you know get your skills up and also to

445
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,278
learn how

446
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,360
different pollen um interacts with uh

447
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,320
with the same female plant

448
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,879
yeah i definitely will paint some ladies

449
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,519
up just

450
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,240
be like oh i'm gonna you find a good one

451
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,159
or something

452
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,639
oh this is gonna get a lot of fallen you

453
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,639
know from

454
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:40,399
so um so the first the first technique

455
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,399
that you suggested was just simply

456
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,360
taking the male and the female plant

457
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,919
and isolating them somewhere uh for

458
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,199
example

459
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,719
a a shower or or a you know a small room

460
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:51,838
in your house and just letting them be

461
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,519
near each other and

462
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,279
you know i've done this as well i kind

463
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,078
of you know wrap them into each other

464
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:57,919
and tap

465
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,198
the mail a little bit and you know just

466
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,278
kind of get that going

467
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,639
um why don't you go through what it's

468
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,278
like to actually

469
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,159
um you know uh you know tap the plant

470
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,720
and remove

471
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,838
remove it for uh for painting back on

472
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,639
with a brush why don't you talk us

473
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,839
through that process

474
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:17,440
yeah so for your average

475
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,440
um home grower you know what we

476
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,639
have done and people still do is you

477
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,320
know you just

478
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,560
once that mail gets nice and chunky and

479
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,360
you know it looks like it's going to

480
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,758
open maybe

481
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,399
maybe it's opened you know started to

482
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,919
open

483
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,320
or some of the you know you can take

484
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,399
that and make a bouquet out of it and

485
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,600
put it in either a jar of water or you

486
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,440
can do like a

487
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,399
jar of um nutrients in there

488
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,000
you know like i think uh josh and kelly

489
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,720
of dragonfly earth medicine do like a

490
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,720
nettle tea

491
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,639
for it you know i just do water but you

492
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,000
know sometimes

493
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,759
you'll get a dud where you you'll

494
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,399
bouquet a male and it won't drop and

495
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,919
maybe if

496
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,839
i didn't he was just water maybe that

497
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:01,120
would you know help it out

498
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,800
um so then you take that bouquet into

499
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,919
somewhere in your house and you

500
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:10,559
some people have it under a you know

501
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:13,360
pirate pyrex dish or over

502
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,198
you know a sheet of wax paper or

503
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,720
whatever you want that to collect that

504
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,758
pollen on

505
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,120
and you let it do its thing till it

506
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,039
looks like you have enough pollen for

507
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
what you need

508
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,078
and then you scrape it up get the plant

509
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,839
material out

510
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,198
you know put it in a jar with a moisture

511
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,600
absorbent packet keep it in

512
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,120
like a dry place let that pollen cure

513
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,120
for a few days and then you can put a

514
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,039
lid on it and you're good

515
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,320
and then when it comes time to apply

516
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:44,958
the paint brush you know um you

517
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,079
you wait for a uh look at check your

518
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,439
weather reports

519
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,278
early in the morning like right at

520
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,240
sunrise where we're at there's like

521
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,278
nowhere little wind and this year i made

522
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,639
myself some

523
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:59,360
uh like windscreens to

524
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,198
set up so that you know i didn't waste

525
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,519
my mornings getting up really early with

526
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,519
my pollen kit

527
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,120
when there's a one mile an hour when i'm

528
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,599
like oh i can't you know or two mile

529
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,759
three

530
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,000
you know they would ruin my morning of

531
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,679
seed making but

532
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,279
uh especially with the scale that i

533
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,199
achieved this year it

534
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,798
helped accomplish that but even on your

535
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,558
small you know set up some windscreens

536
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,759
or get some of those chinese curtains

537
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:22,798
even would work great are they

538
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,558
i don't know if they're chinese but

539
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:24,959
asian curtains you know like the folding

540
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,678
ones

541
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,038
that but we use the i made some with

542
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,080
just some bamboo

543
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:35,119
and the frost protection fabric

544
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,119
uh remake

545
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,240
and then you know and then you paint you

546
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,240
know if there's no wind

547
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,079
you can get right above the branch you

548
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,519
want look you want to paint and just tap

549
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,119
the brush and you can see the

550
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,558
the pollen just fall straight down to

551
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,759
the ground

552
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:53,599
and i've even seen that when harvesting

553
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,038
some males that were starting to open in

554
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:56,959
our mail garden on a no-win

555
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,440
morning you could wash the pollen

556
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,400
doesn't get very far

557
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,440
when you uh when you make this bouquet

558
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,919
of the

559
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,360
flowers and um and i like this technique

560
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,759
this is not one that i've tried

561
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,000
that you you know you put it into a

562
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:15,440
mason jar or something that acts like a

563
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,640
vase and and you've got your either just

564
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,798
straight water or

565
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,679
a light nutrient solution perhaps in

566
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,879
there

567
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,360
and um and they they start to open i

568
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,919
imagine that there's going to be pollen

569
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,959
on the

570
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,200
sides of the mason jar and then

571
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,480
whatever you're collecting below it do

572
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,960
you put any kind of a

573
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,120
dome over it so that the pollen doesn't

574
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,319
go elsewhere in the room

575
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:43,918
you know um i haven't in the past

576
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,359
but you know and you know like i said i

577
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,000
have developed

578
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,599
like other techniques um when we started

579
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,679
just to scale up

580
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,199
um in the pollen boxes and i do have a

581
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,640
pyro

582
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,400
plexiglas lid for those when i in a in a

583
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,400
little hole with a coat hanger and i do

584
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,919
stir them up

585
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,559
so the palm doesn't go elsewhere and it

586
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,759
just drops into the

587
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,440
box and i've made you know the

588
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,640
homegrower could just use a cardboard

589
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,840
box to do that too

590
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,200
you know they could get creative if they

591
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,199
wanted to

592
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,038
but you know like yeah when we had like

593
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,558
eight males we'd have one in the kitchen

594
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:23,119
one in the bedroom one in the back you

595
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,079
know

596
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,839
you just you spread them out you know

597
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,519
yeah and and you know certainly that's

598
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,678
uh that's something that's perfectly

599
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,519
good for uh for a home or a

600
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,200
patient thing but you know as you get

601
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,798
more calm you know as you get more

602
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,240
hardcore about it like you are nowadays

603
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,160
you're gonna want to keep those

604
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,000
um you know a lot more excluded from

605
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,960
each other you mentioned that

606
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,160
um once the pollen is dropped onto your

607
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,200
collecting

608
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:52,480
you know paper or pyrex or whatever

609
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,319
um that then you um

610
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,919
and then you jumped to you know the

611
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,399
paint brush part but let's talk about

612
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,759
taking the pollen off of that

613
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,360
piece of paper or or pyrex so

614
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,319
um how how much do you clean up the

615
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,038
pollen

616
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,599
before you remove it from that dish

617
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,440
because like

618
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,119
you know so there's a lot of stuff that

619
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,320
that drops from plants in addition to

620
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,519
pollen

621
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:20,798
yep i like to get mine 99 clean

622
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:23,359
and i use just a couple like my you know

623
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,918
costco card or whatever use two cards

624
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:28,959
and

625
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:32,400
you know um very carefully i will

626
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,240
do a very light just kind of hold the

627
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,960
the card loose in my hand

628
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,079
and drag it over the paper and that gets

629
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,720
the plant material

630
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,798
out towards the bottom and then i

631
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,519
manipulate that a couple times and get

632
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,558
the majority of the i get the plant

633
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,200
material off with

634
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,839
as little pollen as possible and you

635
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,840
know

636
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,519
i have used tweezers before in the past

637
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,279
but i've developed a nice

638
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,519
light touch technique to get the

639
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,678
majority of the plant material off

640
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:02,480
with just a couple cards but yeah you

641
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,320
know tweezers will work too or

642
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,919
you know i i haven't done it but i know

643
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,119
some people have used like the little

644
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,679
tea strainers or whatever you know

645
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,879
and it is important to get those um you

646
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,440
know often

647
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,280
some of the plant material are the the

648
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,679
outer layers of the male

649
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,678
flowers because once they pop open the

650
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,200
the outside folds of the flower starts

651
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,880
to dry and drop off

652
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,558
but when they drop off they're not

653
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,600
really totally dry

654
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:32,240
and so um what you're doing is is

655
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,199
adding risk to your pollen because

656
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,960
that's essentially

657
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,880
water right there's water in that in

658
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,759
that male flower part

659
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,480
um that's gonna that's gonna threaten so

660
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:42,079
so

661
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,759
let's say that you're not immediately

662
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,879
gonna go over to

663
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,640
the female plant to apply the pollen

664
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,000
but you're also not saving this for

665
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,400
months let's say that you're just like

666
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,880
saving it for like let's say three days

667
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,519
um what do you like to put your pollen

668
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,799
in

669
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:00,960
to hold it and keep it safe until the

670
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,000
day that you're going to use it

671
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,319
i like that those little amber jars i

672
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,798
i'm not sure the size on them but you

673
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,798
know they're like

674
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,080
a glass essentially though yeah glass

675
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,519
jar

676
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,678
you know like the um

677
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,879
it was a moisture packet and that'll be

678
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,000
viable for

679
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,360
two months at least just in in your

680
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,599
kitchen

681
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,199
or in a in a cabinet or you know

682
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,119
somewhere a cool

683
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,798
you know constant temperature is

684
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:35,279
probably more important

685
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,000
you know you don't need to manipulate it

686
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,158
too much

687
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,759
yeah yeah room temperature cool get it

688
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,240
out of the sun get it out of temperature

689
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:45,359
changes don't put it near the heater

690
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,798
yeah yeah totally um

691
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,719
and then you know another thing you have

692
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,679
to be cons you know now

693
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,360
and this with the hemp aphid is aphids

694
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,679
will really mess with

695
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,879
the the your pollen viability if you

696
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,960
don't get them off

697
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,200
or reduce their population not you know

698
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,038
that was what we discovered

699
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,480
last year you know we lost batches of

700
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,279
pollen to

701
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,960
to the aphid the hemp aphid wow i'm

702
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,558
really glad i haven't run into that so

703
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,480
so as you're collecting your pollen

704
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,158
you're also collecting aphids in the

705
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,919
in the dust is that what how what it was

706
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,919
like you can yeah you can

707
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,520
you know so we actually i did you know

708
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,960
this year was a lot of first this was

709
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,599
the first year i ever

710
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,319
you know sprayed male plants for past

711
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,558
this you know

712
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:33,038
pesticides we just did a uh

713
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,038
a uh insecticidal soap knocked the

714
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,038
aphids down and

715
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,960
sure that's interesting though because

716
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:39,759
yeah that's something to keep in mind

717
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
though because

718
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,599
if you are going to use an insecticidal

719
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,240
soap or if you're going to use anything

720
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,639
with essential oils in it at all

721
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,159
all of that could mess with the pollen

722
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,200
and so you want to make sure that you

723
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,320
are aggressive

724
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,519
with your um pesticide natural pesticide

725
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,079
remedies

726
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,839
early on so that the week that you're

727
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,079
expecting your pollen to drop you're not

728
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:05,038
doing any of that monkey business

729
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,439
yeah yeah and you know that hemp a fit

730
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,599
is

731
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,640
tenacious so um the last thing i want to

732
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,399
hit before we

733
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,480
uh go to the first commercial and then

734
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,480
come back and talk about doing this at a

735
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,839
much much more scaled level

736
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,798
um you you mentioned uh

737
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,678
you know you you're applying the uh

738
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:25,839
pollen

739
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,840
uh with a just you know just a simple

740
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,158
water coloring paintbrush and

741
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,359
you know yeah this isn't rocket science

742
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,760
you can you know

743
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,599
tap above it and let it fall on it or

744
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,720
live or actually paint it yeah yeah or

745
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,000
literally paint it

746
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,839
but the the next thing you said is

747
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,240
something that i don't usually do um

748
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,599
you mentioned um you know you know i

749
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,640
think you said wait a couple days and

750
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,278
wash her down

751
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,038
talk to us about that oh you know if

752
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,480
you're i don't do it either but if you

753
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:54,158
if you were concerned

754
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,798
if you did like an indoor

755
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,440
um and you took the female out of one

756
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:02,400
female out of your room to pollinate it

757
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,000
then you would wait 24 48 hours to put

758
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,038
it back in and if you were really

759
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,119
paranoid about

760
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,480
you know pollinating the other general

761
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,639
population you would

762
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,839
then watch rinse that off that female

763
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,120
off before you brought it in

764
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,319
you know if you wanted to be extra safe

765
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,319
that you know you know

766
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,759
sure so but but when you say rinse it

767
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,599
off do you i mean

768
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,119
that i mean like you don't mean like

769
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,558
with a hose you just mean like mist it

770
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,158
with a spray bottle

771
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,399
sure yeah but it depends on how far

772
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,400
along in the flour you know if you got

773
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,240
you know depends on how far you are in

774
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,440
the flower

775
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,640
so what are the different options

776
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,480
depending on where it is in the flower

777
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,840
break that out a little bit

778
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,759
yeah and also the you know the

779
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,959
the pollen sticks pretty good there too

780
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,359
but yeah you could mis

781
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,079
just missed it off with at any stage it

782
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,359
would

783
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:52,000
you know know the pollen

784
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,439
so so if we're cleaning off the plant

785
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,759
and i get the idea we kind of want to

786
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,480
make

787
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,119
any any loose pollen that's you know on

788
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,679
a leaf or or didn't really join with the

789
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:01,359
plant

790
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,880
we don't want to reintroduce that to our

791
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,119
tent or or put it

792
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,720
up upwind from a plant that we're not

793
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,158
planning on pollinating

794
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,480
um will that threaten the pollen that we

795
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,278
have

796
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,159
already placed on the female flowers

797
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,519
that we want to

798
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,240
have turn into seeds not if you wait you

799
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,918
know

800
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,159
24 to 48 hours uh because that's

801
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,038
processed that's already impregnated

802
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,400
that

803
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:30,158
uh i forget the what the hair the

804
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,840
statement is a statement which or the

805
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,520
female i forget the

806
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,439
technical term but yeah it's already

807
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,480
started this job is done

808
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,000
electrical process there yeah right on

809
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,159
all right well cool well that takes us

810
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,200
through uh you know how to do it uh

811
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,840
simply for

812
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,278
for one person um so let's go ahead and

813
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,079
take our commercial break when we come

814
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,079
back

815
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,278
uh we're gonna be talking about scaling

816
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,079
it when you're we're trying you're

817
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:55,278
trying to do this

818
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:57,678
for uh dozens and dozens of plants as

819
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,038
part of a breeding program uh we're

820
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,360
gonna take a short break and be right

821
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:01,278
back

822
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,119
you are listening to shaping fire and my

823
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:07,038
guest today is daniel morford

824
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:09,359
of heart rock mountain farm

825
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:11,359
oxygen is an essential plant nutrient

826
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,359
and keeping sufficient dissolved oxygen

827
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,519
in the root zone is a challenge

828
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,519
gaia's brand of ultra fine nanobubble

829
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,599
systems will help your garden thrive in

830
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,359
ways you may not have considered

831
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,359
no matter if you grow in soil

832
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,918
hydroponics or aquaponics

833
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,759
gaia's ultrafine nanobubble systems will

834
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,720
increase your dissolved oxygen

835
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,879
and increase your yield often the first

836
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,798
sign of inadequate oxygen supply to the

837
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,679
roots is wilting of the plant under warm

838
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,319
conditions and

839
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,559
high light levels insufficient oxygen

840
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,319
results in an accumulation of toxins

841
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,839
and an insufficient amount of water and

842
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,319
mineral absorption

843
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,158
if oxygen starvation continues mineral

844
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,000
deficiencies will begin to show

845
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,278
roots die back and plants will become

846
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,200
stunted

847
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,839
healthy roots supplied with sufficient

848
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,640
oxygen are able to absorb nutrient ions

849
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:58,319
selectively

850
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,080
from the surrounding solution as

851
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,398
required in studies

852
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,519
this has shown a 30 increase in plant

853
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,918
growth

854
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,440
not only do ultrafine oxygen bubbles

855
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,038
allow your plants to thrive

856
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,278
but they will keep your drip lines and

857
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,599
irrigation pipes and plumbing clean too

858
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,319
because algae pythium and other invasive

859
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,519
species

860
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,759
only survive in low oxygen environments

861
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,679
and the gaia system only costs about two

862
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:24,720
dollars per day to run

863
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,960
gaia ultra fine oxygen nano bubblers

864
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,038
are also great for making compost teas

865
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,440
and wild crafted nutrient teas

866
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,158
the smaller bubbles of truly dissolved

867
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,200
oxygen

868
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:39,120
allow more microbes to reproduce faster

869
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,960
go to gaia's website at h2o5.com

870
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,119
to learn more about using dissolved

871
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,960
oxygen and how to purchase the simple

872
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:49,599
yet amazing technology

873
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,600
that's h205.com

874
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,079
with the national hemp program in flux

875
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,879
due to stringent thc testing

876
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,558
requirements

877
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,159
brother seth and eric crawford continue

878
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:59,038
to release seeds to hemp farmers that

879
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,960
will be legal

880
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,079
no matter how you grow them or when you

881
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,159
test them

882
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,879
these new varieties from oregon cbd

883
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,320
seeds have substantial amounts of cbdv

884
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,240
cbgv cbcv and thcv

885
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,000
while always staying below the point

886
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,159
three percent thc limit

887
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,079
and guaranteeing compliant crops for

888
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,919
farmers every time

889
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:21,278
also these new varieties cannot be

890
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,559
pollinated by your neighbor's

891
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:25,359
uncontrolled pollen

892
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:27,918
or a rogue male in your own crop either

893
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,959
oregon cbd seeds are non-gmo certified

894
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,679
too

895
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,919
oregon cbd seeds was founded and funded

896
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,759
in 2015 by seth and eric

897
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,840
maxing out their personal credit cards

898
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,440
without outside investment

899
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:40,720
they continue to refuse outside

900
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,399
investment that would change their

901
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,120
company culture

902
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,959
oregon cbd grows tons of fresh food on

903
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,599
their research farms for local food

904
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,240
banks

905
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,798
literally tons of food they also give

906
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,679
away tens of thousands of pounds of r d

907
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,639
flour to patients as their company began

908
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,480
to succeed

909
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,399
seth and eric started donating money to

910
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,278
the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber

911
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,199
cause 2

912
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,359
by giving millions of dollars to oregon

913
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,200
state university in order to establish

914
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,719
the world's leading cannabis genomics

915
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,720
research program

916
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,319
and they treat their employees right

917
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,919
oregon cbd pays for

918
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,000
full health and dental coverage for

919
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,240
their employees a 401k

920
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,679
program and their minimum starting wage

921
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,558
is 20 bucks an hour

922
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,159
plus everyone shares food from the farms

923
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,398
seth has been on shaping fire a few

hart rock mountain farm so during the

970
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,640
first set we talked about

971
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:03,839
you know the real basics of what it is

972
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,720
to work with pollen

973
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,199
and how to collect and pollinate one

974
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,038
plant

975
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,038
when you don't need to save it and you

976
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,278
know in an ideal situation

977
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,240
it would be that easy all the time but

978
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:16,720
when you start

979
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,798
getting you know really into breeding

980
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,720
and or or producing a lot of different

981
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:23,119
variety of seeds for your farm

982
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,360
to make yourself more you know uh you

983
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,599
know self-reliant

984
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,558
the numbers get up pretty quickly and uh

985
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:30,079
you know when

986
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:31,678
one of the reasons why i was excited

987
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:32,240
about having you on the show for this

988
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,720
daniel

989
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,159
is you know when when we were you know

990
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,480
chatting and you're like oh yeah you

991
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,559
know

992
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,480
we did 150 different cultivars this year

993
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,918
and like i i'm sure that there are other

994
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,440
people who are doing that kind of volume

995
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,399
but i've never heard of that kind of

996
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,440
volume before and i'm

997
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:51,518
like my god keeping up you know over 150

998
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,759
different cultivars straight where

999
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,440
you know on a season that i do six i'm

1000
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,278
all like oh man things are starting to

1001
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,080
get pretty chaotic right

1002
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,038
so um so why don't you start us out with

1003
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,798
you know

1004
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:07,440
when you when you are planning

1005
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:09,038
for that many plants yeah how do you

1006
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,038
think it through in advance

1007
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:12,398
and then and then start walking us

1008
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,679
through how you go about

1009
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:17,918
handling that kind of volume

1010
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,919
yeah well i was a little nervous

1011
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,640
actually and i

1012
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,880
and i didn't necessarily think it

1013
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,840
through but i had a plan you know

1014
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,559
and you know necessity is the mother of

1015
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,278
invention

1016
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,398
yeah so you know when we scaled up from

1017
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,440
eight

1018
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,599
to e you know to 20 you know i made my

1019
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,759
first prototype pollen collection box

1020
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,798
with cardboard and

1021
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:45,038
uh it was i got wardrobe boxes i

1022
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:47,038
pre-slit the front ends of them so and

1023
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:49,679
then take those back up so then i could

1024
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:51,359
you know undo those and access the

1025
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,000
bottom of the box where i also did a

1026
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,199
pre-cut

1027
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,880
square with wax paper and then i closed

1028
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,558
that back up and that was my first

1029
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,880
pollen collection box i put my male

1030
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:03,119
bouquet in there let it do its thing it

1031
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,799
harvested a lot more pond than previous

1032
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:09,118
techniques and then

1033
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:12,079
when we went from 20 to 50 and 50 to 75

1034
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,480
you know we went to 20 to 50 i i had my

1035
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,159
friends

1036
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,719
in ukya help me build

1037
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,639
wooden pond collection boxes for one

1038
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,759
like the wardrobe boxes are expensive

1039
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,639
and then they're

1040
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,599
you know a couple uses or in one season

1041
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,679
they're warped from

1042
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,119
rinsing them out in between uses in the

1043
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,679
water really

1044
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,440
so we came up with these really nice

1045
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,599
wooden boxes that have a drawer in the

1046
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,440
bottom that slides out with a plexiglas

1047
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,280
sheet and then i have a plexiglas lid

1048
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,079
for it and you know we have

1049
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,599
30 of and i upgraded when i went from 50

1050
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,159
to 75 males

1051
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:50,159
got by good then from 75 to over 150 we

1052
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,200
we got more bot we got another dozen

1053
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,398
boxes made

1054
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:58,559
and and that really helped and then

1055
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:59,838
what made with the resources i had and

1056
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,960
the space

1057
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,838
collecting over 150 males this year was

1058
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,519
that

1059
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:10,719
um about

1060
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:13,440
70 to 80 of those were

1061
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:15,279
f1 autoflower hybrids with photoperiods

1062
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,000
so they were technically photosensitive

1063
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,920
but they came

1064
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
in that was the first round and they

1065
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,760
came in almost all of those went through

1066
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
my pollen collection system

1067
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,760
before right before the full terms did

1068
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and you know i was definitely

1069
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,359
looking at this massive in-ground mail

1070
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,639
garden i had and i was

1071
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,799
sweating and then the autoflower hybrids

1072
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:38,480
came in early i'm like hey i think this

1073
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,599
this is actually going to work yeah

1074
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,320
and it was an intense there was

1075
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,119
you know many nights i was up till two

1076
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,200
in the morning

1077
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,200
you know first start out clearing out

1078
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,039
the pollen boxes then harvesting the

1079
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,719
males that were ready and then spraying

1080
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,000
down everything else

1081
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:55,598
and you know because that's another

1082
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,679
thing you can do is you can keep

1083
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,320
spraying down your males if you're not

1084
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:02,000
you're like oh i can't harvest this yet

1085
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,800
you know spray them down however many

1086
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,800
times a day

1087
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,640
till you know you're ready to harvest

1088
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,720
them and that way you're not

1089
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,199
getting pollen spread where you want to

1090
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:12,879
do it and that's something that you know

1091
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,239
dragonfly earth medicine does you know

1092
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,880
like moon gazers out in red

1093
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:18,319
valley that's a technique that you can

1094
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,519
do and

1095
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:25,680
so yeah you know

1096
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:28,719
it's it you have to be if you want to

1097
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:31,519
keep mail safely outdoors

1098
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,519
you know you have to find a zone that's

1099
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,960
good for it or make a zone that's good

1100
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:36,639
for it and you have to be diligent you

1101
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,199
have to be on top of it and the same

1102
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,159
thing for

1103
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:40,799
hand pollinating your females you know

1104
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,239
you have

1105
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,519
its work and dedication and care

1106
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:49,199
um you know and there are hacks

1107
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,719
around that that you know you can do it

1108
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,679
safely um

1109
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:55,598
like a lot of people i know do the you

1110
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,440
know put the pollen in a turkey bag and

1111
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,519
and put it over the branch which

1112
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,039
i find you don't get as many seeds but

1113
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,239
you also don't get as many seeds

1114
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:05,519
elsewhere

1115
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:08,399
which you know people can like

1116
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:08,960
but yeah so you know backtracking a

1117
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,200
little bit

1118
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,079
you know to let's just talk about

1119
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,000
finding the right

1120
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,400
zone you know where we're at is pretty

1121
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,920
unique for ourselves

1122
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,920
you know because we're at the end of the

1123
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,599
road you know tucked into the

1124
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,039
the hillside there and there's you know

1125
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,119
huge cattle ranch

1126
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,039
upwind from us surrounding national

1127
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,200
forest

1128
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,880
so when we get those westerly winds that

1129
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:31,598
come from the coast which is 30 miles

1130
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,838
away

1131
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,599
you know and we but we still have

1132
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:41,039
windscreens up

1133
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:44,559
which uh the re the

1134
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,559
frost protection fabric the

1135
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,960
remake i always get confused with the

1136
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,240
remesh which is like this

1137
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,519
the steel uh but yeah you get the rim

1138
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,479
and then we get the thick there's two

1139
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:57,039
microns

1140
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,960
you get the thicker micron you can even

1141
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,199
double it up

1142
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,800
and yeah so we and this was our first

1143
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:04,799
year doing an in-ground male garden

1144
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,440
which was fun because we'd have

1145
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,920
had them in pots before and this is nice

1146
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,240
to

1147
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,320
get them trenched in and in the ground

1148
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,838
you know having having two different

1149
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,000
ways of

1150
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,239
seed creation sounds like it's really

1151
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,519
working as a win for you as well i mean

1152
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:25,199
uh i i know three three all right

1153
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:27,119
because like you you have the um you

1154
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,000
know you've got your autoflowers

1155
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,280
and a lot of people grow autos because

1156
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,119
they do their thing earlier in the

1157
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,519
season and that's very convenient

1158
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,960
so people will have depth autos and then

1159
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,000
their full terms

1160
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,760
but i would think that with your style

1161
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,519
how you're describing it it also helps

1162
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,400
with pollen collection

1163
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:48,079
because you can reuse those same boxes

1164
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,960
the ones that you're using earlier in

1165
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,400
the season

1166
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:55,599
for the autoflower collection you know

1167
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,480
once you've removed those from the

1168
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,160
male autoflowers you can wash those down

1169
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,358
and then take them on over to your full

1170
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:03,358
terms and then that way

1171
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:06,319
you can make half as many of those nice

1172
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,078
boxes that you described

1173
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,000
yeah and with the autos in like the

1174
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,680
springtime since you know we have 40

1175
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,358
acres and our gardens are with

1176
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,039
you know are kind of spread out

1177
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:17,279
throughout those 40 acres too

1178
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:18,320
and a little bit so i had different

1179
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,359
zones for

1180
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,720
you know my autos i got because i had i

1181
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,480
had i think we did and then i made

1182
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,399
little pollination rooms in some

1183
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,679
greenhouses too

1184
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:36,639
with uh just plywood and

1185
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:38,960
you i use the um cross protection fabric

1186
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,838
and then i had like one auto on the back

1187
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,358
side of a shed

1188
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,039
and i put t posts around it and i put

1189
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,279
the frost that wind break with that

1190
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,400
frost rotation fabric so i would do us

1191
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,960
like you know selected open pollinations

1192
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,119
and

1193
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,960
with those that were kind of contained

1194
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,440
not field scale you know these were

1195
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,880
you know 10 by 20 or were the biggest

1196
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,599
ones some of them were just four by

1197
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,720
fours

1198
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,480
you know depending on

1199
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:04,719
which auto i was making and how many

1200
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,199
seeds i wanted to make of it

1201
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:07,838
you know i'm starting to get this idea

1202
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,078
that there

1203
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,838
there's enough variety in how you're

1204
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,599
doing this

1205
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:16,000
and you know that's probably actually

1206
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,318
pretty accurate for most farms that that

1207
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,239
they

1208
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:19,920
they don't have enough of any particu

1209
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,559
one particular resource

1210
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,159
and so the more they do the more variety

1211
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:25,920
there is and how they do it

1212
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:27,598
and it sounds like so long as you have

1213
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,760
the basics down

1214
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,318
of knowing when the pound's going to

1215
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,480
drop so it doesn't drop

1216
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:36,480
unexpectedly and that you exclude

1217
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,880
the male plant one way or another

1218
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,000
whether or not it's with a

1219
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,559
cardboard box or your upgraded uh wooden

1220
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,199
box

1221
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:45,838
or you make something you know something

1222
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,480
with uh

1223
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:50,559
you know a micron mesh around it you

1224
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,719
know so long as it's excluded so that

1225
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:55,279
pollen stays inside

1226
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:56,559
and then you decide how much pollen you

1227
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,160
want and then when you when you've

1228
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:00,960
collected enough

1229
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:01,519
you you know you stop the process with

1230
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,280
water

1231
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,440
and then you can remove the box it

1232
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,000
sounds like really you can do that same

1233
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,358
process with a whole bunch of different

1234
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,719
um techniques and ways to do it

1235
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:17,039
but really it's it's those uh

1236
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:18,959
main activities that have got to be done

1237
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:22,318
and once you find

1238
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,760
you know the resources that you have as

1239
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:27,039
a cultivator

1240
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,200
that can do those jobs you're you then

1241
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:32,318
have your special sauce

1242
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:34,239
yeah yeah and you know it's

1243
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:35,599
and then you're always learning and oh

1244
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:36,959
wow you know

1245
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,200
you know someone over here is doing

1246
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,240
something cool i'm gonna try that out

1247
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:43,439
too and

1248
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,199
you know and you know one thing that

1249
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,400
we're gonna start moving to which we

1250
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,480
haven't really

1251
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,480
done too much of besides in our

1252
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,079
greenhouses is build actually like

1253
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,838
pollination chambers and we're going to

1254
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,400
try this next spring because

1255
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:57,039
you know we're going to be attempting to

1256
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,519
uh

1257
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,199
breed out 200 varieties of autoflowers

1258
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:04,960
that we have working on

1259
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:07,679
um at once in our fields

1260
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,880
with um you know i think maybe we're

1261
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:10,960
gonna make some

1262
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,519
pollination teepees you know so we have

1263
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,440
a we have a

1264
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:18,000
fur forest that needs to get thinned and

1265
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,559
gonna use that

1266
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,079
uh frost protection fabric that and

1267
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,119
double layer it around there

1268
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,280
so that the the wind can't hit them and

1269
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,559
then

1270
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:35,440
let them pollinate and then i will

1271
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:38,880
mist down the inside of the pollination

1272
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,639
chamber to make the pollen

1273
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,559
unviable so i can get in there and cut

1274
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:45,519
the males out and

1275
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,599
then i can take the the fabric off and

1276
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:50,239
let them finish off in the full sun

1277
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,079
so when you say pollination chamber um

1278
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,479
you know what i picture in my head

1279
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,160
is the the last time we talked about

1280
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,199
pollination chambers on the show it's

1281
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,799
the ones that uh

1282
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,118
caleb csi humboldt has got and and his

1283
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,079
are

1284
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,838
indoor and they are um they're

1285
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,960
negatively pressured because

1286
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:10,000
of his his hvac pulls so much air out of

1287
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,400
the room

1288
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,719
that um you know when he's when he's

1289
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,160
done it just pulls the pollen out

1290
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:18,318
now i'm imagining you're making a

1291
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:18,639
pollination chamber that's outdoors and

1292
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:21,599
so

1293
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,078
probably is not going to have hvac so

1294
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,200
are you

1295
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,318
more talking about um you know like in

1296
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:30,078
an inert um air environment

1297
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:31,519
like where it's not being pulled in or

1298
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,880
sucked out it's just a

1299
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:37,519
it's just a larger exclusion area the

1300
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,640
it's i'm just trying to stop the wind

1301
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:41,599
from hitting

1302
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:43,118
the males in for this for the auto

1303
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,838
flowers you know for

1304
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,280
if i was going to do larger ones you

1305
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:50,318
know i would do hoops

1306
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,400
and you know and people have done this

1307
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:54,079
successfully with

1308
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,920
just frost protection fabric double

1309
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,359
layered up over their

1310
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,240
uh breeding hoops uh and we're gonna

1311
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:03,759
attempt to

1312
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:06,399
to do that with the autos and

1313
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,920
in the springtime but yeah so they'll be

1314
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,358
the walls we pretty much closed off

1315
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,800
there will be a little airflow

1316
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:16,400
on top and you know just to eye

1317
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,599
so that these 200 varieties won't cross

1318
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,440
pollinate with each other

1319
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,440
and then we'll be growing some autos

1320
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,639
outside in the rows just to

1321
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,318
just to see how it works so i know that

1322
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:28,480
where you are in the valley

1323
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:30,000
you're lucky because there's there's not

1324
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,559
a lot of folks around but we should

1325
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,639
probably

1326
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:38,159
talk to uh the idea of using

1327
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,118
um you know uh pollinating just out into

1328
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,000
the air

1329
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,960
so uh yeah yeah you've run into this

1330
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,559
many times

1331
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,159
so i'm gonna i'll let you go ahead and

1332
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,480
lead and i'll follow up with you

1333
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:50,399
why should we be careful about how we're

1334
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,880
spreading our pollen around

1335
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,160
oh yeah i mean is you don't want to seed

1336
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,079
stuff that you don't want to see it in

1337
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:58,799
your own garden let alone your neighbors

1338
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,280
and

1339
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,000
you know like i said we're in a unique

1340
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,079
location

1341
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,559
where we have done successful field

1342
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,839
scale you know what i call selected open

1343
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,279
population because i

1344
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:14,318
reduce the amount of males by

1345
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,760
structure and you know whatever that you

1346
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:18,079
you want to say like that still you know

1347
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,319
a decent amount of pollen up there and

1348
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,200
and only in the with the autos in the

1349
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,679
spring

1350
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:24,559
in the spring and early summer and you

1351
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,480
know

1352
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,799
we don't have neighbors close to us that

1353
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,079
we're doing depths at that time

1354
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:35,200
uh we do now so you know

1355
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:38,160
i haven't done open pollination

1356
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,358
since then and i've definitely you know

1357
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:41,118
checked in with them to see where

1358
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:43,358
they're at in their cycles when i

1359
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,240
you know which gave me some relief that

1360
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,199
they were in

1361
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:47,838
veg when i was pulling in a lot of males

1362
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:50,960
you know

1363
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:50,960
so i didn't you know

1364
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,839
it's um it's important though to be

1365
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:57,279
aware you know i like that you have such

1366
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:59,119
good connection with your neighbors that

1367
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,440
you know who is depping this year and

1368
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,519
who

1369
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,119
is not and you know it's always good to

1370
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:04,559
for us to be talking with our neighbors

1371
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,318
just as being a you know healthy

1372
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,078
cannabis community anyway but

1373
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:09,519
you know like where i live on vachon

1374
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,039
island um

1375
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:16,000
no one should be pollinating freely

1376
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:18,480
unexcluded outdoors because you know my

1377
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,838
whole island's only 14 miles by six

1378
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,760
miles which means that

1379
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:23,599
any pollen that's produced anywhere on

1380
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,720
the island could get anywhere on the

1381
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,880
island it's just

1382
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:28,239
because pollen can travel 15 miles right

1383
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,838
so so

1384
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:32,078
anywhere on the island that that

1385
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:34,639
somebody is just letting pollen go

1386
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,599
is a danger to other people who are

1387
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:37,118
growing

1388
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,039
and you know especially on an island

1389
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:42,240
like ours where there are so many

1390
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,759
uh growers who are patients um you know

1391
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:44,879
you really don't want to pollinate a

1392
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,240
patient's

1393
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,599
you know uh garden you know a few

1394
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,399
parcels down from you

1395
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,359
and and kind of ruin their medicine and

1396
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,400
also you know

1397
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:59,039
we've talked about before um the the

1398
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,119
valley where oregon cbd seeds

1399
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:02,318
is in oregon you know there's a there's

1400
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,680
a lot of both

1401
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:07,519
uh thc and hemp farmers there and they

1402
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:08,318
have had problems before with you know

1403
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,559
rookies

1404
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:11,679
new to the scene and they're like oh

1405
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,679
we're gonna we're gonna

1406
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,598
you know pollinate this whole field and

1407
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:16,799
then and then their whole valley got

1408
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,480
pollinated

1409
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,760
and so um so you know uh seth crawford

1410
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,880
from oregon cbd

1411
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,400
seeds you know is trying to put together

1412
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,720
what i've been calling a pollen

1413
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,200
exclusion zone but but he's trying to

1414
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:33,439
organize the farmers there to say hey

1415
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:35,199
let's you know let's all agree to this

1416
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,920
compact that we won't

1417
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:39,279
open pollinate on our properties for

1418
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,200
everybody's benefit you know

1419
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,519
not try not not telling them they must

1420
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:44,318
not but like having people voluntarily

1421
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:46,559
get involved

1422
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:48,159
because really it's not really the best

1423
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,880
way to go about it

1424
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:52,000
at scale anyway but it's really

1425
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,680
important to be aware

1426
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,440
of your neighbors and while while we're

1427
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:58,078
while we're at it i also

1428
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,838
i also want to shy people away you know

1429
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,880
it's it's cool and it feels

1430
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:04,799
you know radical to make these uh feral

1431
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,960
hemp bombs you know you like take some

1432
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,839
mud and you take some nutrients and you

1433
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,400
take some

1434
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:11,920
you take some seeds uh cannabis seeds

1435
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,760
and and people go around and kind of

1436
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,880
like just chuck them right to try to

1437
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,280
restart

1438
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,119
feral cannabis in the eos and and while

1439
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,400
the idea of weed being everywhere sounds

1440
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,200
pretty cool

1441
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,079
the idea of having these sneaker males

1442
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:27,838
just like pop

1443
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:30,079
up in nature unexpectedly

1444
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,599
it's not really a great way to go

1445
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,440
because you know it

1446
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,599
you're you're pollinating your neighbor

1447
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,318
your could be pollinating yourself

1448
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,519
and it's really uncontrolled so you know

1449
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:41,920
i'm all for

1450
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:43,039
more and more cannabis for everybody but

1451
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,838
perhaps let's not

1452
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:47,279
throw genetics just you know willy-nilly

1453
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,279
in nature

1454
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,640
so that we have unexpected males

1455
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,599
everywhere

1456
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:54,879
and i would say that uh open pollination

1457
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,440
you know not

1458
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,800
like in in the field is probably

1459
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,280
extremely rare if

1460
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,160
like maybe even like not you should just

1461
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,359
never do it

1462
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:07,118
yeah and you know okay also we're upwind

1463
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:09,199
from us is one of the widest stretches

1464
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,680
of national forest in mendocino county

1465
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:11,439
to

1466
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,199
you know not saying that we're not

1467
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,358
pollinating any gardens there but they

1468
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:17,118
shouldn't be growing there if they are

1469
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:18,639
well you know i i can't say that i've

1470
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,838
never opened pollinated

1471
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:23,118
uh just out naked uh you know in the air

1472
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:26,480
as well i mean i

1473
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:28,240
i did that once in 2013 when you know i

1474
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,159
i didn't i didn't know i didn't hadn't

1475
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:31,199
thought it through right honestly yeah

1476
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:32,719
and then i thought it through and i'm

1477
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:33,598
like oh yeah i don't i don't want to do

1478
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,719
this again

1479
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,119
and um uh so you know for those of us

1480
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,598
who

1481
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,200
who have done it it's like yeah you know

1482
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,960
doing it out of inexperience is one

1483
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,159
thing but but how about let's not do it

1484
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,199
on purpose

1485
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:46,960
while we're talking about open

1486
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:47,439
pollination though regardless of whether

1487
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,358
or not

1488
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,358
it's um it's outside um

1489
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:56,078
you know in the air or whether or not

1490
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:59,358
you're open air quotes open pollinating

1491
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:01,519
in a in a warehouse facility uh so that

1492
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:04,400
you are extremely or a greenhouse or

1493
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,679
or a really closed-up hoop house um why

1494
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,318
don't you talk a little bit

1495
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:09,358
to the advantages of of what open

1496
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,079
pollination is

1497
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,519
and and and why it's good because so far

1498
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,720
we've only talked about

1499
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:17,679
you know mostly taking one specific

1500
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:20,159
plant

1501
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,279
and breeding and mating it to a very

1502
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,159
another specific

1503
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,440
female but you know open pollination

1504
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,440
captures

1505
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,880
attributes in a different way and so why

1506
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,599
don't you kind of explain what that is

1507
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,640
so that people

1508
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,440
got a frame of reference for it so yeah

1509
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:36,960
we did a

1510
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,960
open pollination project

1511
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:44,318
in 2016

1512
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:47,680
with our lion claw autoflower uh regular

1513
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:50,079
seeds um we did two rounds we did a

1514
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,960
uh early spring in a late spring early

1515
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,760
summer and

1516
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,039
it was magical and the honeybees were

1517
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,880
harvesting

1518
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:58,800
you know pollen from the males and they

1519
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,838
were just not even paying attention to

1520
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,839
the females and

1521
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:03,519
which is cool because later that year i

1522
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:06,558
read an article how

1523
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:08,800
you know industrial hemp can

1524
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,920
that they're growing with males and

1525
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,240
females can

1526
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,960
provide summer food for bees when it's

1527
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,358
scarce and

1528
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,119
and that was really beautiful to see and

1529
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:20,639
and you're just gonna

1530
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:23,760
there's you make a ton more seeds in

1531
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:26,480
open pollination you know whether it's

1532
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,800
open field or in a hoop house than you

1533
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,880
do

1534
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:32,000
with with painting you know more than

1535
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,000
you ever probably gonna need

1536
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:37,838
uh and yeah and so but we did like a

1537
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:39,358
selected open pollination so we were we

1538
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:40,639
were looking for specific meal but

1539
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:42,719
you're going to get more diversity

1540
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,318
in open pollination even a selected open

1541
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,838
pollination unless you're doing i've

1542
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:46,318
done open pollinations with just one

1543
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:48,719
male

1544
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:49,519
in a greenhouse you know with autos and

1545
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:52,239
stuff our fee

1546
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:54,079
our other ones so you can increase the

1547
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:55,679
diversity or in the smaller hoop house

1548
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:56,000
like you know you got your stud in there

1549
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,679
with

1550
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,039
whatever females you want to pollinate

1551
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,799
and you're still going to get a lot more

1552
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:02,960
seeds that way than

1553
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,000
you know but there are ways to get a lot

1554
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,000
of seeds like

1555
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,159
i'll double paint a female if i really

1556
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,599
want to make a lot of seeds on it

1557
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:13,279
uh you paint it once and then a couple

1558
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,720
days later paint it again maybe you know

1559
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,160
within

1560
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,759
and then you can keep painting it for

1561
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,679
like you know depending on how much time

1562
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,720
you have left in the season

1563
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,639
you know you want to give yourself a

1564
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:24,959
good four weeks to finish out where

1565
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:28,239
you're not painting it again you can

1566
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,199
you know on a little two three foot tall

1567
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:32,239
plant you can get

1568
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:34,239
a couple thousand seeds by double triple

1569
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:36,639
painting and

1570
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:38,479
i'll be doing an open pollination uh

1571
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:40,400
summer 2021

1572
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,679
uh over at a friend's house who's got

1573
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,480
some extra space

1574
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:46,399
and who doesn't cultivate otherwise

1575
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,039
we've got a uh we're gonna use their

1576
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,599
uh greenhouse because there is uh

1577
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:53,440
there's a

1578
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:55,760
uh an old uh heritage um

1579
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,599
cultivar here on vashon called ovp

1580
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:02,319
original vashon purple

1581
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:04,960
and uh and the the the fella who used to

1582
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:06,558
um you know provide the seeds on the

1583
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,920
island for the like the last whatever

1584
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,240
20 years or something um he uh moved up

1585
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,400
to

1586
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:14,159
canada for the last of the last stage of

1587
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,280
his life and and so um

1588
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:18,318
i was given his last 50 seeds and he's

1589
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,119
all like you know this

1590
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:21,519
every summer he would take his his best

1591
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,599
uh

1592
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:25,440
producing plants and and he would make

1593
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,440
next year's seed out of it

1594
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,720
and so you know while it's certainly not

1595
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,200
a land race

1596
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:33,679
we kind of think of it as an um you know

1597
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:36,719
acclimatized land race if you will

1598
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:38,960
because it's become uh so great for our

1599
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:40,078
particular area our short summers and so

1600
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,760
these plants are

1601
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,280
they're early to start they're early to

1602
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,400
finish they don't grow too

1603
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,040
big and um they are you know they tend

1604
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,920
to be

1605
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:50,719
uh mold and and pest resistant and so

1606
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,838
you know wow

1607
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:55,919
20 years of selective breeding and just

1608
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:57,119
opened you know open pollinated every

1609
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,358
year that's that's

1610
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,760
that's pretty cool and and i grew these

1611
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,759
seeds uh once four years ago

1612
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,040
and the plants were just fantastic and

1613
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,559
they they had

1614
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:08,318
some good chirping profiles and

1615
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,200
everything but but then i didn't pop any

1616
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:12,318
more of the seeds because i'm

1617
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:15,358
like i don't have the skill set yet to

1618
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:16,558
properly preserve these and so but now i

1619
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:18,880
do and so we're gonna

1620
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,480
we're gonna pop a bunch of those and

1621
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,119
just let all the males and the females

1622
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,760
hang out

1623
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,680
in one closed environment and just let

1624
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,400
nature take its course but

1625
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:30,078
you know excluded and closed in and so

1626
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,079
the reason we're doing this and why

1627
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,920
people open pollinate is so that you can

1628
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:35,599
get all you can get a nice snapshot of

1629
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,318
all those genetics you're gonna get

1630
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,960
you know ver various different males all

1631
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:40,639
putting

1632
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,639
you know their different genetic

1633
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,838
expressions out and all these different

1634
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:45,679
females and so

1635
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:47,358
you know it's it's the opposite of what

1636
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:49,679
most people are looking for

1637
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:51,519
when they get a pack you know i mean a

1638
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:54,000
lot of people yeah okay i bought a pack

1639
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:57,440
of 10 seeds i'm hoping for

1640
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,480
the plant that you know was described to

1641
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,880
me

1642
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,480
you know when i bought the seeds and and

1643
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,559
you know nowadays

1644
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,318
with everybody putting out f1s that that

1645
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,640
that plant the the

1646
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:10,798
the golden child plant if you will may

1647
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,440
or may not be in the pack

1648
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:15,440
and and while that's not you know many

1649
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,200
people want that when they buy seeds

1650
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,480
there's a lot of the rest of us who are

1651
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:20,399
just all like okay

1652
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,679
we want to know everything that's in

1653
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,240
this genome

1654
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:24,879
so let's make a wide variety of seeds

1655
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,279
and and then

1656
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,280
sift those right for what you're and

1657
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,119
then start breeding with it and i

1658
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,040
i believe it's called a preservation

1659
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,000
breed a preservation breed right on i

1660
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:35,519
haven't heard that that

1661
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,960
term and so that's what we're trying to

1662
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:37,440
do we're trying to take like i was

1663
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,559
gifted

1664
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,639
his last 50 seeds we probably popped

1665
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,200
10 of them so far so maybe i've got 40

1666
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,838
left and so we'll take some number of

1667
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:48,159
those

1668
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:50,000
and and just pop them and let them go

1669
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:52,399
through their thing and so

1670
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,239
what we should end up with is several

1671
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,480
thousand seeds

1672
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:57,919
that in that you know in that grouping

1673
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,079
will have

1674
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,119
everything this plant can possibly do

1675
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,640
shown in it

1676
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,160
and then and then we'll take those seeds

1677
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:06,400
and we'll we'll give them out to people

1678
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:09,039
you know on vashon and stuff and

1679
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,559
and and hope that the lineage can just

1680
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:12,880
carry on itself

1681
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,079
and um and you know i'm jealous of you

1682
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,720
because of course you've got

1683
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,280
you know these much larger hoop houses

1684
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:19,118
so

1685
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,319
you can do that in a much larger volume

1686
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,680
than we will do in a

1687
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:26,480
you know a 15 by 710 oh yeah and

1688
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:29,039
and we're breeding on five farms right

1689
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,039
now too

1690
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:33,279
at least we have you know in in farms

1691
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:36,719
genetics going on multiple

1692
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:40,880
farms you know so it's yeah it's

1693
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:43,598
you know and we took those 150

1694
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,920
males and made over 400 combinations of

1695
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,920
genetics this year

1696
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,519

1697
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,798

don't have the time to really dig into

1834
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,240
your marketing as deeply as you'd like

1835
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:15,838
you know there's more that you could do

1836
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:17,519
to reach out to new customers and

1837
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,239
encourage loyalty and the customers you

1838
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:19,759
already have

1839
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,199
but you certainly don't have the time

1840
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,520
for it and you're not ready to hire

1841
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:26,399

responsibility

and her team put together a whole brand

1874
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,359
package for them

1875
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,760
built their website and wrote their

1876
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:29,279
sales materials no doubt this is a paid

1877
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,640
commercial spot but that does not mean

1878
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,640
they bought my opinion

1879
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:34,159
i've worked with blunt branding on five

1880
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:34,879
projects now for various of their

1881
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:36,480
clients and

1882
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,838
every single time they have done more

1883
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,280
than they have promised and over

1884
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:41,358
delivered on results

1885
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,200
i love how they generate new revenue and

1886
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:45,358
focus on that as the goal instead of

1887
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:47,199
just making a pretty logo

1888
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:48,880
similarly every single friend i have

1889
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:50,639
referred them to has come back to thank

1890
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,358
me and that just does not happen every

1891
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:53,118
day

01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,480

shango los and our guest this week is

1912
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,639
daniel morford of

1913
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:32,399
hart rock mountain farm so uh daniel

1914
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:34,400
what i'd like to talk about in this

1915
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,519
third set is preserving the pollen

1916
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,599
because uh

1917
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,920
it is so sad when we go through all of

1918
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,200
this

1919
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:46,079
effort to exclude and collect and

1920
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:46,960
get it all together and then we screw up

1921
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:50,160
the pollen

1922
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:52,960
and i have done this many times um

1923
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:54,480
and the pollen ends up getting corrupted

1924
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,240
and and there's so many different ways

1925
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,798
you can get corrupted but the one that i

1926
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:59,759
tend to have had the harder time with is

1927
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:02,798
is keeping it

1928
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,359
properly uh you know dry and out of

1929
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:05,440
humid

1930
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:07,358
out of humidity and you see it and it

1931
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,119
looks all greased up and you're like ah

1932
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:10,558
yeah you know it's it's rotting right

1933
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:12,480
there so

1934
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:13,920
so why don't we start with that like

1935
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,480
talk to us a little bit about

1936
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,280
more about um how you keep your uh

1937
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,000
pollen

1938
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,039
safe and then a couple of the different

1939
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,920
techniques that

1940
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:26,400
that you have experimented with um to

1941
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,559
keep it over time

1942
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,838
well one pro tip that i learned this

1943
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,079
year is

1944
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:33,279
don't get the cheap moisture packets you

1945
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,240
know get the really good

1946
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,359
get the really good ones you know so uh

1947
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:40,479
and bigger than

1948
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:43,279
you would need for the actual size jar

1949
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,559
that you have so you know and so in

1950
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,200
these little

1951
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,599
you know i think they're one ounce you

1952
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:48,879
know

1953
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,798
like you can see they have like

1954
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,280
sometimes an eighth of cannabis in them

1955
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:53,679
they're like

1956
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,798
you know smaller jars at the pollen in

1957
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,358
there you know i'll put a

1958
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:57,920
one inch by two inch moisture packet in

1959
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:01,119
there

1960
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,599
and you know i had some smaller ones

1961
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:05,039
and i'm like oh and they were you know

1962
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,119
not as good and i used some and i

1963
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,200
definitely had a couple

1964
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:10,960
uh jars of pollen go off this year but

1965
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:12,399
luckily i used the majority of them with

1966
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,240
the bigger batches and

1967
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,000
and some of it was still but you can

1968
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,479
tell like when you open a jar

1969
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,318
and it smells sour it's probably not

1970
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,480
going to be viable

1971
01:05:20,318 --> 01:05:24,318
what kind of uh packets are you using

1972
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,358
are you using traditional desiccant or

1973
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:27,519
are you using

1974
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:28,480
one of the one of the fancy brands that

1975
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:31,679
they're using now

1976
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:34,159
like to to for preserving cannabis

1977
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:35,838
oh no not a fancy brand just your you

1978
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:37,838
know i like the silica ones with the

1979
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:40,159
little beads in there yeah

1980
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:40,960
and and those actually help when i go to

1981
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:45,440
preserve

1982
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:48,159
the pollen um because it's a lot of work

1983
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,559
uh harvesting so much pollen so you at

1984
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:50,639
the

1985
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,880
when you're done with it i put it into

1986
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:53,519
single use jars and i've even used just

1987
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,559
use

1988
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:59,440
you know dab jars besides you know small

1989
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:01,440
because once you um thaw the pollen it's

1990
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,960
only good for about 20 minutes

1991
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,639
and then it's no longer you can't freeze

1992
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,720
it again you know so

1993
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:08,318
i take it from the freezer to the ice

1994
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:11,358
chest to where i want to use it

1995
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:13,920
and then it's it's done so i definitely

1996
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:16,798
take a jar of pollen and empty it into

1997
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,240
several little jars and and also that's

1998
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:22,159
why some people use the

1999
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:25,279
um the flower cutting technique because

2000
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:26,639
you don't there's like millions of

2001
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,720
little grains of pollen

2002
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:30,960
in there and you don't need you can cut

2003
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:32,558
it if you if you need it to go further

2004
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,079
on your projects i've never done that

2005
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:36,319
but you can you know

2006
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,000
when you research that online you mean

2007
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:41,119
like cutting it with like flour

2008
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:44,880
like yeah f-f-l-o-u-r flour

2009
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:47,519
yes yeah right on so so um

2010
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,079
so do you know what the what the ratio

2011
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:51,199
is because i

2012
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:53,680
i've come across that myself and um

2013
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:54,639
it i think that people use it because it

2014
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:57,598
makes the

2015
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:58,159
pound a little easier to work with it

2016
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:01,519
goes

2017
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:02,639
further and yeah flower helps decrease

2018
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:06,000
the likelihood

2019
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:09,199
that any particular pollen

2020
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,838
uh piece

2021
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:12,639
will will get wet because the whole

2022
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:16,239
thing acts

2023
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:18,239
as a as a moisture scene right yeah

2024
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:20,078
yeah i've just never done it but you

2025
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:21,838
know maybe i will start to add in a

2026
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,559
little bit of rice flour in it just to

2027
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:24,880
help that

2028
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,599
initial curing process dry out a little

2029
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,838
bit but

2030
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:29,838
you know a proper moisture packet is is

2031
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:32,239
going to do the trick and

2032
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:34,880
and also in the pollen boxes they get a

2033
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:36,959
hang out there longer than

2034
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,119
than they did on the kitchen counter top

2035
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:42,400
or you know bathroom counter top so

2036
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,119
you know i it depends on this year it

2037
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,440
was

2038
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:47,280
such a fast pace moving so many i don't

2039
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:50,000
think i'll

2040
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:52,000
attempt what i did this year again at

2041
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,559
this scale i probably i won't need to

2042
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,119
because those autoflower hybrids i made

2043
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:57,760
that were

2044
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:59,440
full term because they're the f1 you

2045
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,039
know 25 percent of those are going to be

2046
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,280
auto flowering

2047
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,880
in the f2 so i don't i can spread it

2048
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,920
it'll spread out my pollen collection

2049
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,519
even further

2050
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,680
but when they get a sit in the box a

2051
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:10,480
little bit longer or your collection

2052
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:12,558
chamber and

2053
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,240
dry out more you know you want to let it

2054
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,400
dry before you close the lid on on the

2055
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:18,079
jar or mostly dry but a good moisture

2056
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:19,838
packet is is going to save you from

2057
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:22,798
spoiling your pollen

2058
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:24,158
but also sometimes it doesn't it's just

2059
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:26,000
from the very beginning it

2060
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:27,759
it just doesn't cake right it or it

2061
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,399
cakes up it's not like that nice powder

2062
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:32,079
and it

2063
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:34,158
so it's also you know if you have a

2064
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:35,759
particular cross you want to make you

2065
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:37,119
know and you have a couple nice males

2066
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,640
maybe you want to collect

2067
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:40,880
pollen from each of those males to make

2068
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,759
sure that you know one of your

2069
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:46,159
if one of your pollen goes bad you have

2070
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:48,158
you know some backup

2071
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:49,198
so when you so thinking about your

2072
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:52,559
process you know

2073
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:56,158
you in whichever collection method

2074
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:58,000
that you use you collect it and it's

2075
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:59,679
probably pretty dried out in the bottom

2076
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,600
of your pollen collecting chamber

2077
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,880
or if you're doing it smaller scale it's

2078
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,679
just fallen

2079
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,000
down next to the mason jar onto you know

2080
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:09,759
some

2081
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,399
paper or or glass or something and then

2082
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,798
you

2083
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:14,000
um you use a costco card i use a razor

2084
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:16,960
blade whatever we

2085
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,238
bring it we bring it together dry and i

2086
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,838
actually like your technique i'm going

2087
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,519
to start using where instead of putting

2088
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:24,079
it all in one container i'm going to put

2089
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,839
it into multiple smaller containers

2090
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:28,318
because you're right once once you bring

2091
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:29,519
it out of refrigeration you really can't

2092
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,679
put it back in

2093
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,560
because of the condensation so so you so

2094
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:36,880
um

2095
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,839
do you always put it right into the

2096
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,719
freezer or

2097
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:41,039
do you often just use the refrigerator

2098
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,920
so

2099
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:44,560
i never use the refrigerator i go

2100
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,759
because

2101
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:50,880
when i'm done making seeds for the

2102
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:52,000
for the season you know when i've

2103
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,279
pollinated everything i want to

2104
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,840
pollinate i'll put

2105
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:59,040
in them into the single-use jars and

2106
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,560
into the freezer for long-term storage

2107
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:02,158
and what's long-term how long do you

2108
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,600
think that stuff will stay

2109
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:07,359
you know unfortunately with the uh

2110
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,679
you know we've had some of those you

2111
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:12,479
know power shutoffs with the

2112
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:13,039
whole wildfires in california that you

2113
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,559
know

2114
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:19,760
um i haven't

2115
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,760
been able to keep it for longer than a

2116
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:25,280
year but i did get to use it the next

2117
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,840
you know so my ideal breeding program

2118
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:29,439
for me

2119
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,960
is you know um like last year i used

2120
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:32,799
frozen and fresh pollen

2121
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,399
this year i just use fresh pollen next

2122
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,600
year i'll use frozen and fresh

2123
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:39,920
you know just just uh um

2124
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,960
it's just kind of just the system i've

2125
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,440
developed

2126
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,960
and then i like to take the frozen pot

2127
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:46,799
pollen in the

2128
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,760
spring or summer and put it on the auto

2129
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,760
and see if it's viable

2130
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:53,759
so you uh give it a give it a trial

2131
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:55,759
first before you

2132
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,039
uh commit yeah and and i like crossing

2133
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,039
things into the auto so

2134
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:00,719
right yeah because you just was for fun

2135
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:02,800
yeah um

2136
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,239
so you know one of the things that we

2137
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:08,640
run into a lot is

2138
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:11,759
um you have one set of tools

2139
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,000
but you're going to be making all of

2140
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,560
these

2141
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,158
crosses and you know whether whether

2142
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:20,000
it's your costco card

2143
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:23,119
or uh brushes or the pyrex

2144
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,840
um you're you're very likely going to be

2145
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:26,559
using

2146
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,239
some of these tools time and time again

2147
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,199
and if you've got a serious breeding

2148
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:32,000
program

2149
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:33,359
you can't be cross-pollinating very

2150
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,079
literally

2151
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:37,439
what do you do to you know clean your

2152
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:38,238
materials or do you have any best

2153
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:39,919
practices

2154
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:41,519
so that you don't accidentally cross

2155
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,640
pollinate

2156
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,239
yeah so i have a bunch of those

2157
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,079
you know just those cheap little paint

2158
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:49,198
brushes that you get in a huge pack with

2159
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:50,800
the multiple colors

2160
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:53,678
and i ordered more this year because i

2161
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,400
needed more and then i have a

2162
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:58,560
i use them once per variety of pollen

2163
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:00,079
and then i'll put them in my mouth

2164
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,600
and then put them into the dirty

2165
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:03,279
paintbrush container and then

2166
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,280
you know i'll hand wash those in the

2167
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:07,599
soap in the in the kitchen sink with

2168

soap and water and use those

2169
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,360
use them again and then yeah when when

2170
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:13,519
i'm harvesting

2171
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:14,799
pollen i clean off my tools in between

2172
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,800
varieties of pollen

2173
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,840
that i'm scraping up i you know

2174
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,320
sometimes will clean off

2175
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,199
you know when i'm harvesting males i'll

2176
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:24,000
i'll

2177
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:26,000
you know clean off my hands spray mist

2178
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,640
myself down in between

2179
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,840
collection yeah you know a spray bottle

2180
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,960
you know if you have your males in a

2181
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,440
greenhouse you know

2182
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,198
like have a spray bottle is going to be

2183
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:36,639
a good miss yourself off before when

2184
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:38,399
you're when you're done with your mails

2185
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,440
or change your clothes and mr miss

2186
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:40,559
yourself off and then change your

2187
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:41,839
clothes depending on where you got to

2188
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:45,199
walk from your mail garden

2189
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:47,199
you know so yeah water is a really good

2190
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:48,799
sterilization technique or water and a

2191
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:50,799
little soap depending on

2192
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,800
what you want to do i think that a lot

2193
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:56,079
of people um

2194
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,800
under prioritize the misting themselves

2195
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:59,519
down

2196
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,480
um and and i think that so often people

2197
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,800
will go from

2198
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:05,039
where their males may be on the property

2199
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:07,279
over to where the females are

2200
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:08,479
and people don't realize how easy it is

2201
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:11,920
to um

2202
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:15,279
rub up against a plant just passing it

2203
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:17,520
when she's in bloom and you know

2204
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:18,559
brush two or three or eight pieces of

2205
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,679
pollen off

2206
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,239
and then you know we all know that even

2207
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:24,079
if

2208
01:13:22,238 --> 01:13:25,759
i mean there's certainly sometimes we'll

2209
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:27,439
get a flower and we're excited because

2210
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,440
there's bag seed right we're like oh

2211
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:30,879
this is great let's let's grow this

2212
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:33,198
and so it's like you know that that can

2213
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:36,239
be cool but generally speaking

2214
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:38,639
we don't want seeds in our flowers

2215
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:39,279
because uh especially at the commercial

2216
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,600
level

2217
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:42,880
because people know that this flower is

2218
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,920
not as potent as it

2219
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,359
as it could have been and and it's it's

2220
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,800
fine details like

2221
01:13:47,359 --> 01:13:52,719
misting yourself that can stop uh

2222
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,800
accidental seeds in your product and and

2223
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:56,560
you know that like the the product that

2224
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,199
you put out with seeds in it is going to

2225
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,719
be

2226
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:00,238
the person who gets it it's going to be

2227
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:02,800
the one that's got the huge instagram

2228
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:04,718
following you know

2229
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,400
yeah and you know that's why you you've

2230
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:09,840
really gotta be on top of

2231
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:11,439
your game if you if you wanna uh collect

2232
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,600
and make seeds

2233
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:15,439
click pollen makes eats outdoor and i

2234
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:17,920
tell you what you know

2235
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:20,079
at the scale that we did we definitely

2236
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,560
have a stray seed here or two but we

2237
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:22,559
didn't

2238
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,840
nothing peppered but like in our garden

2239
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,159
one of our gardens that's

2240
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,600
closest to the male garden yeah there

2241
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:29,759
was a seed or two which is

2242
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,920
i mean a success considering what we did

2243
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,920
and and oftentimes we get a message

2244
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,679
you know oh i found an a seed and you

2245
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,079
know if you find a seed in the eighth or

2246
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:38,399
like

2247
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:40,079
you know a couple seeds in eight

2248
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:43,039
occasionally

2249
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:44,800
most customers are to be stoked but some

2250
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:46,960
are not going to be happy

2251
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,079
you know and and it's it's interesting

2252
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,239
to the different

2253
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:51,279
responses that people will have to that

2254
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:53,119
accidental seed

2255
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:55,599
and even you know even i judge it

2256
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:59,198
differently if if i get it in

2257
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:02,320
you know an expensive indoor

2258
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:05,599
brand that i have paid money for

2259
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:06,319
um and and they hold themselves up as

2260
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,560
being like

2261
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:10,559
ultra premium ultra elite and they're

2262
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,480
charging an elite price

2263
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,920
i expect there to not be any damn seeds

2264
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:15,759
in my flower ice

2265
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,760
but but you know most of the farms that

2266
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:20,119
that i get flower from are

2267
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:23,119
you know regeneratively minded folks

2268
01:15:20,119 --> 01:15:24,880
outdoors you know dempsure certified you

2269
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:28,399
know more like you know

2270
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:30,319
very organic minded down-home stuff

2271
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:32,158
well if if there's a if there's a seed

2272
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:33,920
in my pinkleberry well i'm actually

2273
01:15:32,158 --> 01:15:36,000
gonna be excited

2274
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,119
and and you know i'm like oh this is

2275
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,600
this is cool and

2276
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:40,640
and i'll be i'll be happy about that and

2277
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:44,000
you know

2278
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:45,199
so it my reaction to the seed often has

2279
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,319
a lot to do

2280
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:51,119
with um how how

2281
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:52,960
premium the brand discusses themselves

2282
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:55,359
about how flawless they are right

2283
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,800
because you know a seat or two like like

2284
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:57,439
i'm perfectly cool with that but if you

2285
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,039
say that you're

2286
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:00,559
flawless and then there's a seed well

2287
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:02,560
then i'm all like oh i guess you're not

2288
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,719
you know

2289
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,239
yeah and in your if it's indoors

2290
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:09,279
probably from a herm

2291
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:12,639
yeah you know so that's not as

2292
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:14,238
not good so so so we've talked so we've

2293
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,840
talked about you know taking

2294
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:18,079
the pollen splitting out up into

2295
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,920
multiple jars putting in the freezer and

2296
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:21,359
if you take it out it's out you can't

2297
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,560
really put it back in because

2298
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:26,559
of the condensation that takes place

2299
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,000
and from the freezer you want to go

2300
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,800
freezer to

2301
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,679
you know to ice chests because you got

2302
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:36,159
20 minutes

2303
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:40,640
after that thaws a viability

2304
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:40,639
and then you can't refreeze pollen um

2305
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,679
in and then yeah

2306
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,119
so you could take if you let's say you

2307
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:48,079
got a bunch of pollen and you want to

2308
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:49,760
you know but when you

2309
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:52,319
initially harvest your pollen just keep

2310
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:55,679
it constant temperature

2311
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:56,880
you know dry you know not even in and

2312
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,719
out of the fridge a lot unless you're

2313
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,880
not going to use it for

2314
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:02,319
a couple months in the same season like

2315
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:03,520
let's say it was like wow this is super

2316
01:17:02,319 --> 01:17:05,759
early mail i'm not going to have

2317
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:09,199
anything for like a month or two

2318
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:12,239
or but mainly you just want to keep it

2319
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:14,559
uh constant temperature so when you take

2320
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:15,279
it out of the freezer right before you

2321
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:18,640
use it

2322
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:20,319
you then put it into a an ice cooler

2323
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,840
and and the i and the reason of that is

2324
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:24,238
so that you can then take

2325
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,600
that out to wherever you are on the farm

2326
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:27,198
that you're going to use it right

2327
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,800
like if you're not if you're if you're

2328
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:29,599
if your fridge is where you're going to

2329
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,760
pollinate

2330
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,760
or or like in your home you can just

2331
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:36,800
take it out but you're talking about

2332
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:38,000
preserving slowing down that window that

2333
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,600
you have to use it

2334
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,359
and and i've done it before where i've

2335
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,239
taken out you know

2336
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:46,559
i don't know like 20 30 jars of frozen

2337
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:50,238
pollen put an ice chest gone out to my

2338
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:54,000
my field and put those 20-40 jars

2339
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:57,759
on 40 different females yeah

2340
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,359
um with with really good success

2341
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,760
uh i don't know i've never heard this

2342
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:04,799
anywhere but it's just how i do it

2343
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:08,159
um once i take it out of the freezer

2344
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:10,960
um and and you know if i had 40 acres

2345
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:12,479
i would take it out to my plants in uh

2346
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,158
you know in an ice chest but like once

2347
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:17,039
i'm ready to use it

2348
01:18:14,158 --> 01:18:18,158
i i don't usually like to think that i

2349
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:21,519
want to have it come

2350
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:24,158
to room temperature with the lid on it

2351
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,040
i wanna i wanna i think that i wanna

2352
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:28,319
take the lid

2353
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:31,359
off so that any condensation that might

2354
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:33,279
form in the jar actually is immediately

2355
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:35,039
going out into the surrounding

2356
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:36,719
air does that sound like a good best

2357
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:39,920
practice to you or do you do something

2358
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:41,760
opposite well i i i do another thing

2359
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,719
let's just backtrack a little bit to

2360
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,400
when we

2361
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,158
put it into those single-use jars so

2362
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:48,799
another reason i like to use those

2363
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:50,399
um silica packets with the beads in them

2364
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:53,199
the moisture packets because

2365
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:54,719
i when i go to freeze my pollen i will

2366
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:55,839
cut those open and i'll put a little of

2367
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,880
those bbs

2368
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:01,600
in each jars and then i will use um

2369
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:03,920
whatever i would use a small actual

2370
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,320
moisture packet that'll fit inside that

2371
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,880
little

2372
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:08,559
you know dab size jar and then i'll

2373
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:11,840
close that up there too

2374
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:14,480
and i've i've just

2375
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,159
always just opened and used it from the

2376
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:18,319
ice chest i've never

2377
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:20,839
so you know once i open the jar i'm out

2378
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:22,000
in the environment so yeah i open the

2379
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:25,360
jar

2380
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,960
as it than thaws as i'm using it

2381
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:29,039
so yeah i would say yeah probably oh you

2382
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,198
want the jar to be open

2383
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:33,760
yeah right on and and and yeah using the

2384
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:35,439
desiccant pack that um

2385
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,039
in the small jars is not something that

2386
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:38,639
i was considering in my example so

2387
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:40,640
that's a good thing too

2388
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,920
yeah i mean i i just do it it's a lot

2389
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,640
it's a lot of work and i want to make

2390
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,719
sure that

2391
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,320
that hard work gets preserved by a cheap

2392
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:49,279
little moisture package yeah totally

2393
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:49,759
it's worth the nickel um so you know

2394
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:51,840
once

2395
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,760
once the word gets out that you are

2396
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,039
successful at collecting

2397
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,640
viable pollen uh invariably people ask

2398
01:19:57,039 --> 01:19:59,920
for that right and sometimes that's good

2399
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,800
because maybe you want to trade with

2400
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,000
somebody

2401
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:06,480
um but but trading pollen

2402
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,039
is challenging because mostly because of

2403
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:08,399
all the

2404
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:10,319
temperature issues that we've already

2405
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:12,319
talked about but you know i've heard of

2406
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:14,559
people mailing pollen have you ever done

2407
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:16,479
that and do you have a best practice

2408
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,400
um i have not mailed pollen but i know

2409
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:20,000
people do mail pollen and you know if

2410
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:23,439
it's dry

2411
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:27,039
and you know it's fresh you know

2412
01:20:23,439 --> 01:20:30,479
and it's packaged where it's gonna i'm

2413
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:31,600
it's i'm sure it would most likely

2414
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:34,238
you know make it to where it's going and

2415
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:37,120
be viable for use um

2416
01:20:34,238 --> 01:20:38,079
you know it's i have offered up pollen

2417
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:39,920
to

2418
01:20:38,079 --> 01:20:42,559
you know some of the the grower groups

2419
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,399
i'm a part of in mendocino county and i

2420
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,400
did that one year and it's a lot of work

2421
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:50,238
and it was fun and i got some you know

2422
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:51,920
but i i usually don't advertise

2423
01:20:50,238 --> 01:20:53,678
i said indicate you know i have a couple

2424
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,359
friends that i get falling to

2425
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:57,279
that you know make sure to hit me up and

2426
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:59,039
come by my house to get to get it

2427
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:00,719
you know yeah you know i think that's

2428
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:02,399
really the way to do it too right i mean

2429
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:05,279
i definitely do think that

2430
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:06,559
as uh as cannabis it is increasingly

2431
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:09,920
normalized

2432
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:12,320
that um that the sale

2433
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,279
of pollen is going to become more

2434
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:16,479
popular

2435
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:18,719
um just like the sale of clones

2436
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:19,599
it had has become more popular and

2437
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:22,319
therefore

2438
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,360
people are developing new best practices

2439
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:25,519
for sending

2440
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:27,198
uh clones i think the same thing's gonna

2441
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,440
be happening for pollen

2442
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:31,439
um and there are certainly you know some

2443
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:33,519
hardcore heads who are doing it

2444
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:34,879
but i i would not say that it's common

2445
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,760
yet

2446
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,679
yeah and you know i would say just like

2447
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,199
how you get those live predator bugs in

2448
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:42,800
the mail you know if

2449
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:44,638
you know someone was willing to pay for

2450
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,440
it you know that would probably be the

2451
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:47,119
best practice

2452
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:48,960
to make especially in these hot summers

2453
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:50,319
to make sure that it stayed at a cooler

2454
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,960
temperature and got to where it was

2455
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:52,399
going

2456
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,840
yeah that's actually a pretty good point

2457
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:55,439
the same the same things that i would

2458
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,440
think about for selling

2459
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:59,039
ascending insects anything living it's

2460
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:00,879
the same same kind of head space i would

2461
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:02,800
use about pollen yeah that's good

2462
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,960
and like i said earlier you know the

2463
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:08,320
when pollen's gone off it's it's

2464
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:10,399
it has a sour smell to it and taste and

2465
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:11,920
and taste too you know so that that's

2466
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:12,559
exactly where i was going to finish up

2467
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,719
which was

2468
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,480
you know when you're trading with pollen

2469
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:18,399
um mostly you just need to

2470
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:19,519
take the person's word for it and how it

2471
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:22,158
was handled and stuff

2472
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,440
what are there other things that you

2473
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:26,000
would be looking for

2474
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:27,359
in pollen i i've not run into the sour

2475
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,359
smell you described but

2476
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:31,599
i do i am familiar with like

2477
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:33,599
discoloration when it goes from

2478
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,800
you know whitish or yellow to beige you

2479
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,280
know

2480
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,079
and and the consistency of it you know

2481
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:41,759
like if

2482
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:43,439
it's like a you know a dry grainy powder

2483
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,039
that doesn't really stick and kind of

2484
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:48,000
doesn't it moves

2485
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:48,639
you know more like sand like very you

2486
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,479
know

2487
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:54,480
individualized there and um

2488
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:55,919
but you know i one thing does come to

2489
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:57,439
mind since we're talking about pollen

2490
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,639
and you know i did send

2491
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:02,399
uh some pollen off for research and

2492
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:04,239
development you know they were it's

2493
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:05,439
i think flora wellness that they make

2494
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:07,359
like the

2495
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:08,879
among other things like some you know

2496
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:11,679
cannabis oils for like

2497
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,960
sexy time and and he thought that

2498
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:15,520
cannabis could be like

2499
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,600
a male supplement like you know pine

2500
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,800
pollen's a natural testosterone booster

2501
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,719
oh right on

2502
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:23,600
so i was actually eating like fresh male

2503
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:26,319
flowers and you get energized actually

2504
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,600
