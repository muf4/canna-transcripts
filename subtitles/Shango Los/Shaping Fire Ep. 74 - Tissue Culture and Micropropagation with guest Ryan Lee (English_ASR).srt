2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,320
in the days of complete cannabis

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,919
prohibition

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,919
cannabis folks didn't have as much

5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,559
access to advanced science

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,079
to complex analytical technology or most

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,000
of the great scientists who are now

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,079
feeling more comfortable to sign on to

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,640
cannabis related research

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,479
because of this our entire scene

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,480
including heritage cultivators

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,560
newcomers to cannabis and big

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,399
agriculture are all rejiggering their

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,359
relationship to both cannabis

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,039
and technology some of the science like

16
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,200
terpene and potency tests

17
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,159
are clearly a win and few question their

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
usefulness

19
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,439
even though we are still questioning

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
their accuracy

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,558
the other end of the spectrum is full on

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,559
genetically modified cannabis dna

23
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,640
and while that is already happening in

24
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,359
labs the vast number of cannabis

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,198
consumers are not very supportive of it

26
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,280
each cannabis consumer needs to decide

27
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,839
for themselves how much science they

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,198
want in their cannabis

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,200
no part of today's discussion is gmo

30
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,280
no part of this discussion involves

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,400
genetic insertion into the cannabis

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,560
genome

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,080
today's discussion is heavy on science

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,920
technique though and much of it

35
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,560
describes lab techniques that are

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,400
new to cannabis so even though some of

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,840
the vocabulary may be new

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
and some of the techniques may sound

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,000
like science fiction they in no way

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,640
degrade the cannabis genome or the

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,319
pool of available genetics most of the

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,799
techniques actually preserve cannabis

43
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,559
genetics for the future

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,720
today's episode is all about tissue

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,560
culture i wanted to do this topic

46
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,118
because i have a poor understanding of

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,439
it

48
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,118
and i have a general adversion to

49
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,879
laboratories as well

50
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,719
and yet there's so much science in

51
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,798
cannabis discussions today

52
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,959
and from my early research into tissue

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,240
culture i realized that most cannabis

54
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,879
folks were using the term

55
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,560
tissue culture really loosely without a

56
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,599
firm understanding of the concepts we

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,399
were talking about

58
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,559
including myself the goal of today's

59
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,680
episode is to translate tissue culture

60
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,439
for the lay person

61
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,439
with nothing more than a high school

62
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,079
understanding of science

63
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,199
most of the episode will focus on

64
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,000
micropropagation since that is mostly

65
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,318
the sort of

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
tissue culture we use in cannabis but

67
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,839
we'll round out the show in the third

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,199
set by discussing all the tricks that

69
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,239
fall under the umbrella

70
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,919
of the general term tissue culture so

71
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,159
wash your hands and get ready for some

72
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,519
time in the lab

73
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,959
if you want to learn about cannabis

74
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,480
health business and technique

75
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,000

today we're going to talk about the

143
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,039
application of tissue culture techniques

144
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,800
in cannabis cultivation welcome to the

145
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,720
show ryan welcome back brother

146
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,639
thanks so much for having me again shane

147
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,880
so man let's let's start by clarifying

148
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,639
what tissue culture really is because

149
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,319
i think most folks throw around that

150
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,400
term pretty darn loosely

151
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,399
um would you give us a quick overview of

152
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,959
like the total breadth of the term but

153
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,038
then

154
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,879
hone in a bit more on what people in the

155
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,839
cannabis industry usually intend when

156
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,079
they use the term tissue culture

157
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,918
yeah absolutely um i think tissue

158
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,719
culture is really like an overarching

159
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,319
term

160
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,600
it's kind of like saying cultivation

161
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
there's so many different ways that you

162
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,479
can grow a plant

163
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,959
and and tissue culture is really the

164
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,240
same thing when we say tissue culture

165
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,959
really what we're doing is we're

166
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,918
culturing

167
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,120
plants or parts of plants in a glass

168
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,319
test tube or a

169
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,519
some type of plastic or glass sterilized

170
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,360
vessel

171
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,918
and we call those pieces of plants

172
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,919
explants

173
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,319
i guess a little bit of history might

174
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,719
help around the turn of the 20th century

175
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,319
like 1900s

176
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,080
scientists were starting to learn about

177
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,159
bacteria and fungus and how they could

178
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,959
grow these things on petri dish

179
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,320
petri dishes and i guess a german

180
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,560
biologist wondered if he could do the

181
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,879
same thing with plants or plant parts

182
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,038
and so he started harvesting leaves and

183
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,478
you know cross sections of stems and

184
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,560
little bits of cells and they would take

185
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,680
the cells and mash them all up

186
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,680
and and create something called a

187
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,360
suspension culture and they would see

188
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,120
you know like we can grow these very

189
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,759
small bacteria and fungi

190
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,560
fungi can we also do the same with plant

191
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,720
cells

192
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,000
and that it that brings up a term called

193
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,080
total potency

194
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,800
which really means the ability of any

195
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:21,519
cell to regenerate a whole plant

196
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,360
from that one cell is that like stem

197
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,599
cells

198
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,560
yeah we have it canon or not cannabis

199
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,720
all plants have

200
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,120
uh they're the equivalent of stem cells

201
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,240
we call them callus which is really

202
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,240
stem cells are what we call

203
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,199
undifferentiated tissue and usually when

204
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,918
we make callus

205
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,360
it's a d-differentiated tissue and so

206
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,639
that means you might have a cell type

207
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,639
that was like for example

208
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,240
here's a perfect example when you when

209
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,120
you make cuttings

210
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,560
the cells along the stem they're at that

211
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,439
point in time they're stem

212
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,160
cells i don't mean stem cells they're

213
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,560
cells of a

214
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,319
from the stem of a plant and when we cut

215
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,319
those little branches off and expose it

216
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,080
to a high oxygen high

217
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,080
moisture environment like you'd find in

218
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,959
a rooting

219
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,839
pack or a rockwool cube or something

220
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,879
that

221
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,198
um that encourages the cell

222
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,240
to change its cell type and become a

223
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,240
root cell

224
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,680
and so when we actually see roots

225
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,720
growing out of the side

226
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,360
of a cutting that's d differentiation

227
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,680
that cell has differentiated itself from

228
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,919
a stem

229
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,918
type cell to a root type cell

230
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,198
and so we can we can manipulate that

231
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,120
processor we've learned that we can

232
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,720
manipulate that process

233
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:40,000
and we can take very tiny pieces of

234
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,919
um of plants like we can section out

235
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,720
just the meristem which is a

236
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,000
a very small structure in the tip of a

237
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,560
plant chute

238
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,079
that produces the entire plant lit but

239
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,839
that's where all the cell division takes

240
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,279
place

241
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,399
and it's about the size of a pin and you

242
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,559
can cut those out and grow them on

243
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,439
these agar mediums like we're talking

244
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,680
about

245
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,839
and uh and eventually culture that

246
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,000
little piece into a full plant

247
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,198
is it is it the dna of the plant that's

248
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,038
driving all this because the

249
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,919
instructions are there in every single

250
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,000
cell

251
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,918
yeah i would consider the meristem

252
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,519
actually an organ so it's an it's not

253
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,038
just a dna it's a

254
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:23,120
an organized cell type that are dividing

255
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,120
uh in a specific genetic program

256
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,279
so it's it's probably a little more

257
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,799
advanced than just the dna

258
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,959
thinking of it as just the dna or a

259
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,399
couple of cells it's actually a an

260
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,718
actively dividing organ yeah

261
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,839
all right so so if we've got this big

262
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,640
umbrella

263
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,839
which is tissue culture and and you know

264
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,598
over the course of the show we're going

265
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,800
to talk about a bunch of things that are

266
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:50,560
under this umbrella of tissue culture

267
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,799
um my i guess my best understanding of

268
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,958
it

269
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:57,919
is that you know 80 or 90

270
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,759
of what we're doing in cannabis as far

271
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,039
as tissue culture goes

272
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,919
all falls into the subsection of

273
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,719
micro propagation and then the other 10

274
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,399
or 20

275
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,000
are like all this random things that

276
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,360
we're going to talk about mostly in the

277
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,120
third set but

278
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,879
but would you you know does am i getting

279
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,639
it right that micro propagation is

280
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,399
really what just about everybody

281
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,159
in cannabis is talking about when we

282
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,879
talk about tissue culture like off the

283
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,199
cuff

284
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,838
yeah that's really the focus right now i

285
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,600
think that serves an industry need

286
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:34,160
to be able to produce large amounts of

287
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,440
virus free mold free pest free plants

288
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,360
and and we can do that using

289
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,519
micropropagation but there's other

290
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,720
other types of things that we can do and

291
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,839
um there's something called a

292
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,320
metabolite reactor or a bioreactor and

293
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,240
uh

294
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,278
you know at one point in time scientists

295
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,839
were trying to figure out if we could

296
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,080
get cannabis cells to produce

297
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,320
cannabinoids

298
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,839
um you know without having to actually

299
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,760
grow the plant during this

300
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,600
crazy pro prohibition area that we've

301
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,039
kind of just graduated from

302
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,959
but you know you could do something like

303
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,919
you take some leaves off of a plant

304
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,719
and chop them up very very finely using

305
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,278
a

306
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,160
you know a delicate blender or a some

307
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,958
kind of

308
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,759
sectioning device and then you suspend

309
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,518
those cells

310
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,799
into a big um like a big erlenmeyer

311
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,440
flask one of those big

312
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,078
kind of triangle-shaped flasks that sits

313
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,120
on a

314
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:25,278
orbital shaker or a spinning shaker and

315
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,039
that just kind of shakes the

316
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,879
the the soup broth gently

317
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,719
and provides lots of oxygen and these

318
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,519
cells just float around

319
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,120
in the in the medium and the thought was

320
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,399
that you know perhaps we could get these

321
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,000
plants to produce

322
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,600
uh cannabinoids because that's actually

323
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,879
been you're able to do that with other

324
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,200
plant species

325
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,559
but it turned out that of course the

326
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,040
production of cannabinoids needs the

327
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,639
resin

328
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,240
the resin glands the trichomes so we

329
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,799
actually can't do that

330
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,680
um but you can you can use that same

331
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,559
technique

332
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,078
to grow embryos or produce something

333
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,559
called artificial seeds

334
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,399
which are essentially little shoot tips

335
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,639
encased in a

336
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,320
like an alginate or an agar jelly it

337
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:07,759
looks like a little jelly bean

338
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,320
and i'll try to put some of those up on

339
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,360
my instagram page so people can see

340
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,560
those while we're

341
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,639
we're talking about it yeah but they're

342
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,719
just essentially little ways that we can

343
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,480
produce different plant parts in in

344
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,360
these glass beakers

345
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,278
um but like you said the most common

346
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
thing in the cannabis industry is to use

347
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,879
those

348
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,879
to grow plantlets sterile plantlets

349
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,240
which we can either section by

350
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,919
subculturing and

351
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,519
multiply them into a whole army of

352
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,919
plants

353
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,200
army of plants i like that you know so

354
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,159
many of us we just want you know

355
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,399
overgrow right

356
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,679
army of plants bring it on yeah well i

357
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,440
mean the truth is

358
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,879
you know these large production systems

359
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,880
that we're seeing start to be grown all

360
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,639
over california washington

361
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,078
they require armies of plants i mean you

362
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,600
plant you know

363
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,278
the grape growers are pretty lucky they

364
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,040
or even hop growers are pretty lucky you

365
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,278
plant the crop once and then

366
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,799
it just keeps growing year after year

367
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:59,519
whereas cannabis i mean if you're if

368
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,519
you're planting

369
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,879
or if you're harvesting maybe two times

370
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,839
in a summer or three if you're really

371
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,679
organized

372
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,279
you know you need a full complement of

373
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,239
plants to be planted every year

374
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:12,720
or every planting so it really it the

375
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,919
production of armies of plants

376
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,240
will be um part of this industry

377
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,240
right all right so if we are talking

378
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,440
about creating armies of plants

379
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,120
as being like the primary usage

380
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,200
of titu culture in cannabis um

381
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,480
let's focus on this micro propagation

382
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,800
because it's it's you know it's what

383
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,879
most

384
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,399
everybody's talking about anyway so this

385
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,679
is a strategy to

386
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,159
multiply a plant very quickly under very

387
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,719
clean

388
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,159
controls in a lab and i mean my

389
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,959
understanding of it is essentially

390
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,919
cloning but with exceptionally immature

391
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,599
plant material like

392
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:53,039
at the cellular level um cellular level

393
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,278
would you walk us through what that

394
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,439
you know the science of that because the

395
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:01,200
the idea of even

396
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,320
handling and manipulating the cells

397
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,680
um is you know one step removed from my

398
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,560
understanding so walk us

399
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,958
walk us through that process yeah so

400
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,078
these

401
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:14,000
these agar containers we'll call them

402
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,599
are tissue culture vessels

403
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,360
um you you really have to think of it

404
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,278
like a plant in a pot so just like

405
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,879
you're making you're transplanting

406
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,879
any plant into a container

407
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,838
the the tissue culture vessel holds

408
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,679
it it does all the same thing it's got a

409
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,000
place for the plant to grow

410
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,679
it has the medium or the the sorry the

411
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,559
hormones and the food source the

412
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,559
nutrients that are needed by the plant

413
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,399
we also put some sugar in there and some

414
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,479
other hormones that'll help

415
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,399
help help the plant grow as it goes

416
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,879
along

417
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,958
but it's such a perfect space and a

418
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,159
perfect environment

419
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,319
you got to remember when we put a little

420
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,278
piece of an explant or a little piece of

421
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,079
a plant

422
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,039
into that tissue culture medium there's

423
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:58,559
no roots

424
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,799
right the plant is just it's just like a

425
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,518
little cutting so the plant has to be

426
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,439
able to

427
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,560
be able to absorb everything that it

428
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,920
needs

429
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:11,198
from that um that jar

430
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:13,120
and one of the problems is that that

431
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,639
environment is so suited to growing

432
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,480
anything even even other

433
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,360
molds and and bacteria that if the plant

434
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,519
part is not

435
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,639
completely sterilized before we put it

436
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,039
in the jar

437
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,399
it may bring in a virus or a bacteria or

438
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,838
a fungus with it

439
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,360
and that fungus or bacteria will then be

440
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,800
able to

441
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,360
um propagate itself much much more

442
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,439
quickly

443
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,800
than the the plant part that we've put

444
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,000
in there and so that's what we call

445
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:45,519
contamination of the vessel

446
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,278
so we have to uh autoclave these jars

447
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,799
at very high temperature and pressure

448
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:49,759
before we put the plant in there it's

449
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,519
all sealed up

450
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,278
you make your medium you add your

451
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,278
hormones and your food and your sugar

452
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,559
and that all goes in the jar and then we

453
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:57,439
put it in the pressure cooker or an

454
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,759
autoclave

455
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,720
and that sterilizes the plant medium and

456
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,639
so

457
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,480
the next step is is cooling that

458
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,198
material down and letting the agar

459
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
harden

460
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,679
and then we use something called a

461
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,360
laminar flow hood which is essentially

462
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:16,399
a very high quality

463
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,440
uh hepa filter that creates an

464
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,278
air flow that passes through this filter

465
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,279
process so

466
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,278
any air that comes in contact with the

467
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,120
plant has actually had all the fungus

468
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,879
and viruses and bacteria been removed

469
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,799
from the plant is that the same kind of

470
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,360
hood that i'm talking about with people

471
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,758
who are

472
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,680
growing psilocybin mushrooms very

473
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,680
similar yeah very similar same kind of

474
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,439
process again the same with the idea

475
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,879
is that you want to maintain sterility

476
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,880
like you really want

477
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:45,039
the only organism that you're putting

478
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,559
into the pot is your target

479
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,639
yeah your target so either cannabis or

480
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,000
like you said mushrooms before we go on

481
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,480
let me let's break down a little bit

482
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,440
about

483
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,480
this uh this petri dish so so first of

484
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,680
all um what's

485
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,039
what's agar agar is like

486
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,879
um it's an extract from seaweed i mean

487
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,360
many of you walking by the seaside you

488
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,799
can

489
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,399
you sometimes you pick up seaside and

490
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,159
they've got these little kind of jelly

491
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,839
balls on them or whatever

492
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,759
um it's that kind of thing so they take

493
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,320
it then they ex you know they'll they'll

494
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,079
extract it from these these plants boil

495
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,000
it all down and purify it

496
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,359
and really all of it all that it does is

497
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,240
it gives a matrix

498
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,759
um it adds some solidify it's a

499
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,320
solidifying agent

500
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,159
for your liquid like we were talking

501
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,240
about the bioreactors before

502
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,159
or the embryo culture reactors if you

503
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,600
have these little plant parts in sugar

504
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,480
water with all the right nutrients and

505
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,440
hormones

506
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,879
and the the your solution is actively

507
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,079
moving around so that it's being

508
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,838
oxygenated

509
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,359
you can actually grow these plant parts

510
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,040
just in the liquid

511
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,800
um but the agar adds like a solid

512
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,240
aspect to that it just solidifies the

513
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,278
medium and it kind of makes it more

514
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,000
stable

515
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,360
um you know we can the plant can remain

516
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,278
upright in in that ag

517
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,480
so is it kind of like a neutral and

518
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,639
inert thing

519
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,159
absolutely okay i get it so it's just

520
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,278
they're kind of kind of like to hold

521
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,759
[ __ ] there

522
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,318
yep it's just it's just a medium all

523
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,879
right

524
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,838
so then you also said that uh in this

525
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,039
agar

526
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,399
um you're putting these uh you know tiny

527
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,078
plant cuttings

528
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,319
well like we've we're already talking

529
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,078
about at a cellular level right

530
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,000
and i you know when i make a clone it's

531
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,918
a pretty big cutting

532
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,720
so how small of the cuttings

533
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,400
are placed in these petri dishes like

534
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,038
are we talking about

535
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,280
like you know an inch that we've cut

536
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:35,919
with a scalpel or are we talking about

537
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,599
like a

538
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:42,880
sliver like what how small is small

539
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,038
yeah well they ca they ideally you want

540
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,320
them to be small because the bigger

541
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:47,839
the bigger the plant the more

542
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,240
opportunity that we're going to have

543
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,599
missed

544
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,798
some of um the bacteria or the viruses

545
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,839
or the molds

546
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,200
in our sterilization process so we want

547
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,639
to get down to pretty small just by

548
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,400
getting down to a pretty small part like

549
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,919
a centimeter

550
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,759
you can go that small you can get the

551
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,360
pet like again we're talking you know we

552
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,960
can do all these different types of

553
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,519
medium you can actually use pieces of

554
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,840
leaf

555
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,319
you can use cross sections of stems you

556
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,159
can try to do roots

557
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,558
or you can grow the meristem like i was

558
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,960
talking about or or even the auxiliary

559
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,359
bud

560
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,038
like you know if you imagine a plant

561
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,879
that's growing we've got the shoots

562
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,759
coming off the top and then you might

563
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,679
have say three leaves coming off

564
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,519
uh you know two on one side of the stem

565
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,640
and one on the other side

566
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,599
and everywhere that a leaf stem or the

567
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,799
petiole

568
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,599
meets the the main stem junction that's

569
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,359
there's a a space where a new branch

570
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,719
will grow and any grower knows this if

571
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,798
you if you watch plants

572
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,079
that the leaf the the new shoots always

573
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,879
come out between

574
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,519
a leaf and the stem and so that little

575
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,760
spot

576
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,960
on the on the crotch of the you can call

577
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,440
it the crotch of the

578
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,000
the plant in between the stem that shoot

579
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,480
that actually

580
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,038
has um what it was called an auxiliary

581
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,360
bud

582
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,879
or a and that is just the place on the

583
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,399
plant where that shoot will grow

584
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,720
and so we can actually cut we can

585
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,320
actually cut all the

586
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,360
leaves off and and just plant

587
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,639
the node where that piece of the the

588
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,399
chute will grow

589
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,919
and so there's no you got to consider

590
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,080
there's no leaves

591
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,200
right we've cut them all off and so

592
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,759
because there's no leaves

593
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,798
that plant can't harvest co2 from the

594
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,160
air

595
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:34,639
right and so we've put sugar

596
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,360
into the medium directly because photos

597
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,559
sugar is

598
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,798
sugars are the byproduct of

599
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:40,000
photosynthesis so by putting sugar in

600
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,160
the medium

601
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,480
we kind of bypass that photosynthesis

602
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,759
step and allow the plant to have access

603
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,038
to these

604
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,558
these molecules so they can just

605
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,879
incorporate them rather than having to

606
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:54,000
synthesize them themselves

607
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,640
so is that little growth that occurs

608
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,240
in the crotch uh is th is that the

609
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,840
meristem

610
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,599
yeah there is a there is a meristem in

611
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:05,038
the auxiliary bud yeah so

612
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:07,599
define that would you mirror stem

613
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,599
so the meristem is it's kind of like the

614
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,158
center of generation for all the plants

615
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,558
like

616
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,360
if you look at the top of a a growing

617
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:14,960
plant

618
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,479
where the leaves are growing and you can

619
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,120
you know you can get in there and fold

620
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,960
the leaves down and try to get to that

621
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,319
most central point that most central

622
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,360
point where everything is growing

623
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:28,558
out of is the meristem so

624
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,158
um you know

625
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:31,599
think of it like a worm like i don't

626
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,120
know if people have ever heard of this

627
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,719
experiment where you can take a worm and

628
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,879
cut it in half and both hats

629
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,319
will live they and they can regenerate

630
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,000
their own parts it's kind of the same

631
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,200
with cannabis plant

632
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,319
anywhere that there's an auxiliary or

633
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,919
an uh or a an apical meristem in the

634
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,839
apical meristem is just the one on the

635
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,400
very top of the plant

636
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:55,038
that thing can generate an entire new

637
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,880
plant from it

638
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,319
so kind of think of it like the the

639
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,520
source code you know what i mean that's

640
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,439
like the

641
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:07,038
is is the central meristemness

642
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,000
of the cannabis plant only uh

643
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,558
present in certain parts of the plant or

644
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,240
is it

645
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,720
uh everywhere because you know like like

646
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,640
you know

647
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,880
i'm not super good at making clones

648
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,159
right and like you know i have put a lot

649
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,360
of effort into

650
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:26,880
making my cone or my clone uh

651
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,279
cuts you know right there at the point

652
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
where

653
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,720
the you know the new growth of the

654
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,159
leaves are on the side so i'm like oh

655
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,000
this is supposed to be where all the

656
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,320
the new hormones are and i'm like really

657
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,960
careful but but are you telling me that

658
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:40,480
like

659
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,279
most of the plant can be used as a clone

660
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,440
in kind of like a random way or are are

661
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,240
these meristems only a few places on the

662
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,798
plant

663
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,319
no anywhere anywhere that the stem meets

664
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:51,759
a leaf junction there's going to be a

665
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:56,319
meristem oh i see

666
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:58,480
okay um so but using tissue culture

667
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,399
we can actually also get the plant to

668
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,360
produce new meristems from other parts

669
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,559
of tissues

670
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,319
where they don't exist so you know yeah

671
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,678
it's kind of a weird thing but we can we

672
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,079
can take a leaf

673
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,200
and grow what we call people might have

674
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,558
noticed when you

675
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,720
when you're rooting cuttings for example

676
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,240
they go the the stem goes through a

677
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,839
stage before the roots start growing out

678
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,440
where they kind of swell a little bit

679
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,119
and they become

680
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,960
like a little bit of a rough bumpy

681
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,038
texture that's called

682
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,640
callus and callus is kind of the

683
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:30,000
intermediate or what we think of as the

684
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,320
as the stem cell it's d

685
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,519
differentiated tissue it's tissue that's

686
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,839
kind of

687
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,960
it hasn't been genetically destined to

688
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:38,720
do anything

689
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,640
so it can kind of become anything at

690
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,640
that point in time callus can become a

691
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,000
root it can be encouraged to become a

692
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,840
shoot

693
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,759
but you really have to encourage the

694
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,439
plant using hormones to do

695
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,119
you know to guide it down the path that

696
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,640
you want it to go through

697
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,918
all right all right cool well thank you

698
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,480
for going down that with me there's one

699
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,840
more

700
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,640
um ingredient in those petri dishes i

701
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,599
want to talk about

702
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,080
you said that we're going to add a

703
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:05,359
little sugar so i'm curious to know

704
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,279
like what kind of sugar and why sugar

705
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,879
i mean we use it in compost tea and we

706
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,440
talk about that all the time on the show

707
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,840
but

708
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,519
um you know in this particular

709
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,319
application why are we using it

710
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,839
so like i said sugar you know sugar is

711
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:22,079
the end result of photosynthesis

712
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,959
light comes in it hits the cells in the

713
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,319
leaf

714
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,840
and there's a whole reaction that

715
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,918
happens but what essentially comes at

716
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,918
the other end is sugar

717
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,759
and so we there is a form of sugar and

718
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,200
so we actually use sucrose just go to

719
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,480
the grocery store and buy a couple of

720
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,798
pounds of sugar

721
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,839
and that gets you know it get it gets

722
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:39,440
mixed in at like

723
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,199
i can't even remember it's like a few

724
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,200
grams per liter

725
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,200
um and and so essentially we bypass

726
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,038
the photosynthesis and we just put the

727
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,120
sugar directly into the into the food

728
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,480
source and that way the plant has a

729
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,000
carbon source because

730
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,319
like i said if you cut off all the

731
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,880
leaves and we're just trying to grow

732
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,158
a little auxiliary bud from a small

733
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,240
piece of stem

734
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,320
and there's no leaf there's no way for

735
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,400
the plant to harvest co2 from the air or

736
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,480
the explant to harvest co2 from the air

737
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,720
that makes sense and so we kind of

738
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,839
bypass that process and put the sugar

739
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,440
right into the

740
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,359
into the medium so that the plant can

741
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,679
actually suck that up through

742
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,839
um you know the the piece of the plant

743
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:23,038
that's in contact with the medium

744
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,720
so you were talking earlier about how um

745
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,480
like what an opportunity this

746
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,759
environment is right you're like okay

747
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna try

748
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,640
to grow

749
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,519
cannabis you know plantlets in this

750
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,559
thing

751
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,639
but but it would love to grow fungus

752
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,240
and you know probably bacteria and

753
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,679
anything else that happens to be

754
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:45,120
in the room um what are

755
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,880
the you know what are the sterile

756
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,158
conditions that have to be

757
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,080
set and generally how are those made

758
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,679
in this tissue culture environment i'm

759
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,158
assuming this is you know a tissue

760
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,720
culture

761
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,080
lab yeah it's all done in the lab but i

762
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,079
think i like to use the

763
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,199
cut finger analogy so i mean if you're

764
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,720
out working away

765
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,240
in the garden or in your shop or

766
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,400
whatever and you cut your finger you get

767
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,679
a big old deep gash on your finger

768
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,519
the first thing you do is you run it

769
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,278
under water and take the blood away but

770
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,798
you want to sterilize it right you want

771
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,400
to clean it up so that there's no

772
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:15,918
bacteria or

773
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,759
things that are going to start growing

774
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,679
in the cut because our bodies

775
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,119
you know the inside of your body we've

776
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,798
got all these nutrients it's like a

777
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,798
perfect place for a bacteria to come and

778
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,960
set up home

779
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:30,240
and and so too is the tissue culture

780
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,079
vessel it's kind of the same thing

781
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,759
so we want it to be completely sterile

782
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,519
and sterile just means that we've we've

783
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,879
killed 100

784
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:41,359
of the bacteria the fungal spores

785
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,240
and any viruses or any other organisms

786
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,038
that might be living

787
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,480
in the medium and we do that by we make

788
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:49,359
a big batch of this

789
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,519
of our agar and then we pour say 25

790
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:55,359
milliliters into a small baby food

791
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,960
size jar and then those get special lids

792
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,319
on them and then we can stack

793
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,400
you know a whole bunch of those in an

794
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,639
autoclave or a pressure cooker

795
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,679
and uh for anybody that's ever done

796
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,880
canning you know

797
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,000
canned fruits or jams or or even

798
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,400
you know different vegetables or

799
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,720
whatever that you can can meets

800
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,080
we seal up the lids in these jars and we

801
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,360
put put them in a large

802
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:19,599
container like a pressure cooker

803
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,558
that's essentially like a big it's more

804
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,918
or less a bomb

805
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:27,038
it's like a big metal container

806
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,720
that we heat from the bottom and we put

807
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:29,919
water in the container obviously we seal

808
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
it all up and then we heat it from the

809
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,200
bottom

810
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,759
and the the heating it from the bottom

811
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,679
creates

812
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:39,839
a steam inside this big vessel and so

813
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,679
you have all these big really locks and

814
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,319
tighteners and fasteners that hold the

815
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,440
lid down i mean it's a serious piece of

816
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:50,720
equipment and we actually by

817
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,720
by letting the steam build up

818
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,720
it gets to a really high temperature but

819
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,480
the pressure also increases immensely

820
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,440
inside this vessel

821
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,319
and um that is that will actually

822
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,759
sterilize

823
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,918
anything that's in the jar it kills all

824
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,558
the bacteria and it kills all the the

825
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,000
funguses

826
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,558
fungal spores or anything that are in

827
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,200
the medium so that when we take it off

828
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,720
uh the stove and we let it cool back

829
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,440
down and releasing the st

830
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,200
the steam from the container those jars

831
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,798
can then be taken over to

832
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,200
the laminar flow hood you actually take

833
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,119
the whole autoclave or the whole the

834
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,038
whole autoclave but the whole container

835
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,879
over to your laminar flow hood and we we

836
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,359
take the jars out and let them cool

837
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,559
in the laminar flow so once they've come

838
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,038
out of this

839
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:34,000
pressurization process the sterilization

840
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:35,679
process

841
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,519
they only exist in an environment where

842
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,200
there's no bacteria

843
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,359
so like i don't have a lot of lab

844
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,360
experience and this question

845
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,278
very well may illustrate that but it

846
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,959
kind of sounds to me like this

847
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:49,119
this this pressure cooker that you're

848
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,880
talking about is the exact

849
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:55,439
opposite of of using a vac oven

850
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,320
that we use in a lab as well like where

851
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,720
the vacuum

852
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,398
is you know uh trying to create

853
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,480
different different atmosphere

854
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,319
by creating a vacuum whereas this is

855
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,200
doing the opposite it's trying to

856
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,678
ultra pressurize it also to create an

857
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,679
unlivable environment am i anywhere

858
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,840
accurate on that that's exactly what it

859
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,840
does

860
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,520
it creates an unlivable environment

861
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,480
right and so that anything that's gone

862
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,440
through the process

863
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,000
dies and then from that point on it's

864
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,240
what we call

865
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,359
sterile and so think of you know when

866
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,079
we're talking about the lab

867
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,599
or the laminar flow hood this sterile

868
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:31,678
air environment

869
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,678
think of that literally like a surgical

870
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,600
suite or a surgical room

871
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,519
um you know when when the doctors and

872
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,918
nurses go in to do surgery

873
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,158
they're all gowned up they've got

874
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,159
special gloves on and masks on that are

875
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,278
stopping them from breathing you know

876
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,960
just like we already know is about

877
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:47,919
mastering kovid right i mean it's the

878
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,679
same process

879
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,240
you want your doctors to have on a mask

880
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,080
so that they're not blowing out bacteria

881
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,720
into the open patient that's lying in

882
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,879
front of them

883
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,159
right and and that's kind of like this

884
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,200
think of you can kind of think of the

885
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,840
sterile

886
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,759
uh jar as like the patient right any

887
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:06,000
time you open it

888
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,278
um there's a risk that we're gonna

889
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,599
introduce

890
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,319
again either a virus a bacteria a pest

891
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,879
or or

892
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,558
uh some fungus into it and we really

893
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,720
this whole process

894
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,240
we want to do in the absence of all

895
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,000
those organisms

896
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,919
all right now that we've established

897
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,398
really well really really well

898
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,000
what are in these petri dishes um let's

899
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:29,278
kind of reorient ourselves

900
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,798
so so explain how the

901
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:35,839
cannabis industry right now is using

902
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:39,440
uh this for um for cultivation

903
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:42,240
is is one of these petri dishes

904
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,038
going to make a gazillion plantlets and

905
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,759
all these like

906
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:46,480
like little tiny ass clones or is it is

907
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:50,240
it going to be

908
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:54,240
one petri dish per clone

909
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,720
uh no no it really won't be one petri

910
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,319
dish

911
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,079
per clone at the end of the stage it

912
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,558
gets to be that but

913
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,398
so when we think about it there's really

914
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:02,798
a few parts to tissue culture the first

915
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:04,879
part is

916
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,240
sterilization and then what we go into

917
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,440
something called initiation where we

918
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,519
actually put the

919
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,080
the sterile piece of plant material into

920
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,079
the jar

921
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,599
if you put that plant material into the

922
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,440
jar and let it put the lid on

923
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:18,719
take it to your sterile culture room

924
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,759
that plant will actually grow

925
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,360
inside the jar for say two weeks okay

926
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,480
and then after two weeks you come back

927
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,158
along

928
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,798
you can take that plant part or that

929
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,919
grown

930
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,599
plant part out of the jar under

931
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,759
laminar flow again in this sterile

932
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,719
environment and you can cut it up into

933
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,919
probably

934
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,600
two or three or maybe five new shoots

935
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,000
and plant each of them again in their

936
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,439
own jar and that's called subculturing

937
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,599
where we actually take one culture

938
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,360
vessel we take it out divide it into

939
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:53,119
multiple plant parts

940
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:56,798
and then create five new vessels okay

941
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:58,798
in doing that we've skipped the step of

942
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,278
having to sterilize

943
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,038
five times those individual plants that

944
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,038
are going in so

945
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,440
the the beauty of subculturing is that

946
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,720
you can

947
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,558
you can mult you can essentially

948
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,919
multiply your plant material

949
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:13,839
without having to go through the

950
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,799
initiation process again

951
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,720
okay so so if you think of of doing that

952
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,480
one plant goes into the jar

953
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,558
two weeks of vegetative growth we take

954
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,480
it out you've now got a plant that we

955
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,759
can cut out five plant parts

956
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,159
each of those goes into their own

957
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,079
individual jar they can go back into the

958
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,519
culture room for another two weeks

959
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:36,158
and then what comes out is 25 plants

960
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,440
right so overall it reminds me of

961
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,640
mothers right just

962
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,558
like regular old mothers yeah it is it's

963
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,559
very in the same way it is very much

964
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,000
like the mother process but the the

965
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:47,678
mothering process

966
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,119
is all done in a greenhouse environment

967
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,000
or a grow room environment

968
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,199
and you're subject to bacteria and molds

969
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,558
and fungus and anything else that's

970
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,759
floating around in the air or what's

971
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:57,599
brought in with

972
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:58,879
um you know the cultivators as they come

973
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,240
in and out maybe they're bringing bugs

974
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,240
in on their clothes

975
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,159
so it's it's just a different way of

976
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,640
doing the same thing

977
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,480
uh in a sterile environment and you can

978
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,600
imagine the logarithmic curve that you

979
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,720
get you know after

980
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,359
like i said if you go 1 to 5 5 to 25 the

981
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,720
next multiplication is

982
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,879
125 the next multiplication is you know

983
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,558
we're well over 600 so

984
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,000
it it it really starts to grow

985
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,879
exponentially

986
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,640
um and so that's that's it it takes a

987
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,880
period of time i mean you're not gonna

988
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,320
you know if you want to plant a million

989
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,360
cuttings in a year you have to start

990
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:33,599
today

991
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:36,479
right but it does allow you to hit this

992
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:38,240
critical mass where

993
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,960
the the like i said the multiplication

994
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,640
becomes exponential

995
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,679
so all right so if we we've got this one

996
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,120
original plant um for for lack of

997
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,559
vocabulary i'm going to call this the

998
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,479
mother right this is the plant that we

999
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:54,639
want to make a bunch of

1000
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,159
because we want to micro propagate it

1001
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,399
because we're gonna fill our

1002
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,440
field our cultivation facility with it

1003
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,918
or whatever

1004
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,759
um you know i would think that there are

1005
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,360
some attributes we would want this

1006
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:08,960
mother to have i mean like sure

1007
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,918
sure we wanted to have a good terpene

1008
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,079
profile and good potency and all and all

1009
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,278
the regular stuff we're used to right

1010
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:17,839
but because

1011
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:19,839
we are doing it in the lab and we are

1012
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,599
doing the sorcery with it

1013
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:24,158
i would think that there are other

1014
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:27,038
attributes that we would be looking for

1015
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,760
in our plant that makes it appropriate

1016
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:32,240
for micro

1017
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:36,319
propagation so so what do we look for

1018
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:39,839
in a plant that makes it especially

1019
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:41,599
a good candidate for micro propagation

1020
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,278
yeah that's actually a really good

1021
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:46,158
question

1022
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:47,759
and the answer is that not nobody is

1023
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,640
currently doing that

1024
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,558
um wait like we don't even know we don't

1025
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,240
even know what plants make good

1026
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:58,240
micro propagation plants no i think so

1027
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,679
cannabis is a really interesting species

1028
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,120
in many many ways

1029
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,038
but in one of the ways it's really

1030
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,518
interesting is that like every single

1031
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,480
trait that we can consider the in the

1032
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,480
plant

1033
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,519
there's usually there's usually almost

1034
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,280
always

1035
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,878
a great amount of variation like for

1036
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,480
example let's just talk about height

1037
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,639
you can have tall plants medium plants

1038
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,119
short plants right yielding plants

1039
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,399
low me low yielding medium yielding high

1040
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,480
yielding uh

1041
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:23,918
terpene plants you can have low low

1042
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,639
levels of terpenes high levels of

1043
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,719
terpenes

1044
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,000
cannabinoids the same thing so the point

1045
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,000
that i'm trying to make is that any

1046
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,878
trait that we can look at in the plant

1047
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,159
there's a continuum of performance right

1048
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:35,838
for that trade

1049
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,599
and and currently the way that we're

1050
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:38,159
doing tissue culture is people are

1051
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,079
growing

1052
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,760
cannabis the way they normally do

1053
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,560
they're selecting the plants that they

1054
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,919
want to be

1055
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:48,000
ideal for their production environment

1056
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,519
and then once we've selected the plant

1057
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,480
you know we get our blue dream or our

1058
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:52,239
cookies or

1059
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,000
og comes out at the end of whatever

1060
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:57,039
process we're doing

1061
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,039
to to select plants we then take those

1062
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:01,119
plants back into the tissue culture

1063
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,719
system and see how well they they

1064
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,200
perform in tissue culture

1065
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,480
and we've come to learn over the past 15

1066
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,919
or 20 years

1067
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:13,039
that there is actually different plants

1068
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,639
perform either well or poorly in micro

1069
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:16,000
propagation right some planets just

1070
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,639
don't like the process

1071
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,800
they want more vitamin b or they want a

1072
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,719
specific hormone

1073
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,800
they just don't grow quickly when you

1074
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:27,838
put them in into tissue cultures so

1075
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,720
it might be in the future that the

1076
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,920
question of

1077
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:33,919
does this plant propagate well

1078
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,200
under tissue culture is actually a

1079
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,320
criteria that we use

1080
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:40,159
for um selecting individual plants but

1081
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,920
currently we're not doing that

1082
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:44,078
man i can't i can't think that we're too

1083
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,880
far off from that you know with the

1084
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,359
with the increased interest in corporate

1085
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,240
ag

1086
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:52,319
and everything and these like crazy huge

1087
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,239
fields they've got in california now

1088
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,960
i've got to think that's the future as

1089
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,479
much as it may not mean my flavor

1090
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,800
yeah well the more listen the more we

1091
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,719
move towards scientists being involved

1092
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,240
in the selection of plants

1093
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:07,679
um these these added

1094
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,199
characteristics are going to start being

1095
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,480
looked at before the problem with

1096
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,879
handing it all over to science is they

1097
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,440
just don't get the culture right i mean

1098
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,039
you have to it's kind of like you know

1099
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,880
if you're making wine

1100
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,039
the people that make the best wine in

1101
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,559
the world like they consume wine

1102
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,960
right because they understand the things

1103
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,000
they understand the processes that go

1104
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,039
into production that

1105
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,920
yield quality at the end

1106
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,039
and we just the scientists aren't at

1107
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,639
that point with cannabis where they

1108
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:35,920
really under the the vast majority of

1109
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,239
the pure scientists

1110
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,119
that are being brought in to cannabis i

1111
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,118
mean

1112
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,358
the the most successful companies that i

1113
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,240
see operating in cannabis space

1114
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,838
they have a science team or a group of

1115
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:51,039
people that are bringing science to the

1116
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,559
the the venture but they're also people

1117
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:53,599
from the cannabis community that

1118
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,159
understand

1119
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,440
all the important things that go along

1120
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,679
with you know

1121
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,440
cannabis production and it's really the

1122
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:02,319
marriage of those two things that that

1123
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,960
makes the win

1124
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,320
right yeah i don't i don't really want a

1125
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,519
scientist

1126
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,000
who has been over in ornamentals

1127
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:14,000
you know making plans for somebody's

1128
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,639
freaking landscaping to be making these

1129
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,358
choices

1130
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:19,358
i want mean gene to be making those

1131
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:21,679
choices you know

1132
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:22,880
somebody who i respect because they have

1133
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,199
done the

1134
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,599
the propagation and the in the in the

1135
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:30,559
sifting in the old ways right

1136
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,519
i want i want somebody like that but

1137
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:33,358
with this

1138
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:34,559
ridiculous science education to be

1139
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:36,719
making those choices

1140
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,239
and you know i don't know there's maybe

1141
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,319
there's a handful of those people

1142
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,919
nowadays but i would guess that those

1143
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,838
are probably these

1144
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,000
freaking lucky kids who are in their

1145
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:48,559
early 20s now

1146
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,838
who are coming up in this post

1147
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,320
prohibition

1148
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,078
environment who are going to learn that

1149
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,920
stuff and they're going to come up and

1150
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,200
and they're you know they're pot smokers

1151
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,159
who also

1152
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:00,960
are getting science degrees yeah well

1153
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,598
you know i

1154
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,960
i see plant breeding or plant

1155
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,880
improvements as really

1156
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,079
it's not a one-man sport it's a team

1157
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,280
sport

1158
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,119
right and it's kind of one of those

1159
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,519
situations where it's like it takes

1160
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,320
teamwork to drape make the dream work

1161
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:16,079
right like

1162
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,440
you know it's a cheesy thing but it's

1163
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,920
like if you could pair

1164
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,960
you know mean gene with a really high

1165
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,599
advanced

1166
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,159
uh plant scientist that understands

1167
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,680
things

1168
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,039
about plants that maybe mean gene

1169
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,559
doesn't understand or someone like

1170
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,639
myself doesn't understand

1171
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:32,639
that you can actually you know get a lot

1172
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,799
farther of the synergy between

1173
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,400
the experience the two those two

1174
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,039
different worlds of experience meeting

1175
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,440
together or being married together

1176
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,239
that's great i i can already start to

1177
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,599
imagine

1178
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:45,759

cannabis geneticist ryan lee

1185
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,480
with the national hemp program in flux

1186
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,280
due to stringent thc testing

1187
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,960
requirements

1188
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,560
brother seth and eric crawford continue

1189
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,440
to release seeds to hemp farmers that

1190
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,279
will be legal

1191
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,480
no matter how you grow them or when you

1192
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,560
test them

1193
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,199
these new varieties from oregon cbd

1194
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:16,639
seeds have substantial amounts of cbdv

1195
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:18,559
cbgv cbcv and thcv

1196
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,400
while always staying below the point

1197
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:22,559
three percent thc limit

1198
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,480
and guaranteeing complying crops for

1199
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,239
farmers every time

1200
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,599
also these new varieties cannot be

1201
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,879
pollinated by your neighbor's

1202
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,760
uncontrolled pollen

1203
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,240
or a rogue male in your own crop either

1204
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,359
oregon cbd seeds are non-gmo certified

1205
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,078
too

1206
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:40,239

00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,279
maxing out their personal credit cards

1209
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:45,440
without outside

1210
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,960
investment they continue to refuse

1211
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,800
outside investment that would change

1212
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,519
their company culture

1213
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,280
oregon cbd grows tons of fresh food on

1214
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:54,000
their research farms for local food

1215
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,640
banks

1216
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,199
literally tons of food they also give

1217
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:02,078

1218
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:03,039
flour to patients as their company began

1219
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,880
to succeed

1220
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,800
seth and eric started donating money to

1221
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,599

dissolved oxygen in the root zone is a

challenge gaia's brand of ultrafine nano

1253

bubble systems will help your garden

1254

thrive in ways you may not have

1255

considered

1256
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,358
no matter if you grow in soil

1257
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,839
hydroponics or aquaponics

1258
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,679
gaia's ultrafine nanobubble systems will

1259
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:26,719
increase your dissolved oxygen

1260
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:28,799
and increase your yield often the first

1261
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,719
sign of inadequate oxygen supply to the

1262
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,039
roots is wilting of the plant under warm

1263
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,879
conditions and high light levels

1264
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:36,480
insufficient oxygen results in an

1265
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,240
accumulation of toxins

1266
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,760
and an insufficient amount of water and

1267
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:42,318
mineral absorption

1268
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,079
if oxygen starvation continues mineral

1269
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,000
deficiencies will begin to show

1270
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,200
roots die back and plants will become

1271
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,119
stunted

1272
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,759
healthy roots supplied with sufficient

1273
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,559
oxygen are able to absorb nutrient ions

1274
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,240
selectively

1275
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,000
from the surrounding solution as

1276
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,318
required in studies

1277
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,519
this has shown a 30 increase in plant

1278
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:01,838
growth

1279
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,358
not only do ultra fine oxygen bubbles

1280
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:04,960
allow your plants to thrive

1281
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,279
but they will keep your drip lines and

1282
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,519
irrigation pipes and plumbing clean too

1283
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,000
because algae pythium and other invasive

1284
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,440
species only survive in low oxygen

1285
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,599
environments

1286
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,599
and the gaia system only costs about two

1287
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,720
dollars per day to run

1288
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,880
gaia ultrafine oxygen nano bubblers

1289
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:24,959
are also great for making compost teas

1290
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,358
and wild crafted nutrient teas

1291
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,079
the smaller bubbles of truly dissolved

1292
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,119
oxygen

1293
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:35,039
allow more microbes to reproduce faster

that's h205.com

1299
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,240

demanding and consumers become more

1301

educated

1302
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,480
it is increasingly important to avoid

1303
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,160
the use of chemical pesticides when

1304
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,838
cultivating cannabis

1305
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,679
beneficial insects have been used for

1306
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,279
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and

ornamental plant industry

1308
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,440
and today many cannabis cultivators are

1309
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:05,119
moving from sprays and chemicals to

00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:20,078
and cobert is ready to help visit

1347
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:21,358
cobert.com today

1348
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,160
welcome back you are listening to

1349
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,759
shaping fire i am your host shango los

1350
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:26,719
and our guest this week is cannabis

1351
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,319
geneticist

1352
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:32,799
ryan lee so now we have selected

1353
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,000
our mother plant we have harvested

1354
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,720
plantlets we have

1355
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,800
incubated and multiplied them in the

1356
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,719
agar growing medium

1357
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,920
let's talk about transitioning them to

1358
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:45,118
the garden

1359
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,838
so how do we move the plants from the

1360
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:51,599
growing solution in these petri dishes

1361
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:53,358
to rooting into soil and becoming plants

1362
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,720
okay it's a it's a really good question

1363
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,358
i think we should probably walk through

1364
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:56,799
the whole

1365
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,920
process we've already started the

1366
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,519
process but um

1367
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,519
there's different phases in tissue

1368
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,679
culture and so

1369
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:06,800
we we start with our explant which is

1370
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:08,559
the piece of the plant

1371
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,280
that we've cut off which is then

1372
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,759
sterilized and initiated into the tissue

1373
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:17,440
culture process or into the jar

1374
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,000
that plant then grows um we talked about

1375
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,599
already the

1376
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,119
process of multiplying it and

1377
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,200
subculturing those

1378
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,720
plant parts again into their own

1379
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:27,519
individual jars

1380
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:29,118
and that process kind of goes on over

1381
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,559
and over and over again until like i

1382
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,160
said we have our army

1383
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:34,239
but at that point in time we still have

1384
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:37,838
a tiny little plant chute

1385
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:39,598
in an agar uh medium in the jar

1386
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,159
with no roots if we were to take that

1387
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,119
plant outside and either try to clone it

1388
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:45,039
or

1389
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,800
try to try to stick it into soil it

1390
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:47,599
would just die because again it needs to

1391
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,560
have that

1392
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,240
set of roots on it and so depending on

1393
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,039
the hormone mixture that we're using in

1394
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:55,919
the agar

1395
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:56,800
we might have to create a new specific

1396
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,000
mixture

1397
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,640
or it's a new specific rooting medium

1398
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,559
and which we plug those just like we do

1399
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,358
with clones we plug those little pieces

1400
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,279
those little plant shoots into the

1401
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:09,920
rooting medium and over the process of

1402
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,560
say

1403
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,838
7 to 14 days just like a clone these

1404
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:15,838
things will grow roots

1405
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,280
but again that little plant part is used

1406
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:24,480
to being and it's like happy little

1407
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,480
jar sterile greenhouse it hasn't

1408
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,719
built up the type of protections that it

1409
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,358
would need to just be taken and put it

1410
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,719
under a

1411
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:32,239
like a thousand watt light or in a

1412
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:33,598
greenhouse or something the plant would

1413
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,799
just welt and die

1414
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,599
and so we have this process where we

1415
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,800
take the the rooted plants out we wash

1416
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,800
away the

1417
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,560
the agar medium and we put them in the

1418
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,318
soil and they kind of go through this

1419
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,000
real babying phase which we call

1420
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:51,199
hardening off

1421
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,880
um you might think of it like the

1422
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:54,480
nursery in the hospital where the babies

1423
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,000
go right when they're born

1424
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,599
it's just like a happy warm little

1425
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,280
environment with just the right it's a

1426
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,470
funny idea that the nursery in the

1427
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,079
hospital is hardening off the humans

1428
00:47:01,469 --> 00:47:05,519
[Laughter]

1429
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,880
so when one of the things that happens

1430
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:07,280
when we grow these plants in tissue

1431
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,079
culture

1432
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,440
they grow very small and they're just

1433
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,880
because they don't they don't need a lot

1434
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,519
of inputs they're not really harvest

1435
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,559
they're pulling

1436
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:18,719
sugar from this from the agar they're

1437
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,799
not harvesting it through sunlight

1438
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,239
and they're not exposed to wind and all

1439
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,480
these other things right

1440
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,239
and so we have plants have when you grow

1441
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,159
plants in a greenhouse or in a grow room

1442
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,239
environment

1443
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:31,759
you can actually look tell on the plant

1444
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:32,719
they've got something called the waxy

1445
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,400
cuticle

1446
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,799
and that waxy cuticle is kind of like a

1447
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,240
like think of it like an

1448
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,200
anti-transpiration barrier it stops the

1449
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:44,558
plant from just

1450
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:47,919
losing all of its water um

1451
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,640
and so we have to baby these plants in a

1452
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,358
way

1453
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:52,400
and kind of encourage them to to get to

1454
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:53,920
toughen up

1455
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,519
enough to the point where we can

1456
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,559
actually take them and put them into the

1457
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:58,800
into a tissue culture

1458
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,079
or sorry into a standard production

1459
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,960
environment

1460
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,200
and uh and so that it might be like a

1461
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,240
warm environment with lots of humidity

1462
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:10,000
right um it's just

1463
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:11,439
they don't go i think the important

1464
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,280
thing to realize is that they don't go

1465
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,960
from the jar to the field

1466
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,319
right but you have to have this

1467
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,760
intermediate step where this

1468
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:20,159
intermediate step is this still

1469
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,760
happening in the lab

1470
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:23,279
it's kind of it's like it's kind of in

1471
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,319
between the lab and the field

1472
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,040
right so it's less so it's not

1473
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:30,558
it's not sterile but it's also not

1474
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,800
exposed to the elements

1475
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,880
exactly right yeah yeah it's kind of

1476
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,480
like a really it's like i said it's like

1477
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,039
a nursery it's like it isn't

1478
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,800
it's exactly what it is a nursery right

1479
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:42,639
it's like we want to

1480
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,039
take these little babies and encourage

1481
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:47,838
them to grow up just enough

1482
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,039
so that when we then take those plants

1483
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:49,920
and move them into the production

1484
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,079
environment

1485
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,280
either in a grow room or in a greenhouse

1486
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,880
that they can just take off

1487
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,519
how big are they physically at this

1488
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,440
point it's not really to do with size i

1489
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:01,119
mean you can do it on very small plants

1490
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,079
but you kind of want to do it on what we

1491
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,838
you know staged

1492
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,000
like three and a half four plants

1493
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:09,199
they're like you know maybe

1494
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,719
three four inches tall so so

1495
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:15,118
in that petri dish a plant has grown

1496
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,799
that's about three or four inches long

1497
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,280
and that is the size of the plant you're

1498
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,000
going to take

1499
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,440
out of the petri dish and put into your

1500
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,199
soil in this nursery

1501
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,039
yeah and the later phases of the tissue

1502
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,159
culture process i mean we might start

1503
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,960
with baby jars

1504
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:30,000
or actually even test tubes but but you

1505
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,679
can actually upscale

1506
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
the size of the container and so they

1507
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:37,039
use like those i don't know they're like

1508
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,358
you know 500 gram um

1509
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:40,880
yogurt containers you've probably seen

1510
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:42,159
them at like fast for not fast food

1511
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,480
tickets but like uh

1512
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:45,598
maybe like a slightly higher end you

1513
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,280
know vegetarian

1514
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,640
takeout it's like yeah clear clear

1515
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,359
polypropylene so

1516
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:52,239
they're actually like like transplanting

1517
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:56,480
they're potting them

1518
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:58,078
up even in micro propagation in the lab

1519
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,079
yeah as they get too small you know

1520
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,480
you're growing these little trees

1521
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,760
they they it literally looks like a two

1522
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,838
foot tall bush

1523
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,680
but it all happens in the size of a baby

1524
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:09,519
jar a baby food jar

1525
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:11,039
right and so if you want to get if you

1526
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:14,639
want the plant to grow

1527
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:16,960
past that size you make a bigger jar

1528
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:18,639
right so that's why we call it that's

1529
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,960
why these tissue culture vessels come in

1530
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:23,519
various sizes

1531
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,440
all right so um let's talk one more

1532
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:28,639
moment about this waxy cuticle

1533
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,639
so the waxy cuticle if i understand it

1534
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:32,558
correctly it is preserving like the

1535
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:34,799
moisture in the plant and is

1536
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,200
is kind of just kind of protecting it

1537
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:40,240
during the hardening off process

1538
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:42,558
does the waxy cuticle

1539
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:44,639
go away during the hardening off process

1540
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,280
and is it like reabsorbed into the plant

1541
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:47,920
or does it like

1542
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,800
fall off and is in the bottom no this

1543
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,639
oil

1544
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,280
sorry i maybe wasn't clear when i said

1545
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:56,078
that the waxy cuticle is what develops

1546
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,119
in this hardening off process so it's

1547
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,720
actually growing more

1548
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,318
thick during the or thicker during the

1549
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:02,318
hardening oh i see so

1550
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:04,159
so it's like the outer layer it's the

1551
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:06,719
defenseman it's the the outside

1552
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:08,639
skin it's the skin is toughening up

1553
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:10,480
during the hardening off process

1554
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,000
exactly and there's there's actually a

1555
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,280
product that you used to be able to buy

1556
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,480
that people would take i think it was

1557
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,079
called no wilt

1558
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,679
but it was a it was a product that you

1559
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,599
could actually put on cuttings

1560
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:21,598
and it was kind of like a waxy spray

1561
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,640
that you'd spray on the plant

1562
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,920
and it it kind of seals the plant up and

1563
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,519
it stops that's one of the things

1564
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,000
i mean when we when we take a cutting

1565
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:31,759
off of a branch cutting off of a plant

1566
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,920
you've cut off the way the plant is

1567
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,839
going to get access to water

1568
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:40,480
right and so that's why we use uh a dome

1569
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,239
on the clone trays right is it it

1570
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,440
maintains that humidity if we were to

1571
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:45,838
take the dome off

1572
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,679
and put a even a fan blowing lightly

1573
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:49,920
across clones that were freshly

1574
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:51,279
planted they'd all wilt because what

1575
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,119
you're doing is you're encouraging them

1576
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,640
to transpire all that water

1577
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,760
out of the plant and they can't reabsorb

1578
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:59,519
enough water

1579
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,880
to compensate for what they're losing so

1580
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:02,400
they wilt

1581
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,079
right and the idea is that we kind of

1582
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,960
create this little mini greenhouse

1583
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,880
with these domes and that prevents them

1584
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,358
it holds the water in it prevents them

1585
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,480
from

1586
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:14,799
from transpiring so

1587
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,480
this this the waxy cuticle that's going

1588
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,720
to grow on the outside this actually

1589
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:22,159
reminds me a lot of

1590
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:24,879
um wax grafting tape

1591
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:25,679
that you know after after you you make a

1592
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,680
graft you

1593
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:30,159
you wrap it with this waxy tape that is

1594
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:33,199
semi-permeable

1595
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:37,440
and but so it closes off the

1596
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:39,759
the the cutting spot for to disease and

1597
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,720
a bunch of stuff um it kind of reminds

1598
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,040
me of the same thing

1599
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:44,480
how how wax is product generally

1600
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:47,039
protective

1601
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,480
yeah absolutely and you know we we know

1602
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,159
that these waxes are all on the plant i

1603
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,960
mean if you don't ever seen

1604
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,759
these big co2 extractors in the process

1605
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,000
but

1606
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,880
you know they actually pull out a large

1607
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,960
amount of wax

1608
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,519
in the in a co2 run which is usually why

1609
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,440
they do that winterization step right in

1610
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:04,960
the extraction process where they

1611
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,039
they take the cannabis oil and they put

1612
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,159
it in a big vat of

1613
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:12,000
um or a big container of ethanol and

1614
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:14,719
then they drop the temperature really

1615
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,679
really low like well below freezing and

1616
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,519
what happens

1617
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:18,960
is all the waxes and the ax in the

1618
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:21,199
extract they precipitate

1619
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,280
out of the solution and you can actually

1620
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:25,199
filter the waxes away

1621
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,119
so those waxes though are coming from

1622
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,679
the trichomes and not the

1623
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,480
plant material right probably both oh

1624
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:33,199
okay

1625
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,519
yeah all right so it's it's you know

1626
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:35,118
it's

1627
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,199
it's common in the literature to read

1628
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,240
that micropropagation produces plants

1629
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:40,480
that can be

1630
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:42,399
more robust than their traditionally

1631
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,838
cloned counterparts

1632
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:48,800
has this been your experience i think

1633
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:49,679
probably what we're seeing i don't know

1634
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,599
if they would be

1635
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:56,000
any more robust than a healthy plant i

1636
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,760
think that probably what we're seeing

1637
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,119
is that some of the plants that are

1638
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,880
coming out of tissue culture

1639
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,480
compared to the plants that they came

1640
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,519
from

1641
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,960
they might be a little more vigorous but

1642
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:08,719
it's probably because the plants that

1643
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,519
we're comparing them to

1644
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:12,799
have had more uh they you know they've

1645
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:14,239
they were talking about like dotted

1646
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,280
plants you've heard of these dudded

1647
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,000
plants

1648
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,519
right they've got a viral or bacterial

1649
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,599
load like the plant has essentially

1650
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:23,280
become

1651
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,599
infected over years you gotta again

1652
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,000
remember cannabis plants are annuals

1653
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,280
so their natural life cycle is to grow

1654
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,199
and live for a year

1655
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,960
and then they set seed and the whole

1656
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:34,639
life cycle starts again

1657
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,720
which is kind of a way for the plant to

1658
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:39,199
shed any bacteria that's growing

1659
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:41,838
that's growing in the plant right but if

1660
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:45,118
you're if you're growing a 1996

1661
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:46,719
jack herrera plant chances are um

1662
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,559
it's picked up some garbage along the

1663
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:49,838
way yeah and that's actually one of the

1664
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,480
things that we're seeing in tissue

1665
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,440
culture is

1666
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,119
you know there's we've seen some some

1667
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,039
groups identify like

1668
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,960
bacteria that are actually living within

1669
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:00,480
the cells of the plant or in between the

1670
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,358
cells of the plant

1671
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,599
um and and so part of one of the things

1672
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:08,798
that you can do in tissue culture is

1673
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,640
is is play around and try to actually

1674
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:12,400
find a way to kill those bacteria and

1675
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:15,920
viruses in the plant

1676
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:20,000
so in instead of it being oh tissue

1677
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:22,480
culture plants are by definition

1678
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,199
you know better and more vigorous it's

1679
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,159
really

1680
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:27,759
like yeah it's really about the fact

1681
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:31,118
that the preparation

1682
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:33,760
that goes into creating a

1683
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,358
tissue culture mother you're cleaning up

1684
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,760
the bacteria and the viruses

1685
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:39,519
so so you're just making a better plant

1686
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,280
it's not necessarily that plants that

1687
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,159
are grown in petri dishes are somehow

1688
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,400
more vigorous

1689
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:46,838
yeah i suspect that's what it is again i

1690
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,079
don't i can't say that with 100

1691
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:51,039
conclusivity

1692
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,599
um i think the truth is also is that you

1693
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,279
know while

1694
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,480
well yeah some of these companies are

1695
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,359
starting to do tissue culture in

1696
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,838
cannabis

1697
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:59,679
i would say that we're probably three to

1698
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:00,880
five years away or maybe even 10 years

1699
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:03,838
away from having

1700
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:07,440
a completely bulletproof system that is

1701
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:09,519
producing perfect plants every time

1702
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,960
um well in in the category of

1703
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:11,358
bulletproof you know one of the things

1704
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,119
that

1705
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:14,798
people who want to complain about tissue

1706
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,599
culture will

1707
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:18,000
they'll point out that some cultivars do

1708
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,798
not

1709
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,199
grow true to type after they're grown

1710
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:24,480
out

1711
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:27,358
from tissue culture um is this a

1712
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,480
failed expression common in cannabis

1713
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:31,199
like the plant

1714
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,920
or is this more or less common in other

1715
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:34,960
species

1716
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,318
and and like what might cause this yeah

1717
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,679
so that's something called

1718
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:42,719
somaclonal variation um

1719
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,639
semiclonal variation just means

1720
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:47,199
the variation that we see due to

1721
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:49,118
possible genetic changes in the plant

1722
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:51,118
uh through the tissue culture process

1723
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,680
and and we actually know that some of

1724
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,039
the

1725
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:57,039
hormones um that are used

1726
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,400
in in the tissue culture process

1727
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:00,480
actually do

1728
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,599
increase the rate of genetic mutation in

1729
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,798
these plants so

1730
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:07,280
we might be seeing um

1731
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:10,480
genetic changes it could also be that

1732
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:14,160
we're seeing epigenetic changes

1733
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:16,400
epigenetics is essentially you know

1734
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:17,598
it's it's a way that genes are regulated

1735
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,318
by the environment

1736
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,720
and so a plant or an organism might go

1737
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:24,000
through

1738
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:27,598
some organ or some environmental

1739
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:31,039
insult that changes the way that the dna

1740
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:33,119
that their genes are expressed

1741
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:34,318
is this like nature versus nurture from

1742
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,039
high school biology

1743
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:40,558
yeah a little bit it's it's it's it has

1744
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:43,199
it has to do with that for sure

1745
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,559
so so let's let's hit on that a little

1746
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:45,118
bit more then because i find this

1747
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,839
interesting

1748
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,798
so did you just say that like you know i

1749
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:51,440
mean i know people

1750
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:53,358
are you use the term epigenetics a lot

1751
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,599
and you know one of my favorite breeders

1752
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:56,639
modern epigenetics is making cannabis

1753
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,798
seeds but you know

1754
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,000
the word epigenetics i'm not like super

1755
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:03,119
intimate with

1756
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:08,400
are you suggesting that um environmental

1757
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:11,599
stresses can change the dna

1758
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:15,119
they they change the way the dna

1759
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:17,519
is expressed and so yeah

1760
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,358
like there's something called dna

1761
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,960
methylation and so

1762
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:23,119
there's these little tags that can be

1763
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:26,159
put on a dna which say

1764
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:28,318
transcribe this gene or don't so the dna

1765
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:30,960
itself doesn't really change

1766
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:32,639
but it's what's being altered is the

1767
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,079
regulation of those genes

1768
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:39,118
and so epigenetics literally means above

1769
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,240
genetics or standing upon genetics is

1770
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,440
really what epi

1771
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:45,439
genetics means and so this is a type of

1772
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,200
regulation that occurs

1773
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:51,519
on the dna without changing the dna

1774
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:52,480
interesting so so it's kind of like all

1775
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,519
right the dna

1776
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:57,599
says do this but then there's like then

1777
00:58:55,519 --> 00:59:00,400
there's like an epigenetic post-it

1778
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,200
note next to it that says yeah do that

1779
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,400
but like

1780
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:06,879
don't don't do that a lot or or yeah do

1781
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,519
that but do that a whole bunch

1782
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,559
yeah i mean without getting into a whole

1783
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:13,119
show on

1784
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,798
epigenetics i think that that's pretty

1785
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:16,798
like i think the post-it note is

1786
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:17,519
actually like a really good way to think

1787
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:18,798
about it

1788
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:20,559
you've got your little piece of

1789
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:21,440
machinery that comes along and it reads

1790
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,519
the dna

1791
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,599
and it encounters the post-it note and

1792
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,960
that post-it note is a little

1793
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,680
instruction that says

1794
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:31,039
hey read this dna a little bit

1795
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:34,078
differently

1796
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:36,159
and so the the the message that's

1797
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,280
on the post-it notes would that be

1798
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:41,358
considered

1799
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:43,680
soma clonal variation no somo colonial

1800
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:44,558
variation is the it's like the change in

1801
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:47,440
the observable

1802
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:50,000
observable phenotype is how i would

1803
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:53,039
describe it so the soma clonal variation

1804
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,079
is the variation from the nurture

1805
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:56,480
not the nature exactly all right i got

1806
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,160
it yeah

1807
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,318
it's the off type it's like i said it's

1808
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:02,000
the way we put known genetics in

1809
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:03,759
and two percent of those plants that

1810
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,559
come back out look different

1811
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,280
those are soma clonal variants yeah like

1812
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,440
like you know

1813
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,119
getting getting if i if i get genetics

1814
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,519
up here in the pacific northwest that

1815
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,838
grow

1816
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,519
totally kick ass and humble and i bring

1817
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:16,400
it here and people are like oh that's

1818
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:18,159
not that plant

1819
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,079
you can tell by the photograph and i'm

1820
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:20,719
like yeah well you know i got it from

1821
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,200
jodry

1822
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:24,000
and it's definitely from humboldt but

1823
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:26,639
our weather here

1824
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,798
sucks and so i'm experiencing some

1825
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:31,118
clonal variation well that's

1826
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:31,920
yeah that's really environmental

1827
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,559
differences

1828
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,400
all right i went a little too far yeah

1829
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,839
it's it's really the variation that we

1830
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,119
see coming out of the tissue culture

1831
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:42,078
process i wouldn't

1832
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,720
try to extrapolate extrapolate it past

1833
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,798
that

1834
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,318
but we do know for example there's a

1835
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:47,440
there's one chemical that was really

1836
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:49,480
used a lot

1837
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,079
um in in cannabis tissue culture called

1838
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:54,318
thiazeron or tdz

1839
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,200
and tdz is known to cause genetic

1840
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,558
mutations

1841
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:58,399
right or at least to increase the

1842
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,960
frequency of genetic mutations

1843
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,880
and so by using some of these hormones

1844
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,760
in the process yeah we can lead to

1845
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,240
changes

1846
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,799
um in the plant there can be changes in

1847
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:09,279
the process

1848
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:10,159
and that's that's really part of what we

1849
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,680
want to do is

1850
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:16,159
monitor these these types so that we can

1851
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:18,159
make sure that as we're cloning you know

1852
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:20,480
you don't want to take a variant

1853
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:22,000
or an off type and then use that to

1854
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,798
start your whole new sub culturing

1855
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,440
process

1856
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:27,039
because everything that every plant that

1857
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,880
comes from that cell line

1858
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:30,239
is going to be changed right and the

1859
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,280
idea is that we want to be

1860
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:35,199
have them being true to type aka

1861
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,040
blue dream or whatever the variety is

1862
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:40,239
right you want you want to use

1863
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:43,519
the plant that is true the truest

1864
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:46,558
expression of the genetics

1865
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:48,079
that you want exactly right on so this

1866
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:50,160
would be a great place for me to ask you

1867
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:53,039
about genetic drift because

1868
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:55,199
oh my god all the crazy stuff that is

1869
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,279
said about genetic drift and

1870
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:58,318
people pointing fingers and like you

1871
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,880
know all the bro

1872
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,558
science god help us you know people

1873
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,400
argue a lot about whether or not

1874
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:08,000
genetic drift is even a thing so so

1875
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,680
you know generally people are when they

1876
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,119
talk about genetic drift they're like

1877
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:13,759
okay you had a mother

1878
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:15,200
some time ago let's say well for the

1879
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,960
sake of this conversation let's say that

1880
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:17,838
it was five years ago there's this great

1881
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,000
plant

1882
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:22,000
and then you made a clone off that

1883
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,838
mother and you grew that up

1884
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,519
and then you made a clone off that plant

1885
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:26,159
and then you made a clone off that plant

1886
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:28,480
you made it

1887
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:29,598
so like now maybe we're like seven or

1888
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,639
eight or nine

1889
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:36,079
clones off of the original

1890
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,920
plant that was grown from seed and

1891
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:39,200
and you know what people normally tell

1892
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,680
me is like oh

1893
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:46,480
there's genetic drift because

1894
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,199
the cutting that you are growing now

1895
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,719
nine

1896
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:54,000
cuttings later is so far from the mother

1897
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:54,719
and um the clone that you have now is

1898
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,838
the same

1899
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:59,118
age as that mother was way back nine

1900
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:02,159
cuttings ago

1901
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:04,559
and so the the the genetics have

1902
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:05,759
drifted from the original expression of

1903
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,480
the seed

1904
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,799
is that a thing and if so what's what's

1905
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,838
the

1906
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:14,079
what are the mechanics there

1907
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:15,599
yeah those are again so those are why we

1908
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,839
call off types

1909
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,920
genetic drift is actually something else

1910
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:22,639
genetic drift really means

1911
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,559
the change in the frequency of the genes

1912
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:27,679
in a population

1913
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:30,559
from one generation to the next

1914
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:32,399
and those typically the frequencies of

1915
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,200
genes if your population is large enough

1916
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,039
your breeding population is large enough

1917
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:39,038
the frequency of those genes don't

1918
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:41,119
really change in the population

1919
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,799
unless we're exerting some type of

1920
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,960
selection of pressure

1921
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:46,559
like you know either through artificial

1922
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,318
selection by humans

1923
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:52,400
or pests or molds or if you use a small

1924
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:53,838
breeding population

1925
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,000
those are the things that can really

1926
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:57,519
cause a change in the genetic frequency

1927
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,079
but that's probably different than what

1928
01:03:57,519 --> 01:03:59,838
we're talking

1929
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:01,680
about it's just the community has

1930
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:02,880
started using the wrong term that term

1931
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:05,919
genetic drift

1932
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,798
already has a specific meaning and i

1933
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,720
think that what

1934
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:10,239
the community is really talking about is

1935
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:13,358
more

1936
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:13,838
results of soma clonal variation or some

1937
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:16,000
type of

1938
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:17,599
epigenetic regulation that's either

1939
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,559
happening on the plant

1940
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:21,760
or the change in phenotype is being

1941
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,280
induced by

1942
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:26,079
something like the plant has acquired a

1943
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,559
virus right so it's not it's not really

1944
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:29,200
age related it's not time related it's

1945
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,160
because

1946
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:34,000
over time your cuttings of cuttings of

1947
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:36,159
cuttings are actually picking up

1948
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,440
you know diseases and viruses and stuff

1949
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:39,679
and getting weaker

1950
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,200
i think that that's more likely we have

1951
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:42,798
shown through the sequencing

1952
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:44,639
you know that has been done in the last

1953
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:48,239
10 years that

1954
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:49,358
that you know clones what we call clones

1955
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:51,118
you know on the i don't know you

1956
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:52,159
remember the the phyllis galaxy but they

1957
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,480
used to have these

1958
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:55,838
clone groups yeah right and that's

1959
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,000
really what we're talking about is

1960
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:59,279
like you know if if two people if you

1961
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,639
got one cutting from joe

1962
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,640
jodrey and somebody else got the same

1963
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:04,960
cutting from him like 10 years ago

1964
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,078
and took it to the east coast as those

1965
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,679
two plants are now they're

1966
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,280
they're divergent branches on an

1967
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:10,798
evolutionary tree

1968
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,559
right and so they actually may go

1969
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:15,038
through little bits of

1970
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,000
of dna mutation you know that's that's

1971
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:20,400
how

1972
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,280
um pinot gris and pinot blanc came about

1973
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,079
right like those

1974
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,400
those grape varieties actually started

1975
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,599
as

1976
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,358
pinot noir and then

1977
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:32,240
you know somebody in a in a vineyard in

1978
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:32,880
france 300 years after they started

1979
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:36,479
growing

1980
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:38,318
pinot noir found one group of branch or

1981
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,318
one group of grapes that was

1982
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:42,079
like slightly gray colored and it was a

1983
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:43,038
it was a white grape not a red grape

1984
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:45,920
anymore

1985
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,960
um and that was just because that one

1986
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,760
branch

1987
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,240
produced a mutation and the mutation was

1988
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,480
in the

1989
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:55,038
in the gene that was responsible for the

1990
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:57,679
color of the pigment in the grape

1991
01:05:55,039 --> 01:06:01,280
right and so when you actually take that

1992
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:04,078
if you cut that branch off and root it

1993
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:07,280
genetically except for that one mutation

1994
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,760
it's the same plant as the pinot noir

1995
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,599
right um but it has just acquired a

1996
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,799
mutation that allows it or that has

1997
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:14,240
caused it to have

1998
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:16,719
a slightly different phenotypic

1999
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:16,719
expression

2000
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:23,038
all right so um let's before we go to

2001
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:26,160
the commercial break let's talk about

2002
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:28,880
one of the risks that people talk about

2003
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:29,279
with this entire process because you

2004
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:32,798
know

2005
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,839
you take your original um mother plant

2006
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:37,038
shall we say

2007
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:39,838
and she is the

2008
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,480
best expression of the genetics that you

2009
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:43,838
want to

2010
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:47,199
micro propagate to make your

2011
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:50,798
cannabis clone army and

2012
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:52,078
um and so then you you know go through

2013
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:55,920
the process

2014
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:58,079
of tissue culture to micropropagate it

2015
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,838
and now you've got you've got you know a

2016
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,480
gazillion of these plants and you're

2017
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:03,759
gonna put

2018
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:06,240
5000 of them out in a field or

2019
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,280
you know in a series of warehouses or

2020
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:10,399
whatever

2021
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:13,519
you know one of the things that i like

2022
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:15,519
about growing outdoors from seed

2023
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:16,639
is that all of my plants are slightly

2024
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:20,079
different

2025
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:22,798
so if i get a pest if i get crappy

2026
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,760
weather if i get a fungus if i get like

2027
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:26,960
whatever my

2028
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,079
threat is not all of my plants are going

2029
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,960
to be equally

2030
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:33,039
susceptible to it so like okay i might

2031
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,720
lose some of my plants

2032
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,799
but i'm not going to lose all of my

2033
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:39,439
plants because they're like slightly

2034
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:42,480
different people you know

2035
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,720
when you do this micropropagation though

2036
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:48,000
since you're targeting on this very

2037
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:50,399
specific expression of the genetics

2038
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
you know these 5000 plantlets that

2039
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,200
become plants they're all going to be

2040
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,519
exactly the same plant and

2041
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:59,038
you know you know i agree with a lot of

2042
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:01,759
folks that like you're like okay

2043
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:02,160
well that might give you a whole bunch

2044
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,319
of

2045
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:07,199
plants that will produce flowers that

2046
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:09,679
will look appropriate in the same bag

2047
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:11,759
because they look the same but it also

2048
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:14,798
makes them susceptible as hell

2049
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:17,039
to all of these pests and

2050
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:18,158
you know i think that that would

2051
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:21,679
decrease

2052
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:24,318
the the defensive posture

2053
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,798
of all these plants making your plant

2054
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,319
your

2055
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:32,000
your field or warehouse more at risk

2056
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:34,480
to everything um how realistic

2057
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,600
is that concern and and how do we weigh

2058
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:37,439
that

2059
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,279
well that's you're talking about

2060
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:41,599
monoculture and this is

2061
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:42,560
this is always the risk of monoculture

2062
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,440
right when you grow

2063
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:48,159
one genotype in an environment the

2064
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:50,399
possibility always exists

2065
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:52,000
that a pest is going to come in and

2066
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:54,399
really love the plant that you're

2067
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
growing on and if that's the case

2068
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,039
they'll run through it like locusts

2069
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,119
right i mean

2070
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:00,640
they literally will spread the whole way

2071
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:02,318
and

2072
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,920
it's kind of one of the negative aspects

2073
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:05,440
that we have in the way that we grow

2074
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,600
cannabis currently

2075
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:09,759
as a monoculture is that we're very

2076
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,159
susceptible to

2077
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,920
invasion of pests or even specific molds

2078
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:15,198
i mean if something shows up

2079
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,279
it's going to run through the entire

2080
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:19,198
population

2081
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,279
and really the only way to combat that

2082
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:23,678
is to plant some level of

2083
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,279
heterogeneity or some level of genetic

2084
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:30,399
diversity

2085
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:31,759
um that it kind of acts as like a shield

2086
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:35,039
or a barrier

2087
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,838
you know to the the mass expansion of

2088
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:38,880
the past right

2089
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,920
if you have a quarter of your production

2090
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:43,440
space

2091
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:45,520
is a plant that spider mites for example

2092
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:46,879
don't find very tasty

2093
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,279
you know they're gonna they're gonna

2094
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,119
stay away from that one plant

2095
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:53,040
or that one genetic type and so you can

2096
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:56,479
actually kind of create barriers through

2097
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:58,960
throughout your room you create a mosaic

2098
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:01,198
of different patches of genetics

2099
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,000
and you kind of set it up in a

2100
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:04,000
randomized way

2101
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,079
that they you know you don't have all

2102
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,800
your blue dream in one area for example

2103
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:08,559
so that

2104
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,239
if it gets contaminated it's going to

2105
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,480
run through them right

2106
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:14,479
all right but yeah this is a my

2107
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,158
follow-up is really freaking specific so

2108
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:17,039
i hope i can get us all the way there so

2109
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:20,879
here

2110
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:24,079
so so you said that we want to

2111
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:26,640
decrease the risk of the monoculture by

2112
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:27,840
creating this mosaic with different

2113
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:31,360
genetics

2114
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:33,119
and so my question is is this mosaic of

2115
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:36,399
different genetics

2116
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:38,479
all cannabis plants so like

2117
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:41,279
you know to use your example plant one

2118
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:41,678
is a blue dream but then plant two would

2119
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,759
be

2120
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:45,679
skittles and then plant three would be

2121
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,199
wedding cake or whatever

2122
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:49,679
and and then and then like when you know

2123
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:53,198
plant five would be blue dream again

2124
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:56,640
so that plants two three and four

2125
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:57,039
have got different genetics and may not

2126
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,320
be

2127
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:03,840
as attractive to whatever the pester

2128
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:07,279
or fungus is that's attacking plant one

2129
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:09,679
now do you mean that or we talk a ton

2130
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:13,039
about polyculture on this show because

2131
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:16,158
i'm a big fan of

2132
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:19,519
you know planting cannabis plants

2133
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:20,799
alongside other plants like comfrey or

2134
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:24,159
whatever

2135
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:28,320
and because those plants might might

2136
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:29,759
attract the pests or repel the pests

2137
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:32,639
because of their terpene profile

2138
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:35,679
depending on the nature of the plants so

2139
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,239
are you saying that that you know the

2140
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,800
better

2141
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:40,559
solution for mono culture as we've been

2142
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,840
talking about it now

2143
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:46,640
is to produce is to plant you know five

2144
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,600
or more different types of cannabis

2145
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,560
plants but

2146
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:52,960
interweave them or are you saying no no

2147
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:56,159
you can actually do a whole field

2148
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:58,239
of one variety of cannabis plant

2149
01:11:56,158 --> 01:11:59,759
but then we want to solve it with all

2150
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:02,799
these different

2151
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:05,039
um species of plants

2152
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:08,159
you can do it both ways i think for the

2153
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:10,238
context of this discussion i mean

2154
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:12,158
it's more about planting different types

2155
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:13,759
of cannabis i wouldn't intersperse them

2156
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:15,039
plant by plant that's just not an

2157
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,520
efficient way

2158
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,880
to either plant or grow or track you

2159
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,480
know through production

2160
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:26,079
you might do blocks of say you know

2161
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:29,359
whatever 20 by 20 or 100 by 100

2162
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:32,640
um of one genetic type and then you you

2163
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:36,880
you rotate your blocks

2164
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:40,400
right um in in a completely

2165
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:41,279
integrated system i think that we're

2166
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:44,079
going to start to see

2167
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:45,679
more farms more small farms that aren't

2168
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:49,840
just growing cannabis that they're

2169
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:51,279
adding cannabis as a value-added product

2170
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,800
to their production of what they can

2171
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:53,439
grow on their farm i mean they'll grow

2172
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,840
their

2173
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:57,279
blueberries and their garlic or whatever

2174
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,719
flowers they're going to grow and then

2175
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:00,639
like a little bit of cannabis that helps

2176
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,480
with the bills

2177
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:05,840
and i see that the future of cannabis

2178
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:05,839
being really integrated into

2179
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:11,599
more of a holistic system of a holistic

2180
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,600
production system

2181
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:16,319
one step less advanced though is even in

2182
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,000
a cannabis grow

2183
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:20,399
is if you're say you're growing five

2184
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,238
varieties that you don't just have one

2185
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:23,119
big block of each of those five

2186
01:13:22,238 --> 01:13:25,759
varieties

2187
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:29,119
that you have many blocks of those

2188
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:32,000
different varieties interspersed

2189
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,840
yeah you know that idea of growing your

2190
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,800
blueberries or whatever

2191
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:39,039
and then cannabis around it was what i

2192
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,800
really thought we were signing up for

2193
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,960
when we started going down this

2194
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,800
legalization path in my head

2195
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,000
cannabis was going to save the family

2196
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,560
farm you know

2197
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,719
because you could take the the sales

2198
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,520
pressure off of the vegetables or the

2199
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,439
fruit

2200
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,000
that has to be harvested at a very

2201
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:57,599
specific time and brought to market

2202
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,679
there's so much pressure on the family

2203
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:03,280
farm for these these you know

2204
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:06,079
smaller margin plants for food

2205
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:06,800
i love the idea of like oh you do a row

2206
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:08,880
of your

2207
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,800
your fruit tree and then a row of your

2208
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,480
cannabis plant right and then

2209
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,159
the cannabis plant can make sure that

2210
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:14,959
the mortgage is paid and then you can

2211
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:18,079
make a you know

2212
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:19,760
a good profit but at a lower margin off

2213
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:22,880
of whatever your food plan

2214
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:25,920
is and we save the family farm but

2215
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:27,679
you know unfortunately like no states

2216
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,039
are are encouraging that with their

2217
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:30,800
regulations and

2218
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:32,960
i think that it's i think it's a

2219
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,480
disappointment yeah we're allowing it a

2220
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,520
little bit up here in canada and i've

2221
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:37,919
seen a few

2222
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,880
um smaller farms try to integrate

2223
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,560
cannabis

2224
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,000
unfortunately they don't do it in a

2225
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,880
professional enough way like you

2226
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,319
really you you know growers know what

2227
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,840
they're doing at this point in time but

2228
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:49,759
i think that like

2229
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,920
as an industry we're still in the very

2230
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,119
nascent you know we're in the nascent

2231
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,800
stage where

2232
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:56,319
you know we're trying out big large

2233
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,920
public companies and they're not really

2234
01:14:56,319 --> 01:14:59,519
working out because they just produce a

2235
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,119
bunch of garbage

2236
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,560
it's hard to quote to maintain that

2237
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:05,439
level of quality

2238
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:07,679
when you scale it right and i think that

2239
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:10,799
there is going to be a sweet spot

2240
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:12,960
but you the smaller family farms

2241
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,640
also need to learn how to integrate that

2242
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,480
information in

2243
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,000
um and it's actually something that you

2244
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:19,198
know oregon and

2245
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,960
southern washington even northern

2246
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:23,119
california there's there's some people

2247
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:26,480
that are really doing it right

2248
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:28,238
um but i think that it's going to be a

2249
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:29,279
learned experience that that people need

2250
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:31,839
to learn how to

2251
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:31,840
integrate

2252
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,600
a good amount of candida not a small

2253
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:38,399
amount i'm not talking like a small

2254
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,880
amount but a reasonable amount

2255
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:41,599
of cannabis that they can grow they can

2256
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,480
maintain

2257
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:46,239
the level of care and attention that is

2258
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:49,439
required to produce

2259
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:50,158
a crop of that level of quality because

2260
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:52,079
again you can't

2261
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:54,158
in today's market you can't just produce

2262
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:56,079
a bunch of average bud

2263
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:57,519
and expect to get a decent paycheck for

2264
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:59,519
it on the market i mean there's just way

2265
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,560
too many people growing cannabis

2266
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,920
and the stuff that gets turned into thc

2267
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,360
distillate

2268
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,119
you know it doesn't really matter what

2269
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:08,880
it looks like because again you're just

2270
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:09,599
going in for that one compound it's kind

2271
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,920
of like

2272
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,120
you know farming for high fructose corn

2273
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,679
sugar right

2274
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:16,640
um but i think that we all recognize

2275
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,239
that

2276
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,920
the people that really consume cannabis

2277
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:21,039
and are passionate about cannabis those

2278
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,000
aren't the products that they want to

2279
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:23,679
consume

2280
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,760
right they want to consume either really

2281
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,760
high quality flowers or extracts made

2282
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,079
from really high quality flowers

2283
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,440
yeah the only the only time i've ever

2284
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:34,238
seen

2285
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:37,119
the inter planting of real food crops

2286
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:39,119
and real high quality cannabis

2287
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:41,039
in the way the kind of ideal way that

2288
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:43,519
you're talking about is when i visited

2289
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:44,800
happy day farms casey and amber down in

2290
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,199
mendocino

2291
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,079
they actually do that but it takes so

2292
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:50,479
much work

2293
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:51,840
and they've only got a few acres of it

2294
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:53,198
but um

2295
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,960
you know i know that they're a small

2296
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:55,839
craft farm and they're they're probably

2297
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,960
not interested

2298
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:01,760
in scaling up to you know you know

2299
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:03,600
mega acreage levels but but that's what

2300
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,000
i would like to see you know like where

2301
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,840
you have

2302
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,560
acres of of beautiful cannabis plants

2303
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:12,000
alongside

2304
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:15,360
beautiful food and we can feed everybody

2305
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:18,399
and get stoned at the same time while

2306
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:20,559
resisting pests and viruses but

2307
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:22,319
i don't i don't think we're there yet

2308
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,760
well and i don't think the small farmers

2309
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:25,679
are there yet i mean

2310
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,360
running a farm even a couple acres of

2311
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,000
any crop it's it's there's a lot of work

2312
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:29,839
there

2313
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,359
and some crops are more forgiving than

2314
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,880
others but i don't think that cannabis

2315
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:34,719
is very forgiving in terms of

2316
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,079
it's like you said earlier like when it

2317
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,119
needs to be harvested it needs to be

2318
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:38,479
harvested

2319
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:40,559
you know you can't just put it off a

2320
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:42,000
week or cut it a week earlier and expect

2321
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,600
that it's going to maintain that same

2322
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,960
level of quality

2323
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,440
right yeah so yeah it's it's hard to

2324
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,319
juggle

2325
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:51,839
those acre-sized balls in the air and

2326
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:54,000
keep everything humming

2327
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,600
you know yeah for sure all right so

2328
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,039
we're gonna go to commercial but stay

2329
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,840
with us when we come back we're

2330
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:01,679
to start talking about the other aspects

2331
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:04,159
of tissue culture we've already covered

2332
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:06,319
micro propagation very seriously

2333
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:08,319
but there you know there are a good five

2334
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:09,920

as a business owner you are incredibly

2369
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,560
busy in reality you are responsible for

2370
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:20,399
everything your company does

2371
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,159
you've got so many responsibilities

2372
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:23,359
every single day that often you just

2373
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:25,439
don't have the time to really

2374
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,479
dig into your marketing as deeply as

2375
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:27,599
you'd like

2376
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:29,279
you know there's more that you could do

2377
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,760
to reach out to new customers and

2378
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,198
encourage

2379
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,880
loyalty and the customers you already

2380
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:34,639
have but you certainly don't have the

2381
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,079
time for it and you're not ready to hire

2382
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,800
somebody full time for that role

2383
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:39,679

bottom line

2388
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,760
you know most marketing firms are

2389
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:50,158
excited to make your logo

2390
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,239
packaging and website very pretty but

2391
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:54,158
they leave responsibility for improving

2392
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:55,198
your bottom line up to you

2393
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:57,119
they don't want that kind of

2394
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:59,039
responsibility but that's pretty much

2395
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:00,079
the most important part of marketing

2396
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:01,519
right

2397
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:03,760

point of sale whether it be online or a

2400
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,079
storefront

2401
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:09,599
and keep them coming back to you and

2402
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:11,439
telling their friends

2403
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,440
now if you happen to be a new cannabis

2404
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:15,759
company or an established company moving

2405

2406

kirsten especially can help you not only

2407
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:21,198

2408
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:23,039
finance but she

2409
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:25,519
totally gets cannabis whole plant

2410
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:28,238
medicine terpenes heritage farmers

2411
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:30,080
and the particular needs of startups

2412
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:32,079
check out what she did recently for moon

2413
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:35,039

2414
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:36,800
moon time medicinals.com kirsten and her

2415
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:37,359
team put together a whole brand package

2416
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,800
for them

2417
01:20:37,359 --> 01:20:41,198
built their website and wrote their

2418
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,719
sales materials no doubt this is a paid

2419
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:44,079
commercial spot but that does not mean

2420
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:46,000
they bought my opinion

2421
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:47,519
i've worked with blunt branding on five

2422
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,319
projects now for various of their

2423
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,920
clients and

2424
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:51,279
every single time they have done more

2425
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,719
than they have promised and over

2426
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:54,800
delivered on results

2427
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:56,639
i love how they generate new revenue and

2428
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,800
focus on that as the goal instead of

2429
01:20:56,639 --> 01:21:00,639
just making a pretty logo

2430
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,320
similarly every single friend i've

2431
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:02,639
referred them to has come back to thank

2432
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:04,799
me

2433
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:06,560
and that just does not happen every day

2434
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,840
grab a pen and paper because the website

2435

01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:09,119
multiplying plants

2502
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:11,439
but sometimes before a plant can be

2503
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:14,559
multiplied it needs to be cleaned

2504
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:15,759
up we've talked earlier about removing

2505
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,520
these viruses

2506
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,520
and bacteria and different things that

2507
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,000
might be in it that kind of weighs down

2508
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,840
the plant

2509
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,439
over the years but we haven't really

2510
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,639
talked about a lot about

2511
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:29,039
um how that's done so so ryan at what

2512
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,600
point in the process would we put the

2513
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:32,639
target

2514
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:37,039
plant through a pcr test

2515
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:38,159
to see how contaminated it might be

2516
01:23:37,039 --> 01:23:40,158
well really it's something that we

2517
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:42,399
probably want to do repeatedly and

2518
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:44,638
over you know at different points

2519
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:47,279
throughout the tissue culture process

2520
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:48,000
and that's really how we we go about

2521
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:49,840
certifying

2522
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,198
something that's pest fungus or virus

2523
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,719
free right we

2524
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:56,719
we test them we prove that there's no um

2525
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:58,639
that these organisms aren't in the plant

2526
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:01,039
and and and that's how we certify them

2527
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:04,400
just to clarify how pcr does that

2528
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:07,760
pcr is a technique for multiplying

2529
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:08,399
specific genetic markers um and so for

2530
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,320
example

2531
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:12,799
you know powdery mildew has a genetic

2532
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:14,880
sequence that's unique to powdery mildew

2533
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,239
and so do spider mites and every virus

2534
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,279
you know covid we all know that the

2535
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:19,279
covet

2536
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:20,800
these covid uh plants can be uh

2537
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:22,880
identified through

2538
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,719
specific genetic sequencing so we can we

2539
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,880
can kind of do the same thing with like

2540
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:28,800
the hops latent viroid or any of these

2541
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:31,359
other viruses that are affecting

2542
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:33,039
cannabis we can look first we can look

2543
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:36,799
and try to amplify

2544
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:38,960
these specific genes from those species

2545
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,920
and if we don't show if those if those

2546
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:42,158
pieces of dna

2547
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,520
aren't amplified we can't multiply them

2548
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:46,479
then we can say that those

2549
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,920
organisms are absent from the you know

2550
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:50,158
from the population

2551
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,920
so it's like turning up the volume of a

2552
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:53,119
song so that you can hear the

2553
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,279
instrumentation

2554
01:24:53,119 --> 01:24:57,439
but you turn it up and you're like yep i

2555
01:24:55,279 --> 01:24:58,000
really don't hear a triangle in that and

2556
01:24:57,439 --> 01:24:59,599
then

2557
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
and so then you can certify it's

2558
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,719
triangle free yeah it's a great analogy

2559
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,399
in fact because

2560
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:06,560
you know those those things are just a

2561
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:08,719
genetic single and that's what pcr does

2562
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:11,039
is it amplifies that genetic signal

2563
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:12,079
and so if the signal is free if we're

2564
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:13,760
free from the signal

2565
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:15,519
then we're also free from the organism

2566
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,239
that creates the signal all right

2567
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,280
so so after we've put this these plants

2568
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:21,919
into

2569
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:23,679
the pcr and we've turned up the volume

2570
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,319
so that we can hear all these different

2571
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:27,600
signals

2572
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:29,920
very clearly and and we go like oh

2573
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,199
we hear the signal for i don't know

2574
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:34,079
powdery mildew

2575
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:35,359
um how do you go into the plant and

2576
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:38,479
separate

2577
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:38,479
these these

2578
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:44,399
these pollutants out well let's

2579
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,920
i'm not exactly sure how you would deal

2580
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:47,759
with powdery mildew you'd probably have

2581
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,719
to use a chemical that suppresses

2582
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,719
powdery mildew

2583
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:52,800
but let's what's a better example then

2584
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:56,158
let's let's use a virus

2585
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,600
um and so you know like the hops latent

2586
01:25:56,158 --> 01:25:59,359
virus for example

2587
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,280
you know when when when humans get

2588
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:02,479
infected by a virus one of the things

2589
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:05,198
that happens

2590
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:07,439
is we get a fever right and the reason

2591
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:10,238
that your body has learned to give it to

2592
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:11,359
to raise your core temperature is that

2593
01:26:10,238 --> 01:26:13,039
viruses or

2594
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:14,799
at least subset of viruses don't

2595
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:16,560
actually do very well

2596
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,920
um they don't replicate well they're not

2597
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:20,480
very happy

2598
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:22,399
when the temperature is higher than you

2599
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:25,519
know 37 degrees celsius or whatever

2600
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:29,198
the ideal human temperature is right um

2601
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:30,800
so your body ramps up the temperature

2602
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:32,559
terms of the thermostat

2603
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,560
you get really hot and sweaty and you

2604
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:37,280
know you maybe develop a fever

2605
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:38,560
but it's actually giving your bodies um

2606
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:39,679
just creating your body's creating a

2607
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:43,600
system where

2608
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:44,960
your immune system is going to be uh

2609
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,480
tougher than the virus that it's

2610
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:48,079
fighting at that point in time and it'll

2611
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:48,799
it gives it a chance to kind of take

2612
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:52,000
over

2613
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:55,360
so if we apply that same logic to

2614
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,359
um to plants

2615
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:59,119
imagine as a plant cell is growing

2616
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,280
you've got the meristem and so the

2617
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:03,599
meristems producing new cells

2618
01:27:01,279 --> 01:27:05,039
that new cell is initially born without

2619
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:07,920
any viruses in it

2620
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:08,719
and then the virus moves in afterwards

2621
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,880
okay

2622
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:12,079
and so if you can actually grow a plant

2623
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:15,199
in a raised

2624
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:18,158
temperature condition as new cells are

2625
01:27:15,198 --> 01:27:20,479
created if the temperature is high the

2626
01:27:18,158 --> 01:27:21,359
virus can't actually infect those cells

2627
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:23,599
because it's

2628
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:25,679
at a disadvantage because the enviro the

2629
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:28,400
the environmental temperature is high

2630
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:30,079
and so you might have a little section

2631
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:32,079
of the plant where the whole tip of the

2632
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:33,600
plant becomes virus free

2633
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:35,279
because it's growing in a high

2634
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,440
temperature environment and the

2635
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:39,519
viruses aren't able to take over and so

2636
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:42,879
if you were able to go in at that point

2637
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:46,239
and cut out the new healthy unvir

2638
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:48,800
the cells that hadn't been infected via

2639
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:50,238
by a virus and you subculture them and

2640
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,159
plant them on their own

2641
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:53,839
you know their own agar plate grow them

2642
01:27:52,158 --> 01:27:56,879
for two to three weeks

2643
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,400
again monitor them with a pcr test to

2644
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,679
see if the virus is there

2645
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:01,920
and if it is you just go through the

2646
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:03,520
process again but after a series of

2647
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:05,920
subcultures

2648
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,120
theoretically you're able to get a group

2649
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:10,480
of cells

2650
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:13,119
that are true to the plant type

2651
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:14,238
but free from virus infection and if

2652
01:28:13,119 --> 01:28:16,800
that plant

2653
01:28:14,238 --> 01:28:18,799
the plant that grows from those cells

2654
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,719
then becomes your new starting line

2655
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,639
you've now actually removed the viruses

2656
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:24,880
from your plant line

2657
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,239
i had it all wrong man i like i wasn't

2658
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:29,840
even close i was

2659
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:32,638
like i i can see how

2660
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:34,639
novice or amateur my picture was but i

2661
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:37,199
was literally picturing the lab

2662
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:39,760
scientists there with a scalpel

2663
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:40,319
cutting around the virus you know so

2664
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,639
that

2665
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:43,439
it's not in the cutting but in a way

2666
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:44,880
they're doing that

2667
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:46,879
but it's just that you're using the

2668
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,840
temperature to create the barrier for

2669
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,440
the virus

2670
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,960
right another way to do it you might i

2671
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:52,879
mean if it was a bacteria

2672
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:54,719
you might put like antibiotics on the

2673
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:57,520
growth medium for example

2674
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:59,679
right so you're creating a chemical

2675
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,719
situation in the in the medium and thus

2676
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:02,960
in the plant

2677
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,560
where the bacteria can't grow right and

2678
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:07,439
then you go and you do the same thing

2679
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,400
right so so so after you run it through

2680
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:10,079
the pcr

2681
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:11,439
and you you've turned up the volume and

2682
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:12,639
you can see all the crap that your

2683
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:16,079
plants got

2684
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:17,679
then you create a strategy for like okay

2685
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:19,600
what are the different steps we're going

2686
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:23,960
to do to this plant

2687
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:25,679
to allow new growth to be uh

2688
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:28,239
contaminant-free so

2689
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:30,079
maybe you know you know you have to turn

2690
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:32,158
up the heat for a while to get rid of a

2691
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:34,960
virus and then maybe you need to

2692
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:36,879
douse it with some kind of you know

2693
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:38,399
organic chemical to get rid of something

2694
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,880
else and like maybe maybe it's a three

2695
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:44,879
or four step process but in the end

2696
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:46,960
you are getting new growth that is

2697
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,400
free of these contaminants that's

2698
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,158
exactly it

2699
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:51,519
yeah and then and that's you know what a

2700
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:53,279
pain in the ass

2701
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,040
it really is but i mean hot blatant

2702
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:56,800
virus is also a pain in the ass

2703
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:58,399
right i mean it completely devastates

2704
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:01,360
your production space

2705
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:02,638
so um or broad mites or anything any of

2706
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:03,679
these types of pests that you can go

2707
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,960
through so

2708
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:07,199
you can think about it we can get down

2709
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,000
to this very small little world inside a

2710
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:09,759
jar

2711
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,158
where we add maybe just a very little

2712
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:15,119
bit of pesticide or fungicide

2713
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:15,920
um and and those cells then grow out of

2714
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:17,599
that

2715
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,158
but it's a lot different than having

2716
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,920
taken a whole big tall plant and

2717
01:30:20,158 --> 01:30:23,198
soaked it down with you know five liters

2718
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,880
of pesticide

2719
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:26,559
right i mean yeah and have to get that

2720
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:28,159
whole plant clean when you're only

2721
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,440
trying to get a little cutting to put in

2722
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:31,439
your petri dish

2723
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:32,879
exactly right and there's less

2724
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:33,359
environmental damage because again

2725
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,119
you've

2726
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:36,799
you've released like maybe two three

2727
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:37,760
microliters worth of pesticide as

2728
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,920
opposed to

2729
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:42,079
you know 500 milliliters all right so

2730
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,840
earlier i thought you misspoke when you

2731
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:45,198
said that we're you're talking about the

2732
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,760
things that we were going to

2733
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:49,119
you know remove from the plant like we

2734
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:51,119
talked about the virus

2735
01:30:49,119 --> 01:30:53,519
earlier said spider mites and now you

2736
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:56,960
just said i think you said russets but

2737
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:59,280
um like i thought that the these

2738
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:01,760
these pests are coming from the outside

2739
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:03,599
of the plant the plant attracts them

2740
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:05,039
are you telling me that there are things

2741
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,840
within the plant

2742
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:09,760
that is making them either attract or

2743
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,960
more susceptible to these pla these

2744
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:14,159
pests

2745
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:16,239
yeah so typically insects

2746
01:31:14,158 --> 01:31:17,839
should be removed during surface

2747
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:20,158
sterilization

2748
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:22,000
um and so that's really like the when we

2749
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:23,679
go through that sterilization part where

2750
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,920
before we put the plant into the jar for

2751
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:27,760
the first time you know we might cut it

2752
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,600
cut out a little stem section and you

2753
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,960
know we use like bleach it's like you'll

2754
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,880
create like a 10 15

2755
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,880
bleach solution and just shake your

2756
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,600
little plant parts in the bleach for 15

2757
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:38,239
minutes

2758
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:39,920
well it's like really hard on the plant

2759
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:40,799
material right i mean when you when you

2760
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,399
take it out

2761
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,600
there's all this dead plant material

2762
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:44,719
that you actually have to cut away

2763
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,880
before you

2764
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:48,319
um you section out the part of the plant

2765
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,079
that you want to try to live but that's

2766
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:51,759
what we're doing is we're really

2767
01:31:50,079 --> 01:31:53,119
and they use all sorts of nasty stuff i

2768
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:55,840
mean they use like

2769
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:58,319
you know mercury compounds and all sorts

2770
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:02,000
of little different poisons

2771
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:03,198
to do that initial sterilization process

2772
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,039
and that's kind of one of the reasons

2773
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:06,399
you don't want to keep reinitializing

2774
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:08,158
plants right it's because

2775
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:10,479
you're always introducing them into into

2776
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:13,439
this chemical ideally they go through

2777
01:32:10,479 --> 01:32:15,678
a short chemical insult and then what

2778
01:32:13,439 --> 01:32:18,559
comes out from that

2779
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:19,840
is your starter culture material right

2780
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,360
so you could find yourself in a

2781
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:23,520
situation that a plant's got

2782
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:25,359
so much pollutant in it where you're

2783
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,000
like man i don't know if it's gonna be

2784
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:28,960
able to live

2785
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,880
through like four or five of these

2786
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:33,359
treatments to get rid of all the crap

2787
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:34,239
and like i i guess that's where the

2788
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:37,679
artisan

2789
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:39,919
and expert level comes on where you can

2790
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:41,840
where you can expose a plant to these

2791
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:44,560
various things and actually

2792
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:46,480
have it like living on the far side yeah

2793
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,520
you have to have a strategy to it like

2794
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:49,599
again you know

2795
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,639
if a plant's really weak and like really

2796
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,079
hurting it's almost

2797
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:54,239
dead that's probably not a great

2798
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:56,158
candidate plant for tissue culture

2799
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:57,919
but you know there are certain forms of

2800
01:32:56,158 --> 01:33:00,158
tissue culture where you can do

2801
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,639
essentially what's like you know what's

2802
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:05,679
called rescue and you you can

2803
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:06,400
you know by shedding the plant the the

2804
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:08,000
tips

2805
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:09,759
shoots of those plant from the rest of

2806
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,439
the collet carcass

2807
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,960
right the infected parts of the plant

2808
01:33:11,439 --> 01:33:14,960
you're actually freeing it from that

2809
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,880
disease

2810
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,239
but yeah it's a targeted approach and it

2811
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:21,199
has to be done

2812
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:22,959
with care and attention so i i know that

2813
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:24,000
with all the variabilities this next

2814
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:27,359
question isn't really

2815
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:30,719
fair but i want to talk about cost um

2816
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:34,000
so this all sounds incredibly expensive

2817
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:36,158
um let's say that that you you know

2818
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,920
say that i don't know what's typical but

2819
01:33:36,158 --> 01:33:39,679
but i'm just gonna assume for a second

2820
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:41,440
that a plant you need to clean up before

2821
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:43,279
you can micro propagate it

2822
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:44,879
is gonna have like yo let's say that

2823
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:46,960
there's a virus and

2824
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,719
a fungus in there somewhere and you're

2825
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,560
like okay we need to clean you know we

2826
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:53,198
found these in the pcr we need to clean

2827
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:55,920
these up so that we get a nice clean cut

2828
01:33:53,198 --> 01:33:57,519
so that we can micro propagate it so to

2829
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,920
take us from the

2830
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,880
the the pcr analysis through the

2831
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,760
cleaning it up

2832
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,960
so that we have our one set of mother

2833
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,840
platelets

2834
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:09,520
that were then going to micro propagate

2835
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,960
like can you just give me a ballpark

2836
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:13,280
figure about what it's going to cost to

2837
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:14,719
get us through the cleanup stage

2838
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:16,960
yeah i don't know what it would actually

2839
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:18,800
cost in terms of reagent materials to do

2840
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:21,119
it yourself but i know that

2841
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:22,880
um there's companies both in canada the

2842
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:25,599
united states that will

2843
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:27,119
that will do this for you now and i've

2844
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:29,120
heard quotes from anywhere of five

2845
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:31,599
thousand to twenty five thousand dollars

2846
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:33,279
per per genotype so you know if you have

2847
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,360
a cutting of blue dream and a

2848
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:36,800
cutting of cookies that you want to have

2849
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:38,719
this process done to it's

2850
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,079
you know minimum 10 grand kind of thing

2851
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:42,800
for both right

2852
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:44,399
cool idea yeah and it can go up from

2853
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,719
there you know i mean like again if

2854
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:46,479
you're

2855
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:48,639
if these people are offering services to

2856
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:51,919
these public trading companies it's

2857
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:54,480
going to be closer to 25 right

2858
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:57,359
yeah i get you um all right cool well

2859
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:58,879
then let's let's bring this episode home

2860
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:01,118
you know we've spent the most of the

2861
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:01,840
show talking about micropropagation

2862
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:05,679
because

2863
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:06,880
that is what 90 of the cannabis industry

2864
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:10,399
is doing

2865
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:11,199
under this this umbrella of tissue

2866
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:13,439
culture

2867
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:14,399
but we know that there's other cool

2868
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:16,879
stuff

2869
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:17,920
that is under this tissue culture

2870
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,960
umbrella

2871
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:22,239
that's only being dabbled in in cannabis

2872
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:25,760
right now

2873
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:28,559
even though it is incredibly common

2874
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,600
with like food and ornamental crops so

2875
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,600
um

2876
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,119
you know you had mentioned in our in you

2877
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:35,679
know in a previous answer

2878
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:38,079
the issue of total potency the the idea

2879
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:40,000
that plants have stem cells

2880
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:41,439
and these stem cells can become any

2881
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,359
other part of the plant

2882
01:35:41,439 --> 01:35:44,479
using this knowledge there are a few

2883
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:46,559
other more rare

2884
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:48,959
tissue culture applications that we're

2885
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:50,800
not going to go into deeply in this show

2886
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,239
but you know any anybody who's still

2887
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:54,719
listening right

2888
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:55,439
it probably actually cares about this

2889
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:58,800
right

2890
01:35:55,439 --> 01:36:02,158
so would you go into um

2891
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:03,119
a few of these different applications

2892
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:06,479
that fall

2893
01:36:03,118 --> 01:36:08,719
under the tissue culture umbrella so

2894
01:36:06,479 --> 01:36:10,000
that like when we end the show people

2895
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:13,039
are like okay

2896
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,319
i understand the micro propagation that

2897
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:17,760
makes up 90

2898
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:20,719
of tissue culture but i also understand

2899
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,119
kind of topically or tangentially these

2900
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:23,118
other

2901
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:25,839
areas that are also under the tissue

2902
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:27,439
culture umbrella

2903
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,960
yeah well there's some really neat stuff

2904
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:29,439
i mean kiss your culture is just a great

2905
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,279
way to

2906
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:32,479
to kind of ship plants around the world

2907
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:35,599
and store them

2908
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:36,479
you know for long term we have what we

2909
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:38,639
call ex-situ

2910
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:40,638
storage of germplasm so you know they

2911
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:41,600
might go into a forest and find a very

2912
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:43,760
rare

2913
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,360
plant and then you can take a cutting of

2914
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,239
that plant and bring it back and keep it

2915
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:49,279
alive

2916
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:50,799
uh under tissue culture um i bet you

2917
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:52,000
that i bet you people are smuggling

2918
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:55,360
plants that way too

2919
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,800
absolutely well we'll get to that one

2920
01:36:55,359 --> 01:36:57,839
but i think the first really cool one

2921
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,440
that i think that we're going to start

2922
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:01,840
seeing more of is something called a

2923
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:04,000
process called cryopreservation

2924
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:05,679
and so cryopreservation is exactly what

2925
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,679
it sounds like it's like

2926
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:09,199
you know on the what's it futurama they

2927
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:11,199
had the frozen heads right

2928
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:13,118
yeah yeah it's that same kind of thing

2929
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:14,238
like you can take like a very small

2930
01:37:13,118 --> 01:37:16,158
shoot tip

2931
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:17,919
and you can subject it to a freezing

2932
01:37:16,158 --> 01:37:18,799
process again you load the plant up with

2933
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,880
sugar and

2934
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:22,079
these anti-osmotic if you've if you've

2935
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:25,679
ever seen

2936
01:37:22,079 --> 01:37:26,719
ice form under under a um a microscope

2937
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:28,560
for example

2938
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:29,760
you see it start what starts off as a

2939
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,880
clear liquid and then you get these

2940
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:34,239
crystals growing

2941
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:36,079
in the in the liquid as it turns to ice

2942
01:37:34,238 --> 01:37:39,359
and if you imagine that process

2943
01:37:36,079 --> 01:37:39,359
happening in a cell

2944
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:44,480
those ice crystals will actually grow

2945
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,520
and they'll pierce right through the

2946
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:47,359
cell wall

2947
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:49,199
okay so as soon as you stab the cell

2948
01:37:47,359 --> 01:37:51,439
wall with like an ice crystal or

2949
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:52,879
a needle or whatever the cell's done

2950
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:54,319
right like it's going to leak all of its

2951
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,880
contents out and it just it's

2952
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:57,840
it just can't take that kind of insult

2953
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:00,239
but

2954
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:01,199
if you do it properly you can actually

2955
01:38:00,238 --> 01:38:02,718
get

2956
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:06,158
you can you can do something called

2957
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:09,359
vitrification whereas

2958
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:12,479
think of it like the life in that still

2959
01:38:09,359 --> 01:38:16,000
that cell going from an animated alive

2960
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:20,000
state to completely frozen

2961
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:22,719
into a glass-like state immediately

2962
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,198
and when it just happens faster it

2963
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:25,760
happens

2964
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:27,118
incredibly fast and it happens through a

2965
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:30,239
very specific process of

2966
01:38:27,118 --> 01:38:31,519
dropping the temperature um in a very

2967
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:34,718
specific and quick way

2968
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:37,280
and if you can actually get that um that

2969
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:38,880
vitrification to happen

2970
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:40,479
think of it like trying to walk through

2971
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,400
the mud okay

2972
01:38:40,479 --> 01:38:44,079
or walk through cement you got like

2973
01:38:42,399 --> 01:38:46,000
rubber boots on up to your knees

2974
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:47,920
and you're trying to walk through like

2975
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,639
some freshly laid cement like it gets

2976
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:52,560
stuck right and if if you got stuck in

2977
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:54,560
there and you really tried to like

2978
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,639
really force moving your leg like you

2979
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:59,600
might actually break your leg

2980
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:00,800
right um whereas if you were frozen

2981
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,159
solid

2982
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,840
you're not gonna break anything because

2983
01:39:02,158 --> 01:39:06,000
you're not moving

2984
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:07,679
right so if you can actually get a cell

2985
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,158
or a group of cells

2986
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:10,880
to undergo this vitrification process

2987
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:14,559
from

2988
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:17,840
essentially live to completely frozen

2989
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:20,880
like in a split second that

2990
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:22,560
you that's called vitrification and it

2991
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,520
turns out that if you can actually

2992
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:27,199
freeze life

2993
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:30,159
till at that speed and size we can then

2994
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:31,118
store whatever biological materials you

2995
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:35,679
have

2996
01:39:31,118 --> 01:39:37,439
at like you know minus 120 degrees

2997
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:38,880
they do it in like a liquid nitrogen

2998
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:41,279
they have these special

2999
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:42,079
containers that hold liquid nitrogen and

3000
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:44,238
say the bottom

3001
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:46,079
third is filled up with liquid nitrogen

3002
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:48,158
and the top third is the gas that's

3003
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:50,238
coming off that liquid nitrogen which is

3004
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:51,198
still very very cold it's not as cold as

3005
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:53,519
the liquid

3006
01:39:51,198 --> 01:39:55,039
but that gaseous phase that fills up the

3007
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,639
top part of the container

3008
01:39:55,039 --> 01:39:59,359
is cold enough where you can actually

3009
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:02,079
store biological samples for

3010
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:03,279
you know an extended period of time say

3011
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:04,719
indefinitely

3012
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:06,559
right and as long as the temperature

3013
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:09,039
doesn't change those

3014
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,920
those biological samples are safe you

3015
01:40:09,039 --> 01:40:13,039
can then

3016
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:15,760
take those things and reanimate them

3017
01:40:13,039 --> 01:40:16,319
and grow plantlets from those shoot tips

3018
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,039
that you've

3019
01:40:16,319 --> 01:40:20,079
you've frozen under cryo preservation

3020
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,399
and so

3021
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:24,238
um it's a difficult process it's we've

3022
01:40:22,399 --> 01:40:27,359
only just figured out how to do it with

3023
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:29,118
cannabis um but it's it's been typically

3024
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:32,799
done in other species you know

3025
01:40:29,118 --> 01:40:34,238
uh pine trees and all sorts of trees

3026
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:37,279
that they use for forestry

3027
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:38,799
and hops there's a place in oregon

3028
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:40,559
hops research center is doing all this

3029
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:42,960
kind of stuff with hops as well

3030
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:44,560
um but you can imagine i mean anybody

3031
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,960
that's a grower and collects

3032
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:48,719
you know special plants from all over

3033
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,480
you know you you learn pretty quickly

3034
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:52,079
that it's like you know keeping 50

3035
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:53,678
different genetic types

3036
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:55,359
and having to like grow them and take

3037
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:57,118
cuttings and cycle them like

3038
01:40:55,359 --> 01:40:58,960
that's a real process and it takes a lot

3039
01:40:57,118 --> 01:41:00,880
of time and energy and resources

3040
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:04,079
if you could just submit those things to

3041
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,520
a frozen gene bag

3042
01:41:04,079 --> 01:41:07,279
knowing that you could then go and pull

3043
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:08,080
those plants out of crowd preservation

3044
01:41:07,279 --> 01:41:09,359
and yeah that

3045
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:11,439
process to pull them out of cryo

3046
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:13,198
preservation it takes like six months

3047
01:41:11,439 --> 01:41:14,879
right until you're you've got a cutting

3048
01:41:13,198 --> 01:41:18,158
back in your hand

3049
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:20,159
but if you think of like

3050
01:41:18,158 --> 01:41:22,399
the space saving and the time saving and

3051
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:24,079
the the the resource saving that happens

3052
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:25,279
if you can cry preserve these plants i

3053
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:25,920
mean it's pretty it's something pretty

3054
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:28,479
special

3055
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:31,199
yeah just keeping a regular mother

3056
01:41:28,479 --> 01:41:32,879
library is a big difficulty i mean my

3057
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:33,599
god i can't imagine if you were trying

3058
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:36,000
to

3059
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,840
you know take a snapshot of all the hype

3060
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,359
strains right now and like we're going

3061
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:42,000
to preserve them all for the future

3062
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:43,519
it's like oh my god yeah but you could

3063
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,479
preserve them all in a

3064
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:46,960
you know in like a small 50 pound doer

3065
01:41:46,479 --> 01:41:49,519
right like

3066
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,880
a small like a it's about the size of a

3067
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,880
propane barbecue tank

3068
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:55,039
right that you could probably store oh

3069
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,960
wow two or three hundred cell lines in

3070
01:41:55,039 --> 01:41:58,960
there like no problem

3071
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:00,000
um so that's that's pretty attractive

3072
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,079
and as a breeder

3073
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,600
you know if you're doing selections it's

3074
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:04,800
also a very attractive thing to be able

3075
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,280
to do that

3076
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,239
um the next step i think the next one i

3077
01:42:07,279 --> 01:42:10,238
think i'll mention is something a

3078
01:42:08,238 --> 01:42:12,479
concept called artificial seeds

3079
01:42:10,238 --> 01:42:14,319
and that's really like a very small

3080
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:16,158
shoot tip call it like

3081
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:17,759
you know three or four eighths of an

3082
01:42:16,158 --> 01:42:20,879
inch

3083
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:23,039
uh maybe half half an inch and

3084
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:24,719
that gets embedded into a little jelly

3085
01:42:23,039 --> 01:42:26,960
matrix

3086
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:28,480
and hardened in a solution of calcium

3087
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:31,118
carbonate and it's like

3088
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:31,678
a little mini tissue culture shoot in a

3089
01:42:31,118 --> 01:42:33,439
seed

3090
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:36,239
like you know it doesn't look like a

3091
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:38,079
seed it looks more like a jelly bean

3092
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:39,599
but those artificial seeds again can

3093
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:41,359
generate a full plant and

3094
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:43,280
you can think about how easy it would be

3095
01:42:41,359 --> 01:42:44,880
to ship a small piece of plant material

3096
01:42:43,279 --> 01:42:45,759
instead of a jelly bean around the world

3097
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,840
i mean

3098
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:49,280
you know you get on a plane with a

3099
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:52,480
handful in your pocket and you could

3100
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:52,479
pretty much go anywhere right

3101
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:55,039
so those are those are another

3102
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:57,039
interesting little thing there's

3103
01:42:55,039 --> 01:42:57,840
something called embryo rescue but

3104
01:42:57,039 --> 01:42:59,600
people might have

3105
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:01,520
read in the newspaper you know some of

3106
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:04,639
these russian scientists found a

3107
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:07,040
a 30 year old seed in a

3108
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:09,520
um i'm not sure if it was an ice core or

3109
01:43:07,039 --> 01:43:11,118
it was thawing out of a

3110
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,480
out of a melting glacier but they

3111
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:14,238
collected these 30 you probably don't

3112
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:14,559
mean 30 year old you probably mean more

3113
01:43:14,238 --> 01:43:16,638
like

3114
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,600
30 sorry 30 000 30 000 all right because

3115
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:19,600
as soon as you said

3116
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:20,719
glacier i'm like yeah i think he means

3117
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:24,000
more than 30 oh yeah

3118
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:25,198
yeah yeah miss smoke but yeah 30 30 000

3119
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,238
year old season they actually were able

3120
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:30,238
to grow these things back

3121
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:34,479
in to into plants and it took some doing

3122
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:36,879
but yeah this this idea of being able to

3123
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:39,198
take seeds and and baby the you know a

3124
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:42,960
seed planting a seed is

3125
01:43:39,198 --> 01:43:44,879
you know it's they're tough but again

3126
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:47,439
you know when you have a 30 000 year old

3127
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:49,520
seed you really have to baby it and make

3128
01:43:47,439 --> 01:43:51,039
sure all the conditions are perfect and

3129
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:53,199
you know tissue culture is kind of one

3130
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:54,960
of those one of those

3131
01:43:53,198 --> 01:43:57,919
ways that you could do that i can't i

3132
01:43:54,960 --> 01:44:00,960
can't even get seeds to pop from 1978.

3133
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:02,719
you know let alone 30 000 years yeah

3134
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:04,319
those are all possible candidates you

3135
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:05,198
know i mean once the seed is dead it's

3136
01:44:04,319 --> 01:44:07,039
dead but

3137
01:44:05,198 --> 01:44:08,399
if it's stored properly you know

3138
01:44:07,039 --> 01:44:09,439
sometimes you have like a lot of that

3139
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:12,158
what the seed is is

3140
01:44:09,439 --> 01:44:13,678
it's um part of the test is actually

3141
01:44:12,158 --> 01:44:15,198
just food source for the seed that's why

3142
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:18,960
you can plant a seed in the ground

3143
01:44:15,198 --> 01:44:22,399
and they'll grow to like two sets of um

3144
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:24,560
leaves all really eating the food that's

3145
01:44:22,399 --> 01:44:25,839
in in the seed already i've never

3146
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:28,800
actually heard the term

3147
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:29,600
dead seed before so what is actually do

3148
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,199
you mean from that

3149
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:32,719
i mean just based on what you were just

3150
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:35,359
saying about food

3151
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:37,118
does that mean that the food that was

3152
01:44:35,359 --> 01:44:41,118
contained within the seed

3153
01:44:37,118 --> 01:44:42,799
that keeps it viral has all been used

3154
01:44:41,118 --> 01:44:43,839
and therefore you have got genetic

3155
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,679
material with no

3156
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:46,880
food in the seed and that is therefore

3157
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:50,079
called a dead seed

3158
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:51,359
it's not really that it's used it's

3159
01:44:50,079 --> 01:44:53,118
probably that you know

3160
01:44:51,359 --> 01:44:54,479
we're talking about 30 000 year old seed

3161
01:44:53,118 --> 01:44:55,920
it might be that the starches or

3162
01:44:54,479 --> 01:44:56,879
whatever the compounds or sugars that

3163
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:59,520
are in the plant

3164
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:01,199
have broken down due to whatever it

3165
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:03,600
could be a fungus or whatever

3166
01:45:01,198 --> 01:45:05,439
but yeah within a seed there's a very

3167
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:07,520
tiny little embryo

3168
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:09,279
right and so that embryo could could

3169
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,960
theoretically be cut out and provided

3170
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:12,238
with all the nutrients and vitamins that

3171
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:14,880
is need and hormones

3172
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:16,000
a typical a typical cannabis seed that's

3173
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:18,639
let's say that somebody's got

3174
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,760
their typical scent cannabis seed uh

3175
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:23,039
let's go old school

3176
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:23,760
and saved in a 35 millimeter film

3177
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:26,560
container

3178
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:29,039
right because that's how they used to be

3179
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:31,600
how many years do you think that seed is

3180
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:33,679
gonna go before it's air quotes dead

3181
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,119
well it's that's really a tough thing to

3182
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:37,359
say if you

3183
01:45:35,118 --> 01:45:38,559
if you store a cannabis seed it's

3184
01:45:37,359 --> 01:45:40,799
properly dried

3185
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:42,320
it's packed with a desiccant something

3186
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,679
that's gonna absorb the moisture

3187
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:44,960
you can put those seeds into a fridge

3188
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:46,480
and we're pulling seeds out that are

3189
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,639
like 25 years old

3190
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:50,000
and still germinating at like 85 90

3191
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:52,880
percent oh wow

3192
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,960
right um and listen like i said earlier

3193
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:57,359
that also varies by type like

3194
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:59,039
some genetic lines or they don't last

3195
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:00,238
that long and some will probably last

3196
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:01,600
longer and my

3197
01:46:00,238 --> 01:46:02,959
personal hypothesis is that it has

3198
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,320
something to do with the oil content

3199
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:06,880
that's in the seed

3200
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:08,479
before it goes through that process but

3201
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,600
whatever it is it's just another trait

3202
01:46:08,479 --> 01:46:12,638
that varies

3203
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:14,719
right that shows variation so um

3204
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:16,400
yeah the the question about it being in

3205
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:18,960
a container

3206
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:19,839
is really what what was the temperature

3207
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,920
and what was the

3208
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,880
humidity that those that it was subject

3209
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:24,560
to right

3210
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:26,719
like like i said if you if you put it in

3211
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:28,639
a four degree celsius fridge

3212
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:31,760
for you know 20 years they're going to

3213
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:34,880
be fine um if it's in like

3214
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:37,119
uh a 35 millimeter film camera

3215
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:38,719
in your attic your attic or your trunk

3216
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:40,158
or your car whatever like your odds are

3217
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:42,079
gonna go way down pretty quick

3218
01:46:40,158 --> 01:46:43,599
which is probably why these seeds that

3219
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:45,039
we're getting to pop after these

3220
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,079
thousands of years are coming out of

3221
01:46:45,039 --> 01:46:48,158
freaking tombs

3222
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:50,158
yeah exactly yeah exactly they were in

3223
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:51,039
like a one environment that was stable

3224
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:54,000
for that long

3225
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:55,840
yeah um so that's so that's really cool

3226
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,359
um

3227
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:59,600
there's also something called uh

3228
01:46:57,359 --> 01:47:03,599
anthroculture um

3229
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:04,880
where we we grow what you think about

3230
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:08,560
when a male plant or

3231
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:10,400
even a feminized reverse plant a plant

3232
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,159
a female plant sprayed with the sts so

3233
01:47:10,399 --> 01:47:15,359
that it's making male flowers

3234
01:47:12,158 --> 01:47:18,879
those male flowers are

3235
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:20,799
um you know they go through a process

3236
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,639
until they drop the pollen and say that

3237
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,880
takes 30 days

3238
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:28,159
right so you can actually cut those

3239
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:31,279
branches off at like 15 days for example

3240
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:32,960
and go into the forming male flowers and

3241
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:34,840
within those flowers

3242
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:36,239
there's the cells that are growing to

3243
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:39,119
become

3244
01:47:36,238 --> 01:47:41,198
pollen grains you can actually culture

3245
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:44,079
those cells at that stage

3246
01:47:41,198 --> 01:47:45,919
and and try to culture them and in rare

3247
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:47,519
circumstances

3248
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:49,520
if you've done everything right you can

3249
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:52,719
actually grow the the pollen

3250
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:55,760
or the pre pollen green grain cells

3251
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:58,639
into a plantlet um

3252
01:47:55,760 --> 01:48:00,560
and we can subject those things to a

3253
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:02,480
chemical called colchicine and

3254
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:05,360
colchicine effectively doubles the

3255
01:48:02,479 --> 01:48:08,319
chromosome number and so you can imagine

3256
01:48:05,359 --> 01:48:09,759
that a pollen grain like sperm or you

3257
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:13,519
know

3258
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:16,159
an egg in a female

3259
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:17,600
in the female reproductive system

3260
01:48:16,158 --> 01:48:20,079
context of an egg

3261
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,719
when those things come together they

3262
01:48:20,079 --> 01:48:22,158
actually

3263
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:23,760
in you know in cannabis when they come

3264
01:48:22,158 --> 01:48:24,559
together we get two sets of ten

3265
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,960
chromosomes

3266
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:28,000
so so each the sperm and the egg only

3267
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:30,560
have

3268
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
one copy of the ten chromosomes and so

3269
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:35,840
that's called haploid that's

3270
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:38,479
like a essentially you need to have

3271
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:39,760
two halves to make the whole that when

3272
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:42,238
they come together in the new

3273
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:44,239
organism that that new organism has a

3274
01:48:42,238 --> 01:48:46,238
complete genetic set and so

3275
01:48:44,238 --> 01:48:47,359
we can grow these plants that have half

3276
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:49,678
the set

3277
01:48:47,359 --> 01:48:52,000
double the chromosome number and now we

3278
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:54,319
have a plant that is 100 true breeding

3279
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,920
for all traits

3280
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:58,079
right and so that's those are called dye

3281
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:58,639
haps that's some mad scientist [ __ ]

3282
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:00,399
right there

3283
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:01,760
it's it's serious mad science and stuff

3284
01:49:00,399 --> 01:49:03,279
but this is these are the techniques

3285
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:06,079
that they use in like

3286
01:49:03,279 --> 01:49:07,039
corn and wheat breeding to create seed

3287
01:49:06,079 --> 01:49:09,359
lines

3288
01:49:07,039 --> 01:49:10,158
where all of the seeds you know you can

3289
01:49:09,359 --> 01:49:12,158
plant

3290
01:49:10,158 --> 01:49:13,839
a hundred like a thousand acres and

3291
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:15,039
every single plant looks the same do you

3292
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:16,239
know anybody who's doing this in

3293
01:49:15,039 --> 01:49:17,599
cannabis now

3294
01:49:16,238 --> 01:49:19,198
yeah there's people there's a couple of

3295
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:20,400
groups that are working so so this is

3296
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:22,960
happening wow

3297
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:24,000
that's some hard hardcore science yeah

3298
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:26,560
and you can again

3299
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,399
like you know you can if you can figure

3300
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:29,920
out the process to grow these pre-pollen

3301
01:49:28,399 --> 01:49:31,279
grains into plantlets and you can say

3302
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:33,039
get a thousand of them

3303
01:49:31,279 --> 01:49:35,039
you can then go in and subject those

3304
01:49:33,039 --> 01:49:36,960
thousand plants to genetic screening

3305
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:38,158
and find the ones that are really ideal

3306
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:40,079
right

3307
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:42,158
um so that's all really interesting

3308
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:44,158
future stuff that's coming uh

3309
01:49:42,158 --> 01:49:46,079
towards cannabis that'll be that'll

3310
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:48,238
really exceed our breeding

3311
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:49,599
and the last real thing i think that's

3312
01:49:48,238 --> 01:49:51,118
that's probably interesting to talk

3313
01:49:49,599 --> 01:49:52,560
about is the concept of somatic

3314
01:49:51,118 --> 01:49:54,960
embryogenesis

3315
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:56,800
and so embryogenesis is like you can

3316
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,760
think of the word the genesis of an

3317
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,800
embryo

3318
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:02,000
it's the process of creating embryos and

3319
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:06,320
so the somatic

3320
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:08,719
part of that word means it comes from

3321
01:50:06,319 --> 01:50:09,759
the body of the plant and so you can

3322
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:12,639
actually take

3323
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:13,520
imagine you could take for example your

3324
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:14,639
favorite plant

3325
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:17,520
doesn't matter what it is called

3326
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:20,319
skittles you take your skittles plant

3327
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,719
you encourage those um that plant to

3328
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:23,759
grow

3329
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:27,359
callus and that cal callus can then be

3330
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:28,639
coaxed into like a pre-embryonic cell

3331
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:31,679
state

3332
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:34,079
okay and once we have those cells

3333
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:35,118
those cells can be grown and multiplied

3334
01:50:34,079 --> 01:50:37,599
on mass

3335
01:50:35,118 --> 01:50:38,960
quantities and then divided into little

3336
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:41,119
groups or clumps

3337
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:43,118
and those individual clumps can then be

3338
01:50:41,118 --> 01:50:45,598
coaxed into embryos

3339
01:50:43,118 --> 01:50:47,279
and so essentially what you have at the

3340
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:51,360
end of that process

3341
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:52,960
is say 10 000 embryos that all came from

3342
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:55,920
your skittles plant

3343
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,800
right but they're what we call bipolar

3344
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,880
they have a

3345
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:00,560
a top chute that goes like a top

3346
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:02,960
meristem that grows

3347
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:05,520
skyward and they have the root meristem

3348
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:06,960
that grows towards the soil

3349
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:08,400
right whereas in the context of the

3350
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:09,599
tissue cultures that we were talking

3351
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:11,198
before

3352
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:13,279
you know we had to actually put them

3353
01:51:11,198 --> 01:51:16,559
through a separate process

3354
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:18,479
to get that root meristem to grow

3355
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:20,159
right so they were really unipolar at

3356
01:51:18,479 --> 01:51:21,118
that stage they were only growing

3357
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:23,118
skyward

3358
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:24,238
right and so having a plant part that

3359
01:51:23,118 --> 01:51:26,479
will grow a shoot

3360
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:27,359
and a root it really makes things easy

3361
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:29,118
for automation

3362
01:51:27,359 --> 01:51:30,559
because the plants ready to just do what

3363
01:51:29,118 --> 01:51:33,519
it does normally it as a

3364
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:34,880
as if it were a normal seed right so

3365
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,560
think of it like

3366
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,480
having a hundred thousand seeds that are

3367
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:41,199
all twins

3368
01:51:38,479 --> 01:51:42,718
and and do they have the virility that

3369
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:44,879
you know like when we when we

3370
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:46,399
normally say we're gonna grow from seeds

3371
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:48,960
most people say like yeah the

3372
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:49,920
the a plant from a seed is going to be

3373
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:52,960
more

3374
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:55,039
energetic and more virile than a cutting

3375
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:56,639
are these going to have that that that

3376
01:51:55,039 --> 01:51:58,719
you get from a seed

3377
01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:00,639
yeah because again part of that of comes

3378
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:03,039
from the having the taproot that grows

3379
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:04,560
straight down and it taps down into the

3380
01:52:03,039 --> 01:52:05,279
soil and goes searching for the water

3381
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:06,880
table

3382
01:52:05,279 --> 01:52:08,319
whereas clones you know when we have

3383
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:09,520
clones they're coming out sideways so

3384
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:10,960
the roots kind of

3385
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:13,119
they don't tap they don't they don't

3386
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:15,118
seem to tap down as much they kind of

3387
01:52:13,118 --> 01:52:16,960
they kind of grow more along the surface

3388
01:52:15,118 --> 01:52:18,639
of the soil

3389
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:20,560
and so there really is something about

3390
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:23,440
having that taproot that drives

3391
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:24,639
straight down into the soil that has to

3392
01:52:23,439 --> 01:52:27,919
do with

3393
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:30,880
vigor right wow wow

3394
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:33,199
um you know uh i'm i'm kind of glad that

3395
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:36,159
we focused on michael propagation

3396
01:52:33,198 --> 01:52:37,598
as the major umbrella because i don't

3397
01:52:36,158 --> 01:52:38,319
think i would have been able to follow

3398
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:40,400
you

3399
01:52:38,319 --> 01:52:42,158
uh in a conversation with these five

3400
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:44,238
things that you just laid out this is

3401
01:52:42,158 --> 01:52:46,719
like some serious science and

3402
01:52:44,238 --> 01:52:47,359
i don't you know like you know there are

3403
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:49,920
some good

3404
01:52:47,359 --> 01:52:51,519
people that have got capital that are

3405
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:52,560
probably doing these things but this

3406
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:55,599
really sounds

3407
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:57,440
like like mega you know

3408
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:59,039
mega ag companies that'll be doing this

3409
01:52:57,439 --> 01:53:01,198
stuff

3410
01:52:59,039 --> 01:53:02,479
yeah i think probably i mean you know

3411
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:04,319
someone like

3412
01:53:02,479 --> 01:53:06,000
mr mean green i mean he could go and do

3413
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:07,359
this with a university lab and partner

3414
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,439
with someone like them so there's there

3415
01:53:07,359 --> 01:53:12,000
are definitely ways to do it

3416
01:53:09,439 --> 01:53:13,439
um i like you interjecting hope in there

3417
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,000
i like that thank you

3418
01:53:13,439 --> 01:53:17,519
yeah well we you know none of this stuff

3419
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,439
is about beyond the community i think

3420
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:20,960
that we've kind of felt

3421
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:22,799
you know especially in growing out a

3422
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:24,960
prohibition that it's always been like

3423
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:27,520
us versus these big corporations but

3424
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,560
yeah there are there are opportunities

3425
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:30,639
for people to go

3426
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:31,840
you know it's rather than being acquired

3427
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:34,319
by those guys

3428
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:35,360
why not go and find ways that we can

3429
01:53:34,319 --> 01:53:37,198
partner with them

3430
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:38,479
right so it's not like it's it's more of

3431
01:53:37,198 --> 01:53:40,238
an equal relationship

3432
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:41,519
not one of being told what we're going

3433
01:53:40,238 --> 01:53:43,118
to do and when

3434
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:45,440
right it's like hey look we have all

3435
01:53:43,118 --> 01:53:47,598
these unique genetic resources

3436
01:53:45,439 --> 01:53:49,118
can we partner with people that have

3437
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:51,760
knowledge of how to do these techniques

3438
01:53:49,118 --> 01:53:53,920
so that we can advance the species

3439
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:55,599
that's a beautiful summary i appreciate

3440
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:57,920
your you uh ending this on

3441
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:59,760
on a good note this idea of of

3442
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:01,520
partnering with scientists and

3443
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:02,239
laboratories where we're on equal

3444
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:05,599
footing

3445
01:54:02,238 --> 01:54:08,479
uh pleases me extensively more

3446
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:09,199
than the idea of this idea of us having

3447
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:12,479
to

3448
01:54:09,198 --> 01:54:14,079
defend ourselves because big ag is just

3449
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:14,879
going to come and steal all of our good

3450
01:54:14,079 --> 01:54:17,760
stuff i

3451
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:18,400
like this idea of of we who've been in

3452
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:22,079
the scene

3453
01:54:18,399 --> 01:54:25,598
for 10 or 20 years or whatever we

3454
01:54:22,079 --> 01:54:27,679
just go directly to scientists who

3455
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:29,039
who smoke weed and say all right let's

3456
01:54:27,679 --> 01:54:31,679
get together and let's

3457
01:54:29,039 --> 01:54:32,639
let's use your let's use your academic

3458
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:36,000
knowledge

3459
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:39,199
and then you know um our

3460
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:42,319
ability to smell flowers and determine

3461
01:54:39,198 --> 01:54:42,638
terpene profiles that cause joy and then

3462
01:54:42,319 --> 01:54:44,479
let's

3463
01:54:42,639 --> 01:54:45,760
work together and you know do it

3464
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:48,319
ourselves

3465
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:50,079
before the genetics get taken and

3466
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:51,599
patented by somebody who doesn't have

3467
01:54:50,079 --> 01:54:54,158
our best interests at heart

3468
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:54,960
yeah we it's all in our hands to do it's

3469
01:54:54,158 --> 01:54:56,799
just

3470
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:58,639
you know being able to envision a way to

3471
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:00,719
make it happen and i think that

3472
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:02,480
as we move into this more legal world

3473
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:04,560
there is a lot of opportunity for

3474
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:07,118
collaboration and the truth is

3475
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:08,400
these scientists they're not i think the

3476
01:55:07,118 --> 01:55:10,399
most the people that are really

3477
01:55:08,399 --> 01:55:11,839
truly interested in the science they're

3478
01:55:10,399 --> 01:55:13,279
not out to get rich they're out to

3479
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:15,920
change the world through

3480
01:55:13,279 --> 01:55:17,439
breeding plants and you know making

3481
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:18,399
these species into things that are

3482
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:22,238
really

3483
01:55:18,399 --> 01:55:24,158
valuable tools for humans right and um

3484
01:55:22,238 --> 01:55:25,678
you know the somatic embryogenesis is

3485
01:55:24,158 --> 01:55:27,439
maybe is a little more of a dream but

3486
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:31,520
the dye haploid breeding and
