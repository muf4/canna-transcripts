2
00:00:05,628 --> 00:00:10,259
cannabis seeds are not all bred the same

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,670
some are bred for indoor growing and

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,289
have little relationship to the

5
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:14,968
geographic area that are grown in

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:17,160
because they never actually interact

7
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:19,108
with nature other seeds are bred for

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,570
outdoor growing and historically have

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,730
come from California but nowadays as

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,439
cannabis is being normalized in breeders

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,269
have been able to come out of the

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,460
shadows and connecting groups we are

13
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:31,169
finding that each bio region is starting

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,750
to develop seeds that work best in their

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,130
own area where I live in the Pacific

16
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,780
Northwest on Vashon Island

17
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,149
we need genetics where the flower

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,820
finishes quickly and early before the

19
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,859
October rains start up until now that

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,628
has usually meant growing cultivars that

21
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,700
bloom for eight or nine weeks ending the

22
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,140
mid to end of October and we just have

23
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,030
to go in knowing that they probably

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,489
won't fully mature before the rain and

25
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,379
cold set in now though breeders are

26
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:58,140
bringing seeds to market that finishin

27
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:00,329
has fused 50 days putting harvest more

28
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,789
towards October first or even earlier

29
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,799
these new genetics open up outdoor

30
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,239
growing to a much wider range of home

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,820
growers who live in areas of the country

32
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,419
with shorter summers and to these

33
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,709
breeders we are eternally grateful if

56
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,560
Shango lows the intro to today's show is

57
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,270
gonna be a little longer than usual I

58
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,879
have two extra topics I want to cover

59
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:02,489
with you first I want to give my sincere

60
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,500
thanks to Zack Badgett for saving my

61
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,899
crew on our way to the can Illuminati

62
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,179
party on Saturday night of emerald cup

63
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,068
he and his buddy Brennan were following

64
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,009
the crappy driving directions that

65
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:15,289
Google Maps was giving out to the par

66
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:17,840
along their route they came across my

67
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:19,879
crew in our car that had gotten stuck in

68
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,140
the mud on an unimproved road where we

69
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,719
should not have even been in the first

70
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:25,279
place but Google Maps took us there not

71
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:26,840
only did the guys spend a good amount of

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,270
time trying to pull our car out of the

73
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,099
mud but Zach even went all the way and

74
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,380
used his triple-a membership to get a

75
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:36,079
tow truck out there which got us out of

76
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:37,909
the mud with no problem not only did

77
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,980
Zach offer to let us use his triple-a

78
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:42,680
membership but it meant that his good

79
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:45,590
time at the can Illuminati party was

80
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,540
interrupted a few times because he first

81
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,520
had to call triple-a and then go back

82
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:51,889
again and meet up with the tow truck

83
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,170
folks so thanks to both you guys and

84
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:56,569
especially thanks to Zach who gave of

85
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:58,489
his money and time to make sure that we

86
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:00,319
were okay and able to get to the party

87
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,240
instead of being stuck out in a field

88
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,459
somewhere due to bad directions I

89
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,409
offered to pay for Zach's triple-a

90
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,879
membership for the year in thanks you

91
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:09,829
know but he wasn't having it

92
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,439
he just asked me to let him know if I

93
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,360
heard of any really good hash jobs for

94
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:17,240
an experienced professional hash maker

95
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,580
well this is for you Zach if you

96
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,400
listeners have a legal cannabis business

97
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,530
that produces ice hash or hash rosin and

98
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,909
you want a trustworthy guy who is easy

99
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,830
to get along with and has solid

100
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:30,229
production skills I encourage you to

101
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,920
reach out to Zach Badgett on his

102
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:36,919
Instagram Duet his constellation

103
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:38,719
underscore carolina zach is based in

104
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,458
washington state right now but he is

105
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,620
willing to move for the right job he is

106
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,990
presently on the hash production team at

107
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,360
constellation cannabis if you follow my

108
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,950
Instagram you have heard me talk before

109
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,320
about how great their hash and hash

110
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:52,549
rosin carts are they know zach is

111
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,349
looking for a role with more

112
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,150
responsibilities so he said it was okay

113
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:58,280
if I tried to get him a job more

114
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,099

115
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,259
so thanks again Zach you are a shining

116
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:04,759
example of the cannabis community

117
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:06,560
looking out for each other when things

118
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,539
go bad okay

119
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,219
the other thing I want to do is to thank

120
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:12,079
those of you who have left the hundreds

121
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:14,150
of positive reviews of shaping fire

122
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,890
online where you get your podcasts you

123
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,989
know I'm usually so busy doing

124
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:19,819
interviews and traveling and just you

125
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:21,379
know doing life that I never really

126
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:22,610
looked at the reviews people were

127
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:24,529
leaving about the show

128
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,840
those reviews are really important in

129
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:27,029
order

130
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,349
to be seen so I'm really grateful for

131
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:31,049
anybody that leaves a nice review

132
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,699
wherever they get their podcasts over

133
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,160
the holidays I was reading some of the

134
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,629
reviews left on Apple podcasts and I

135
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,910
want to share just two of them with you

136
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:41,100
and thank the folks that left them so

137
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,610
first of all I want to thank case' del

138
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,439
77 who says well done there are a few

139
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,360
good cannabis podcasts out there but

140
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,430
Shango is possibly the best host and

141
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,960
that he asks good questions and isn't

142
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,150
afraid to let the guest talk for a while

143
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,439
without interrupting tons of knowledge

144
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:57,149
while still maintaining a laid-back

145
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,699
atmosphere for the guests and the

146
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:04,049
listeners well done Shango and then also

147
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:06,329
CB DNA labs says the best I don't have a

148
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,550
far commute to work but I wish I did I

149
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:10,589
have been looking for excuses to drive

150
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,000
for months because of shaping fire many

151
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:14,099
thanks to Shango and his guests for an

152
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,899
incredible podcast I have found answers

153
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,930

155
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,538

00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,129
breeding cannabis for short bloom cycles

170
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,990
as well as a bit on auto Flowers tissue

171
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:00,810
culture and genetic markers such at

172
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,639
breeding welcome to the show nat well

173
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,259
thank you so glad to have you here so

174
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,930
you know I've been aware of you for

175
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,848
years but I really only zeroed in on you

176
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,519
after your interview with Kevin Jo Durie

177
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:13,740
during the Wunderland nursery seed

178
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,478
series which shaping fire sponsored I

179
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,949
got to watch that interview and I'm like

180
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:19,019
oh man this guy's cool and he's got

181
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:21,659
depth and oh man I want to hear him a

182
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:24,810
lot more than 20 minutes so so I then

183
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,360
recently was checking out your new 2020

184
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,788
seed catalog and I saw these cultivars

185
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,990
with bloom cycles under 60 days and and

186
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:33,240
then you totally got my attention

187
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:37,050
because you know most of us outside

188
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,490
California do not have the same perfect

189
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,949
cannabis growing web

190
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,710
that you have there and we need shorter

191
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:47,038
bloom cycles and and you've bred flowers

192
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:49,079
as short as 45 days which is a godsend

193
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,629
when trying to beat those October rains

194
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,490
so up till now if I wanted to get

195
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:55,019
something under fifty days it was

196
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,110
probably going to be some kind of shish

197
00:06:55,019 --> 00:07:00,620
kebob cross or something what inspired

198
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,860
you to start to cross and sift

199
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:08,639
specifically for short blooming flowers

200
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:12,660
yeah so you know we were obviously

201
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,990
humble is not what people commonly think

202
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,979
of when they think about California in

203
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:23,819
regard to whether you know we're not out

204
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:28,110
here you know we're in shorts and tank

205
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:33,649
tops all year round we have quite quite

206
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:37,408
an or Mille you know decent winter and

207
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:40,439
really October it gets a little

208
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:44,209
touch-and-go especially towards the end

209
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:47,908
when it comes to not only just like

210
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:49,769
having to avoid molds and mildew and

211
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:52,829
things like that but even like frost

212
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:57,508
depending what your elevation is and

213
00:07:52,829 --> 00:08:02,609
humbled also is this area with terrain

214
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:09,840
and mountainous terrain and so yeah

215
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:12,360
anyway we definitely do breed for

216
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:16,589
shorter season flower or shorter

217
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:19,408
flowering type cannabis but I do have to

218
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:22,500
say that really initially that was an

219
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:24,209
inadvertent thing and you know we've

220
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:29,459
been breeding here at Humboldt seed

221
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:33,348
company for over 20 years so the story

222
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:37,348
of how we started doing shorter season

223
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:39,450
varietals is is unique and interesting

224
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:44,129
and it can I really dive into it yeah

225
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:46,528
yeah we want to hear it all right so for

226
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:49,370
folks out there that have done a lot of

227
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:51,990
breeding you may have noticed how

228
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:55,528
quickly cannabis

229
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:57,589
acclimate to your environment and I I

230
00:08:55,528 --> 00:09:01,259
kind of think it's one of the more

231
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:05,520
malleable crops out there as far as you

232
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:08,730
know really changing even in the course

233
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,980
of a generation or two or I don't know

234
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,700
folks have noticed but like even clones

235
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:17,370
that obviously don't aren't you know

236
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,528
going through when they're propagated

237
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:23,129
they're not having genetic you know

238
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:25,588
cellular meiosis or whatever so even

239
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:29,309
clones I've noticed can have kind of

240
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:32,279
epigenetic changes and adjust to their

241
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:33,239
new indoor environment let's say or or

242
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:39,929
vice versa

243
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:43,740
so cannabis malleable species and what

244
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:47,239
what I found was you know basically our

245
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:50,639
breeding practices particularly back in

246
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,180
the late 90s and early 2000s were a

247
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:58,019
little bit more kind of you know we

248
00:09:54,179 --> 00:10:02,969
weren't as as specifically directed or

249
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:07,799
focused and I say I can't really blame

250
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:10,620
you know that was sort of just right

251
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:15,719
after cannabis was legalized medically

252
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:18,120
in California and you know there it was

253
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:22,470
okay that we weren't exactly like the

254
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,028
most professional but um but you know

255
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,649
one of the things that we would do is

256
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:31,289
like we're making crosses with a popular

257
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:35,490
clonal variety that might be going

258
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:37,949
around Humboldt or you know as much as

259
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:41,100
as often as those as the clone crosses

260
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:44,310
we're finding these wonderful genetics

261
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,360
that have been you know kept alive in

262
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:49,828
the hills of Humboldt and seed form and

263
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,639
picking the best and making crosses from

264
00:10:49,828 --> 00:10:57,078
those but one of the things when

265
00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:01,129
breeding you know with regular seed

266
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:05,629
doing regular male-female breeding is

267
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:09,629
essentially you're waiting to find

268
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:12,139
find out what sex this lot of plants

269
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:15,088
that you're picking from might be so

270
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:17,669
let's just say I'm gonna round off

271
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:19,710
numbers to make this easier to

272
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:26,669
understand let's just say that we're

273
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:31,470
breeding our mango tree line and we

274
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:33,689
crack two hundred seeds and we're

275
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:37,459
looking at and this is back then we're

276
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:40,610
doing bigger populations these days but

277
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:44,449
we've got two hundred seedlings

278
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:47,250
in trays we transplant them up into a

279
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:50,190
you know five inch pot or a gallon or

280
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:53,278
something like that and now they're like

281
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:55,680
fifteen inches maybe a couple feet tall

282
00:11:53,278 --> 00:12:00,629
so we're starting to like look at the

283
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:05,399
sex and determine you know really what

284
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:08,429
we would do is make sure that we had the

285
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:12,629
best-looking plants out of that larger

286
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:16,199
population and set them aside as our

287
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:19,259
breeding plants and we you know as males

288
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,700
were showing their sex as well we'd be

289
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:26,129
you know it's rubbing those stems and

290
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:30,290
looking at the structure and doing all

291
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:35,639
the selection that we do for males but

292
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:37,740
the reason I mean we were already we

293
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,169
already knew that we were really really

294
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,600
interested in breeding and I mean it was

295
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:46,379
only a few years later that we kind of

296
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,720
formalized that by going and getting the

297
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:51,450
you know the business humboldt seed

298
00:12:48,720 --> 00:13:00,470
company down here and eureka at the

299
00:12:51,450 --> 00:13:04,829
courthouse but and that was so so far so

300
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:08,399
long before you know we have like humble

301
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:12,208
farm and humble everything you could

302
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,159
ever imagine but this was like I was I

303
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,619
just felt so funny in the courthouse is

304
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,049
the ladies there and I was asking was

305
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,730
there a Humboldt seed company and she

306
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:22,889
like ah let me check in the databases

307
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,920
and stuff she's like no and I'm like

308
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:30,480
okay it I'm gonna be I'd like to start a

309
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:33,208
business of that humbled she says she

310
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,389
looks at me and what are you doing are

311
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:39,479
you doing and I just said I'm doing

312
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:41,850
vegetable seeds and just where's your

313
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,009
location and I gave her my address and

314
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:47,040
you're gonna sell it farmers market and

315
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:49,470
I said yes and I think at that time we

316
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:55,828
were we've always had different kinds of

317
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:57,930
seeds you know in reality my intention

318
00:13:55,828 --> 00:14:00,149
was to have a cannabis seed company but

319
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:03,539
down there that day at the courthouse it

320
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:11,250
was it was just Humboldt seeds of any

321
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:13,759
kind so back to the point I knew we

322
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:18,450
wanted to Bree I knew that that was what

323
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:20,309
really interested me and so every year

324
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:24,300
the first priority was pick your

325
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:28,799
breeders and set them aside they're not

326
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:32,870
gonna be in the main garden area so pot

327
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:36,359
him up take care of them make him happy

328
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:39,209
you know then I'd go and later on I'd do

329
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,620
my whole breeding set up but set him

330
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:47,879
aside and really what I found over the

331
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:50,810
years is that had a huge effect on the

332
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:55,470
flowering time of the plants because

333
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:58,619
here I was looking and choosing for the

334
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,910
breeding population first and without

335
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:05,879
even thinking about it I was

336
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:08,429
inadvertently dude selecting for the the

337
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:12,899
ones that had that pre flower the the

338
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:16,409
way that we determine sex on on regular

339
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:19,169
plants without you know genomics which

340
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:21,719
you know I find to be relatively easy

341
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:24,629
it's it's hard for some folks I think

342
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,300
but you just just experiential knowledge

343
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:31,500
you know you get it once you see enough

344
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:32,959
little male parts and yeah becomes it

345
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,289
becomes really familiar to you and

346
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,450
male female male but I get where you're

347
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:41,389
going you were you were splitting up

348
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:44,899
these plans and so because you you were

349
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:46,549
naturally choosing plants because they

350
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:50,958
were showing early which means that they

351
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:54,559
were getting a business exactly so they

352
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:58,278
were the ones that they were the ones

353
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:00,319
that were probably you know that's a

354
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:04,009
relation and and it's a relation that

355
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:09,040
I've actually seen as tangible is that

356
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:12,730
really the ones that tend to you know

357
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:17,480
identify themselves as male or female

358
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:18,769
earlier on are also a little bit you

359
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,480
know the earlier flower but you're still

360
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:24,169
talking about a population so if you're

361
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,209
selecting out of your OG population

362
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:28,179
let's say or sour tea it's kind of those

363
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:30,699
kinds of things that are later flowering

364
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:35,958
well you're probably not maybe you won't

365
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:38,540
be able to sex the plants until mid-may

366
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:41,869
but some of these earlier flowering

367
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:44,809
types you can really sex um early on and

368
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:47,089
you know with the population that

369
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:49,759
eventually led into like varieties like

370
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:53,060
our blueberry muffin other earlier

371
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:57,950
flowering varieties at a point right

372
00:16:53,059 --> 00:17:01,639
around you know 2006 2005 that six I was

373
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:05,120
like realizing because I had my own

374
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:08,240
experiences and a couple other of the

375
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,428
farms that you know would give a lot of

376
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,880
reports back about how our seeds were

377
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:18,050
performing would actually say you know

378
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:21,290
hey we're having flowering is happening

379
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:24,259
way too early and we're not getting as

380
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:28,879
much yield because you know so there's

381
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:33,400
this kind of perfect balance that we end

382
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:37,250
up striving for when it comes to

383
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:41,990
flowering time and and particularly you

384
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:45,890
know for those that are growing you know

385
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:48,470
in the natural photo period you know the

386
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,750
just growing in in full Sun without

387
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:58,360
light deprivation and things like that

388
00:17:50,750 --> 00:18:02,170
and so but back to why we have more

389
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:05,569
quicker flowers flowering types than

390
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:08,720
then you know maybe some others have to

391
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:12,428
offer I think over the years that was

392
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:18,890
something that we kind of learned to

393
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:24,169
balance and really hone in on you know

394
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:26,870
what because I think everybody does

395
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:29,419
enjoy kind of having a quicker flowering

396
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:31,519
type of cannabis because you know

397
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:35,270
sometimes especially with things like

398
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:39,980
the Haze's and certain gosh certain

399
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:41,599
landrace rivals I mean we've met a lot

400
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,269
of growers that have grown a lot of

401
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:48,199
different varieties have had that plant

402
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:51,190
that you're you know showing your

403
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:55,308
friends at Thanksgiving yeah it comes

404
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:58,039
thing is like fifteen feet tall it's

405
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:59,928
just starting to flower it's

406
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,909
Thanksgiving you know I don't know I'm

407
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:09,350
gonna be harvesting this thing next year

408
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:14,210
literally and but so some things you're

409
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:17,689
never gonna make to keep the strain true

410
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:20,480
to form you know you can't change too

411
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,340
much about the flowering time but you

412
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,940
can certainly shorten it by a few weeks

413
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:28,519
I think in my experience and you know

414
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:32,600
that could be said for for a lot of

415
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:35,509
things like the classics like Sour

416
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:38,000
Diesel that tend to be a little on the

417
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:40,869
longer side for flowering you can still

418
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,029
you know keep something that is

419
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:48,168
recognizably Sour Diesel with terpenes

420
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:51,168
and structure and the high and maybe cut

421
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:54,259
off a couple weeks which is you know

422
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:56,310
that's so that's a that's that's

423
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:59,789
breeding right there I mean

424
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:03,839
you know that's that's improving

425
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:05,059
something that you know without I don't

426
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,829
feel like you know you're not

427
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:10,079
jeopardizing too much by doing that

428
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:12,599
you're really selecting within a

429
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,879
population and and you know everybody's

430
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:16,709
always grateful for that too because the

431
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,660
shorter the bloom cycle the less time

432
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,670
there is for something to go wrong right

433
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,610
I mean like one of the challenges with

434
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,140
these long I mean where I live on Vashon

435
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:27,209
Island in the Pacific Northwest

436
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,130
anything over eight weeks is we consider

437
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,200
long but you know you've got somebody

438
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:34,260
who's got a 12 week er it's like oh my

439
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,180
gosh you've got so much time to run into

440
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:37,349
potential pest problems that you're

441
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,840
gonna have to solve

442
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:42,869
during flower when your options are very

443
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:45,029
limited it's you know it's if you can

444
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:47,399
knock a couple weeks off of a long bloom

445
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:49,950
cycle it's it's to everybody's benefit

446
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,280
so long as the flower you know still

447
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:55,590
still comes out being the haze or

448
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,299
whatever that you're hoping it is now

449
00:20:55,589 --> 00:21:01,379
now you were talking about for your

450
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:03,899
flowers that started blooming early does

451
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:07,230
that for you pretty much equate with

452
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,750
ending early too because you know you

453
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,930
might have something that that might

454
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,720
start flowering early but then it still

455
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:18,269
doesn't finish until the second or third

456
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,990
week of October which is really at the

457
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:25,079
at the end of reasonable for most of the

458
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:28,230
country it's really nice if not only if

459
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:31,169
that if it starts flowering earlier than

460
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:33,630
it than others but then it also drags

461
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:36,300
that finishing time forward to the end

462
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,460
of September - do you find normally that

463
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:40,319
that when you're doing these large sips

464
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:45,930
that the ones that are starting early

465
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:47,730
are also finishing early yeah and for

466
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:51,110
the most part I'd say that that is the

467
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:56,640
case so you know you're moving the

468
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:59,519
you're really just the flower time it's

469
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,520
not completely static I mean it is a

470
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:06,000
little bit dynamic and certain varieties

471
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:09,660
I'm sure folks have seen it you know you

472
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,730
basically flip the lights so twelve

473
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,630
12 and next thing you know if they go

474
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:17,819
yeah it just seems like you know within

475
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,850
a few days you're noticing the

476
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:23,519
difference and uh and then next thing

477
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:25,769
you know you've got significant flowers

478
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:29,069
put on which is I think that's really

479
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:33,980
what the goal is is to get that you know

480
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:37,470
initial chunk to start early enough and

481
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,910
so when you're working in indoors it's a

482
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,100
little bit easier to kind of see the

483
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:43,529
difference between that because when

484
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:48,029
you're doing outdoor of course if if

485
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:53,009
you're let's say up in Washington you

486
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:57,450
know the lights changing and certain

487
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:59,460
varieties will you know trigger into

488
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,100
flower earlier than others and that's

489
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:05,250
just you're essentially taking the

490
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:07,829
flowering cycle and moving it up a few

491
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:11,250
weeks and then of course the end gets

492
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:15,389
moved up a few weeks as well so I mean

493
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:18,240
that and that is effective for that goal

494
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:20,700
if you really want to avoid the problems

495
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,359
that are associated with having you know

496
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:27,269
big beautiful flowers out in the rain or

497
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:28,829
the freezing cold then that's completely

498
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:32,940
effective for that but I think that

499
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:36,359
there's another factor that we're also

500
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:39,690
considering which is just how fast the

501
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:42,419
flowers actually grow and how you know

502
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:45,779
how much of the plants energy is

503
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:50,400
strictly just getting devoted to putting

504
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:53,430
on flower weight versus continuing to

505
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,670
put energy into stalk and leaf growth

506
00:23:53,430 --> 00:24:00,299
and you know I think a lot of the time I

507
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:05,060
do associate those earlier flowering

508
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:08,730
ones you know they kind of go all in on

509
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:10,109
flowering too which is I know we're

510
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,680
gonna talk about autos in a little while

511
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:17,179
but that you know for me I see I think

512
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,670
of it as kind of the difference between

513
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:23,519
annual and perennial plants and where

514
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:27,600
the the plant really is putting

515
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:31,139
it's energy at the time and for me you

516
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:33,658
know I think of it being a a fish

517
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:36,240
biologist for four years while I was

518
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:38,549
also reading and running the company

519
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,339
when I when I couldn't be as big of a

520
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:45,269
company I got to really know and

521
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:49,019
understand salmon and steelhead and an

522
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:53,308
interesting thing about salmon and

523
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:57,259
steelhead is that steelhead can live

524
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:58,889
after they reproduce so they can spawn a

525
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:02,220
number of times

526
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:05,759
whereas salmon just kind of you know

527
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,470
they have to expend all of their energy

528
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,960
into reproduction to swimming up the

529
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:14,429
river they pretty much stop eating and

530
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,890
then they reproduce but from a person

531
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:19,048
that you know also likes to fish and eat

532
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:22,049
salmon and steelhead I can tell you

533
00:25:19,048 --> 00:25:25,500
right now that the best I think I really

534
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:29,990
enjoy the taste of the salmon because

535
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:33,869
you're having a this is a creature that

536
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:36,750
knows that it has to put a whole bunch

537
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:41,489
of energy into this one special moment

538
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:46,259
and when you harvest it if it's at the

539
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:48,329
right moment then you're essentially you

540
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:50,640
know that energy is kind of transferring

541
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:52,319
over and I think of that with with

542
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,179
cannabis and some of these shorter

543
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,240
flowering varieties are kind of like

544
00:25:54,179 --> 00:26:00,929
salmon where they're just like okay we

545
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,609
know that this is the the time to go for

546
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:05,880
it and we're gonna throw everything we

547
00:26:02,609 --> 00:26:07,379
have into basically you know what

548
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,710
they're trying to do which was reproduce

549
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,620
and we're getting in there and

550
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:17,548
harvesting it at this moment where the

551
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:22,849
plant is just full of of every you know

552
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:27,389
all life and and vibrant and you know

553
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:29,579
big chunky beautiful buds I think that

554
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:32,580
that interpretation of it is really you

555
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:34,589
know poetic if not spiritual because you

556
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:36,099
know you're you're talking about all

557
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:39,189
life having the

558
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:43,329
particular moment when it when it gives

559
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:45,429
its full expression of who it is in the

560
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:47,589
natural system and it and it puts it all

561
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:51,490
on and you're right some of these

562
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:54,129
shorter blooming flowers when they come

563
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:55,589
on they come on like gangbusters and I

564
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,330
think that's one of the things that

565
00:26:55,589 --> 00:27:01,629
those of us who have the opportunity to

566
00:26:58,329 --> 00:27:03,668
walk through gardens with you know many

567
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:05,020
plants lets you know you can do it with

568
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:07,000
you know five or six plants but let's

569
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:09,339
let's say 25 plants when you can walk

570
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,380
through and all these plants are

571
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:13,480
expressing themselves fully and and

572
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,940
we're looking at them and we're smelling

573
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,250
them and we're both the plants and us

574
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:21,159
are reacting to the Sun I think that we

575
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:22,808
can feel that energy that's going

576
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:24,880
between the Sun and the plants and us

577
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:26,710
and I think that's one of the reasons

578
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,100
that we are so in love with this plant

579
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:35,400
is because we can we can participate in

580
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:38,730
that at an energetic level exactly and

581
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:42,659
yeah and it's it's okay I mean we're

582
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:45,880
we're all creatures and we all you know

583
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:49,470
give and take from all the different

584
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,860
kind of life forces on the planet and

585
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:57,490
you know I'm a I'm an omnivore I'd I

586
00:27:52,859 --> 00:28:00,189
love going out and harvesting broccoli

587
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:02,370
out of the garden and fishing and all

588
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:07,620
those things and it's you do you kind of

589
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:09,759
when you are harvesting something and

590
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:12,459
especially if you've put a bunch of

591
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:15,210
energy into it whether that's you know

592
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:19,360
growing tomatoes in your garden or

593
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:23,110
growing cannabis or you know taking care

594
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,369
of the wild world that you live in when

595
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:26,048
you're harvesting something like that

596
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:32,229
and you have that real connection with

597
00:28:26,048 --> 00:28:34,779
it it's such a thing of beauty to you

598
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:38,829
know be so proud and hold that thing in

599
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:44,440
your hand and then you know go have a

600
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:46,889
stir-fry yeah I feel like that it's a

601
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,308
real it is it's it's super spiritual I'd

602
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:51,860
totally agree

603
00:28:49,308 --> 00:28:53,658
so before we go to commercial because

604
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:54,918
we're a little over but I want to make

605
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:57,559
sure that we hit on something because

606
00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:01,519
we've certainly talked about you know

607
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:05,028
how you moved toward growing these short

608
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,888
blooming types and it ended up being

609
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:09,409
kind of like just systemically you just

610
00:29:06,888 --> 00:29:11,178
started getting shorter ones because of

611
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:13,490
how you worked your sips which is really

612
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:17,028
interesting and then we've talked about

613
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:19,159
like the you know the the energetic

614
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:21,079
expression of these plants but there's

615
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:26,028
also people who are listening who are

616
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:28,990
like meticulous breeders who are looking

617
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:33,200
for some kind of guidance from you of

618
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:34,519
how to do the selection so before we you

619
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,619
know since second set we're going to be

620
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:39,169
talking more about Auto flowers I want

621
00:29:36,618 --> 00:29:41,178
to make sure that we get this in here so

622
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:44,240
would you explain to us a little more

623
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:48,440
like on the brass tacks like operational

624
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:53,028
level when you are doing your sips how

625
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:57,169
are you specifically selecting for short

626
00:29:53,028 --> 00:30:00,710
bloom cycles and making sure that you

627
00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:04,580
concentrate on those sure well you know

628
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:09,048
so I think I explained initially there

629
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:11,240
was some inadvertent sips that happened

630
00:30:09,048 --> 00:30:14,269
in the spring where we were prioritizing

631
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:17,720
breeding and so choosing first the

632
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:20,509
plants that showed out of that group

633
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:24,200
we'd choose the best ones and you know

634
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:27,860
then set them aside so that led to all

635
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:30,950
of a sudden now if we do that every

636
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:34,878
single season every every time we're

637
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:39,798
breeding then holy cow we can actually

638
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:43,428
make things almost flower too early too

639
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:47,808
quick and and that was problematic in

640
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:50,869
like 2005-2006 right around that time it

641
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:53,418
it dawned on me that look we I have a

642
00:30:50,868 --> 00:30:58,118
bunch of we're controlling this and so

643
00:30:53,419 --> 00:31:03,109
now let's control for exactly what

644
00:30:58,118 --> 00:31:06,468
farmers want which you know maybe that's

645
00:31:03,108 --> 00:31:09,978
a fuel type that normally would flower

646
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:12,889
and mid to late October let's see if we

647
00:31:09,979 --> 00:31:17,869
can get it to flower and finish you know

648
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:22,278
and admit mid to early October and that

649
00:31:17,868 --> 00:31:27,618
actually really was easier than I ever

650
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:30,378
thought and so basically what we were

651
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:33,829
doing was just initially seeing which

652
00:31:30,378 --> 00:31:37,638
one's happened to to show first and then

653
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:40,338
of that population putting that through

654
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:43,008
the other rigorous selection that we

655
00:31:40,338 --> 00:31:46,489
would normally do to make sure that it

656
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:49,038
had the you know phenotypic expressions

657
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:52,159
the type of terpenes that we're looking

658
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:55,398
for and and then eventually you know

659
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,739
testing for cannabinoids and all the the

660
00:31:55,398 --> 00:32:01,848
more detailed stuff that we have the

661
00:31:57,739 --> 00:32:05,088
capability to do now but you know gosh

662
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:08,058
this has been a 20-year process and it's

663
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:10,338
incredible what we can do now with you

664
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:12,558
know genomic stuff and and even just

665
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:17,628
simple like lab stuff that we can

666
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:22,638
utilize but back then and and something

667
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:25,808
that still no matter how fancy the

668
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:29,748
equipment that you have access to I

669
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:35,808
wholeheartedly believe that ninety

670
00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:40,548
percent of of any breeders work should

671
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:44,989
be basically a phenotypic selection and

672
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:47,929
or you know and the personal experience

673
00:32:44,989 --> 00:32:50,479
of smoking and and all just stuff that

674
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:52,788
you don't really need that expensive lab

675
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:55,129
equipment for and that's something that

676
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:57,558
kind of equalizes this industry which

677
00:32:55,128 --> 00:33:00,439
you know now we've got folks coming in

678
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:02,358
that have all the money in the world

679
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,469
suspend on all that lab equipment and

680
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:10,358
it's boy thank gosh that you really need

681
00:33:06,469 --> 00:33:14,179
to know the plant to be able to do

682
00:33:10,358 --> 00:33:16,359
proper cannabis breeding and the more

683
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:19,809
time and energy that you've spent with

684
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:24,459
plant the more that you understand how

685
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:27,519
malleable and how to to you know form

686
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,919
that in in a direction that you want

687
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,399
like let's say a quicker flowering type

688
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,009
plant the more years that you've got

689
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:38,889
under your belt the the better that the

690
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:42,908
easier that'll be for you but for folks

691
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:45,669
that really want to try that I it's it's

692
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:48,039
a couple things you know early on you

693
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:51,100
can really be effective by just doing

694
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:55,408
selection and noting which ones do show

695
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:59,528
sex earliest that is more powerful than

696
00:33:55,409 --> 00:34:03,789
anyone would probably expect and it was

697
00:33:59,528 --> 00:34:06,519
something that dawned on us years ago we

698
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:07,898
almost did too much of that we kind of

699
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,389
reversed it now we've learned how to

700
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:13,628
control it and then of course the next

701
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:16,269
thing is just you know looking at

702
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:20,259
flowering if the cool thing is is you

703
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:23,199
can do it real time you can say you know

704
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:25,659
this plant is flowering now I can see

705
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:28,598
that it's gonna finish up early I can

706
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:30,338
see that it's probably gonna avoid you

707
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,490
know the weather I know that's coming in

708
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:35,469
late October and this is the one that

709
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:37,949
I'm going to select to pollinate but

710
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:42,699
just you know make sure that you're not

711
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:46,210
compromising what you you know the most

712
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:49,000
important thing I think is the varietal

713
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:53,949
that you're going after and those traits

714
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:57,579
the terpenes and the structure if you

715
00:34:53,949 --> 00:35:01,989
like beautiful buds which I love you

716
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:04,838
know frosty trichome coated buds that's

717
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:08,289
another important factor obviously not

718
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:09,730
to ignore but um you know sometimes

719
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:12,909
those things aren't necessarily exactly

720
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:16,179
related like that frosty us buds are not

721
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:20,379
always the ones that test highest for

722
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:23,250
THC D or whatever so you know I think

723
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:27,010
those those are all important things but

724
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:29,050
essentially you can you can change

725
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,190
things and I think as we go into this

726
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:33,760
Auto flower discussion

727
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:37,300
next I'm holding back on a few others

728
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:42,869
that I think are relevant to that too

729
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:42,869
because that's an obviously those are

730
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,949
you know I don't even want to say early

731
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:52,869
but it's it's a whole different animal

732
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:56,739
but there are what we call heterozygotes

733
00:35:52,869 --> 00:36:00,960
which is sort of combinations of both of

734
00:35:56,739 --> 00:36:04,059
those characteristics that pop up and

735
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,900
there are ways to take traits that you

736
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:11,199
like and in a photo period type and

737
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:12,760
transpose them on to the auto type or or

738
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:16,088
have a heterozygote which sometimes

739
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,550
lands right in the middle so so then

740
00:36:16,088 --> 00:36:20,409
let's let's leave that there as a nice

741
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:22,839
little tasty bit to encourage people to

742
00:36:20,409 --> 00:36:24,818
come back for second set and go ahead

743
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:26,769
and take our first short break you're

744
00:36:24,818 --> 00:36:29,619
listening to shaping fire and my guest

745
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:32,679
today is nat Pennington founder of

746
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:34,450
Humboldt seed company one of the reasons

747
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:36,250
why no-till cannabis growing is so

748
00:36:34,449 --> 00:36:38,169
valued by farmers is because the

749
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,719
mycelium networks in the soil remain

750
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,730
established from year to year and we

751
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,259
know these fungal networks are essential

752
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,358
because they are the nutrients

753
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,160
superhighways that extend far and wide

754
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:50,980
in the substrate to feed your plants

755
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:53,108
the trouble with growing in new soils or

756
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,179
blended cocoa substrates is that it

757
00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:58,088
takes most of the plant's life just to

758
00:36:55,179 --> 00:37:00,549
create these mycelium highways Dino

759
00:36:58,088 --> 00:37:03,159
Michael endo mycorrhizal fungi inoculant

760
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:05,740
reduces that time and gets your plant

761
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:08,379
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

762
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:10,118
and it's three times the concentration

763
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:13,568
of the current leading brand in the u.s.

764
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:15,519
at 900 propagules per gram of to fungal

765
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:18,190
species selected specifically for

766
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,469
cannabis cultivation this new product

767
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:22,150
called Dino my co is the result of 30

768
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:23,828
years of research and trials at the

769
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:26,200
volcanic a Greek ultra research

770
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:28,420
institute in Israel it has also been

771
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:30,279
vigorously trialed by cannabis and food

772
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,769
growers across the u.s. since the

773
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,910
product first arrived here last year you

774
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:35,889
may have already even heard about

775
00:37:33,909 --> 00:37:36,879
dynamite go by its original name

776
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:40,059
dynamite

777
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,190
now Dino myko is available at grow shops

778
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:43,779
and online in the United States for the

779
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:45,820
first time I'd

780
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,500
love using dynamite go to both speed up

781
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,320
the growth of mycelium networks in the

782
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,659
soil but also as a bio stimulant to make

783
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,700
clone cuttings more virile you can see

784

00:43:56,849 --> 00:44:01,739

946
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,360
flowers in your catalog this year which

947
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:06,329
tells me you've probably been messing

948
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:08,849
with them for a few years and you know a

949
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:12,239
lot of us get a lot of flack from

950
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:13,230
growers who like big cannabis trees and

951
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,269
these are a lot of the people who

952
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,949
respect you and and have liked the

953
00:44:15,269 --> 00:44:19,739
cultivars that you've brought to market

954
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:21,750
and I'm a pretty public proponent for

955
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:23,669
Auto flowers for people with certain

956
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:27,059
needs you know what

957
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:30,030
has been your motivation to go ahead and

958
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:31,440
explore Otto flowers when you're when

959
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:33,720
you're you know when you've been serving

960
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:38,190
these other folks who like big trees for

961
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:42,358
so long well I do have to say that I

962
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:46,380
love big trees and that's been sort of

963
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:48,598
the classic uh Emerald triangle or even

964
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:51,420
like the kind of the whole north glass

965
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:55,170
so yeah you know we've been growing

966
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:57,559
trees for a long time and gosh back in

967
00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:03,720
the days when it was you know we had

968
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:07,140
sort of these quasi guidance from from

969
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:09,899
the you know got state or whatever the

970
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:12,690
police that you know you could do 99

971
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:16,769
plants or whatever it was we it would be

972
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:21,240
like just a personal challenge like 99

973
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:24,809
trees make them as big as possible you

974
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:27,689
like with look at Google Earth that he'd

975
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:31,619
be like now is that at almond orchard or

976
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:37,530
a cannabis I can't really even tell but

977
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:40,200
uh yeah so you know I I miss those trees

978
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:43,410
because these days it's there's not a

979
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:48,389
much motivation to do things that way

980
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:51,858
there you have these you know rules

981
00:45:48,389 --> 00:45:54,868
basically you've got square footage and

982
00:45:51,858 --> 00:45:56,480
you can have as many plants as you want

983
00:45:54,869 --> 00:46:00,298
inside of that square footage so

984
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:05,269
sometimes production does increase when

985
00:46:00,298 --> 00:46:05,269
you know you're doing things that way so

986
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:16,159
Otto's I think in a lot of respects just

987
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:18,450
completely change the whole paradigm and

988
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:21,149
why did we start breeding them well I

989
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:25,739
think you know my top answer would be

990
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:28,530
basically it was curiosity that that

991
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:31,409
drove me to start playing around with

992
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:33,839
autos and I've learned that you know

993
00:46:31,409 --> 00:46:35,460
even though humbled is obviously world

994
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:37,349
renowned for growing eighth grade

995
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,509
cannabis that

996
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:41,459
if we just think that we're doing it

997
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:45,088
perfectly well and we don't have

998
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:47,998
anything to you know that we could be

999
00:46:45,088 --> 00:46:52,199
learning from others then that's you

1000
00:46:47,998 --> 00:46:55,618
know not gonna do us any favors so you

1001
00:46:52,199 --> 00:47:01,938
know got some auto flower seeds gave him

1002
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:05,399
a try wasn't initially you know thrilled

1003
00:47:01,938 --> 00:47:09,028
like I and I that is the general

1004
00:47:05,398 --> 00:47:13,438
sometimes the the preconception or the

1005
00:47:09,028 --> 00:47:16,798
stereotype around them and so you know

1006
00:47:13,438 --> 00:47:19,379
look it was a challenge to say hey let's

1007
00:47:16,798 --> 00:47:21,179
maybe see what we can do and see if we

1008
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:23,599
can change it and and I think as I

1009
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:27,088
mentioned earlier I've always been

1010
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:32,249
really amazed at how malleable that

1011
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:36,119
species is how you know much of our own

1012
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:37,848
influence we can have on the evolution

1013
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:42,889
of the plants and things like that how

1014
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:47,899
how they change for us and with us so

1015
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:51,199
yeah autos it's really it's unbelievable

1016
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:54,058
just with our own breeding projects and

1017
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:58,349
looking at quite a few different auto

1018
00:47:54,059 --> 00:48:03,509
cultivars making crosses and then making

1019
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:06,088
selections you know it only took two or

1020
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:08,539
three years before I was I think last

1021
00:48:06,088 --> 00:48:11,159
year was when we came out with our first

1022
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:14,929
you know fully endorse taught a line

1023
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:18,449
that was in our catalog and available

1024
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:20,219
for folks wherever but you know maybe

1025
00:48:18,449 --> 00:48:23,548
the year before that I we were kind of

1026
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:24,778
test running some locally with friends

1027
00:48:23,548 --> 00:48:29,548
in the community and things like that

1028
00:48:24,778 --> 00:48:32,608
but you know last year people were happy

1029
00:48:29,548 --> 00:48:34,679
and this year we were able to refine

1030
00:48:32,608 --> 00:48:39,449
that you know during last year's

1031
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:41,548
breeding process and now we've got to

1032
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:44,668
varietals that were really really

1033
00:48:41,548 --> 00:48:47,458
endorsing and you know putting out there

1034
00:48:44,668 --> 00:48:49,168
then we made a bunch of seeds and the

1035
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:50,519
test results weren't exactly what we

1036
00:48:49,168 --> 00:48:52,049
were you know

1037
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:54,469
we were thrilled with but those are

1038
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:58,410
available for folks who might want to do

1039
00:48:54,469 --> 00:49:03,719
you know I think it's that's kind of

1040
00:48:58,409 --> 00:49:10,250
like a big field that would just be for

1041
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:10,250
biomass or something like that so yeah

1042
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:17,660
I think there's a ton of potential with

1043
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:23,750
a lot of flour and I think that that

1044
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:28,379
we're going to be able to make that we

1045
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:32,219
more conducive to what people expect

1046
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:33,750
from cannabis these days so you know the

1047
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,949
the thing a lot of people go for the

1048
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,719
Otto flowers I mean you and I have

1049
00:49:34,949 --> 00:49:39,509
talked a lot about October weather and

1050
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:40,889
how much it sucks at this point and one

1051
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:43,260
of the things people love about him is

1052
00:49:40,889 --> 00:49:46,289
that you can you know start them earlier

1053
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:48,930
in EM you know May or June and be done

1054
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:51,840
by August or the beginning of September

1055
00:49:48,929 --> 00:49:53,759
and they they finish when it's bright

1056
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:57,660
and sunny out they've got these kick-ass

1057
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,940
terpene profiles and you know it's

1058
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:02,549
interesting to experience it from the

1059
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:05,130
growers side but I'm assuming that there

1060
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:07,050
have there are some breeding intricacies

1061
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:09,660
that you have to be aware of when

1062
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:12,140
breeding the auto flowers that you don't

1063
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:14,849
have to be aware of when you're breeding

1064
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:19,199
regular seeds will you shine some light

1065
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:25,469
on that yeah well you know one of the

1066
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:26,399
things was that uh I mean a lot of

1067
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:30,618
people that don't have a ton of

1068
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:35,460
experience with autos are just like

1069
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:38,039
don't realize that you cannot make

1070
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:41,369
clones see you like our whole breeding

1071
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:47,579
process where we do phenotype hunting

1072
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:52,230
and you know take clones of fout I mean

1073
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:57,840
last year in 2018 we literally looked

1074
00:50:52,230 --> 00:51:03,030
over 10,000 plants in this collaborative

1075
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:04,110
phenotype hunt effort and we're able to

1076
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,730
take caught

1077
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:07,800
it's off of every single one of them

1078
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:11,519
while they were you know still in a

1079
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:13,910
vegetative form preserve them and mark

1080
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:18,690
them from the field to the clone tre and

1081
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:21,119
it was a huge effort I'm we may do it

1082
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:24,329
again this year we we actually only

1083
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:26,250
ended up doing 2500 but you know that's

1084
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:28,380
still really significant and I feel like

1085
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:32,130
we kind of were able to focus even more

1086
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:34,079
on those so we did kind of the same

1087
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:36,960
result from a little bit of a smaller

1088
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:39,000
batch but you can't do that with autos

1089
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,000
so when you're breeding audit because

1090
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,730
they'll just there's no veg there or

1091
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,869
there is veg but there's notes taking a

1092
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:51,889
clone and keeping that strain in veg so

1093
00:51:48,869 --> 00:51:54,869
that you can you know have it kind of

1094
00:51:51,889 --> 00:51:56,549
permanently you know you couldn't put an

1095
00:51:54,869 --> 00:52:00,119
auto flower into tissue culture for

1096
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:03,150
example because it would you know flower

1097
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:04,710
inside the tissue culture and to be

1098
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:10,079
ridiculous so there's a whole bunch of

1099
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:13,820
different breeding constraints but you

1100
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:16,940
know you can also cycle through breeding

1101
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:20,130
generations quick very quickly because

1102
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:21,300
you know you've only got three menthe

1103
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:23,760
you only have to wait three months

1104
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:26,330
before you might have your next

1105
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,400
generation and and you may have made

1106
00:52:26,329 --> 00:52:34,880
significant improvement in that period

1107
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:40,079
of time so we look at it differently

1108
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:43,530
where we're really doing more of kind of

1109
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,989
this traditional breeding that people

1110
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:50,250
have done for years with things like you

1111
00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:53,219
know corn and Mendel's pea plants and

1112
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:59,070
it's neat because you can utilize a lot

1113
00:52:53,219 --> 00:53:01,919
of those methodologies and not kind of

1114
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:03,840
confuse yourself with you know keeping

1115
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,960
things clonally and breeding with them

1116
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:10,170
but I do have to say there are

1117
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:13,260
advantages to being able to select one

1118
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:15,119
clone out of 10,000 plants and then

1119
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,539
breed with that I mean without a doubt

1120
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:21,318
that gives you a huge advantage

1121
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:25,579
and allows you to progress really

1122
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:28,568
quickly in developing the trait

1123
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:33,369
expressions that you are looking for so

1124
00:53:28,568 --> 00:53:37,099
you know will we get autos that are

1125
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:40,659
comparable or you know maybe even

1126
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:46,429
superior to photoperiod type varieties I

1127
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:48,829
think so and I think in a lot of ways

1128
00:53:46,429 --> 00:53:53,088
the advantages that you get of having a

1129
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:56,149
quicker turn over potentially might

1130
00:53:53,088 --> 00:53:58,038
almost equal out with the the

1131
00:53:56,148 --> 00:54:00,768
disadvantages of not being able to

1132
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:05,239
choose but it may take a little while

1133
00:54:00,768 --> 00:54:09,618
before we're able to make things that

1134
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:13,249
are quite as uniform in their very

1135
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:17,479
specific expression so you know if

1136
00:54:13,248 --> 00:54:20,778
you've got a field of a few thousand

1137
00:54:17,478 --> 00:54:22,358
Auto flowers and you're pollinating and

1138
00:54:20,778 --> 00:54:25,639
you're going out there and now you're

1139
00:54:22,358 --> 00:54:31,068
choosing the very best one out of that

1140
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:35,048
field you're not able to take a clone of

1141
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:39,139
it and keep that and then you know put

1142
00:54:35,048 --> 00:54:42,858
like basically cross either sell fit or

1143
00:54:39,139 --> 00:54:45,858
cross into it and and create like a

1144
00:54:42,858 --> 00:54:49,909
really stable homozygous line for those

1145
00:54:45,858 --> 00:54:52,848
specific traits but you know you can

1146
00:54:49,909 --> 00:54:57,199
actually have a big field like that and

1147
00:54:52,849 --> 00:55:00,739
you can hone in on one plant and then if

1148
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:03,559
you are pollinating you can select the

1149
00:55:00,739 --> 00:55:07,969
seeds from that plant and then you've

1150
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:13,028
got at least a population that you 100%

1151
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:15,798
know you know is likely to display that

1152
00:55:13,028 --> 00:55:17,358
trait that you're you know the the

1153
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:20,298
attractive trait that you were after

1154
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:22,969
maybe you know at least 25% of the time

1155
00:55:20,298 --> 00:55:26,239
and then if you back cross it again

1156
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:28,929
you're gonna get 50 and so on and so

1157
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,929
forth so

1158
00:55:29,019 --> 00:55:32,679
if that makes sense yeah it does and

1159
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:34,690
it's interesting to to hear you talk

1160
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:37,029
about you know the traits that you're

1161
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:39,250
trying to lock down because you know a

1162
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:41,860
lot of folks complain about autos that

1163
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:43,210
there is so much variety I mean actually

1164
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,769
I mean people complain about a lot of

1165
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:46,780
things right number one that there's

1166
00:55:44,769 --> 00:55:49,900
smaller plants number two that there's

1167
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:51,790
you know more phenotypic variety number

1168
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:55,900
three that maybe they don't have the

1169
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:58,929
same quality terpene profiles as some

1170
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:02,079
reg seeds and it's interesting if that

1171
00:55:58,929 --> 00:56:05,469
those complaints don't apply to all auto

1172
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:08,319
flower seeds but they certainly apply to

1173
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:10,739
many if not most because we're still in

1174
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:14,230
the early days of auto flowers and

1175
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:17,019
they're they're they're very useful for

1176
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:18,880
particular types of patients and for

1177
00:56:17,019 --> 00:56:21,519
particular home growers and for

1178
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,380
particular commercial folks but they're

1179
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:25,150
not for everybody nor are they designed

1180
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,550
that way but here's my question for you

1181
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:30,490
you know one of the things I like about

1182
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:32,980
you is that you don't just have all of

1183
00:56:30,489 --> 00:56:35,409
your staff in the front of your booth

1184
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:37,900
selling seeds you are there yourself and

1185
00:56:35,409 --> 00:56:40,389
you're talking to your customers and you

1186
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:42,070
are your you're explaining them how the

1187
00:56:40,389 --> 00:56:44,789
seeds are gonna work best for their life

1188
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:48,309
so you've spent you know some shows now

1189
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:50,500
selling these auto flower seeds what is

1190
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:53,500
the response that you are seeing from

1191
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:56,199
people who are looking for auto flower

1192
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,940
solutions do you think that enough

1193
00:56:56,199 --> 00:57:00,579
people know about them now that as

1194
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:02,619
somebody who makes seeds and puts them

1195
00:57:00,579 --> 00:57:04,449
out to the people that people are coming

1196
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:06,250
to you and going hell yeah Auto flowers

1197
00:57:04,449 --> 00:57:13,089
are you seeing that yet or is this

1198
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:17,250
mostly just heads still uh you know I'd

1199
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:17,250
say it's a little bit of a mix basically

1200
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:27,430
we're seeing folks that a lot of it is

1201
00:57:22,769 --> 00:57:31,780
folks that are you know looking to do it

1202
00:57:27,429 --> 00:57:37,449
an industrial type cannabis agriculture

1203
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:39,460
in California and you know it's I think

1204
00:57:37,449 --> 00:57:43,819
that it's going to change things a lot

1205
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:45,389
the way that that autos allow

1206
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:47,250
plants eh

1207
00:57:45,389 --> 00:57:48,869
one of the really things I think it's

1208
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:51,869
really positive about it is I think it

1209
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:54,179
does have the capability of reducing the

1210
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:56,299
environmental impact and don't get me

1211
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:58,829
wrong I don't believe that cannabis has

1212
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:03,060
very much of an environmental impact

1213
00:57:58,829 --> 00:58:06,679
because you know compared to the big AG

1214
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:06,679
that we have in the Central Valley is

1215
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:19,549
you know a lot I mean it's gotten this

1216
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:22,710
kind of misplaced stereotype as in

1217
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:25,500
especially here in Humboldt for some

1218
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:27,809
reason and and I would have been a part

1219
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:32,940
of the Humboldt environmental movement

1220
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:37,049
my entire adult life and can honestly

1221
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:40,590
say that there has been a major impacts

1222
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:45,060
that you know pre cannabis that are

1223
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:48,269
still you know not healed up but I'm

1224
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:50,460
always looking for ways to lessen impact

1225
00:58:48,269 --> 00:58:55,650
and I think Otto flowers is a good way

1226
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:58,679
to do that particularly in places like

1227
00:58:55,650 --> 00:59:02,460
the Central Valley where there actually

1228
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:07,079
is a major shortage of water and we do

1229
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:09,000
have wildlife that's suffering and

1230
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:12,569
teetering on the brink of extinction so

1231
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,210
that's like really good outcome of of

1232
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:22,440
Otto flower types I think for the

1233
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:24,630
hobbyist grower that people have more of

1234
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:27,599
an opportunity to be able to grow

1235
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:30,030
cannabis because we're bringing this

1236
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,519
Otto flower trait into the mix because

1237
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:35,340
you know you can put it in a small pot

1238
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:38,070
even if you live in an apartment and if

1239
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:40,559
you have a balcony and actually still

1240
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:43,110
harvest your own cannabis which I love I

1241
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:47,909
mean as much as we're a company that

1242
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:54,200
does service you know this growing

1243
00:59:47,909 --> 00:59:57,049
industry which I still you know think of

1244
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:58,909
as a community but there's no doubt that

1245
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:02,750
that there is an industry that's

1246
00:59:58,909 --> 01:00:05,960
developing and you know we do service

1247
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:10,699
that but what I really enjoy most about

1248
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:15,050
what we do is interacting with small

1249
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:18,319
farms and hobbyists and you know like

1250
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:20,570
grow your own kind of people and we have

1251
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:23,300
quite a few people that are that are

1252
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:26,210
experimenting with autos and and having

1253
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,960
a really good experience just in their

1254
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:30,320
backyard

1255
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:33,889
even in the coastal climates and humble

1256
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:37,420
it it's a totally different story

1257
01:00:33,889 --> 01:00:40,069
because you know there actually are

1258
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:43,760
there is a period of time here in

1259
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:46,460
Humboldt on the coast where humble it's

1260
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:50,480
famous for cannabis but that's like the

1261
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:53,869
inland is where that has always come

1262
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:56,510
from but we have this fog layer and in

1263
01:00:53,869 --> 01:00:59,140
the urban area of Humboldt which is like

1264
01:00:56,510 --> 01:01:02,119
really where most of the population is

1265
01:00:59,139 --> 01:01:04,670
it's not the greatest place to grow

1266
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:06,730
cannabis because we get fog every day

1267
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:11,420
that's why we have redwood trees and

1268
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:12,650
things like that and but people you know

1269
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:15,260
it's Humboldt so people still love

1270
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:19,190
cannabis so they're here you know

1271
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:21,530
growing it and we love that we can now

1272
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:24,260
offer them something that they can

1273
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:27,349
harvest in late July or early August

1274
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:31,010
when Humboldt is actually at its

1275
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:33,230
sunniest and they have a great

1276
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:36,530
experience with it which is what we want

1277
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:39,490
we want folks to have a good experience

1278
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:43,430
and an even endure to you know you can

1279
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:46,629
leave your lights on 24 hours if you

1280
01:01:43,429 --> 01:01:50,210
want and our Auto flowers will still

1281
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:52,940
flower and you'll still get bud and so

1282
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:55,929
while you know you're still kind of

1283
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:58,039
using a similar amount of electricity

1284
01:01:55,929 --> 01:02:00,769
you know maybe you're using a little

1285
01:01:58,039 --> 01:02:03,139
less water and you're not taking up so

1286
01:02:00,769 --> 01:02:06,530
much space for so long and you're

1287
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:08,000
probably kind of increasing the amount

1288
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:10,130
of flower that you're getting

1289
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:14,119
for that electricity that you're putting

1290
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:16,490
in so yeah I think it is advantageous in

1291
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:19,130
a lot of ways and yeah and using that

1292
01:02:16,489 --> 01:02:21,409
particular example about the the having

1293
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:25,190
the lights on you know whether it be 16

1294
01:02:21,409 --> 01:02:26,420
18 or 24 hours one of the theses of

1295
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:29,510
feedback I get back from people all the

1296
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:33,260
time like oh it just turned my veg room

1297
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:34,940
into a room that yields flour like like

1298
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:37,970
had all this extra room in my bedroom

1299
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:41,119
and and now people can actually run

1300
01:02:37,969 --> 01:02:42,739
autos there and certainly that helps

1301
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:45,139
with resources more than more than

1302
01:02:42,739 --> 01:02:47,119
anything it's a huge advantage to the

1303
01:02:45,139 --> 01:02:50,569
grower yeah

1304
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:54,199
and you know you're planting from seed

1305
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:56,809
every time which you know that

1306
01:02:54,199 --> 01:03:00,460
alleviates the need to have you know a

1307
01:02:56,809 --> 01:03:04,670
whole nother space to keep moms alive or

1308
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:09,130
also it alleviates the need to bring

1309
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:13,450
genetics to and from - I mean you know

1310
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:15,980
all people I say cannabis has been

1311
01:03:13,449 --> 01:03:17,509
sprayed with a lot of pesticides well I

1312
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:20,300
don't necessarily think that's the case

1313
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:24,470
I mean I know for a fact that the

1314
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:29,030
standards that were held to here now in

1315
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:31,779
California and in most legal you know

1316
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:34,610
with licenses and all that stuff you

1317
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:37,220
literally there's no other agricultural

1318
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:39,400
crop in the world that is as clean as

1319
01:03:37,219 --> 01:03:43,519
what we produce because it goes through

1320
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:46,160
the most rigorous testing in the world

1321
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:52,570
they have baby formula that isn't as

1322
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:56,629
pure as our cannabis but anyway you know

1323
01:03:52,570 --> 01:04:00,860
it's growing from seed not having - when

1324
01:03:56,630 --> 01:04:02,450
when there were problems with pests it

1325
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:05,260
was just basically because you know

1326
01:04:02,449 --> 01:04:09,250
essentially somebody ground a good cut

1327
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:12,710
they shared it with their neighbor and

1328
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:14,809
their neighbors shared it with the other

1329
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:17,329
person and and so on and so forth and

1330
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:19,909
and undoubtedly one of those people

1331
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:20,929
might have had a infestation some bugs

1332
01:04:19,909 --> 01:04:22,639
and

1333
01:04:20,929 --> 01:04:25,219
and then those bugs hitched a ride over

1334
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:27,098
to the other place and so on and so

1335
01:04:25,219 --> 01:04:30,469
forth and so that was like how we spread

1336
01:04:27,099 --> 01:04:34,088
pests and pathogens historically in the

1337
01:04:30,469 --> 01:04:37,969
cannabis industry and you know of course

1338
01:04:34,088 --> 01:04:40,429
some people were willing to compromise

1339
01:04:37,969 --> 01:04:42,949
there maybe their morals or maybe they

1340
01:04:40,429 --> 01:04:44,509
didn't have the greatest one morals

1341
01:04:42,949 --> 01:04:48,250
they're spray these really nasty things

1342
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:51,740
on it and so because autumn flowers

1343
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:54,230
there's really no you're not never gonna

1344
01:04:51,739 --> 01:04:57,669
or you're much less likely to take a

1345
01:04:54,230 --> 01:05:00,380
plant from one grow to another grow

1346
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:02,119
you're just more likely you're just

1347
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:05,300
gonna sprout some seeds right inside

1348
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:08,599
your growth and that's there's all the

1349
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:11,900
much less likelihood of getting

1350
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:13,970
something from another you know passing

1351
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,680
around these pests and pathogens so I

1352
01:05:13,969 --> 01:05:17,598
actually really like that you know i've

1353
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:19,250
been i've been talking about autos for i

1354
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,480
know better part of a year now maybe a

1355
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:22,219
little more than a year talking to

1356
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,230
people about it push them and i had

1357
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:26,449
never really considered that they're

1358
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:28,068
more hygienic because we're not moving

1359
01:05:26,449 --> 01:05:29,659
our cuts around as much because they're

1360
01:05:28,068 --> 01:05:34,009
all from seed that's a really good point

1361
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:36,710
yeah absolutely and you know i think we

1362
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:40,250
were starting to talk about cannabis and

1363
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:44,690
the specie outs of a malleable species

1364
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:49,119
and you know I sometimes don't love the

1365
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:53,358
terminology of plant breeding in and

1366
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:55,880
biotech terminology but what you say is

1367
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:59,210
that you're improving you know this is

1368
01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:02,900
an improved varietal over what it was

1369
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:05,088
before and you know don't get me wrong

1370
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:08,329
like I love landrace I think we have to

1371
01:06:05,088 --> 01:06:10,808
preserve seeds we can't let these

1372
01:06:08,329 --> 01:06:13,430
classic and original cannabis varietals

1373
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:18,079
disappear that's why we keep like a

1374
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:21,318
really really robust seed bank here and

1375
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:23,599
humble and there should be that kind of

1376
01:06:21,318 --> 01:06:28,568
an effort everywhere but you know we are

1377
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:33,200
basically still improving things for

1378
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:36,210
what what it is that we want to see and

1379
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:40,469
if a plant that just flowers no matter

1380
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:43,289
what you do if and it starts flowering a

1381
01:06:40,469 --> 01:06:45,750
month after you sprout the seed and then

1382
01:06:43,289 --> 01:06:49,829
lo and behold the flowers are just about

1383
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:53,849
finished after 90 days from sprout to

1384
01:06:49,829 --> 01:06:55,799
finish or even shorter sometimes and if

1385
01:06:53,849 --> 01:06:58,170
that is something that really gives

1386
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:00,420
certain advantages like the ones that

1387
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:03,329
you just discussed I mean they might be

1388
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:05,639
good for just getting more weed they

1389
01:07:03,329 --> 01:07:09,090
might be good for the environment they

1390
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:11,159
might save money and energy or maybe

1391
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:12,240
they're cleaner I don't think there's

1392
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:15,569
anything wrong with that

1393
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:18,599
and particularly you know I'm not

1394
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:22,559
talking about going in and splicing

1395
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:25,230
genes or even editing them with CRISPR

1396
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,059
or something like that I'm just talking

1397
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:29,039
about real traditional breeding

1398
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:33,239
practices where basically I mean that's

1399
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:37,289
how we got all of the food just about

1400
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:41,399
that we enjoy today like the things that

1401
01:07:37,289 --> 01:07:44,579
we grow at least and you know that's

1402
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:47,849
gonna happen and I think it's it's a lot

1403
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:51,960
of fun to be a part of that plant you

1404
01:07:47,849 --> 01:07:55,259
know and seed improvement and with autos

1405
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:57,990
I've it's it's crazy how I've just been

1406
01:07:55,260 --> 01:08:00,510
able to see you know taking an auto

1407
01:07:57,989 --> 01:08:03,329
flower and crossing it with you know

1408
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:05,070
like a stream we did last year we have

1409
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:08,159
this vanilla frosting strain and it's a

1410
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:10,620
higher THC one and it's got this

1411
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:14,879
beautiful smell and you know really

1412
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:17,250
attractive strain and you know we're

1413
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:20,730
moving that towards being an auto flower

1414
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:23,130
strain just by crossing it with similar

1415
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:26,519
types of autos and it's happening

1416
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:30,119
quicker than I ever expected so you know

1417
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:32,040
it won't be long before we're able to

1418
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:36,449
say look here's this auto flowering

1419
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:39,689
version of strains that we've all come

1420
01:08:36,449 --> 01:08:41,279
to know and love and it shouldn't really

1421
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:44,849
there's there's nothing that says that

1422
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:46,798
it has to compromise the things that

1423
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:48,630
we've come to love about those strains

1424
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:50,809
you know it doesn't like your fur

1425
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:55,798
blueberry muffin we're also working on a

1426
01:08:50,809 --> 01:08:58,679
blueberry muffin OTO and it has this you

1427
01:08:55,798 --> 01:09:03,630
know it's a strain that we created in

1428
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:06,480
2008 or way back and it really smells

1429
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:10,230
just like blueberry muffins and it's got

1430
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:13,919
pretty purple color and you know a lot

1431
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:15,149
of really nice traits about it and and I

1432
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,809
don't think there's anything wrong with

1433
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:22,229
trying to make that so that you know

1434
01:09:17,809 --> 01:09:25,710
someone could get some seeds and plant

1435
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:27,988
them and maybe do it on their balcony

1436
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:31,408
early in the year mid May and then the

1437
01:09:27,988 --> 01:09:33,209
next thing they've got they just you

1438
01:09:31,408 --> 01:09:34,979
know plant it on their balcony and they

1439
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:38,698
can use the little railing as a trellis

1440
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:41,068
then have their friends over and show

1441
01:09:38,698 --> 01:09:44,158
them the plan it's a lot of fun harvest

1442
01:09:41,069 --> 01:09:46,469
and and then they've got something that

1443
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:49,920
they've you know created themselves and

1444
01:09:46,469 --> 01:09:52,039
I think everybody kind of you know who

1445
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:56,118
enjoys that more like I've always had

1446
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:57,960
kids around in my life and you know kids

1447
01:09:56,118 --> 01:10:01,139
it's hard to get them to eat their

1448
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:04,319
vegetables right and so we I would

1449
01:10:01,139 --> 01:10:06,199
always have a garden and I always found

1450
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:09,299
that if you get the kid out there and

1451
01:10:06,198 --> 01:10:12,388
they're the ones that planted the

1452
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,960
cauliflower or even worse the brussel

1453
01:10:12,389 --> 01:10:17,069
sprouts

1454
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:19,349
and you know now it's harvest time and

1455
01:10:17,069 --> 01:10:21,328
you get them out there and they get to

1456
01:10:19,349 --> 01:10:24,150
be the one that harvests it and

1457
01:10:21,328 --> 01:10:27,569
everything boy do they love Brussels

1458
01:10:24,149 --> 01:10:31,019
sprouts when they bounce and you know I

1459
01:10:27,569 --> 01:10:34,769
think that's it's funny because when we

1460
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:37,800
first started you know really having a

1461
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:42,119
decent distribution for the seed company

1462
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:44,789
here you know I would be really critical

1463
01:10:42,118 --> 01:10:47,098
in myself and and of our genetics and we

1464
01:10:44,789 --> 01:10:49,500
like I've always been right here in

1465
01:10:47,099 --> 01:10:53,309
Humboldt County and I always felt like

1466
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:56,789
oh man and of all the places too you

1467
01:10:53,309 --> 01:10:59,730
know if someone's gonna think you know

1468
01:10:56,789 --> 01:11:01,619
know that these seeds aren't good or

1469
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:05,399
whatever reason it's gonna be Humboldt

1470
01:11:01,619 --> 01:11:09,539
ian's because they they know what to

1471
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:12,929
expect and what maybe didn't work out or

1472
01:11:09,539 --> 01:11:14,670
whatever they're gonna tell you so so so

1473
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:16,079
when breeding these auto flowers you

1474
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:18,750
know one of the odd things about is that

1475
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:20,399
your you need to take your your cultivar

1476
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:22,859
that you that you're you know you want

1477
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:26,639
to emulate if you will and and you're

1478
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:28,649
more usually just crossing into a

1479
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:32,940
ruderalis so that you can get that Auto

1480
01:11:28,649 --> 01:11:35,639
flower tendency but then a lot of people

1481
01:11:32,939 --> 01:11:38,069
are concerned about the the taste of the

1482
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:41,970
ruderalis which is you know not usually

1483
01:11:38,069 --> 01:11:45,179
awesome really tamping down the flavor

1484
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:47,850
of the of the you know cultivar that

1485
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:50,119
you're you're trying to make auto have

1486
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:53,039
you found that to be like especially

1487
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:56,399
challenging or is it like add now you

1488
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:57,988
just take some time and effort well I

1489
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:00,889
think that that is a really good point

1490
01:11:57,988 --> 01:12:03,389
and I but I think that it's a little bit

1491
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:05,700
outdated and there's nothing wrong with

1492
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:07,140
that so if people are listening out

1493
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:12,510
there they're like that's what I think

1494
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:15,780
I'm like look I totally get it but and

1495
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:19,170
since we were working with just like low

1496
01:12:15,779 --> 01:12:22,979
rider some of these original auto flower

1497
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:25,260
genetics that are really clearly you

1498
01:12:22,979 --> 01:12:27,779
know kind of a subspecies of cannabis

1499
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:30,090
because people always say there's like

1500
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:32,340
ruderalis and there's Steven in to come

1501
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:36,960
and I think we all know that there's a

1502
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:40,520
lot more to it than just that but if

1503
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:48,329
that is the defining characteristic of

1504
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:52,290
ruderalis then to me that is just the

1505
01:12:48,329 --> 01:12:54,809
defining characteristic and I've seen

1506
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:59,060
firsthand that you can completely and

1507
01:12:54,810 --> 01:13:02,460
totally isolate that one trait which is

1508
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:05,489
I'm gonna flower literally a month after

1509
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:07,770
I germinate and I'm gonna start going

1510
01:13:05,488 --> 01:13:11,909
towards flowering and and I'll be done

1511
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:13,050
in three months rather than whenever you

1512
01:13:11,909 --> 01:13:15,239
know two

1513
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:19,920
months after the light changes to 12:12

1514
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:23,550
or the photoperiod type so I I do

1515
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:26,069
believe that really that is a a trait

1516
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:28,529
that you can absolutely isolate and you

1517
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:32,359
don't necessarily need to bring some of

1518
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:36,989
the more negative connotations to

1519
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:40,609
ruderalis along with that so but that

1520
01:13:36,989 --> 01:13:43,469
involves a lot of selective reading and

1521
01:13:40,609 --> 01:13:47,039
you know essentially if you cross a

1522
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:50,970
complete reader Alice with a blueberry

1523
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:53,399
muffin then you're gonna have a whole

1524
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:57,090
bunch of progeny and some of them are

1525
01:13:53,399 --> 01:14:01,049
not going to be ruderalis or auto flour

1526
01:13:57,090 --> 01:14:02,789
type some of them are not gonna be they

1527
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:05,670
will be but they won't be blueberry

1528
01:14:02,789 --> 01:14:07,619
muffin at all they'll be more you know

1529
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:10,880
what you started with the auto flour

1530
01:14:07,619 --> 01:14:15,420
look which you know stereotypic

1531
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:17,520
description might be lar fear and that's

1532
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:20,970
like the Humboldt word but loose loose

1533
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:27,210
flowers and you know not very crystal e

1534
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:35,190
and just not dank so you know you don't

1535
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:38,369
necessarily know my only have 15% or

1536
01:14:35,189 --> 01:14:42,149
even only like 5% that really captured

1537
01:14:38,369 --> 01:14:44,699
they that you just carried that one

1538
01:14:42,149 --> 01:14:48,859
characteristic which was the three-month

1539
01:14:44,699 --> 01:14:52,340
start to finish and then took on and

1540
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:56,149
carried the characteristics that you do

1541
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:58,670
appreciate about blueberry muffin and

1542
01:14:56,149 --> 01:15:01,829
obviously that'll be the one that you'll

1543
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:03,510
do your breeding with or you know it's

1544
01:15:01,829 --> 01:15:05,359
Auto far so you don't have a cool you

1545
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:08,570
can't do the clone breeding so you've

1546
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:12,149
hopefully that one has seeds in it

1547
01:15:08,569 --> 01:15:15,359
hopefully that the pollinator that you

1548
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:19,369
chose had also had those characteristics

1549
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:23,420
but it's it's a you know it that's

1550
01:15:19,369 --> 01:15:26,979
that's where you can probably get

1551
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:29,649
there's a lot of advantages to molecular

1552
01:15:26,979 --> 01:15:31,150
marker-assisted breeding which i think

1553
01:15:29,649 --> 01:15:36,848
we're going to talk about a little bit

1554
01:15:31,149 --> 01:15:40,978
later but you know you can you can and

1555
01:15:36,849 --> 01:15:43,479
we do and we have done that just through

1556
01:15:40,979 --> 01:15:47,760
selective breeding traditional breeding

1557
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:51,639
practices and and looking at the plants

1558
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:54,340
phenotypic expression but i mean the

1559
01:15:51,639 --> 01:16:01,179
advantage is that we've essentially

1560
01:15:54,340 --> 01:16:03,639
devoted all of our farms to breeding and

1561
01:16:01,179 --> 01:16:07,269
selections and we've got these isolated

1562
01:16:03,639 --> 01:16:12,840
areas where we do have the pollen that

1563
01:16:07,269 --> 01:16:16,119
we you know us assume or best-guess

1564
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:18,458
pollen is in the air and so when we're

1565
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:21,759
going and doing selection and looking

1566
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:25,208
through these populations that that are

1567
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:29,800
have received seeds then we are able to

1568
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:32,738
be you know to deem this one the best

1569
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:38,139
expression the one that captured the

1570
01:16:32,738 --> 01:16:40,419
most ideal traits of of the set of

1571
01:16:38,139 --> 01:16:42,400
traits that were working with and it's

1572
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:45,578
got to be such a relief to get there

1573
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:47,379
after all that extra work so i want to

1574
01:16:45,578 --> 01:16:48,609
talk more about actually you hit on a

1575
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:53,349
whole bunch of stuff the blueberry

1576
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:55,389
muffin the the genetic markers and

1577
01:16:53,349 --> 01:16:57,010
tissue culture i want to talk about all

1578
01:16:55,389 --> 01:16:59,260
that more but let's do it after this

1579
01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:01,449
next set break you are listening to

1580
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:03,159
shaping fire and my guest today is nat

1581
01:17:01,448 --> 01:17:06,069
Pennington founder of humboldt seed

1582
01:17:03,158 --> 01:17:08,109
company cultivators who grow in living

1583
01:17:06,069 --> 01:17:09,969
soil are very particular on what inputs

1584
01:17:08,109 --> 01:17:11,889
they use in their soil they educate

1585
01:17:09,969 --> 01:17:14,078
themselves and painstakingly create

1586
01:17:11,889 --> 01:17:15,760
compost and nutritive teas to create

1587
01:17:14,078 --> 01:17:17,439
thriving soils that will produce the

1588
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:19,989
very best expression of the cannabis

1589
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:22,388
plant many living soil farmers now

1590
01:17:19,988 --> 01:17:24,279
believe that over time seeds become

1591
01:17:22,389 --> 01:17:26,618
acclimated to the kind of substrate they

1592
01:17:24,279 --> 01:17:28,599
are grown in for example a seed that was

1593
01:17:26,618 --> 01:17:30,189
bred and synthetic fertilizers may not

1594
01:17:28,599 --> 01:17:31,989
immediately know what to do in a living

1595
01:17:30,189 --> 01:17:34,569
soil environment slowing their growth

1596
01:17:31,988 --> 01:17:36,728
and decreasing yield the regenerative

1597
01:17:34,569 --> 01:17:38,799
seed cooperative is a different kind of

1598
01:17:36,729 --> 01:17:40,150
seed bank the regenerative seed

1599
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,980

1600
01:17:40,149 --> 01:17:43,960
cannabis seeds that were bred in living

1601
01:17:41,979 --> 01:17:46,299
soil and using probiotic growing

1602
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:48,130
techniques that way when you germinate

1603
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:49,390
in soil the seeds genetics will

1604
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,980
recognize the environment and

1605
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:53,530
immediately start interacting with

1606
01:17:50,979 --> 01:17:56,379

regenerative seeds calm growing cannabis

1629
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:51,310
in greenhouses is taking over the

1630
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:53,230
cannabis industry an efficient and

1631
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:55,270
effective blend of sunshine grown

1632
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:57,729
terpene profiles and the controlled

1633
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:59,800
environment of indoor greenhouses can be

1634
01:18:57,729 --> 01:19:01,869
the best of both worlds for many

1635
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,909
greenhouse operators though building

1636
01:19:01,869 --> 01:19:05,979
their green house before gaining insight

1637
01:19:03,908 --> 01:19:08,139
into how cannabis greenhouses differ

1638
01:19:05,979 --> 01:19:11,500
from ornamental crops can be the start

1639
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:13,719
of a world of hurt Eric Branstad and his

1640
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:16,000

Branstad has been helping cannabis

1644
01:19:20,198 --> 01:19:24,759
growers find locations design build and

1645
01:19:23,079 --> 01:19:26,649
equip their greenhouses for over a

1646
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:28,630
decade first starting in Northern

1647
01:19:26,649 --> 01:19:30,488
California but expanding over the last

1648
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:32,199
five years to helping clients throughout

1653
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,820
challenges facing cannabis greenhouses

1654
01:19:40,569 --> 01:19:44,738
and how to overcome them in episode

1655
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:47,649
number forty one of the shaping fire

1656
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:49,779
podcast no matter where I go in the

1657
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:51,579
country good people with smart

1658
01:19:49,779 --> 01:19:54,009
backgrounds still are making the mistake

1659
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:55,809
of building without knowing cannon

1660
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:58,989
and it causes them to burn through

1661
01:19:55,810 --> 01:20:01,090
capital and time fast everyone has their

1662
01:19:58,988 --> 01:20:03,279
own failure point for some it is

1663
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:04,690
improper ventilation planning for others

1664
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:06,689
it is surface temperatures of the

1665
01:20:04,689 --> 01:20:08,829
building or the plants leaves or both

1666
01:20:06,689 --> 01:20:10,659
some folks that build their greenhouse

1667
01:20:08,829 --> 01:20:12,340
from scratch make really basic errors

1668
01:20:10,659 --> 01:20:14,079
like placement of the greenhouse on the

1669
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:15,760
property or not understanding the

1670
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:16,390
natural environment where the greenhouse

1671
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,610
sits

1672
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:20,770
some have even built a decent greenhouse

1673
01:20:18,609 --> 01:20:22,269
but are inefficient in their deployment

1674
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:24,570
of light deprivation techniques and

1675
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:26,920
never really hit their target yields

1676
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:28,719
it's great when you learn from your

1677
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:30,940
mistakes but it's even better when you

1678
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:33,130
learn from the mistakes of others when

1679
01:20:30,939 --> 01:20:34,779
you bring on greenhouse advisory group

1680
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:36,640
you will learn from the mistakes of

1681
01:20:34,779 --> 01:20:38,259
their many clients and you'll take

1682
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:40,480
advantage of the best practices

1683
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:42,489
developed by Eric Branstad over his

1684
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:45,219
years of working with clients just like

1685
01:20:42,488 --> 01:20:47,049
you from location development to

nat Pennington founder of humbled seed

company so now I'm really glad that we

1728
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:16,029
finally got to this part of the show

1729
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:18,759
where we can talk about the blueberry

1730
01:22:16,029 --> 01:22:22,539
muffin cultivar more because holy hell

1731
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:25,329
man it is crazy how exactly it smells

1732
01:22:22,539 --> 01:22:27,550
and tastes just like that jiffy

1733
01:22:25,329 --> 01:22:29,859
blueberry muffin mix in the blue box

1734
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:32,289
when I first smelled it at noontime

1735
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:34,539
medicinals in Garberville it was like a

1736
01:22:32,289 --> 01:22:37,149
time machine back to my mom's kitchen as

1737
01:22:34,539 --> 01:22:40,329
a kid what was your reaction when you

1738
01:22:37,149 --> 01:22:44,939
smelled that very unique terpene profile

1739
01:22:40,329 --> 01:22:47,710
for the first time in your sift yeah so

1740
01:22:44,939 --> 01:22:51,789
the way that that happened was really

1741
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:55,060
interesting because it wasn't me or

1742
01:22:51,789 --> 01:22:57,399
really anybody who was totally in the

1743
01:22:55,060 --> 01:23:00,850
company that that pointed that out it

1744
01:22:57,399 --> 01:23:03,549
was just a trimmer that we had and you

1745
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:06,400
know it wasn't somebody that that were

1746
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:09,909
really close with but we had been

1747
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:11,349
working on this cross and this was

1748
01:23:09,909 --> 01:23:14,439
really the first year that we grew it

1749
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:17,920
out with you know looking through twenty

1750
01:23:14,439 --> 01:23:19,989
or so different plants and one of them

1751
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,029
did come out just amazing and we had all

1752
01:23:19,989 --> 01:23:24,329
kind of had our eye on that plan we were

1753
01:23:22,029 --> 01:23:29,590
a special one right there

1754
01:23:24,329 --> 01:23:32,619
but it was a you know late September

1755
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:35,860
night the plant was done earlier than a

1756
01:23:32,619 --> 01:23:38,710
lot of the rest of them and we're up

1757
01:23:35,859 --> 01:23:41,109
there in the field and were harvesting

1758
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:43,569
and he's right across on the other side

1759
01:23:41,109 --> 01:23:47,289
of the plant and he just harvests a big

1760
01:23:43,569 --> 01:23:50,409
old Cola and says man I can't believe

1761
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:52,449
this smells exactly like a blueberry

1762
01:23:50,409 --> 01:23:54,699
muffin you know that blueberry muffin

1763
01:23:52,449 --> 01:23:57,970
mix and I said no kidding you're

1764
01:23:54,699 --> 01:24:01,300
absolutely right and you just named that

1765
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:05,740
strain and we always had a like an

1766
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:08,409
ongoing strain naming little thing

1767
01:24:05,739 --> 01:24:10,510
within our group where you know you get

1768
01:24:08,409 --> 01:24:12,939
like prizes and things like that if you

1769
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:16,270
end up naming a strain so he got the

1770
01:24:12,939 --> 01:24:20,649
prize for the year and that was that but

1771
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:21,070
you know I knew that that that you know

1772
01:24:20,649 --> 01:24:23,559
it was

1773
01:24:21,069 --> 01:24:24,759
born unfortunately we did have clones of

1774
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:27,130
it because that's something we've been

1775
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:30,310
doing for a long time we always started

1776
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:32,980
taking clones maybe in you know early

1777
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:34,989
2000 mid-2000s of every plant that we

1778
01:24:32,979 --> 01:24:37,750
put up in our field and we were growing

1779
01:24:34,988 --> 01:24:41,439
these trees so it wasn't like that much

1780
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:43,779
to keep track of it was manageable and

1781
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:47,319
we got to see the full expression of

1782
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:49,090
them so it was worth that for but the

1783
01:24:47,319 --> 01:24:52,090
blueberry muffin then you know we just

1784
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:54,069
back cross and back cross into it and I

1785
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:56,860
think it was like 2010 that we were

1786
01:24:54,069 --> 01:24:58,389
finally able to you know feel confident

1787
01:24:56,859 --> 01:25:02,348
that the seeds should carry that

1788
01:24:58,389 --> 01:25:03,909
expression of the blueberry muffin kind

1789
01:25:02,349 --> 01:25:06,069
of jiffy mix thing and I don't always

1790
01:25:03,908 --> 01:25:07,839
say jiff you make but you called it and

1791
01:25:06,069 --> 01:25:10,269
I don't know if we've ever even talked

1792
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:12,369
about it before but well it's blatant

1793
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:14,110
you can't be like you can't not not like

1794
01:25:12,368 --> 01:25:17,229
like if you have any experience with

1795
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:19,539
that and I dare call it cheap right like

1796
01:25:17,229 --> 01:25:21,848
that cheap blueberry muffins smell

1797
01:25:19,539 --> 01:25:23,859
because the boxes are only like you know

1798
01:25:21,849 --> 01:25:26,619
whatever a dollar a box to get this

1799
01:25:23,859 --> 01:25:29,828
muffin mix and and and that's the odd

1800
01:25:26,618 --> 01:25:32,380
thing is like yeah there are smells of

1801
01:25:29,828 --> 01:25:34,179
blueberry in you know across lots of

1802
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:37,319
phenols right or not me more than four

1803
01:25:34,179 --> 01:25:40,408
you know scold cultivars but this very

1804
01:25:37,319 --> 01:25:43,750
particular version of the blueberry

1805
01:25:40,408 --> 01:25:45,009
smells just like that box and it's and

1806
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:47,590
it's unlike anything else and and

1807
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:51,340
everybody who smells a jar of it that's

1808
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:54,760
their first response yep exactly it

1809
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:59,250
people do you know note that it's that

1810
01:25:54,760 --> 01:26:01,750
sort of artificial blueberry muffin and

1811
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:04,270
and I don't I don't mind because that

1812
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:07,630
was what we were really you know that

1813
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:10,360
was what we were honing in on was the

1814
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:13,599
the jiffy mix so you nailed it right

1815
01:26:10,359 --> 01:26:16,420
there it's it's totally I'm not saying

1816
01:26:13,599 --> 01:26:19,569
that it smells like organic blueberries

1817
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:25,960
put in whole wheat flour muffins baked

1818
01:26:19,569 --> 01:26:28,689
at home and no no it's totally it's it's

1819
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:31,510
it's more of a a breakfast cereal

1820
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:33,429
blueberry versus a organic muffin

1821
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:35,710
blueberry you know

1822
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:40,539
exactly right look they're pellets

1823
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:42,159
they're not bluebird yeah so so that's a

1824
01:26:40,539 --> 01:26:44,470
good story about the trimmer fine it and

1825
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:46,359
bless their hearts oh you know I have

1826
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:49,510
come across two different she knows of

1827
01:26:46,359 --> 01:26:51,489
it there is most of them seem to be like

1828
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:54,730
this purplish green color which is very

1829
01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:57,399
beautiful but then the one that I saw in

1830
01:26:54,729 --> 01:26:59,739
all of these gorgeous hugelkultur at

1831
01:26:57,399 --> 01:27:03,639
moon time medicinals in Garberville they

1832
01:26:59,739 --> 01:27:06,909
happen to have the the pur purple Fino

1833
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:08,740
which I'm not sure if it was you or your

1834
01:27:06,909 --> 01:27:11,050
daughter who commented on my Instagram

1835
01:27:08,739 --> 01:27:13,210
where I posted a picture of this

1836
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:16,210
this Cola that was like the size of my

1837
01:27:13,210 --> 01:27:17,529
forearm and the entire thing is purple

1838
01:27:16,210 --> 01:27:21,069
there's there's you know very little

1839
01:27:17,529 --> 01:27:23,409
green actually on it and and the comment

1840
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:25,389
that that y'all made was it was like wow

1841
01:27:23,409 --> 01:27:27,340
this is this is one of the purple ones

1842
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:30,070
most of them are green but they all got

1843
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:32,319
the same smell how often do you come

1844
01:27:30,069 --> 01:27:34,329
across that that purple Phoenix I would

1845
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:35,920
think that that's the one that you know

1846
01:27:34,329 --> 01:27:38,229
regardless of the other attributes of

1847
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,640
the plant people probably really

1848
01:27:38,229 --> 01:27:43,239
freaking dig the fact that they've

1849
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:46,690
they've got a fully purple plant yeah so

1850
01:27:43,239 --> 01:27:49,179
you know the original ones that we were

1851
01:27:46,689 --> 01:27:51,819
kind of the the cuts that we've

1852
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:55,630
preserved and things like that they've

1853
01:27:51,819 --> 01:27:58,989
sort of had this purple but not the dark

1854
01:27:55,630 --> 01:28:02,770
dark dark purple but kind of a mottled

1855
01:27:58,989 --> 01:28:05,979
flecks of purple and and that is really

1856
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:10,090
the target one you know one thing that

1857
01:28:05,979 --> 01:28:15,399
I've noticed is one of the harder things

1858
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:19,150
to create complete uniformity in in

1859
01:28:15,399 --> 01:28:22,079
cannabis is the level of anthocyanin or

1860
01:28:19,149 --> 01:28:25,359
purple that you get in your flowers and

1861
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:27,789
you know that's been somewhat

1862
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:31,599
problematic because as we are now

1863
01:28:27,789 --> 01:28:36,279
breeding for folks who need to put

1864
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:39,820
together a big batch of a specific type

1865
01:28:36,279 --> 01:28:43,179
and they do want to grow from seed you

1866
01:28:39,819 --> 01:28:46,059
know having strains that have different

1867
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:47,230
levels of purple can be problematic

1868
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:48,760
because

1869
01:28:47,229 --> 01:28:49,989
then you might end up with a plant

1870
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:55,060
that's a little bit on the darker side

1871
01:28:49,989 --> 01:28:56,859
or or you know or more green and you

1872
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:58,990
know I always kind of caveat with like

1873
01:28:56,859 --> 01:29:01,659
well that can happen too

1874
01:28:58,989 --> 01:29:05,349
I don't know if you've noticed but I've

1875
01:29:01,659 --> 01:29:08,769
seen that plants that receive more light

1876
01:29:05,350 --> 01:29:10,480
can be a different color than the other

1877
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:12,970
side of the plant it's the same plant

1878
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:15,519
but you know it has some darker buds on

1879
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:20,560
one side lighter buds on the other so

1880
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:24,040
there's really no way to have complete

1881
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:26,230
and total uniformity in it and that's a

1882
01:29:24,039 --> 01:29:29,590
good thing in my opinion I like that but

1883
01:29:26,229 --> 01:29:31,869
um you know I think with blueberry

1884
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:34,300
muffin basically we've shot for kind of

1885
01:29:31,869 --> 01:29:36,760
this you know purplish green kind of

1886
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:39,940
look to it and that's what we've been

1887
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:44,770
going for and hopefully uh most people

1888
01:29:39,939 --> 01:29:46,539
are finding that trait well it's it was

1889
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:49,540
delightful so so let's talk a little bit

1890
01:29:46,539 --> 01:29:52,060
about about tech assisted breeding so

1891
01:29:49,539 --> 01:29:54,279
because I know that you have moved into

1892
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:56,740
that direction and while you know many

1893
01:29:54,279 --> 01:29:59,649
of the corporate cannabis companies are

1894
01:29:56,739 --> 01:30:01,989
using tissue culture you're one of the

1895
01:29:59,649 --> 01:30:04,569
few authentic California heritage

1896
01:30:01,989 --> 01:30:07,300
breeders who started to experiment and

1897
01:30:04,569 --> 01:30:10,299
kind of judge it for its relevance what

1898
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:12,970
are your impressions so far of tissue

1899
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:16,320
culture and are you finding it useful or

1900
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:19,000
just something to mess with you know I

1901
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:23,109
don't know if I want to I don't think

1902
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:25,090
that it's I mean it does take some setup

1903
01:30:23,109 --> 01:30:28,329
you have to buy a hood you have to kind

1904
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:30,730
of have a laboratory essentially to do

1905
01:30:28,329 --> 01:30:33,699
tissue culture I don't know if everybody

1906
01:30:30,729 --> 01:30:35,649
who's doing it is you know kind of

1907
01:30:33,699 --> 01:30:40,239
totally corporate or anything like that

1908
01:30:35,649 --> 01:30:43,149
but I think that it certainly is

1909
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:45,699
attractive to investors because it's

1910
01:30:43,149 --> 01:30:47,889
really you know kind of sounds high-tech

1911
01:30:45,699 --> 01:30:51,519
and you figure how that's a really good

1912
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:53,800
way of must be a good way of doing

1913
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,420
things because you know like we talked

1914
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:57,039
about before you hear about pests and

1915
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:59,980
you hear about pathogens in the cannabis

1916
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:03,850
industry and and pesticides and pests

1917
01:30:59,979 --> 01:31:06,399
testing whether or not someone really

1918
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:09,579
uses pesticides you know they can just

1919
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:13,869
be growing on some ground that either

1920
01:31:09,579 --> 01:31:16,989
has a AG operation nearby and even

1921
01:31:13,869 --> 01:31:19,869
though most of my new amount can make

1922
01:31:16,989 --> 01:31:23,829
you fail a test and so it is a big deal

1923
01:31:19,869 --> 01:31:27,909
so I don't want to say it's not what we

1924
01:31:23,829 --> 01:31:32,470
found with doing tissue culture in 2015

1925
01:31:27,909 --> 01:31:34,840
and 2016 was you know we kind of

1926
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:37,270
expected to have a lot of advantages

1927
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:42,190
from it like you know okay we could

1928
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:46,140
build a library of genetics that we like

1929
01:31:42,189 --> 01:31:50,349
working with it would be much easier to

1930
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:54,100
keep those genetics kind of alive and

1931
01:31:50,350 --> 01:31:56,140
well happy in tissue culture and and be

1932
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:58,120
able to pluck them from the shelf as we

1933
01:31:56,140 --> 01:32:01,450
decided we wanted to use them for

1934
01:31:58,119 --> 01:32:06,099
breeding and and really that is like one

1935
01:32:01,449 --> 01:32:08,319
of the most useful applications of

1936
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:10,750
tissue culture in my mind in cannabis

1937
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:14,349
because you know cannabis is an an

1938
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:18,699
annual crop and it it's a fast growing

1939
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:21,940
crop that in most agriculture would

1940
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:24,899
immediately go to like this is a crop

1941
01:32:21,939 --> 01:32:27,309
that we're gonna propagate with seed and

1942
01:32:24,899 --> 01:32:29,829
you know we already used clone and

1943
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:33,100
that's to deal with often the

1944
01:32:29,829 --> 01:32:36,460
male-female was I think a lot of why

1945
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:40,060
that developed so much and then of

1946
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:41,619
course the uniformity of the you know a

1947
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:44,289
clone is always going to be as uniform

1948
01:32:41,619 --> 01:32:48,340
as it can be because it's genetically

1949
01:32:44,289 --> 01:32:51,760
identical but tissue culture you know I

1950
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:55,449
I think it definitely has its place I

1951
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:58,090
our experience with it was that it would

1952
01:32:55,449 --> 01:33:02,319
be unbelievably costly to actually use

1953
01:32:58,090 --> 01:33:05,050
it to propagate so you know if you're

1954
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:07,479
kind of a company that's a nursery and

1955
01:33:05,050 --> 01:33:10,180
you're wanting to sell thousands and

1956
01:33:07,479 --> 01:33:13,569
thousands of individual plants that are

1957
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:16,570
rooted and ready to go if you were to

1958
01:33:13,569 --> 01:33:20,559
to actually really pull those directly

1959
01:33:16,569 --> 01:33:22,149
from tissue culture and then you know

1960
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:26,650
basically plants that are in tissue

1961
01:33:22,149 --> 01:33:28,000
culture are very small often and so you

1962
01:33:26,649 --> 01:33:30,759
either have to root them whether in

1963
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,470
tissue culture or pull them out and then

1964
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:34,750
root them which is really hard because

1965
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:40,060
they're you know there's the tiny little

1966
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:42,250
X plants and that's tricky so it's it

1967
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:46,539
doesn't seem like to me like it works

1968
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:49,869
for mass propagation but and I think

1969
01:33:46,539 --> 01:33:51,340
most folks that have gotten into doing

1970
01:33:49,869 --> 01:33:54,010
it I've kind of realized that but it's

1971
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:57,190
wonderful for cleaning up individual

1972
01:33:54,010 --> 01:34:00,550
genetics and then once you've got the

1973
01:33:57,189 --> 01:34:04,329
genetic pathogen free and completely

1974
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:08,110
pest free obviously you're then able to

1975
01:34:04,329 --> 01:34:11,619
maybe maintain a very clean nursery so

1976
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:14,489
if you're you know I kind of tend to

1977
01:34:11,619 --> 01:34:17,909
think if you're doing TC and then just

1978
01:34:14,489 --> 01:34:20,739
bringing the plants out of TC and then

1979
01:34:17,909 --> 01:34:23,769
propagating them in a in a nursery that

1980
01:34:20,739 --> 01:34:25,300
maybe is partly outdoors or has a lot of

1981
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:29,110
ventilation or whatever that you're kind

1982
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:30,760
of negating all of the all of those

1983
01:34:29,109 --> 01:34:34,119
benefits that you're getting from tissue

1984
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:36,699
culture but but if you're you know

1985
01:34:34,119 --> 01:34:39,510
cleaning something up there's been a lot

1986
01:34:36,699 --> 01:34:41,380
of talk and research done recently on

1987
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:44,619
something called the hot plate and

1988
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:48,190
diploid virus which is a k otherwise

1989
01:34:44,619 --> 01:34:51,250
known as duh ting and you know like dark

1990
01:34:48,189 --> 01:34:54,789
heart nursery has you know basically

1991
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:56,710
developed a cure for that which I don't

1992
01:34:54,789 --> 01:35:00,640
we didn't really have that before but

1993
01:34:56,710 --> 01:35:02,890
they secure involves putting the plants

1994
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:05,710
through tissue culture and and really

1995
01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:10,570
only taking that apical meristem which

1996
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:14,140
is millimeter like even smaller piece of

1997
01:35:10,569 --> 01:35:15,639
plants and I can't know if I'm supposed

1998
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:19,960
to say exactly but there's a little

1999
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:24,460
process that that they put that piece of

2000
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:27,079
meristem through and then from there you

2001
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:29,810
know they've seen using pea

2002
01:35:27,079 --> 01:35:32,930
er which is like a genetic you can pose

2003
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:36,050
a question like is this carrying this

2004
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:38,539
pathogen and polymerase chain reaction

2005
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:42,230
or PCR will give you an answer yes or no

2006
01:35:38,539 --> 01:35:44,779
and they put it you know through that

2007
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:48,559
test before the process and it the

2008
01:35:44,779 --> 01:35:51,380
answer is yes and then go through apical

2009
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:53,150
meristem tissue culture and the process

2010
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:56,060
that they add to that and then the

2011
01:35:53,149 --> 01:35:59,869
answer is no so those are things that

2012
01:35:56,060 --> 01:36:04,510
are amazing that capabilities that

2013
01:35:59,869 --> 01:36:07,630
tissue culture has but is it a a

2014
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:12,590
cost-saving way to do propagation I

2015
01:36:07,630 --> 01:36:14,770
would have to say probably not that's

2016
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:18,409
one of the things I'm noticing

2017
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:22,370
throughout our chat here today is a lot

2018
01:36:18,409 --> 01:36:24,139
of this stuff you get into not because

2019
01:36:22,369 --> 01:36:25,760
you necessarily need it for your

2020
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:28,250
breeding because you've been breeding

2021
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:29,900
for you know you learned breeding

2022
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:32,090
old-school-style which took a lot of

2023
01:36:29,899 --> 01:36:33,649
time and a lot of effort and a lot of

2024
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:35,300
listening to the plant and being with

2025
01:36:33,649 --> 01:36:37,129
the plant and the in the garden and now

2026
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:40,159
we've got all these new technologies to

2027
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:41,900
assist and you know some of them are

2028
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:45,289
more helpful than others but it's your

2029
01:36:41,899 --> 01:36:47,089
curiosity that has you messing with all

2030
01:36:45,289 --> 01:36:50,600
of this stuff so so I'm gonna ask you

2031
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:53,960
similarity are similarily are you

2032
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:56,450
starting to experiment with a genetic

2033
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:58,460
marker assisted breeding and like a lot

2034
01:36:56,449 --> 01:37:00,349
of people confuse it with like GMO right

2035
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:02,989
it actually genetically modified plants

2036
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:05,060
that that are you know been used with

2037
01:37:02,989 --> 01:37:07,159
CRISPR or something but that's incorrect

2038
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:09,800
it's more like an analysis to read the

2039
01:37:07,159 --> 01:37:11,809
genome so how are genetic markers

2040
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:16,010
helping you to do traditional breeding

2041
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:18,890
more successfully yeah so we are doing

2042
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:22,840
some genetic marker assisted breeding

2043
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:26,990
and you know a bunch of people are

2044
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:29,569
gasping but like the the distinction is

2045
01:37:26,989 --> 01:37:31,609
so important and and I'll just get out

2046
01:37:29,569 --> 01:37:35,239
ahead of that right now hopefully and

2047
01:37:31,609 --> 01:37:40,389
say that you know Humboldt seed company

2048
01:37:35,239 --> 01:37:45,788
is very work actually scared that

2049
01:37:40,389 --> 01:37:50,319
that there is so much biotech interests

2050
01:37:45,788 --> 01:37:52,868
in this precious plant that you know we

2051
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:56,049
feel like has this wonderful amazing

2052
01:37:52,868 --> 01:37:59,908
cultural significance in humanity we've

2053
01:37:56,050 --> 01:38:03,269
evolved with it it's so important and I

2054
01:37:59,908 --> 01:38:06,698
know for a fact that folks are out there

2055
01:38:03,269 --> 01:38:08,649
doing both genetic engineering and

2056
01:38:06,698 --> 01:38:10,118
genetic modification and genetic

2057
01:38:08,649 --> 01:38:13,030
engineering is CRISPR which you

2058
01:38:10,118 --> 01:38:14,889
mentioned before where you can just you

2059
01:38:13,029 --> 01:38:18,728
know you just change the code of a plant

2060
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:20,979
you can like knock out cannabinoids for

2061
01:38:18,729 --> 01:38:24,309
example you could say I don't want any

2062
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:29,229
CBD in this plant I'm taking that code

2063
01:38:24,309 --> 01:38:33,519
out or ad code even but genetic

2064
01:38:29,229 --> 01:38:36,659
modification more like bringing DNA from

2065
01:38:33,519 --> 01:38:39,998
another species and splicing it in and

2066
01:38:36,658 --> 01:38:42,668
both of them essentially that's

2067
01:38:39,998 --> 01:38:45,998
engineered cannabis or modified cannabis

2068
01:38:42,668 --> 01:38:48,458
and we at Humboldt seed company a

2069
01:38:45,998 --> 01:38:53,228
hundred percent support or we're

2070
01:38:48,458 --> 01:38:57,519
actually pushing right now for

2071
01:38:53,229 --> 01:39:00,789
legislation in California to have

2072
01:38:57,519 --> 01:39:04,899
mandatory labeling for any cannabis that

2073
01:39:00,788 --> 01:39:08,139
is modified or engineered and we feel

2074
01:39:04,899 --> 01:39:10,780
like this is incredibly urgent we're

2075
01:39:08,139 --> 01:39:14,260
trying to get support from people and

2076
01:39:10,779 --> 01:39:17,590
I'll caveat that with we're not like

2077
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:20,349
coming out and saying that we think that

2078
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:21,909
it should be banned I mean even if we

2079
01:39:20,349 --> 01:39:24,550
did I don't think that that's something

2080
01:39:21,908 --> 01:39:26,469
that it's likely because we've seen

2081
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:29,439
what's happened with food crops and

2082
01:39:26,469 --> 01:39:32,859
we've seen what's happened with even

2083
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:35,050
animals now it it hasn't gotten a lot of

2084
01:39:32,859 --> 01:39:37,808
traction because there's certain things

2085
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:40,329
that the genetic engineering and

2086
01:39:37,809 --> 01:39:42,699
modification can actually it could save

2087
01:39:40,328 --> 01:39:44,380
lives it could you know that's another

2088
01:39:42,698 --> 01:39:45,728
argument I don't want to get into it but

2089
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:49,538
what we're saying is that we want

2090
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:52,059
cannabis to be mandatory to have it

2091
01:39:49,538 --> 01:39:54,689
labeled and especially when that comes

2092
01:39:52,059 --> 01:39:59,170
to genetics because

2093
01:39:54,689 --> 01:40:03,329
what we see coming is these cultivars

2094
01:39:59,170 --> 01:40:06,219
getting out into the breeding community

2095
01:40:03,329 --> 01:40:08,019
cannabis is different than any other

2096
01:40:06,219 --> 01:40:11,980
plant in the world I would venture to

2097
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:14,500
say people [ __ ] love breeding

2098
01:40:11,979 --> 01:40:18,039
cannabis they love smoking it they're

2099
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:20,590
more interested in cannabis than I mean

2100
01:40:18,039 --> 01:40:21,819
think about it like what other plants

2101
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:23,140
are there I mean I know there's a bunch

2102
01:40:21,819 --> 01:40:25,960
of people that are really into breeding

2103
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:28,780
dahlias I know that all kinds of species

2104
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:31,960
are there's a community around them it

2105
01:40:28,779 --> 01:40:34,689
still pales to cannabis it pales it

2106
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:38,109
totally pales so this is really

2107
01:40:34,689 --> 01:40:40,389
important like let's we I think we've

2108
01:40:38,109 --> 01:40:42,969
lost that opportunity with our food

2109
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:46,989
because I don't know if you're aware

2110
01:40:42,969 --> 01:40:50,430
like Mendocino a few years back did get

2111
01:40:46,988 --> 01:40:56,319
a county ordinance through that banned

2112
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:59,500
GMO and but you know there was no way to

2113
01:40:56,319 --> 01:41:04,719
enforce it like you go to Chevron in

2114
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:08,969
Laytonsville and it's all GMI so there

2115
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:13,270
it wasn't an enforceable or a realistic

2116
01:41:08,969 --> 01:41:15,750
thing as much as what we're trying to do

2117
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:18,130
right now which is just simply say look

2118
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:23,079
cannabis is something that hasn't really

2119
01:41:18,130 --> 01:41:26,560
been engineered or modified so before it

2120
01:41:23,079 --> 01:41:29,979
just gets completely you know away from

2121
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:33,270
us and we couldn't ever keep track let's

2122
01:41:29,979 --> 01:41:35,738
just say you know we're not gonna stop

2123
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:38,320
big biotech from doing what they're

2124
01:41:35,738 --> 01:41:40,179
doing we don't even know whether we're

2125
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:42,099
opposed to it or not or maybe we'll

2126
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:45,690
participate it sometimes on the road

2127
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:48,699
like I'm not saying that I have either

2128
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:52,019
you know I don't ever want to see it

2129
01:41:48,698 --> 01:41:54,759
happen I'll never participate or I I

2130
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:58,210
love it I'm working on it right now I

2131
01:41:54,760 --> 01:42:01,180
mean we're not but but I do think that

2132
01:41:58,210 --> 01:42:03,760
it deserves that we deserve and that

2133
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:06,219
this community deserves to know what is

2134
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:07,510
and what is not genetically engineered

2135
01:42:06,219 --> 01:42:11,789
or modified right

2136
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:14,350
back to what you asked me about so the

2137
01:42:11,789 --> 01:42:17,109
genomic marker assisted breeding is a

2138
01:42:14,350 --> 01:42:19,810
different thing entirely and that just

2139
01:42:17,109 --> 01:42:23,319
means so basically like I did a bunch of

2140
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:25,180
studies on salmon when you know I still

2141
01:42:23,319 --> 01:42:28,349
a big part of these environmental groups

2142
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:32,050
but in Humboldt we were battling to

2143
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:35,530
remove the the Klamath Dam and save the

2144
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:37,869
salmon runs and one of the things that

2145
01:42:35,529 --> 01:42:41,649
became really evident to me was we were

2146
01:42:37,869 --> 01:42:44,710
losing a specific type of salmon called

2147
01:42:41,649 --> 01:42:49,750
the Spring Run chinook and because there

2148
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:52,420
were no there was no data on how

2149
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:55,869
different those spring run fish were

2150
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:57,579
from the fall run fish that they were

2151
01:42:55,869 --> 01:43:01,269
not protected at all so they could

2152
01:42:57,579 --> 01:43:04,539
actually slip into extinction without

2153
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:07,390
ever receiving an endangered species

2154
01:43:04,539 --> 01:43:09,250
listing or any of those things no

2155
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:13,390
protection no management at all so I

2156
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:17,529
said look I had to change this I wrote a

2157
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:21,670
grant got funded found some some

2158
01:43:17,529 --> 01:43:24,789
students and some you know people that

2159
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:27,609
were getting their PhD at Humboldt State

2160
01:43:24,789 --> 01:43:30,340
and at Davis kind of tailored the grant

2161
01:43:27,609 --> 01:43:34,809
for that work and we started doing

2162
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:38,020
genomic studies on the salmon and lo and

2163
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:40,989
behold there actually were specific

2164
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:45,460
differences between those fish that you

2165
01:43:40,988 --> 01:43:47,889
could find with something like PCR which

2166
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:51,730
I mentioned before it's basically it

2167
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:56,410
it's kind of like ancestry.com if you

2168
01:43:51,729 --> 01:44:02,169
were to say you know it is totally like

2169
01:43:56,409 --> 01:44:04,149
ancestry.com for plants and and you know

2170
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:07,409
no one's out there like you know you

2171
01:44:04,149 --> 01:44:10,029
submit some you know a swab of your

2172
01:44:07,409 --> 01:44:14,710
cheek cell or whatever to ancestry.com

2173
01:44:10,029 --> 01:44:16,840
and and no one's saying all your you

2174
01:44:14,710 --> 01:44:18,130
know you're messing with the genome and

2175
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:21,219
because you're not you're really just

2176
01:44:18,130 --> 01:44:24,609
looking deeper into

2177
01:44:21,219 --> 01:44:26,890
a organism to find out more about it

2178
01:44:24,609 --> 01:44:28,179
like what its history is what it's

2179
01:44:26,890 --> 01:44:30,400
related to

2180
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:32,949
so on and so forth and you can even like

2181
01:44:30,399 --> 01:44:36,039
predict there's predictors like you know

2182
01:44:32,948 --> 01:44:38,889
is this person potentially need to worry

2183
01:44:36,039 --> 01:44:42,850
about a heart attack at a young age or

2184
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:47,230
cancer I mean if there's enough evidence

2185
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:52,780
that a certain low sire allele and the

2186
01:44:47,229 --> 01:44:54,729
genome does tend to have that you know

2187
01:44:52,779 --> 01:44:57,069
those problems like a heart attack or

2188
01:44:54,729 --> 01:44:59,289
something then yes it's probably

2189
01:44:57,069 --> 01:45:01,238
something that you should think about

2190
01:44:59,289 --> 01:45:03,880
and maybe you know treat your body

2191
01:45:01,238 --> 01:45:05,529
differently but marker-assisted breeding

2192
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:08,260
is essentially the same thing you're

2193
01:45:05,529 --> 01:45:13,649
basically saying you're trying to find

2194
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:17,199
markers like but at this allele you know

2195
01:45:13,649 --> 01:45:20,948
this low site which is what we did for

2196
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:26,169
the salmon you know we found grab one L

2197
01:45:20,948 --> 01:45:28,089
which was one low side that said this

2198
01:45:26,170 --> 01:45:32,680
fish is either gonna swim back in the

2199
01:45:28,090 --> 01:45:34,390
fall or swim up in the spring and we

2200
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:37,390
wanted to protect the spring run because

2201
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:40,150
that as we were tearing down these dams

2202
01:45:37,390 --> 01:45:42,369
which is this momentous thing is like

2203
01:45:40,149 --> 01:45:44,979
the largest River restoration project

2204
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:48,609
and in the world according to National

2205
01:45:44,979 --> 01:45:51,909
Geographic so I was like look we can't

2206
01:45:48,609 --> 01:45:53,859
lose the fish that will inherit that

2207
01:45:51,909 --> 01:45:55,930
space I mean historically those were the

2208
01:45:53,859 --> 01:45:59,469
ones that went there we put these dams

2209
01:45:55,930 --> 01:46:02,170
in they are now teetering on the brick

2210
01:45:59,469 --> 01:46:05,619
brink of extinction we got to figure out

2211
01:46:02,170 --> 01:46:07,239
a way to protect them before we lose

2212
01:46:05,619 --> 01:46:09,579
them and then we don't have anything

2213
01:46:07,238 --> 01:46:12,909
once these dams come out which is gonna

2214
01:46:09,579 --> 01:46:14,710
happen in the next year or two we won't

2215
01:46:12,909 --> 01:46:17,979
have anything to go repopulate up there

2216
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:19,600
so we actually were able to get the

2217
01:46:17,979 --> 01:46:23,259
endangered species listening through

2218
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:26,410
that that study and there's tons of

2219
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:28,360
similarities between like that I look at

2220
01:46:26,409 --> 01:46:32,289
the spring run and in that fall run and

2221
01:46:28,359 --> 01:46:34,719
I'm like you know Otto flower photos and

2222
01:46:32,289 --> 01:46:38,050
so that's kind of what

2223
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:40,780
No made me so comfortable with with the

2224
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:43,210
marker-assisted breeding was like I had

2225
01:46:40,779 --> 01:46:47,319
done this before the whole purpose was

2226
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:49,869
to save natural resource save like art

2227
01:46:47,319 --> 01:46:53,799
our beautiful environment and the

2228
01:46:49,869 --> 01:46:56,619
wildlife here in humble and you know now

2229
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:57,909
we can apply it to like all the good

2230
01:46:56,619 --> 01:47:01,680
reasons that we were talking about

2231
01:46:57,909 --> 01:47:05,380
earlier to have Auto flower genetics and

2232
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:08,010
there's I I would really argue with

2233
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:10,840
someone that said that there's something

2234
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:14,320
morally or ethically wrong with

2235
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:17,409
marker-assisted breeding because you

2236
01:47:14,319 --> 01:47:20,679
know it's it doesn't even take a lot of

2237
01:47:17,409 --> 01:47:24,069
electricity to one like the PCR machine

2238
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:27,340
is really a pretty simple piece of

2239
01:47:24,069 --> 01:47:31,899
equipment and the way you get the answer

2240
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:33,460
is with these gels and they just one of

2241
01:47:31,899 --> 01:47:37,960
them glows when you put it under a

2242
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:39,880
blacklight if the answer is no maybe it

2243
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:42,640
glows and if the answer is yes it does

2244
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:46,239
not glow and so that's exactly what we

2245
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:48,760
do it's the same thing as the plant sex

2246
01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:50,800
tests that are available through all

2247
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:53,350
these different genomics companies we've

2248
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:55,329
been using leaf works a lot lately and

2249
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:58,539
we've got this feminized certification

2250
01:47:55,329 --> 01:48:01,689
thing but that's the same concept and

2251
01:47:58,539 --> 01:48:06,460
and really if you have ever used one of

2252
01:48:01,689 --> 01:48:08,679
those then in a way if you do breed then

2253
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:11,529
you've actually done marker-assisted

2254
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:14,050
breeding because you've used a marker

2255
01:48:11,529 --> 01:48:17,139
that told you whether the plant is going

2256
01:48:14,050 --> 01:48:18,489
to be a male or a female and then you

2257
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:19,780
know MIT maybe that made it a little

2258
01:48:18,489 --> 01:48:22,119
easier for you to do your breeding

2259
01:48:19,779 --> 01:48:23,469
project in the long run so I think that

2260
01:48:22,119 --> 01:48:25,869
one of the things about you know people

2261
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:28,390
here that first two words right genetic

2262
01:48:25,869 --> 01:48:31,510
marker and then they immediately jump to

2263
01:48:28,390 --> 01:48:34,990
GMO when really it's it's really just

2264
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:37,360
another analysis test like anything that

2265
01:48:34,989 --> 01:48:40,389
you'll get at any Canon I mean you know

2266
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:42,399
it's more complex than then you get it

2267
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:45,190
most cannabis labs my point is though

2268
01:48:42,399 --> 01:48:47,229
they are passive right it's it's you

2269
01:48:45,189 --> 01:48:48,059
trying to read the plant to understand

2270
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:50,399
it it's

2271
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:52,700
not invasive something like CRISPR is

2272
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:55,799
where you're actually going in and

2273
01:48:52,699 --> 01:49:01,349
splicing and editing the genome and then

2274
01:48:55,800 --> 01:49:04,289
inserting genes that are not indigenous

2275
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:06,450
to the plant or you know and and I think

2276
01:49:04,289 --> 01:49:07,949
that though it's the vocabulary that is

2277
01:49:06,449 --> 01:49:10,260
off-putting to a lot of people more than

2278
01:49:07,949 --> 01:49:12,300
the fact that you're like oh well we did

2279
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:14,130
a test to find out if this part teacher

2280
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:16,760
picked our particular attribute is in

2281
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:18,869
the DNA which makes it sound a lot safer

2282
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:21,780
yeah exactly

2283
01:49:18,869 --> 01:49:26,029
and I think that that is like the common

2284
01:49:21,779 --> 01:49:28,409
misconception and you know if people

2285
01:49:26,029 --> 01:49:32,250
excuse me get to understand it a little

2286
01:49:28,409 --> 01:49:34,260
bit more that you know it won't be quite

2287
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:38,189
so scary because there is exactly that

2288
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:41,340
you're basically screening a population

2289
01:49:38,189 --> 01:49:43,919
for this desirable trait that you're

2290
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:46,430
looking for and then you're kind of it's

2291
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:51,140
it's a time saver as well like you're

2292
01:49:46,430 --> 01:49:55,950
then saying you know all right we want

2293
01:49:51,140 --> 01:50:00,930
this trait so if for sprouting a bunch

2294
01:49:55,949 --> 01:50:04,470
of seeds if we know which the marker for

2295
01:50:00,930 --> 01:50:07,500
that trait we can then take tiny snips

2296
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:12,930
of tissue or like little bits of leaf

2297
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:14,909
and submit it or do our own PCR and then

2298
01:50:12,930 --> 01:50:18,329
just get a whole bunch of yes this one

2299
01:50:14,909 --> 01:50:19,920
has it and and no this one doesn't all

2300
01:50:18,329 --> 01:50:22,170
right so this this last question I'm

2301
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:25,170
gonna ask slowly so you can take a sip

2302
01:50:22,170 --> 01:50:27,060
of your heart Giada and and take care of

2303
01:50:25,170 --> 01:50:29,369
that cough so I'm gonna ask it really

2304
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:32,460
slowly so that you can have your sip so

2305
01:50:29,369 --> 01:50:34,769
you know even though you've been you

2306
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:38,010
know doing this cannabis breeding for

2307
01:50:34,770 --> 01:50:42,330
more than twenty years and and humble

2308
01:50:38,010 --> 01:50:43,710
you know humble seed company has been

2309
01:50:42,329 --> 01:50:45,390
around for that long

2310
01:50:43,710 --> 01:50:46,800
you're still a pretty young guy and

2311
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:49,320
you've got lots of years of creativity

2312
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:51,480
left in you but you know you've you've

2313
01:50:49,319 --> 01:50:53,130
talked to me and and you know earlier on

2314
01:50:51,479 --> 01:50:55,259
this show about how you know you've

2315
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:57,449
always got kids around in your life and

2316
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:59,460
and and you know you've just shared with

2317
01:50:57,449 --> 01:51:00,559
us that you're you know a biologist and

2318
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:03,590
environm

2319
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:06,320
you think about generations of things so

2320
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:09,350
I can imagine that you've probably had a

2321
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:11,899
lot of good folks working for you and

2322
01:51:09,350 --> 01:51:14,300
you're probably thinking about the next

2323
01:51:11,899 --> 01:51:16,849
generation of people who are gonna hold

2324
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:19,760
it down in cannabis and specifically

2325
01:51:16,850 --> 01:51:22,010
Humboldt cannabis right because you know

2326
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:25,190
more than just cannabis as an industry

2327
01:51:22,010 --> 01:51:27,739
Humboldt cannabis is an important

2328
01:51:25,189 --> 01:51:30,739
American heritage so my question is is

2329
01:51:27,739 --> 01:51:33,380
you know how much energy do you put into

2330
01:51:30,739 --> 01:51:35,599
mentoring the next generation of

2331
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:37,220
breeders and and and if you you know if

2332
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:39,140
you're into that how do you go about

2333
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:41,329
doing that the goal with this question

2334
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:43,280
is I'm I'm hoping to maybe inspire folks

2335
01:51:41,329 --> 01:51:46,430
because you know not only do we want to

2336
01:51:43,279 --> 01:51:48,259
inspire folks to breed cannabis because

2337
01:51:46,430 --> 01:51:50,659
you know there's a lot of work to be

2338
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:52,730
done but there's gonna be people who

2339
01:51:50,659 --> 01:51:56,029
come after us and we need to make sure

2340
01:51:52,729 --> 01:51:58,159
we instill them with our values before

2341
01:51:56,029 --> 01:52:02,449
the cannabis plant becomes totally

2342
01:51:58,159 --> 01:52:05,569
commoditized sure absolutely well you

2343
01:52:02,449 --> 01:52:08,210
know I I brought Benjamin land into the

2344
01:52:05,569 --> 01:52:11,960
company I don't even remember when but

2345
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:13,970
that was in the early days and Ben is is

2346
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:17,270
a huge part of our breeding program a

2347
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:19,250
huge part of the company so shout out to

2348
01:52:17,270 --> 01:52:22,430
Ben he's a little bit younger than me

2349
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:26,390
but uh I I probably can't say that I

2350
01:52:22,430 --> 01:52:29,329
exactly mentored Ben but you know within

2351
01:52:26,390 --> 01:52:34,180
the company definitely I don't ever

2352
01:52:29,329 --> 01:52:37,159
really think of it as people working for

2353
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:39,770
Humboldt seed company or working for me

2354
01:52:37,159 --> 01:52:42,920
or anything like that it's always you

2355
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:46,310
know if I'm not making them excited

2356
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:49,880
about what they're doing then I'm not in

2357
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:53,539
my opinion like being a good leader in

2358
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:57,890
the company and so that is exactly it

2359
01:52:53,539 --> 01:53:01,060
you know you have to not only mentor and

2360
01:52:57,890 --> 01:53:08,079
teach but allow folks within the

2361
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:11,390
business to develop their own ideas and

2362
01:53:08,079 --> 01:53:13,579
nuances even if maybe you know you've

2363
01:53:11,390 --> 01:53:16,490
done it before and you might say look

2364
01:53:13,579 --> 01:53:19,369
I don't know sometimes you have to kind

2365
01:53:16,489 --> 01:53:21,409
of just take an educated guess it like

2366
01:53:19,369 --> 01:53:24,019
sometimes it's it's important to let

2367
01:53:21,409 --> 01:53:25,460
people kind of try and and experience

2368
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:28,340
the same failures that you've

2369
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:31,270
experienced over the years but yeah I

2370
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:37,460
think it is really important I mean I

2371
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:40,580
started breeding at the through getting

2372
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:44,239
to know people that I really really

2373
01:53:40,579 --> 01:53:47,449
respected and loved that were both

2374
01:53:44,239 --> 01:53:51,050
cannabis farmers and you know the beauty

2375
01:53:47,449 --> 01:53:55,359
the phenomena of humble is that it was

2376
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:58,070
never just a place where people grew

2377
01:53:55,359 --> 01:54:01,279
wonderful cannabis it was a place where

2378
01:53:58,069 --> 01:54:04,269
people worked together to grow wonderful

2379
01:54:01,279 --> 01:54:07,009
cannabis they worked together to

2380
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:10,640
embellish community they work together

2381
01:54:07,010 --> 01:54:13,640
to foster you know these environmental

2382
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:18,170
movements they fostered social movements

2383
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:22,550
social justice economic justice and that

2384
01:54:18,170 --> 01:54:25,579
has been a major underpinning of

2385
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:27,110
Humboldt seed company ever since you

2386
01:54:25,579 --> 01:54:28,909
know I first walked into the courthouse

2387
01:54:27,109 --> 01:54:31,159
so many years ago

2388
01:54:28,909 --> 01:54:33,050
even before I knew it was gonna be a

2389
01:54:31,159 --> 01:54:37,369
seed company you know it was basically

2390
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:41,390
like look how do we keep these hills

2391
01:54:37,369 --> 01:54:43,849
alive and one of the thing it's a very

2392
01:54:41,390 --> 01:54:49,880
rural place so we have to band together

2393
01:54:43,850 --> 01:54:51,860
and that needs to persist through this

2394
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:56,510
change that we're experiencing right now

2395
01:54:51,859 --> 01:55:00,619
with it becoming more of kind of this

2396
01:54:56,510 --> 01:55:02,869
traditional economy where you've got you

2397
01:55:00,619 --> 01:55:05,960
know all these pressures fiscal

2398
01:55:02,869 --> 01:55:09,590
pressures let's just say and and then

2399
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:13,039
now more obviously taxes and you know

2400
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:15,590
the even the county itself as as

2401
01:55:13,039 --> 01:55:17,659
conducive as Humboldt I have to give it

2402
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:21,800
to Humboldt like it started out a little

2403
01:55:17,659 --> 01:55:25,840
rocky but our county government is now

2404
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:27,110
really understanding and embracing that

2405
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:29,060
the

2406
01:55:27,109 --> 01:55:34,969
businesses the small businesses and

2407
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:38,770
trying to you know help help us make

2408
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:42,949
this transition and so all the way from

2409
01:55:38,770 --> 01:55:46,900
the County Supervisors to the the

2410
01:55:42,949 --> 01:55:54,439
Planning Department to our local

2411
01:55:46,899 --> 01:55:57,170
wildlife officials to the old growers

2412
01:55:54,439 --> 01:56:00,379
that you know have some of them have

2413
01:55:57,170 --> 01:56:03,050
come sort of out of the hills and are

2414
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:05,270
now you know working in the licensed

2415
01:56:03,050 --> 01:56:06,680
space some of them are maybe have scaled

2416
01:56:05,270 --> 01:56:08,450
back their grow a little bit just so

2417
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:13,400
that they can stay in that sweet spot of

2418
01:56:08,449 --> 01:56:16,369
of having a grow eat but not a grow

2419
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:19,399
that's gonna get red-flagged by the cuz

2420
01:56:16,369 --> 01:56:22,699
hey you know it humbled it was it's so

2421
01:56:19,399 --> 01:56:25,339
much harder now to grow cannabis ennoble

2422
01:56:22,699 --> 01:56:29,380
than it was four years ago I mean four

2423
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:32,329
years ago we were having this influx of

2424
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:34,760
everybody had heard you know oh you got

2425
01:56:32,329 --> 01:56:36,829
the humble and it's a Green Rush and

2426
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:39,560
make a bunch of money and and to be

2427
01:56:36,829 --> 01:56:43,039
honest like most of those people came

2428
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:45,190
out here they all they wanted was to

2429
01:56:43,039 --> 01:56:48,439
move here because of the money and and

2430
01:56:45,189 --> 01:56:51,199
weed and it was cool or whatever fell

2431
01:56:48,439 --> 01:56:54,169
flat in their face and most of them have

2432
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:57,529
now moved on to whatever they're doing

2433
01:56:54,170 --> 01:57:00,920
next somewhere else but you know really

2434
01:56:57,529 --> 01:57:03,319
it has been those people that we're here

2435
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:07,069
because of the place and because and

2436
01:57:03,319 --> 01:57:11,539
really fell in love with this community

2437
01:57:07,069 --> 01:57:14,750
and and the tightness that that being in

2438
01:57:11,539 --> 01:57:17,750
a more of a rural environment creates

2439
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:20,960
you know you and I don't want to make us

2440
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:22,340
sound like you know we're a bunch of

2441
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:24,050
rednecks out in the boonies

2442
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:26,930
even though there's nothing wrong with

2443
01:57:24,050 --> 01:57:30,650
that but you know we're we we've

2444
01:57:26,930 --> 01:57:33,770
innovated a lot here too and coming

2445
01:57:30,649 --> 01:57:36,939
together has made that innovation you

2446
01:57:33,770 --> 01:57:39,260
know it we've changed the whole cannabis

2447
01:57:36,939 --> 01:57:40,969
community around the world you know

2448
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:44,840
created so much stuff

2449
01:57:40,969 --> 01:57:47,149
we innovated we've made our mark and I'm

2450
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:49,489
super proud of that Mendocino Trinity -

2451
01:57:47,149 --> 01:57:51,558
like I don't want to just be all

2452
01:57:49,488 --> 01:57:54,618
Humboldt centric because there's so many

2453
01:57:51,559 --> 01:57:58,360
great people and in the whole area here

2454
01:57:54,618 --> 01:58:02,259
Oregon um but yeah we gotta pass that

2455
01:57:58,359 --> 01:58:05,988
we gotta pass that community feeling

2456
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:07,369
down through and my daughter I know you

2457
01:58:05,988 --> 01:58:13,178
probably were referring to my daughter

2458
01:58:07,368 --> 01:58:18,828
she's 21 years old now and literally was

2459
01:58:13,179 --> 01:58:21,739
on my back when I was out planting the

2460
01:58:18,828 --> 01:58:24,679
first cannabis you know like she's been

2461
01:58:21,738 --> 01:58:28,998
there since day one and and we're really

2462
01:58:24,679 --> 01:58:30,889
tight and she she does a lot with the

2463
01:58:28,998 --> 01:58:33,800
company and she's actually really did

2464
01:58:30,889 --> 01:58:36,380
you know how started to guide some of

2465
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:40,038
the breeding a little bit and you know

2466
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:42,859
she has years of experience under her

2467
01:58:40,038 --> 01:58:47,228
belt and you know you just can't deny

2468
01:58:42,859 --> 01:58:50,630
this plant loves experience it loves

2469
01:58:47,229 --> 01:58:54,429
people that have that are familiar with

2470
01:58:50,630 --> 01:58:57,650
it and and a familiar touch as they as a

2471
01:58:54,429 --> 01:59:01,130
cannabis breeder I think is one of the

2472
01:58:57,649 --> 01:59:05,509
most important traits that you can have

2473
01:59:01,130 --> 01:59:07,578
as a breeder is familiarity I think

2474
01:59:05,510 --> 01:59:10,880
that's you know a sign of some of the

2475
01:59:07,578 --> 01:59:14,408
best companies in any industry that

2476
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:16,819
they've got not only mentorship but also

2477
01:59:14,408 --> 01:59:18,828
you know family companies when it gets

2478
01:59:16,819 --> 01:59:20,808
passed down to generation and sure you

2479
01:59:18,828 --> 01:59:22,788
know family companies generation to

2480
01:59:20,809 --> 01:59:24,130
generation they break too

2481
01:59:22,788 --> 01:59:27,880
but there's something about being

2482
01:59:24,130 --> 01:59:31,130
totally immersed in any kind of

2483
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:34,788
education which really gives you much

2484
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:36,739
more rounded awareness of it and and

2485
01:59:34,788 --> 01:59:39,198
it's funny how you mentioned how you

2486
01:59:36,738 --> 01:59:41,238
know the the the the humble area the

2487
01:59:39,198 --> 01:59:43,879
Emerald triangle in general you know it

2488
01:59:41,238 --> 01:59:46,069
attracts people for lots of reasons and

2489
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:47,880
if their hearts not in the right place

2490
01:59:46,069 --> 01:59:51,359
it also spits them back out

2491
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:54,180
[Laughter]

2492
01:59:51,359 --> 01:59:55,250
and and you know I think that's I think

2493
01:59:54,180 --> 02:00:01,920
that's okay

2494
01:59:55,250 --> 02:00:07,159
yes I thank God well you know people are

2495
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:11,300
people and we try to live as harmonious

2496
02:00:07,159 --> 02:00:12,869
with all of them and you know it

2497
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:16,140
fortunately you're exactly right

2498
02:00:12,869 --> 02:00:21,390
fortunately it takes a certain kind of

2499
02:00:16,140 --> 02:00:27,920
person to so be here and you know we've

2500
02:00:21,390 --> 02:00:27,920
had I you know I've been here since 1995

2501
02:00:28,189 --> 02:00:36,389
that was when I was 18 years old and you

2502
02:00:33,899 --> 02:00:41,189
know traveled around the world since

2503
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:45,329
then doing the environmental stuff but I

2504
02:00:41,189 --> 02:00:48,839
never once thought to myself you know

2505
02:00:45,329 --> 02:00:52,050
I'm gonna live somewhere else it was

2506
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:55,890
always this place is beautiful too but

2507

2510
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:03,119
top that as a place to end this

2511
