2
00:00:06,528 --> 00:00:10,949
trimming is a constant companion of the

3
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,109
cannabis community since the earliest

4
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:14,579
days of commercial cannabis growers have

5
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:16,948
been trimming their cannabis flowers to

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,929
increase their bag appeal and clean up

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,118
the flavor profile from being overly

8
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:23,219
green tasting trimming styles change

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,589
depend on where you live and what your

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,629
final use of the flowers will be one

11
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,460
thing for sure though trimming is very

12
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:31,589
time intensive and it's hard on your

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,350
hands and usually your back and butt -

14
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:37,019
it is true though that it is a necessary

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,939
step in producing fine cannabis and both

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,420
home growers and commercial growers need

17
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,649
to get the job done one way or another

18
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,870

hardest they are a mobile trimming

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,090
company that sends out teams of between

24

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,079
home grows and large-scale commercial

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,760
growth - today we'll talk about the

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,709
different styles of trimming their

28
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,298
favorite scissors to use and get a

29
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,829
better understanding of their business

30
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,810
plan and how they make money in this

31
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:11,760
area that many in cannabis consider a

32
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,460
difficult necessity welcome to the show

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,780
Kristen hey Shango great to be here so

34
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,118
glad you could make the time to join us

35
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,868
so you know the canvas market is

36
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,728
exploding of course as licensees and

37
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:25,978
patients and even just everyday citizens

38
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:28,140
are beginning to grow what are the kinds

39
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,269
of clients that you find calling you for

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,759
trimming services you know it's

41
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:36,959
interesting we see clients all the way

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:40,188
from large scale commercial growers who

43
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,769
have several locations in which we trim

44
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:46,739
with teams of you know 15 to 20 trimmers

45
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:49,259
several days a week two personal growers

46
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,298
in their homes who have just a few

47
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,390
plants so really it's a it's a huge

48
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,770
range it's probably you know probably

49
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,739
feels like two different departments

50
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:01,379
because of the demands of your of your

51
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:04,048
big commercial growers the the

52
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,509
expediency and the regularity and and

53
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,060
how after once the contract is set up

54
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,699
its kind of plug and play versus your

55
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,348
you know your personal trimming services

56
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,789
where you know you might just be at

57
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:16,399
somebody's

58
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:18,009
house for a day or two and and so you

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,049
kinda have to create that relationship

60
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:23,269
anew with that person way differently

61
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:25,549
than the commercial clients for sure and

62
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:27,739
you know to that effect we make sure

63
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:29,989
that the people we send to our personal

64
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:32,239
and grow clients are our supervisors

65
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:34,099
there are our best trimmers they're our

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,030
fastest and and also they're in a

67
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:41,298
position to sort of educate in the home

68
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,449
as the client wants us to or doesn't

69
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:45,950
want us to they may want to sit with the

70
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:48,318
trimmer they may not it's really up to

71
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:51,018
them how involved in the process they

72
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,729
are and how closely they work with the

73
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:54,349
team yeah I can imagine that I can

74
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:55,638
imagine that there's a lot more customer

75
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:58,369
service actually it's probably really

76
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,109
weird to to be in some people's homes

77
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,609
right I mean that's a that's awfully

78
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:03,829
intimate and if they're growing maybe

79
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:05,269
sometimes they're a little sketchy about

80
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:07,189
having people in their homes and then

81
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,810
heck you know if their patients some

82
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:11,090
patients are you know they're living in

83
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,289
some rough situations sometimes I can

84
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,319
imagine that's a very colorful

85
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:17,479
environment for your team yeah you know

86
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:19,458
what we find is that it's really just

87
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:21,828
great people who generally are either

88
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:25,370
caregivers for them for their own needs

89
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:27,709
or caregivers for a friend or family or

90
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,400
a group of patients and they're they're

91
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:33,079
genuine kind individuals who just really

92
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,579
need a service sometimes especially with

93
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:38,269
the older folks it's just that they're

94
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:39,829
not able to manage it themselves you

95
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:42,889
know with some folks it's that they're

96
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:45,280
new it it just depends on the situation

97
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:48,229
some folks are just not able to

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,939
physically take care of the plants

99
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:53,479
themselves so there's some times that we

100
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:56,209
go do harvesting and gardening we can

101
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:59,449
move clones around it's really you know

102
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:01,310
a fit to your need kind of service

103
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:03,349
especially in that circumstance and

104
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,870
really even all the way up to the

105
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:08,388
commercial grower it it multiplies out

106
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,239
in the same way we use the same formula

107
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:12,979
regardless of where we are I can

108
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,378
actually imagine I mean I'm a patient at

109
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:17,419
all but my my hands still work fine and

110
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:20,089
I can do my own trimming but I hate

111
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:23,180
shrimping right and so and so you know

112
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:25,509
if if if you were in my state I think I

113
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,120
would just call because my time is

114
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:30,490
spent you know recording a podcast or

115
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,860
calling an advertiser instead of

116
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,019
spending my time trimming and so I think

117
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,949
that you know it makes I would expect

118
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:37,479
that you have a lot of people who

119
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:39,430
certainly can but it's just not how they

120
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,350
prefer to spend their time that's

121
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,110
exactly it and and also I mean that's

122
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:46,810
even true in the commercial spaces it's

123
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,389
not that they couldn't hire and manage

124
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,220
that staff it's that they prefer not to

125
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,459
that they have enough on their hands

126
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,930
just managing growing the plants and

127
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,430
it's a completely different skill set I

128
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,139
mean that's the other thing it just

129
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,300
because you know how to grow doesn't

130
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:04,110
mean you know how to manicure and and

131
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,650
interestingly we find some of the best

132
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:10,990
trimmers come from industries like

133
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:13,569
cosmetology school graduates for example

134
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,879
make excellent marijuana trimmers as you

135
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:17,920
can imagine and they're they're the

136
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:20,860
fastest that we've seen and the most

137
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,600
deft with the smaller smaller work which

138
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,160
you know some of it can be quite

139
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,879
meticulous yeah that makes a lot of

140
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,330
sense do you charge by weight or time we

141
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:33,459
charge per person per hour mm-hmm so

142
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:36,069
based on the size of the team that we

143
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:38,919
send you and the number of supervisors

144
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:41,379
versus trimmers that calculates an

145
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,629
hourly rate we don't charge any

146
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:46,149
administrative fees or anything weird on

147
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:48,819
top of that and you know on a daily

148
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:51,399
basis that gets observed by the grower

149
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:53,589
whether that's a personal grower or a

150
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,419
huge commercial grow they see the same

151
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:57,669
tablet that says this is how long we

152
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,439
were here this is who was here this is

153
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,710
how much a costume so it we try and keep

154
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,759
it as you know transparent and without

155
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:07,359
much room for error

156
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:11,469
I find that doing it by weight it just

157
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,610
kind of lends it to a to a lot of

158
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:18,130
variants and ways that things can go

159
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:20,170
askew yeah well then then you have to

160
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:23,889
change the price for dry or wet and how

161
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:25,840
dry is yeah yeah a lot of malarkey well

162
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:28,419
yeah I'm sure that I'm not the only one

163
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,099
listening to you who's curious about a

164
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,990
ballpark figure for what this would cost

165
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,750
and I also figure that you probably got

166
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,430
a wide range of pricing from like you

167
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,689
know your bulk commercial clients to

168
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,240
somebody you know who's a personal

169
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:43,219
so let's say that somebody has just got

170
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,889
you know here's your simple legal six

171
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,530
person grow and they've got you know

172
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:50,000
very you know moderately sized plant

173
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:53,539
let's say everything's like a medium

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,790
right so so what would I expect to it to

175
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,850
cost for to have one or two of your

176
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:03,530
people come and trim out my my six

177
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:06,770
plants you know I think that it would

178
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:09,229
really be just a few hundred dollars I

179
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:12,560
mean it would be a day of work for one

180
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:15,620
or two people and you know if it's six

181
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,660
really really productive plants like a

182
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:24,800
big big fat indica versus sativa that's

183
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,330
gonna have a lot fewer smaller buds that

184
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,980
are further apart that would make a

185
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:30,529
difference in how many hours it would

186
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,689
take but generally we wouldn't book more

187
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:34,129
than a day all of our personal grow

188
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,800
clients I've never really seen it go

189
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:38,689
over more than two days unless the

190
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,329
objective is for us to come and cut the

191
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:43,430
plants down on one day and do the

192
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:45,560
harvesting and D fanning and then let it

193
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,230
dry and come back and do the trimming on

194
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,939
another day which is you know quite

195
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,430
often how it goes so it could be two

196
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:54,350
days but it might only be four to six

197
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,180
hours of work on each day yeah I get

198
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,840
that I get that and and for me to think

199
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:02,629
okay my my six plants go from being cut

200
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,719
and hung which I would do to being you

201
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:07,610
know nice and in jars done for a few

202
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,770
hundred bucks I'd be like in you know

203
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,050
okay I'd be like that let's do what yeah

204
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:13,609
totally so you know there's a lot of

205
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,379
variety and trimming styles you know

206
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,629
like like you know if you're if you're

207
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:20,689
trimming for bag appeal it's gonna be a

208
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:21,889
lot tighter you know where I live in out

209
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:24,230
here on Vashon Island

210
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:26,149
you know people leave their flowers

211
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,770
really shaggy because they're like look

212
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:29,569
at all those trichomes on there you know

213
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:32,120
I'd rather have those on my flower than

214
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:34,009
you know in the trim which you know

215
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,929
you'd normally go somewhere else

216
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,580
what sort of client intake do you

217
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,348
perform to make sure that your team is

218
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,610
providing trimming that matches the

219
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:45,590
clients expectations right so so every

220
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,379
time we get a new client there's an

221
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,450
intake they go through that sort of

222
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:52,250
talks about do you twit trim your stuff

223
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:56,360
what do you trim dry

224
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:59,269
I are is this just us prepping a large

225
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,519
amount of cannabis to go into a trim

226
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:04,579
machine which is one job you know that

227
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,389
we do for really really big clients is

228
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,820
this are you gonna make some sort of

229
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:12,740
extract out of this are you

230
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,830
extracting in some way are you making

231
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,259
hash are you what are you doing you know

232
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,300
that's that's the the endgame sort of

233
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:24,519
can dictate the trim in some cases and

234
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:27,979
then all the way down to I want a loose

235
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:30,620
leafy trim maybe for something like a

236
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,870
caviar roll where you want to take all

237
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,429
your excess keef and and re-roll those

238
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,190
buds in it so you the leaves are

239
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:40,069
something for it to stick to we have

240
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,770
some clients who are absolutely you know

241
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,990
because their medical clients are on a

242
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:46,519
such a tight budget they want to make

243
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,649
sure there's not even any little tiny

244
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,019
crow's feet or anything left on the buds

245
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:52,759
that's extra stem because that's a lot

246
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:57,439
of time what the client is looking for

247
00:09:52,759 --> 00:10:00,319
you know the end user so as the kind of

248
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,540
intermediary our big deal is you we will

249
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,460
do it exactly how you want why we have

250
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:07,490
the supervisors there who can interface

251
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:10,129
directly with the client and and get

252
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,169
really specific information on what the

253
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:14,210
team is supposed to do and then also

254
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:18,079
over time you know because a lot of

255
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:19,940
places we go back over and over they'll

256
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,550
develop a rapport and then it becomes

257
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,280
you know almost fluid as a new member of

258
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:27,169
the team comes on to really get them up

259
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,750
to speed on that particular style for

260
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:31,909
that place fairly quickly right on that

261
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,559
makes a lot of sense let's let's dive in

262
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:37,009
the one aspect of that a little more

263
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:39,469
specific so so let's say that you've got

264
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:42,019
three clients one's gonna make

265
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,839
everything into bagged hash one person

266
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:47,419
is going to process it you know in a in

267
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,089
a you know a BHO tower or something and

268
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:53,029
the third person is going to you know

269
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:54,589
just just roll it up and smoke it so so

270
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:58,338
how would you trim differently for those

271
00:10:54,589 --> 00:11:02,060
three clients okay so for someone who's

272
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:05,480
making you know doing a Pho extract that

273
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:10,009
maybe they may be wanting

274
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,750
a very heavy trim product and that may

275
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:13,610
be all they're using to make their BHO

276
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,129
they may be then separating out the bud

277
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:20,449
or they may be doing what's called a nug

278
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:22,639
run which would be that extraction using

279
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:24,948
the buds as well so that would be the

280
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,110
point of clarification there would

281
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:29,719
obviously be are you you know is your

282
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:32,329
main product goal for the for the hash

283
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,600
going to be the trim or the trim plus

284
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:38,028
the bud what do you you know which thing

285
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,339
do you want and then and then if they

286
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:44,990
really want the everything together the

287
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:47,120
Phoenix tears then then it would just be

288
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:50,240
shucking essentially getting it off of

289
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,409
the stem and ready for you know

290
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,259
processing and that would probably

291
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:57,049
happen wet and and you wouldn't do much

292
00:11:54,259 --> 00:12:00,289
more to it after that but for somebody

293
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:03,229
who's gonna you know smoke the buds

294
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:07,250
themselves then typically we would do

295
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:10,370
something more of a Dee fan first in the

296
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,440
harvest flip and then and then trim it

297
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:16,669
down dry because you can get a much

298
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,949
finer trim on a dry product it's I think

299
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:21,769
you know it's it's a more time consuming

300
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:26,299
manicure but ultimately you're getting a

301
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:29,120
lot more flavor that's solely from the

302
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:32,448
bud and your you'll lose that kind of

303
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,120
hay taste or smell a lot more quickly if

304
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:37,729
you trim it that way I remember the

305
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,259
first time I was involved with a grow

306
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:45,259
for a large co2 run and it was the first

307
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:46,519
time I had done shucking right and you

308
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:50,299
know up to that point I had always just

309
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:52,698
trimmed for personal smoke right but

310
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:54,198
then you know I'm was watching guy was

311
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:56,419
being mentored and kind of learning how

312
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:58,578
to do this and I and I saw these folks

313
00:12:56,419 --> 00:13:01,039
just like you know shuck it right off

314
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:04,189
off the branch and it drops into the bin

315
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:06,588
and I'm like no effing way you know

316
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,410
you're all like you're like somewhere in

317
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:10,130
between is is that disrespectful to the

318
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:12,289
flower

319
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:15,198
oh my god this is gonna be the easiest

320
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:16,818
trim ever right exactly right and you're

321
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:18,849
never really sure which thing is true

322
00:13:16,818 --> 00:13:19,929
when you're doing that process

323
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,389
especially if you're working for

324
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:24,099
somebody else right yeah absolutely and

325
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:26,799
you know I mean it's a big

326
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,278
responsibility to get take somebody's

327
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:33,068
hard work over several weeks and and

328
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:35,470
then you know take it from that state to

329
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:37,439
a usable end product and that's really

330
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,028
the intermediary that the trimmer

331
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,620
performs in a lot of cases especially if

332
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:44,439
it's not going through an extraction

333
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,089
process you know if if the trimmer

334
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,480
mangles the buds they mangle the buds

335
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:52,089
and that's that's it if they're squashed

336
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,190
they're squashed and it's not like you

337
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:56,680
can suddenly you know replace them it's

338
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,540
like oh sorry no there's no like little

339
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,879
like bike tire pump that you can stick

340
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:03,549
back into it and sort of like oops

341
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:06,669
you know once you've squished it it's

342
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:09,219
it's over and and I think that that's

343
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:14,919
why it's such an intense process also

344
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:16,660
these guys are working in under extreme

345
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:18,338
scrutiny and that's the other thing to

346
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:20,338
keep in mind on the commercial level is

347
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:23,500
that we'll have a team of ten people

348
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:27,490
they'll have you know three or four

349
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:30,250
cameras on them at all times everything

350
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:33,399
has to be meticulously weighed and

351
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:37,809
accounted for because of the systems

352
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:40,480
here that are extremely rigorous in

353
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:45,328
managing this whole market both on the

354
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:48,278
medical and retail side so you know it's

355
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:51,039
it's a lot of responsibility and and we

356
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:53,409
don't take that lightly nor does anyone

357
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,049
really in the whole chain of process

358
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:57,610
that's involved with this on a

359
00:14:55,049 --> 00:15:00,909
commercial level you have to take it

360
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,379
really seriously right on we're gonna

361
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:04,480
take our first short break and be right

362
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:06,938
back you are listening to shaping fire

know

371
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:29,169

396
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:26,698
you know I listened recently to smoke

397
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:29,458
signals by Martin Lee from Project CBD

398
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:31,769
org Martin's book is a classic of

399
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:35,128
cannabis advocacy he explains the

400
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:37,948
history of cannabis in America THC and

401
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:40,139
CBD cannabis science and why cannabis

402
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:42,299
policy in America has gotten so jacked

403
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:44,428
you know if you consider yourself a

404
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,049
cannabis person this book really is a

405
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:48,120
must

406
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:49,318
talking cannabis we all sound radical

407
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,990
just because we're talking about weed

408
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:54,419
but if you learn the history and science

409
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:57,028
of cannabis suddenly you become smart

410
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:58,498
and trustworthy to people the book was

411
00:16:57,028 --> 00:17:00,659
really incredible and there's no doubt

412
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:02,428

welcome back you are listening to

427
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,569
shaping fire I'm your host Shango Lowe's

428
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:42,479
and our guest this week is Kristen

429
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:44,970
Baldwin director of operations at Green

430
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,730
harvest so in the first set we talked a

431
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,860
lot about kind of the idea of of the

432
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,038
trimming business and the kinds of

433
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:55,918
people who hire you and and actually how

434
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:58,589
damn necessary it is in the new legal

435
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,230
market and and it's funny because you

436
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:03,720
know a lot of people have trimmed before

437
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:06,360
and so a lot of people have got their

438
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,179
preferred method and their preferred

439
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,189
scissors and so I'm like totally curious

440
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,630
you know in online grower forms it seems

441
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,820
like everybody has their own favorite

442
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,220
scissors I myself like small

443
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:18,569
spring-loaded scissors with a curved tip

444
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,759
so you know so I can like get on in

445
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:23,428
there in the flower yeah but my growing

446
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,528
mentor he prefers tiny scissors without

447
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:28,409
a spring but with really big hand

448
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:31,109
openings do you find that that your team

449
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:32,760
like everybody likes their own style or

450
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:34,769
is there a particular style that seems

451
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:38,038
to really come out as being you know

452
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:41,669
universally best by professionals sure

453
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:43,109
yes so we I think in the early days of

454
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:44,100
Green Mountain harvest so that was it

455
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:46,229
like six years ago

456
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:49,589
they did experiment with several

457
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:52,048
different styles of shears and what

458
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:54,329
we've settled on and really we provide

459
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:56,788
all of the tools through a supervisor

460
00:18:54,329 --> 00:19:00,928
kit that they carry in the field we use

461
00:18:56,788 --> 00:19:03,058
the Hydrofarm curved blade shear and we

462
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:05,190
chose that one because for a few reasons

463
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:07,710
one it's super affordable we think it's

464
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,720
a really good price point the curved

465
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:14,480
blade kind of like you said is really

466
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:17,190
what we think creates the the tightest

467
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,250
tightest trim and also it's it's the

468
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:23,130
easiest on your wrist we find because

469
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:26,669
you're not curving your hand as often

470
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:29,970
the blade is curved so you can have a

471
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:31,889
straighter arm and allow the curve of

472
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:35,970
the blade and then the twist of the

473
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:39,119
plant rather than arcing your your wrist

474
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:41,190
at a funny angle and you know that that

475
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,638
makes me think about OSHA standards and

476
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,169
just generate worker health you know

477
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:48,178
you're in this odd position because your

478
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:50,610
company is the state level but obviously

479
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,230
cannabis is still illegal federally you

480
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:55,229
know what kind of best practices have

481
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:56,009
you put together for you know creating

482
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,440
an environment

483
00:19:56,009 --> 00:20:00,390
that is you know ergonomically healthy

484
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,220
for your Yammer's even though they've

485
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,960
spent their entire day using their hands

486
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,130
and probably sitting down which is

487
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,319
probably two of the worst things that

488
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:11,040
you could be doing yeah for sure so

489
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:13,829
actually you know we really really made

490
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,529
a point of keeping safety as a main

491
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:20,429
priority for our team and so to that

492
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:23,039
effect you know we at when they are

493
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:27,019
hired they're given a set of exercises

494
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:29,639
for their wrists and their backs we also

495
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:33,089
have a system in place where our

496
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:36,720
trimmers can sit or stand and they can

497
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:38,879
go back and forth so unless there's some

498
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,059
really heavy space constraints that

499
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,640
would disallow somebody from being able

500
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:47,490
to get up and and and choose to sit or

501
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,970
stand we encourage people to really take

502
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:54,470
both of those options and and you know

503
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:57,000
surprisingly though OSHA is a federal

504
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,789
organization they have been great

505
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,190
working with me directly over my years

506
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:05,460
in this industry regardless of the

507
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:07,890
context and really you know come and

508
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,980
educated us and had open dialogue with

509
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:14,490
with the industry so yeah we're in a

510
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:19,529
funny place there's no there's no doubt

511
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:22,170
about that but you know our main goal is

512
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:24,000
to create an environment for our

513
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,980
trimmers that's healthy so that also

514
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,220
involves not just an ergonomics

515
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:37,170
situation but some other things as well

516
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:39,930
and to that effect it it it we have some

517
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:42,990
some other things masks if there's any

518
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:45,420
kind of mold or mildew present we use a

519
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,089
food grade brown butcher paper on the

520
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:52,560
tables so that each environment is

521
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:56,569
sterile our trimmers all use a new set

522
00:21:52,559 --> 00:22:00,240
of gloves after each break so they are

523
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:03,960
able to have you know left the building

524
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,120
and come back and clean your do you know

525
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,650
do you have a daily team that's pretty

526
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,908
much full-time or is it pretty much all

527
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,479
part-timers

528
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:14,580
who are on call so all of our people are

529
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:16,950
part-time they are employees with us

530
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:19,259
which allows them to be covered under

531
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:22,528
our workman's comp which is a huge key

532
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:26,669
in this industry really trying to you

533
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:29,759
know put as many of those standards of

534
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:31,379
normal working conditions in place for

535
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,108
people even though again we're in that

536
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:37,949
funny gray area but generally the

537
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:41,278
trimmers work between 25 and 35 hours a

538
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:43,259
week you know December is certainly

539
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:45,960
slower we joke that we think that the

540
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:47,669
trimmers get less work because the

541
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,558
growers plan not to have to harvest

542
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:52,649
right around Christmas because why would

543
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:56,428
they want to you know right and that's

544
00:22:52,648 --> 00:22:58,558
fine you know we can plan for that but

545
00:22:56,429 --> 00:23:01,080
like I'm looking at our January schedule

546
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,989
and it's it's totally insane I think

547
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:06,689
everyone who didn't harvest in December

548
00:23:03,989 --> 00:23:09,149
is harvesting in January and then we

549
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:12,119
also sort of lovingly call October hemp

550
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:16,439
Tober here in Colorado because all the

551
00:23:12,118 --> 00:23:18,509
big outdoor farms that's a big big time

552
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,690
for them so that can be really fun and

553
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:23,999
exciting little trips for the trimmers

554
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:27,599
out to these really cool outdoor big big

555
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:29,399
you know really really nice farms that's

556
00:23:27,598 --> 00:23:31,648
one of the funny things about outdoor

557
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:33,719
isn't it you know the idea of harvest I

558
00:23:31,648 --> 00:23:35,998
mean obviously there's lots of indoor in

559
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,659
the country and and there's certainly

560
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:42,629
way more harvesting taking place as I as

561
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:44,909
far as around the calendar but in volume

562
00:23:42,628 --> 00:23:46,769
you know harvest suddenly you're needed

563
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:48,899
everywhere do you have you know a

564
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:51,388
seasonal spike where you need to over

565
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:53,189
hire just for harvest season and then

566
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:56,339
you get back down to a more basic crew

567
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,808
for the rest of the year you know we we

568
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:59,519
actually don't follow that kind of

569
00:23:57,808 --> 00:24:02,460
hiring practice once you're an employee

570
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,769
with us you're an employee and we do our

571
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,319
best to provide you hours consistently

572
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:10,108
you know and so for us it really is a

573
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:12,538
balance of demanding excellence from our

574
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:14,970
team so that the people that do stay

575
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:16,888
with us are the best ones and then and

576
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,710
then making sure that those people have

577
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:22,229
work and and it's a delicate balance I

578
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:24,000
you know I do handle

579
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:26,069
a lot of the hiring and firing and all

580
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,650
the stuff in between and I do find that

581
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:30,629
you know I do want to be able to provide

582
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,250
work for people immediately when I hire

583
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:34,110
them

584
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,940
but I do have to caution them that this

585
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:40,139
is a business where there are lulls and

586
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:43,259
so we give our employees the opportunity

587
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:46,620
to sort of create their own schedules in

588
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:50,160
the sense that they're they have some

589
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:52,229
some big flexibility there which to that

590
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,360
effect if they need to have another

591
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,980
part-time job to supplement this we

592
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,469
understand that that's part of the deal

593
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,419
you know on that note is it hard to find

594
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,190
skilled trimmers you know to fill all

595
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,410
the ranks because so many people say

596
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,400
they've got experience and then that you

597
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,620
know maybe they're too slow or

598
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,019
distracted or sloppy or drunk or

599
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:15,119
whatever yeah so all those things have

600
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:18,359
happened and you know that's part of why

601
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:21,689
we have this supervisor in the field for

602
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:24,509
each group of 12 trimmers that allows us

603
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:28,110
to sort of regardless of what your

604
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:30,419
resume says really watch what you do in

605
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:33,709
that first 30-day probation period and

606
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:36,299
then if if we can't get you up to speed

607
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,130
in that first 30 days then then

608
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:39,629
typically that'll be it for people who

609
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:42,270
just can't cut the mustard and and

610
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,980
sometimes you know the other the other

611
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:46,589
side of the equation is true people find

612
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:50,640
out that they really can't or don't

613
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:54,569
enjoy the repetitive nature of the of

614
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,009
the job and and so we do have people who

615
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:58,759
will do it for a couple of weeks and

616
00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:00,900
then say yeah I don't want to do this

617
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:03,150
but for people that want to put their

618
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,160
headphones on and you know listen to an

619
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:08,730
awesome podcast like this one and and

620
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:10,710
and trim some plants and be with some

621
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,509
great people it's a it's a great job

622
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,690
the other cool thing is that we can hire

623
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:17,730
people with some disabilities so that's

624
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,429
pretty neat because you know it's like

625
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:21,990
you have a walker hey man if you can get

626
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:25,470
into the facility and we'll make sure

627
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:27,179
you can then you can sit down and trim

628
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,910
and that's good for people who are

629
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:32,009
retired we have a lot of folks that just

630
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:35,759
turn with us one or two days a week you

631
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:37,019
know and have their own grows and and

632
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:38,670
and just loved it and had been with us

633
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:43,160
for years and years we have other people

634
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:45,960
who are you know fast young people

635
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:49,170
directly from the industry in the last

636
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:53,940
few years who just are amazing and and

637
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:56,039
and and so so so so fast so that's

638
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,039
that's the other side of the workforce

639
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,119
is people who've just been trained

640
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:02,609
commercially in the last few years but

641
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:05,219
we don't hire anyone directly who

642
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:08,159
doesn't have some sort of trimming

643
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,809
experience I'm if you don't have any

644
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,170
trimming experience then we have a

645
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:16,529
trimmer training school sort of program

646
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:18,509
you can can choose to go through you

647
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:21,410
know I've met some folks who are on the

648
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:24,480
autistic spectrum and it's amazing how

649
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,640
appropriate trimming is for a lot of the

650
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,990
folks oh yeah I've got the hyper focused

651
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,210
ability and they can work for long

652
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,950
periods of time you just like you know

653
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,870
you you allow them to wear their

654
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,759
headphones and let I don't you need done

655
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:38,189
and boom and you're like damn it was

656
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,019
done fast and efficiently and in good

657
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,600
cheer and you know it's really great

658
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:44,430
it's amazing the kinds of people you

659
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:47,399
know who are able to work in our

660
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:49,650
industry who had not necessarily had the

661
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:54,360
opportunity before can can folks get

662
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:56,340
high on the job no no no yeah there's

663
00:27:54,359 --> 00:28:02,250
really strict regulations in place

664
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:04,019
around use anywhere within 500 feet of a

665
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:07,410
commercial facility whether it's a grow

666
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:12,109
or a store or an extraction facility you

667
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:16,050
can't use the product or even bring

668
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:17,429
personal product into that facility so

669
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:19,919
technically when you go into a

670
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:22,250
dispensary you're not supposed to even

671
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,019
have any cannabis already on you and

672
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:26,819
technically if they see that they have

673
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:32,129
to ask you to leave and and if one of

674
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:34,379
our trimmers is observed using cannabis

675
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,960
within 500 feet of a facility we have to

676
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:40,170
fire them that day because they can lose

677
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,509
their light their badge essentially to

678
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,950
work in the industry for just that I can

679
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:45,539
imagine that for a lot of trimmers

680
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,860
that's a that's a deal breaker right

681
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,539
they're like listen if I'm going to be

682
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,998
trim in 30 hours a week I want to be

683
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,949
high

684
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:53,919
or it's oh no no good no good for me

685
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:57,999
right well you know what you do at home

686
00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:01,149
is your business what time of day you do

687
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:02,588
that is also your business what you do

688
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:04,688
when you leave the facility is your

689
00:29:02,588 --> 00:29:07,749
business but what you do while you have

690
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:10,869
to be at the facility that's the key so

691
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:13,449
you know on a 15-minute break where

692
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:16,238
you're not allowed to leave you can go

693
00:29:13,449 --> 00:29:17,889
outside and stretch but you know it's 15

694
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:21,249
minutes you can't leave the facility

695
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:25,238
you can't smoke weed and and that you

696
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:27,038
know I feel like there's ways that

697
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:29,259
people could probably get around that if

698
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,449
their dosage requires like a morning use

699
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:33,159
they could maybe supplement with an

700
00:29:31,449 --> 00:29:35,409
edible or something else I mean no one

701
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:38,079
is suggesting that especially for a

702
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:40,629
medical patient they don't do what they

703
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:42,848
need to do but you can't be using the

704
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:44,708
product on the job that's the main thing

705
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:47,108
and that's you know true just across the

706
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:50,318
board and and I think that that's the

707
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:53,138
one of the big differences between you

708
00:29:50,318 --> 00:29:56,739
know what what people think we do in

709
00:29:53,138 --> 00:29:59,498
this industry and what we do is that

710
00:29:56,739 --> 00:30:02,919
there really isn't a lot of use in in

711
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:05,288
the actual manifestation of the industry

712
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,659
itself that's sort of a completely

713
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:09,669
separate thing at this point and I think

714
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:12,189
the more the more commercial and

715
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:13,778
commodity based if he comes it's going

716
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:16,298
to continue in that direction

717
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:18,368
I remember when everybody was working in

718
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:21,009
medical and it was much less regulated

719
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:22,838
and and loose you know everybody would

720
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:24,939
get high at the beginning of you know

721
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:26,528
just about every business meeting and ER

722
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:29,169
and because that's how cannabis culture

723
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:30,368
was you know I I found that frustrating

724
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:32,528
a lot of time because even though I got

725
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:34,269
to try some amazing you know flowers and

726
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:36,459
oils from that people would bring to the

727
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:38,229
meetings at the same time so many of the

728
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:40,538
folks would not remember the key points

729
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:42,278
of the meeting or what they or what they

730
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,868
committed to do and then I would have to

731
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:46,088
send follow-up emails to remind them

732
00:30:43,868 --> 00:30:48,098
what they agreed to so even though even

733
00:30:46,088 --> 00:30:51,278
though I enjoy the social aspects of it

734
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:53,438
I do see as as cannabis businesses are

735
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:57,489
getting more serious the less people who

736
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:59,679
are doing it you know cooked its yeah I

737
00:30:57,489 --> 00:31:01,328
mean it's sort of like you know I guess

738
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,559
the three-martini lunch would be the

739
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:04,359
closest

740
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,999
equation you know and and even if you're

741
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:10,359
in the beer industry you're not testing

742
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:12,339
beers at 9 a.m. every day like you just

743
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:16,689
you can't do it it's just like in any

744
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:18,548
industry where there's this quality to

745
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:21,909
it where there's some sort of you know

746
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:25,720
state of alteration that's going to

747
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:30,360
occur I think that you know in this

748
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:33,610
industry the reality is you're trying to

749
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:37,928
mitigate that weird gray area that weird

750
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:39,459
federal state gray Aryan so I think this

751
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:42,399
is one of the ways that they've done

752
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:44,159
that and then the other side of it is

753
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:47,258
exactly what you're talking about

754
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,090
professionally at 10:00 a.m. you know

755
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:52,118
would it be appropriate to pop a bottle

756
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:55,839
of wine maybe on a special day but

757
00:31:52,118 --> 00:32:00,099
probably not you know probably not if

758
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:02,230
you want to get a lot done so what

759
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:04,240
people need to do to take care of

760
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:07,929
themselves medically again is another

761
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,669
thing but I would say recreational use

762
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:11,619
in a meeting is really bad especially

763
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:13,629
because you could have 10 different

764
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:16,118
people who respond to that particular

765
00:32:13,628 --> 00:32:18,189
strain super differently so that could

766
00:32:16,118 --> 00:32:20,470
be one that's really like makes you

767
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,330
really focused but it may not work that

768
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,999
way for this whole group of people that

769
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:28,329
you know now you have to make decisions

770
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:30,069
with yeah in there oh yeah that makes

771
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:31,868
sense so we're gonna take another short

772
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:33,460
break and be right back you are

773
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:35,499
listening to shaping fire and my guest

774
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:38,710
today is Kristen Baldwin of Green

775
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:40,600
Mountain harvest businesses everywhere

776
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:42,730
are constantly striving to reach out to

777
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:44,378
people through advertising we all know

778
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,970
though that trying to reach a cannabis

779
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:47,859
audience with a quality message is

780
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,749
pretty difficult that's why many people

781
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:52,719
choose to advertise on the shaping fire

782
00:32:49,749 --> 00:32:54,548
podcast advertising on this show allows

783
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,409
us time to talk about your product

784
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:58,359
service or brand in a way that really

785
00:32:56,409 --> 00:33:00,759
lets people know what sets your company

786
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:02,288
apart from others bold people who own

787
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:03,788
companies know that getting in a

788
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:07,028
relationship with their customers is

789
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:09,128
essential that is what we offer we will

790
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:11,558
explain your service or product and what

791
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:13,778
sets it apart as desirable and help our

792
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:14,878
audience get in contact with you it's

793
00:33:13,778 --> 00:33:16,480
pretty simple really

794
00:33:14,878 --> 00:33:18,480
advertising does not have

795
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,069
to be all whiz-bang smoke and mirrors

796
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,650
nowadays I find that people prefer just

797
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:26,168
to be spoken to calmly accurately and

798
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:27,700
with good intentions if you want to make

799
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:30,610
your own commercial spot you can do that

800
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:33,069
too because the podcast is young but

801
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:34,899
growing in an exceptionally fast rate if

802
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:37,329
you become an advertiser on the shaping

803
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,130
fire podcast now you are going to pay a

804
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:41,500
fraction of the cost will be asking for

805
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:43,750
in just a few months and yet everyone

806

years it's a great deal for you pay a

810
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:55,029

shaping fire I'm your host Shango losan

819
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:14,319
our guest this week is Kristen Baldwin

820
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:17,079
director of operations at Green Mountain

821
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,450
harvest so before the break we were

822
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:22,869
talking about a lot of the specifics on

823
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:25,628
not only running a business but working

824
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:27,429
the best possible customer service with

825
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:29,648
either the commercial growers or with

826
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:31,059
personal growers and you know during the

827
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:33,159
break I was thinking about it and it

828
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:35,019
made me wonder about employee theft

829
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,789
because you know you know in a big

830
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:38,289
commercial environment you know maybe

831
00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:40,059
you can do something on the slide that

832
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:41,440
the cameras don't see and if you're

833
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:43,329
something you know if you're in a real

834
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,668
informal situation in somebody's home

835
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:48,398
you know I can imagine you know being

836
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:49,839
able to abscond with some there you know

837
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:51,638
what's what's your experience with

838
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,210
employee theft you know is that much of

839
00:34:51,639 --> 00:35:00,039
an issue yeah so you know we really

840
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:02,829
really really just sort of impale with

841
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:05,619
every ounce of our strength into our

842
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:07,869
employees how dumb it would be to try so

843
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:09,550
we don't typically have a lot of problem

844
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:11,140
with that that being said you know

845
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:20,050
people try all kinds of crazy things

846
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:21,940
like like there was an incident in one

847
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:26,560
of the very first dispensaries that I

848
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:30,429
worked in where the employee he was in

849
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:34,358
on their trim team and what he would do

850
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:38,078
would be to put like several gloves over

851
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:40,358
his glove and then he would successively

852
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:44,440
put a but in each glove and stick it in

853
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:46,298
his pocket as he was trimming but you

854
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,659
know I don't think that he really

855
00:35:46,298 --> 00:35:53,710
understood that his adidas like running

856
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:56,108
pants were very much showing the outline

857
00:35:53,710 --> 00:36:01,449
of these like what looked like golf

858
00:35:56,108 --> 00:36:05,019
balls in his pockets and so you know I

859
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:06,038
noticed this and it I couldn't figure

860
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:07,538
out what was going on because he

861
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:12,579
definitely didn't have golf balls in his

862
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:15,730
pocket when he came to work so that was

863
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:18,309
one of those situations where you know I

864
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:22,838
think it seemed like a good plan at the

865
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:24,400
outset but in in execution particularly

866
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:26,349
with the number of cameras that he was

867
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,630
visible on I just did not go well for

868
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:31,210
him yeah I can imagine that you know and

869
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:33,838
what I find is you know there's so much

870
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:37,150
cannabis just around in the industry

871
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:40,028
it's kind of a really dumb play to steal

872
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:41,650
from work you know it really is so easy

873
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:43,179
you know everybody's got it in the

874
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:45,338
industry so why would you then go and

875
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:47,169
risk your job to steal it right but

876
00:36:45,338 --> 00:36:49,389
here's a funny thing like you know even

877
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,400
at the beginning there was a whole point

878
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:54,129
of contention around well what do you do

879
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,809
with the little buds that fall on the

880
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:58,028
floor

881
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:59,950
riot Legos floor weed that just kind of

882
00:36:58,028 --> 00:37:01,630
like in the early days that was just

883
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:05,679
sort of going out the door I was floor

884
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:07,329
weed you know but even that in the long

885
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:11,108
term had to be accounted for and there

886
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:13,210
had to be standards of operation put in

887
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:15,068
place to say no you have to actually

888
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:18,278
take that back and weigh it and say this

889
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:19,449
is how much we wasted and and account

890
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:23,528
for it and then destroy it

891
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:27,159
you can't just sweep it up and stick it

892
00:37:23,528 --> 00:37:29,500
in a jar and take it home so so let's

893
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,118
let's flip that dynamic around instead

894
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,849
instead of the

895
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,798
the trimmer stealing like how let's talk

896
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:37,838
about arbitrage like what is yeah what

897
00:37:35,798 --> 00:37:40,478
if you get like a you know somebody

898
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:43,509
who's got a personal grow and in lieu of

899
00:37:40,478 --> 00:37:45,608
paying you for some or all of it they

900
00:37:43,509 --> 00:37:48,009
want to give you your trim or give you

901
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:50,440
their item for you to then like resell

902
00:37:48,009 --> 00:37:52,869
to you know a BHO person or something

903
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,249
does is that is that a is that legal be

904
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:54,789
is that something that you ever come

905
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:57,998
across

906
00:37:54,789 --> 00:38:00,609
right so no that's not legal you know

907
00:37:57,998 --> 00:38:04,088
the only intermediary we would be in

908
00:38:00,608 --> 00:38:06,670
that process would be if we're brought

909
00:38:04,088 --> 00:38:08,619
in to trim and then they're separating

910
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:12,338
those things out and they send it with a

911
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:15,028
licensed courier from their operation or

912
00:38:12,338 --> 00:38:19,150
another to take that to an operator we

913
00:38:15,028 --> 00:38:21,699
can't we can't have the product at any

914
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:24,190
point that's the the nature of the

915
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:28,718
difference in our licensing doesn't

916
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:31,989
allow us to to have it to move it to

917
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:34,989
grow it to sell it nothing like that

918
00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:38,199
because that requires a much different

919
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:41,400
license than what we have we're an

920
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:44,588
ancillary vendor so we don't we don't

921
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,769
have you know a middleman on the deal we

922
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:51,909
can yeah we all that stuff is RFID tags

923
00:38:47,768 --> 00:38:57,038
so essentially we don't own or move any

924
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:59,409
RFID tag product so so let's let's talk

925
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,670
about licenses in a different way so up

926
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:03,548
to this point we've been talking about

927
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:06,999
either having a a license to do a

928
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:09,338
cannabis business or an individual

929
00:39:06,998 --> 00:39:12,278
person having their badge which allows

930
00:39:09,338 --> 00:39:15,369
them to work in the industry but learns

931
00:39:12,278 --> 00:39:17,528
but you know I have not come across

932
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:19,450
actually I mean you're the only one

933
00:39:17,528 --> 00:39:21,309
actually you're the first trim company

934
00:39:19,449 --> 00:39:22,989
that I've come across which is why I was

935
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:24,759
so curious to have you on the show and

936
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:26,228
you know I've been I've been all over

937
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:28,269
the country talking to people at this

938
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:31,778
point and so I think that you know the

939
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:34,419
days of trimming businesses have have

940
00:39:31,778 --> 00:39:35,440
now have now arrived and yeah and

941
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,680
there's you're going to be having a lot

942
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,318
more competition soon so so are you

943
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:43,409
looking to other states to license your

944
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:45,119
intellectual property and you know

945
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:46,858
not a franchise right because we all

946
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,440
understand that friends yeah isn't legal

947
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:51,869
but but you know are you looking to

948
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,588
expand the Green Mountain harvest name

949
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:57,119
into other states we are absolutely yeah

950
00:39:55,588 --> 00:40:00,808
we have business opportunities now

951
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:05,630
available in any state where its medical

952
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:07,859
or retail or somewhere in between we are

953
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,920
available to create business

954
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:12,630
opportunities for you know people who

955
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,579
want to do this there and when the owner

956
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:17,280
Susan Tchaikovsky started this six years

957
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,599
ago she really saw a need for this an

958
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,010
industry and no one else was doing it

959
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,430
and she had to go to the state and say

960
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:24,990
this is what I want to do and they said

961
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:28,048
wow that's a really good idea we hadn't

962
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:29,879
even thought about that you know it

963
00:40:28,048 --> 00:40:33,509
wouldn't hadn't even crossed anybody's

964
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,640
mind that this was a really valuable and

965
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:39,930
necessary piece of the puzzle to make

966
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:41,699
all this work so we have lots of

967
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:43,980
different services available to that and

968
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:46,318
we sometimes just go and we'll train

969
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,358
teams of trimmers for people that

970
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:51,358
already have an existing operation and

971
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:53,909
and want to have an on-site team so

972
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:56,400
we've sent people to other states and

973
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:58,379
we'll send you know again some of our

974
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,460
supervisors and Susan the owner will go

975
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:04,470
and they stay for a few days or a week

976
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,599
or two and they get everybody up to

977
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:09,298
speed that's one option the other option

978
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:11,940
is to actually you know become a partner

979
00:41:09,298 --> 00:41:14,818
a Green Mountain harvest partner and and

980
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:18,240
and carry that name into another state

981
00:41:14,818 --> 00:41:20,308
and in that case then you know you get a

982
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:23,808
huge amount of our intellectual property

983
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:26,630
and our standard practices and how we

984
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:30,059
how we operate in that gray area

985
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:32,190
successfully which is which is kind of

986
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:35,130
part of the key for sure let's let's

987
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:37,650
circle back to your you mentioning Susan

988
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:39,358
going to the state to try to get the

989
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:42,329
blessing for this kind of a business

990
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,909
model because that is a really important

991
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:46,528
entrepreneurial point and a lot of

992
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:47,788
people are like oh now that cannabis is

993
00:41:46,528 --> 00:41:49,920
legal I'm just gonna start a business

994
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:51,480
and I don't have to be an activist

995
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,088
but but right I think that all

996
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,639
entrepreneurs in cannabis have to remain

997
00:41:54,088 --> 00:41:58,798
activists I mean not only to make sure

998
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,690
that your your local government doesn't

999
00:41:58,798 --> 00:42:03,599
pass some kind of moratorium that's

1000
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:06,690
gonna suddenly you know tie your hands

1001
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,369
but what Susan did you know Susan had to

1002
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,260
come up not only with the business idea

1003
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:12,930
but then she had to lobby for it with

1004
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:15,299
regulators so that there was a license

1005
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:18,449
allowance for it and I think that's a

1006
00:42:15,298 --> 00:42:20,818
that's extra credit to Susan for

1007
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:22,259
stepping up and following that and I

1008
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:23,909
think that's a good lesson for everybody

1009
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,460
that you know you might have a

1010
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:27,960
groundbreaking idea and you're gonna

1011
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:31,289
have to sell it to your regulators

1012
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,420
absolutely I mean yeah it's all about

1013
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:36,750
being part of the movement overall and

1014
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,579
so you may have a great idea and you may

1015
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:41,400
be really scared about you know coming

1016
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:44,609
out of a gray market or a black market

1017
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,200
with that idea but unless you stand up

1018
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:48,029
and unless you become part of the

1019
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:51,088
movement and say this is what I'm doing

1020
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:54,119
and this is why it's important then you

1021
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:57,239
know you don't move us all forward as a

1022
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:01,200
whole and and that's really what she did

1023
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:05,639
was say not only do I want to have you

1024
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:08,009
know provide a safe way to handle the

1025
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:10,980
product for this particular point in its

1026
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:13,650
process but also what does a business

1027
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:17,130
model look like that really supports its

1028
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:19,980
employees as if this were any other

1029
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:24,240
industry you have to have workman's comp

1030
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:26,358
you have to make people employees and

1031
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:29,759
not have them work as contract labor

1032
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:31,619
which is so often what people are more

1033
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,740
apt to do because it's easier for the

1034
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:36,690
employer but it provides the employee no

1035
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:39,598
protection they're not an employee

1036
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:42,510
they're just they're not they have no

1037
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,068
protection so Susan really did say I

1038
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:45,990
want to do this but I want to do this

1039
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:49,469
right and what does this look like and

1040
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:51,509
got amazing certifications put in in

1041
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:53,818
place for our company that sort of stay

1042
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:55,799
we are the most compliant and this is

1043
00:43:53,818 --> 00:43:57,568
how that looks and and that's why I was

1044
00:43:55,798 --> 00:43:59,489
excited to come and work with her after

1045
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:01,949
years of doing other things in the

1046
00:43:59,489 --> 00:44:03,219
industry for sure and and I think that

1047
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:04,989
it really helps the end

1048
00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:07,480
three as a whole when people like Susan

1049
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:09,789
provide that leadership because then the

1050
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,159
regulators can point and say look here's

1051
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:14,710
a good actor who's doing it the right

1052
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:17,469
way who is doing the things that that

1053
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:19,720
cause us to feel more safe as regulators

1054
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:21,879
and then I know hopefully eventually

1055
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:24,159
some of those regulations can be a

1056
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:28,030
little loosened so that they don't cost

1057
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:30,039
as much for companies to comply but

1058
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:32,170
fright now you know we've got this

1059
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:34,929
strange dance between entrepreneurs and

1060
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:37,000
regulators of you know what can the

1061
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:39,549
entrepreneurs get away with versus the

1062
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,829
regulator's wanting to you know regulate

1063
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:44,260
or and/or ban everything because they're

1064
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:46,239
afraid of risk absolutely and that's and

1065
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,060
and that's why people have to be really

1066
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:52,479
vocal and they have to get out there and

1067
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:55,179
you know even to the point of for

1068
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:58,449
children who are using cannabis patches

1069
00:44:55,179 --> 00:45:00,419
in schools that was a big big hurdle

1070
00:44:58,449 --> 00:45:02,858
that we had to overcome here in Colorado

1071
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,990
helping people understand that this is a

1072
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:08,500
medicine and that these kids are using

1073
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:13,449
it they're not getting high at school a

1074
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:17,289
kid in a wheelchair whose can move their

1075
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:20,019
arms solely because they've started

1076
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:22,920
using these patches isn't getting high

1077
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:28,659
they're having a better quality of life

1078
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:31,930
so so even something as you know simple

1079
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:33,579
as that takes a huge group of people and

1080
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:37,358
a lot of effort and a lot of people

1081
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:39,519
coming forward so you know what I would

1082
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:42,039
say to anyone in those states that where

1083
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,949
it's still kind of gray is don't don't

1084
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:47,800
stay in the dark just get out there and

1085
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:49,719
be vocal and and get and and get ready

1086
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,900
to sort of be part of something special

1087
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:55,149
because you know the amazing other side

1088
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:57,070
of this is that after you've been in a

1089
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:58,869
state where it's gone recreational and

1090
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:01,720
you've supported the the medical market

1091
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:03,608
and you've seen you know what's happened

1092
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:05,980
here in Colorado some of the outcomes

1093
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:08,009
with people getting out of jail and all

1094
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:10,539
the cool stuff that happens on the side

1095
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:13,000
with the medical research and the kids

1096
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:16,119
getting better and the seizures going

1097
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,670
away it's it's just it's worth coming

1098
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:18,920
out of the dark

1099
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:22,269
and you know like Susan is going to

1100
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:26,088
Pennsylvania for example where you know

1101
00:46:22,269 --> 00:46:28,789
to speak at a conference that's all just

1102
00:46:26,088 --> 00:46:30,739
for doctors who were you know just just

1103
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:33,558
getting the doctors on board as crucial

1104
00:46:30,739 --> 00:46:36,919
so you know there's there's work to be

1105
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:38,809
done in every state and and and and what

1106
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,309
I say is just be brave and go do it
