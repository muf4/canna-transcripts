1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,710
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:10,589
University topic for today is I chose

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,370
the words carefully when I named it

4
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:16,048
I don't really study climate change not

5
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,210
really interested in measuring the

6
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:21,269
minutiae of carbon and things like that

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,699
I am on the other end of it and that's

8
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,439
why I chose the word confronting because

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,260
that's what it feels like we're doing

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,929
all the time with the professionals that

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,989
I work with in my role as an extension

12
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:36,409
scientist okay so I have a couple of

13
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:41,039
words to work through today obviously

14
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:43,759
confronting is the way I feel much of my

15
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,929
work both in research and extension goes

16
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:49,308
and because I'm not a government

17
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:51,988
scientist I can still say climate change

18
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:54,058
this is quite a big joke in Canada I can

19
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:57,599
tell you and urban grass lands right

20
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:59,250
many of you know I like many of the

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,850
people who do what I do around the

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,340
country

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,500
you know the turf guy in in Nebraska the

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,290
turf guy in Wisconsin I've been the turf

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,579
guy in New York and now I'm have to

26
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,320
figure out how to make something cool

27
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,900
out of urban grasslands because that

28
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,089
seems to be their trendy term so let's

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,180
look at the what what I want to cover

30
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:22,020
with you in a little bit of time that we

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:26,189
have here's how I've organized my work

32
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:27,719
and how I view the situation honestly

33
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:30,750
when you hear the word grasslands it

34
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:34,978
might it might hearken you to the

35
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,500
savannas the great savannahs of Africa I

36
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,450
think when you say urban grasslands my

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,519
sense is this is what most people think

38
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,700
that somehow they think it must be a

39
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:47,789
prairie we get to have in the city and

40
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,030
again you know the idea that this isn't

41
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,770
a managed landscape you know is sort of

42
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,810
ridiculous if you're going to have it

43
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:57,269
where there's people it's going to have

44
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,939
to be managed and I spend my entire

45
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:03,658
career working with the people stuck

46
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:06,508
with these things and being asked now to

47
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,629
sequester more carbon or reduce their

48
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,400
emissions or protect water quality when

49
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,019
no one was sort of worried about it in

50
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,349
the past so

51
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,890
in a bit of a pickle having to convince

52
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:22,229
the industry the actual front lines of

53
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:24,899
this mitigating the issues of climate

54
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,009
change when I think when the lion's

55
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,750
share of the people in urban

56
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:30,780
environments think about grasslands this

57
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,060
must be what they think this is the

58
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,340
beautiful Bethpage State Park 1,500

59
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,949
acres nestled in literally the center of

60
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,860
Long Island or I've spent a lot of time

61
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:43,229
researching and studying I consider this

62
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,400
an urban grassland even though I mean of

63
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,039
course you can see the development

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,319
around there but I assure there's houses

65
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:56,449
all over there soccer complex outside of

66
00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:01,909
Boston you know in a typical Saturday

67
00:02:56,449 --> 00:03:04,859
this is an urban grassland ok obviously

68
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:08,250
from the early days of Levittown in the

69
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,620
40s right we now have landscapes that

70
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,979
you know connect each other by these

71
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,900
close cut and vegetative surfaces in

72
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:18,629
front of their dwellings this is

73
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,490
grassland and one of the things that's

74
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:24,120
fascinating when you study it as an

75
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:27,540
academic you know you read so much about

76
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:31,289
the influence that the humans have on

77
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:34,259
the things that we have to do to produce

78
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:36,659
these grasslands and the study of

79
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:40,139
behavior of how people care for their

80
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:43,139
lawns in particular oftentimes and has

81
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:45,929
been shown in several studies to be very

82
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,149
much related to mimicry they call it you

83
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,610
know I think in casual terms recall

84
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,650
keeping up with the Joneses or you know

85
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,320
not having a lawn that looks worse than

86
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,080
somebody else but it's it's our own form

87
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,750
of mimicry we want in general to have

88
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,940
our space to look like everybody else's

89
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,280
how else could you tolerate some of

90
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:09,030
these living conditions so living that

91
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,180
closer to each other so where is the

92
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,590
grass where are the urban grasslands

93
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,379
well you can imagine by their name

94
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,290
they're in the urban areas and you can

95
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:22,100
see all along Long Island the

96
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,110
metropolitan New York area a little bit

97
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,840
that thinks it's part of New York and

98
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,689
then up the Hudson Valley to Albany

99
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,939
Utica Syracuse Buffalo Rochester you can

100
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:33,949
see it very clearly in our state but of

101
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:37,029
course throughout the United States you

102
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:39,979
see where the great grasslands are and

103
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:42,049
because they're urban they're typically

104
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,689
associated with impervious surface right

105
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,699
this is the story from the NASA spectral

106
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:49,399
work that Milesi did many years ago back

107
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:51,199
in 2005 where they looked at the

108
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:53,870
spectral cover and said you know this as

109
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,269
much there's as much turf area as there

110
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:59,000
is irrigated corn that's a bit of a

111
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:01,060
misnomer not all turf is irrigated not

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,500
all the turf you're looking at there is

113
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,170
irrigated as as all the irrigated corn

114
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:10,910
is but the relationship between where

115
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:13,759
grass is and how we manage it right is

116
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,860
ultimately the the challenges that I

117
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,599
face working with the people who manage

118
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,580
these grasslands you cannot separate

119
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,120
yourself from people in my line of work

120
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:28,129
as much as I'd like to and for you know

121
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,649
I love the day I get to work with an

122
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:32,600
apple farm somebody just you know get to

123
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:35,659
drive 30 miles to see one I got to drive

124
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:39,230
30 miles to see another nope

125
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,960
and because the end user is so

126
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:45,470
intimately associated with the surface

127
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:47,089
right I mean when you sell an apple or a

128
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,280
bottle of cider unless you're the farmer

129
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:51,889
you don't get direct feedback from the

130
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,589
people who you are dealing with in my

131
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:57,500
line of work you get more feedback than

132
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:59,599
you'd ever want to get from the public

133
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,170
and so you have to learn how to filter

134
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,390
and we have to learn as and I have to

135
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,890
learn as an extension scientist what are

136
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:10,099
the pressures that the people that I'm

137
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:12,079
working with are under from the people

138
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,360
that they're there and where are they

139
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,879
and how do we set a system that they can

140
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,879
somewhere meet in between between what

141
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,740
the public wants and needs right and the

142
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,420
management of these surfaces has to

143
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,060
adapt to now with the changing climate

144
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,449
so the people put enormous influence on

145
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,259
this lots of great pictures you know and

146
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:33,229
preparation for this I read a whole

147
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:34,909
bunch of work that's gone on throughout

148
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:39,220
the world

149
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:41,689
with things like reduction in crime

150
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,389
associated with you know just keeping

151
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:46,668
the place nice keeping it occasionally

152
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:48,918
clipped doesn't have to be manicured

153
00:06:46,668 --> 00:06:51,409
like center field of Yankee Stadium but

154
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:53,209
if it's well-kept there's plenty of

155
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:56,870
evidence to show that these green

156
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:59,089
landscapes promote good behavior I don't

157
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:03,019
know what else to say it there's this

158
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:05,000
there's this policing idea that we

159
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:07,549
follow an American police work it's

160
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,470
called a broken window approach where

161
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,240
you stop these little crimes and then

162
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,030
supposedly not supposed to stop the big

163
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,160
ones and that sort of mentality in urban

164
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:18,529
areas has penetrated into the landscape

165
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,470
and so they need stuff really literally

166
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:22,879
broken all over the place lots of

167
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,800
important benefits of course easily

168
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,259
defined through the Millennium Project

169
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,319
my colleague my colleague Jenny Gao -

170
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:32,569
and grant Thompson published a wonderful

171
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,219
paper really a very of those papers that

172
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:37,909
will probably get cited for the next

173
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:40,220
3040 years you know integrating basic

174
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,320
ecological concepts and ecosystem

175
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,970
service stuff into the management of

176
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,159
these grasslands I of course stole

177
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,169
liberally from my colleagues like any

178
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,600
good colleague but we'll pay them the

179
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:53,209
proper credit but this mindset is one

180
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,580
that I've been sort of waiting for from

181
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:58,038
my own perspective because I believe the

182
00:07:55,579 --> 00:08:00,800
approach that we have to have in these

183
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:02,750
urban environments is define the value

184
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,139
of these green spaces these green

185
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,300
infrastructures grasses or otherwise for

186
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:11,599
the services they provide because I hate

187
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,418
to say it we don't eat it we are blind

188
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,140
to the plants around us in urban areas

189
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:20,719
plant blindness is a normality people

190
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:22,310
don't see plants and when they do they

191
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,160
only see them when they're very pretty

192
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,288
like perfect lawns or weedy lawns and

193
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,539
then they have put them they imply that

194
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:33,218
mimicry judgment on it and so we get

195
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:35,389
caught up in this one little bit here

196
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:38,210
everything's fussing about this one

197
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:42,708
little bit my entire industry is focused

198
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:45,740
on 80% of the time this one word I'm not

199
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:47,809
kidding you and so what about all these

200
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,889
other things that are important

201
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:54,409
and how this vegetation services of the

202
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:56,688
urban areas and why I'm worried about it

203
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,698
is because when you look at what

204
00:08:56,688 --> 00:09:01,370
happened in California recently as a

205
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:03,409
result of the drought last couple years

206
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,948
they just started paying people to rip

207
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:09,318
grass out they paid over thirty forty

208
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:11,778
million dollars paying people to take

209
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:13,938
their grass out I'll show you what they

210
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:15,889
put in in a minute but you know the

211
00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:19,458
green industry out there was completely

212
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:20,990
ill-prepared golf courses were taking

213
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:23,539
money like crazy they were paying on a

214
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,278
per square foot basis just to take the

215
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:26,808
irrigated grass out up to which I said

216
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,110
well what the hell was it there to begin

217
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:32,028
with why was it there if you could take

218
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,860
it out that easy just for money why was

219
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:37,009
it there to begin with that's part of

220
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,289
the problem that we have now because

221
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:41,688
we're intimately linked to sociological

222
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:43,278
things and human behavior I feel like

223
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:45,919
some time while I'm getting my IRB

224
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,808
certification now finally and we're

225
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,698
gonna start doing more human surveys on

226
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:51,499
these things and so here's a pretty

227
00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:53,990
classic Gallup question they've been

228
00:09:51,499 --> 00:10:00,278
asking since the eighties this is the

229
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:03,470
last 17 years but since the 1980s and

230
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:05,179
when you and well I'm sorry this is not

231
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,620
that this is the one from the 80s ah

232
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:12,138
there's the data sorry

233
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:13,879
I had these a missile which of the

234
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:14,990
following do you agree with protection

235
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,180
of the environment should be given

236
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,938
priority even if curbing of economic

237
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:22,128
growth should be or or at the risk of

238
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:24,289
curbing economic growth or economic

239
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:27,079
growth should be given priority even if

240
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:29,328
the environment suffers so what do you

241
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:31,878
value the environment or your pocketbook

242
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:35,688
and it looked like for a really long

243
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:39,409
time through much of the 80s and 90s and

244
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:41,808
you'll notice this was a period of good

245
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:43,278
economic times when people aren't

246
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,919
worried about the money that goes in

247
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,838
their pocket they tend to value things

248
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,719
like environmental quality it's a pretty

249
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,220
normal behavior and you can see when the

250
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,740
end of that bubble happened and all the

251
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,139
bubbles and blips and booms we've had in

252
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,889
our economy over the last two decades

253
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,519
you can see how over that period of time

254
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:03,230
how

255
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,519
much people saying listen I gotta have

256
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,460
money the environments gonna have to

257
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:12,230
suffer a little bit you wonder how this

258
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:13,610
guy okay and I can take he for making a

259
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,050
joke so I'm happy to do it

260
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,480
we gotta stop taking ourselves so

261
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:22,329
seriously about this okay

262
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,950
so this Danish these are these Dutch

263
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:29,150
scientists Dirksen at all just recently

264
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:32,150
was looking at public acceptance and you

265
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:34,370
know asked citizens in the Netherlands

266
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,470
in in Rotterdam you know where they

267
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,899
value about the vegetation and green

268
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,389
space so certainly what they call green

269
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:44,720
infrastructure of which close vegetated

270
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:47,840
surfaces make up a big part so they

271
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,540
proposed this idea of how the sort of

272
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,899
process you have to follow to get people

273
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:55,909
to understand how to accept essentially

274
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:57,860
ecosystem services for the plants in the

275
00:11:55,909 --> 00:12:00,769
urban environment if we can get the

276
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:04,850
public to demand these things from their

277
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:07,340
municipalities they will get done but as

278
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,980
we continue to just promote aesthetics

279
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,710
the the way we adapt to climate change

280
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,470
will be very difficult to accomplish so

281
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,330
what is the value of these green spaces

282
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,879
there the notion of climate impacts

283
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:22,340
concern about impacts rating green

284
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,200
infrastructure benefits what kind of

285
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,879
green infrastructures do you like and

286
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,090
how much you willing to pay for that

287
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,860
green infrastructure and so the question

288
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:34,040
that came out of that that they're

289
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:37,460
trying to see the services that they

290
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:40,669
value from the paper and they asked them

291
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:44,830
to rate which ecosystem services do you

292
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:47,689
value the most and in the various areas

293
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:53,770
right they were given opportunity so in

294
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:57,200
my line of work right you see them value

295
00:12:53,769 --> 00:13:00,710
stormwater management right go with that

296
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,470
and recreational visually attractive so

297
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,660
at least I got you have to cut the grass

298
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:09,920
to play soccer on it you can't play it

299
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:11,629
in the meadow well that's all well and

300
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,939
good in the Netherlands this is the

301
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:14,899
people I did these are the people I have

302
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,019
to deal with on a

303
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:19,879
pretty regular basis when asked do you

304
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:21,709
believe which you know I don't like

305
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:25,188
using that word makes it turns it into a

306
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:26,838
sort of religious thing change global

307
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:28,818
warming is affecting golf course

308
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:32,209
maintenance and the largest percentage

309
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:36,828
of them say no climate changes croc this

310
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:39,739
is 2060 this is the audience that I'm

311
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:42,258
working with I know what your audiences

312
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,089
are like Steven you know Greg and

313
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:47,869
everybody else is extension audiences

314
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:49,279
this is my extension that's right so one

315
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,019
of the things we try to do and we

316
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,789
started this a year ago I've been very

317
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:55,129
fortunate to have in such an excellent

318
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:57,438
communications professionals boat and

319
00:13:55,129 --> 00:14:00,920
Craig and in my assistant cross command

320
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:03,708
P we started this Twitter page over 1300

321
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:06,678
followers now we get a lot of regular

322
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:08,768
interaction this just-in-time media just

323
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:11,990
focused on getting them information

324
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:14,178
promoting you know the right thing to do

325
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,129
when if they given the right thing to do

326
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:17,899
at the time they need to do it they're

327
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:19,159
more likely to do it so this

328
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,799
just-in-time

329
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:23,778
way of delivering information is perfect

330
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:27,889
for the kinds of things I've got to deal

331
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:31,490
with in my extension so urban grasslands

332
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:33,649
the benefits of them obviously ecosystem

333
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:36,528
services is the way I think we would

334
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:38,720
quantify them but a difficult nut to

335
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:39,649
crack and lots of things working against

336
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,660
us in many ways

337
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:44,629
so let's talk a little bit about urban

338
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:46,338
climate change I don't know that it's

339
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:48,079
entirely different than what's going to

340
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:50,749
happen in other areas except the

341
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:53,620
extremes might be different because of

342
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:57,399
the amount of impervious surfaces right

343
00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:00,230
and you know infrastructure that's there

344
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,208
generally I'm sure you've heard from RT

345
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,370
Gaetano anybody talks about climate

346
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:07,539
change that we're expecting a increase

347
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:11,028
and we have seen more heavy rain events

348
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:12,078
generally we have not overall been that

349
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:15,318
much wetter

350
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,298
year-to-year and of course the season

351
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:21,139
lengths are changing right when the

352
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:23,088
Frost's comes how hard the winter is and

353
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:25,909
I think when you put the word urban in

354
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:28,030
front of climate change it gets people

355
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:30,129
all worked up because

356
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:32,110
when it rains a lot it's not like a farm

357
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,850
field the screen into a ditch

358
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,759
there's a lot of paved surfaces and it's

359
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,980
got to move water great distances and if

360
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,779
it's not designed to do that which many

361
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,039
of the systems are not designed to do

362
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:44,079
that because they were designed before

363
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,360
we had this kind of weather you know

364
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,210
they're old and they need to be rebuilt

365
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,009
so I look at urban as well as you know

366
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,810
the heat island effect and more intense

367
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:54,850
storms many of the things you talked

368
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:57,969
about with climate change in general I

369
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,580
think in urban areas when you look at

370
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,910
the literature on urban climate change

371
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,740
it almost entirely focuses on how

372
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:07,179
there's a lot of people and a lot of

373
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:12,129
infrastructure at risk

374
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:15,429
urban areas put on a disproportional

375
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:17,379
amount of pressure on green space right

376
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:20,679
because they need it for the things that

377
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:23,200
are necessary to survive in an urban

378
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:25,029
environment you have to have plants in

379
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,040
those environments or at least have

380
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:29,740
plants around those environments to

381
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:32,230
service those apply so lots of poor

382
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,940
people of course and you know countries

383
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,310
that are not as fortunate as ours also

384
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:41,140
are going to suffer more greatly I think

385
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:43,239
all right we will obviously we want to

386
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:46,569
make sure the grass is covered so you

387
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,970
know the soil doesn't move longer

388
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:51,250
seasons mean our recreational surfaces

389
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:54,580
get a lot more traffic and this has made

390
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:56,649
synthetic turf very popular and I'm not

391
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,500
even going to open up that can of worms

392
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:02,169
that would be an entire another

393
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,328
presentation about the pits and perils

394
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:07,389
and perceptions of synthetic turf and

395
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:09,879
and where plays a role and and where it

396
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:12,100
can be dangerous and now we have pretty

397
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,819
good data on that but one of the things

398
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:18,730
that allows even poor communities to

399
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:20,529
have good playing surfaces is when they

400
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,599
do a capital project at a school

401
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:25,240
district the state of New York for

402
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:28,029
example will pay 85 cents on every

403
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,460
dollar and the local community only has

404
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:32,349
to come up with 15% so they get a

405
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,910
synthetic turf field for a hundred and

406
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:35,919
fifty thousand dollars while the state

407
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,870
pays the other eight hundred and fifty

408
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,970
thousand now of course we all pay for

409
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:41,619
that but that's one of the reasons

410
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,480
you're starting to see more synthetic

411
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:46,239
turf as well because when these

412
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,539
scholastic seasons happen the grass

413
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,549
isn't growing look how many of us watch

414
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:53,200
them plow snow and play lacrosse on the

415
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:55,289
synthetic turf they do it pretty

416
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,650
regularly through the winter around here

417
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:58,750
all right

418
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,940
urban climate change you know you have a

419
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,130
lot of urban areas here in the Northeast

420
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,590
and this is an example of this past

421
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,320
February the drought like conditions we

422
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:09,789
were entering the growing season with

423
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:12,429
right entering the growing season with

424
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:14,019
big pockets we had some pretty dry

425
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,630
weather a couple of years ago here in

426
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:19,150
the Finger Lakes and made it into the

427
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,190
red status a couple of times into

428
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,380
extreme droughts

429
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,110
I love these NOAA maps I use them all

430
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,570
the time with my industry every time

431
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:30,459
they see me talk and I'm talking about

432
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:32,500
growing something or we're having an

433
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,569
update on something they're gonna get an

434
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,250
updated map of what's going on because I

435
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:38,139
think it's very hard for people to

436
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,970
realize we've been keeping weather

437
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,240
records at least by human standards a

438
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,490
pretty long time 122 years not by you

439
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,839
know other timescales but by our ability

440
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,000
to do it many of these were handwritten

441
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:52,659
of course back then for a very long time

442
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,720
and consistently over the last decade

443
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:59,050
you're looking at record warm

444
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:02,410
temperatures sometimes incredibly dry

445
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:04,569
conditions so I think it's a when I say

446
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,029
confronting climate change

447
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:09,250
I tell people look what's happening

448
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:11,678
don't listen to me here's a data because

449
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,929
people that have trouble getting their

450
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,240
arms around climate change to begin with

451
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:17,890
for whatever you know reason that might

452
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,190
be right

453
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:24,550
eventually the data is compelling unless

454
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:26,860
we fire everybody at NOAA except our we

455
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:28,659
got a key part and of course I'm sure

456
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:31,089
you've seen this from any of the climate

457
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,700
reports that if this continues unabated

458
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:35,529
and we're starting to see it now when

459
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,200
you look at lengths of growing seasons

460
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:41,410
the metropolitan New York area is slowly

461
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,299
creeping into Philadelphia Lane it's

462
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,679
slowly starting to get growing

463
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:46,569
conditions like we're seeing in

464
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,700
Philadelphia when it comes to the

465
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:50,839
grasses in these urban environments in

466
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,309
these urban environments

467
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,959
and of course in these urban

468
00:19:52,309 --> 00:20:00,169
environments with the impervious surface

469
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:02,990
you get the heat island effect and when

470
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,310
it rains to hutch floods for those of

471
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,039
you from downstate the Hudson River

472
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:09,019
Parkway very classic flooding conditions

473
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,710
on a pretty regular basis growing up

474
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:14,599
around there and yet there's green space

475
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,569
and I can tell you you could hit a

476
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:19,009
driver and probably beyond 50 off

477
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:21,919
courses around the Hutchinson River

478
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:23,960
Parkway over a 10 mile strip of the

479
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,580
Hutchinson River Parkway and not a

480
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,700
single one of those golf courses have

481
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:30,679
probably been approached to maybe help

482
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,080
with this problem and easily with some

483
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,980
manipulation of land they're doing this

484
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,689
in Chicago

485
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,799
they're going into the Park District's

486
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,870
and they're saying you know with

487
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,669
flooding like crazy now we built all

488
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:43,039
these houses we paved all this ground

489
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,750
how about we redesign this part of the

490
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,240
golf course make a big hole and put a

491
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,650
sister in it and they've done this on

492
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,230
three or four golf courses now in

493
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:55,340
Chicago someplace is just big collection

494
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:59,930
areas now the problem that that brings

495
00:20:55,339 --> 00:21:05,269
is we let homeowners apply nutrients and

496
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:08,049
chemical pesticides to their laws this

497
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:11,210
is I don't this is this is a big problem

498
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:13,039
because you're talking about a sixty

499
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,140
five billion dollar industry

500
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:20,299
turf industry in the United States about

501
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:22,370
sixty five billion dollars and retail

502
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:25,129
sales of lord.and lawn and garden

503
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:28,609
supplies alone in 2014 almost six

504
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:30,850
billion and you see that the majority of

505
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:34,849
them are fertilizers and pesticides

506
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:37,159
right over 50% fertilizers and

507
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:39,379
pesticides not as much seed as we'd like

508
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,930
of combined so that means there's a lot

509
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,390
of products in the system that can be

510
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:48,789
spilled on those impervious surfaces

511
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:53,360
that can be applied to thin areas that

512
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:55,789
could drain and run if they're thin

513
00:21:53,359 --> 00:22:00,409
right if you if you have good dense

514
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:03,470
vegetation even slow it'll it'll retain

515
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,279
and slow much of the water that will go

516
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,160
across

517
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:09,109
oh and Marnie Petrovic studied this many

518
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,380
years ago Zack Easton was a graduate

519
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:14,869
student here back in the early 2000s and

520
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:18,410
did these landscape-scale sampling

521
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:21,139
studies looking at runoff just water

522
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:24,140
runoff just the materia running off

523
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,980
these surfaces and low maintenance turf

524
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,360
that has very thin conditions one of the

525
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,579
things that's fascinating you see the

526
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:37,729
amount of runoff that actually occurs in

527
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:41,299
the winter and so well not a fully

528
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:44,180
covered ground the wooded areas Martie

529
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:46,460
talked about how the leaves wet leaves

530
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,680
seal up the surface and when the rain

531
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,630
was coming that water would run along

532
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,700
the surface and in this case where he

533
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:55,250
was maintaining with fertilizer and even

534
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,500
pesticides the water volume running off

535
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,720
that turf and it's not surprising right

536
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,779
this shouldn't be surprising grass is

537
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,880
fibrous root system big surface organic

538
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:06,950
matter a perennial crop at the surface

539
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,080
heck menial tell you if you mow it it'll

540
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:14,480
just grow you don't even need to do it

541
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:16,460
it is mow it and leave it alone so so if

542
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,710
it's death you know I would like to just

543
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,750
see some dense low-maintenance turf and

544
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,900
I know he didn't have good density when

545
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:27,559
he did this study now just to reinforce

546
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:33,050
the pesticide use issue this is data

547
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:35,569
from 2012 from the zipcodes surveys that

548
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:38,119
the all certified applicators of

549
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:40,189
pesticides in new york state private and

550
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:44,359
commercial have to report their

551
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:46,640
pesticide use by zip code and so this is

552
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:49,039
one of the only useful pieces of data

553
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,500
that's come out of the last 22 years of

554
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,980
that data collection that occasionally

555
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:58,160
they get around to putting these maps

556
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:01,099
out with pesticide use and of course if

557
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,380
you look at pesticide use you might

558
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:05,750
notice that there's an awful lot of

559
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,690
pesticide use in areas where there's not

560
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:11,329
a lot of farming going on not a lot of

561
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,039
farming going on here and of course you

562
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:14,659
could make the argument that some of

563
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,819
this is agriculture out here but that

564
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,080
sort of looks like Buffalo that sort of

565
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:21,319
look one of these is

566
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:24,278
one of these is missus Syracuse right so

567
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:26,119
so obviously even in courtly big big

568
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:28,398
agricultural region here

569
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:31,609
lots of pesticide use but this is a

570
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:35,178
concern the focus of pesticide use in

571
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:39,079
these urban areas where things can be

572
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:41,538
more mobile USGS surveys aren't expect

573
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:47,089
you to see this it's a just get an idea

574
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:49,158
of this is insecticide use and how it's

575
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:52,579
showing up in the streams that the USGS

576
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:55,549
is survey and you see a lot of it in

577
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:58,158
these urban areas mixed land-use areas

578
00:24:55,548 --> 00:25:03,500
here's all the urban areas right and

579
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:07,159
some of them had the highest 25% right

580
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:11,210
is 25% insecticide concentration in the

581
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:12,528
streams so we got data that says if you

582
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,919
keep the turf in good shape

583
00:25:12,528 --> 00:25:17,869
it might not release the products but

584
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,778
when you put it on in a large scale

585
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:22,729
there's got to be some exponential

586
00:25:20,778 --> 00:25:25,190
effect from little bits here and there

587
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,649
I'm very suspicious that we contribute

588
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,558
to this because obviously rodenticides

589
00:25:27,648 --> 00:25:32,689
and other insecticides this is just

590
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:35,000
insecticides but we use insecticides for

591
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:38,659
you know pets I don't know if that's a

592
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,288
big deal but obviously this is I would

593
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:44,929
think from a lot of landscape use which

594
00:25:42,288 --> 00:25:46,879
drives people crazy people go nuts they

595
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:48,230
show up in meetings you ever been in a

596
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,120
meeting where somebody dresses like that

597
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,889
and your jobs supposed to stand up and

598
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:55,278
talk to them about reasonable pesticide

599
00:25:51,888 --> 00:25:57,439
use so so what I learned is you cannot

600
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,250
talk to these people you have to talk to

601
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,929
these people

602
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:07,609
because they can talk to these people

603
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:10,220
right and so we got to slow down use but

604
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:12,500
we got nuts over here that's you know we

605
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,259
can't reason with and so it just feels

606
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,548
like it pulls the whole debate and I can

607
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:19,129
tell you as a modern extension

608
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:22,839
scientists in an urban area dealing with

609
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:25,278
these issues no one wants to see me

610
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,678
because you know to certain extent I

611
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,720
help them and then aggravate them and I

612
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,830
help these people and then I a great and

613
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,610
I almost feel

614
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:37,230
maybe that's the role in these

615
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:40,019
contentious sociological things that

616
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,880
someone has to sort of mediate it and I

617
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,309
think it's sort of a progressive role

618
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,420
for modern extension anyway what about

619
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:48,299
worse dreams

620
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:50,190
here's some I don't sure everybody's the

621
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:52,200
environmental community's been paying

622
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:57,180
attention to this but this came out in

623
00:26:52,200 --> 00:27:01,289
2014 the province on Ontario of Ontario

624
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:03,210
and Canada banned all pesticide use on

625
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:06,119
homeowners so you cannot go to Home

626
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,920
Depot or any of the places and use you

627
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:10,549
can't buy pesticides for laws and and

628
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:13,590
commercial lawn care people can't apply

629
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:16,500
synthetic pesticides they're using iron

630
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:19,529
they're using Emma toads they're using

631
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:22,980
fungus you know fungi for you know

632
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:24,629
antagonistic biocontrol things much of

633
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,490
what's happened is they've actually the

634
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:28,350
lawn services are selling more cultural

635
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,269
practices they're getting better lawns

636
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:32,309
by seating them to good varieties and

637
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:34,710
fixing the soil and that's what banning

638
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:36,299
chemicals has done the other the other

639
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,559
thing that banning chemicals have done

640
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:39,629
and I don't expect you to see the

641
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:43,500
details of this but these are the three

642
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:47,580
major components of the typical

643
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:50,220
broadleaf herbicide used in turf three

644
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:52,529
active ingredients to 4d everybody's

645
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:56,700
buddy these days died kamba and mecha

646
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:58,559
prop right and the dark bars are these

647
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,289
whisker plots right so Unitas works this

648
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,879
is 50% of the data and then the wider

649
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:05,159
areas and then where they're

650
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,140
significantly different and the dark bar

651
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,779
let's just focus in on the die camba in

652
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,930
this particular stream so they sampled

653
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:15,509
all these streams and you see in almost

654
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:18,480
every case not always statistically

655
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:21,930
significant but most of the time the

656
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,059
back before the band's the concentration

657
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:27,900
of the materials in the stream before

658
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:31,349
the ban and after the ban they are all

659
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,550
dropping now these things move out of

660
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:34,799
the environment a little bit quicker

661
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:36,509
than phosphorous does right you you're

662
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,000
dealing with legacy phosphorous you

663
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:42,029
don't see these we're not seeing these

664
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,028
reductions in phosphorous as a result of

665
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:47,128
fertilizer phosphorous bans in urban

666
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:48,388
we're not seeing that reduction and I

667
00:28:47,128 --> 00:28:49,918
still think it's because we got to sweep

668
00:28:48,388 --> 00:28:52,948
the street every day nobody wants to

669
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,449
hear that and paved surfaces to drain

670
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:54,929
into the drain and then they go into the

671
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:57,719
rivers

672
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:59,849
so just because we're here so we've are

673
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:02,068
confronted this I would say particular

674
00:28:59,848 --> 00:29:04,198
issue of water quality as a result of

675
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:06,868
these intense rains and public concern

676
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:08,639
for pesticide use to develop these best

677
00:29:06,868 --> 00:29:11,578
management practices for golf courses

678
00:29:08,638 --> 00:29:13,348
that serve as codifying the standards

679
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:15,658
golf courses can be held in for water

680
00:29:13,348 --> 00:29:17,908
quality protection and now I've gone

681
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:21,629
completely insane and maybe working with

682
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:24,059
the landscape industry in especially in

683
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:27,178
downstate New York which most of them

684
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:28,979
are of my nationality so it creates

685
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,959
quite an interesting dynamic when you

686
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:33,629
have to tell them to do things that they

687
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:35,609
have absolutely no interest in doing but

688
00:29:33,628 --> 00:29:37,498
they are science-based standards that we

689
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:39,658
hope ensure the highest level of water

690
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:42,088
quality protection and I put this in

691
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:44,249
there you know if you don't maintain a

692
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:46,499
landscape that someone will pay for you

693
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:49,139
can't be in the landscaping business and

694
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:51,659
that business and industry is not going

695
00:29:49,138 --> 00:29:53,668
away they're going to keep existing so

696
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:56,099
we have to figure out how to meet them

697
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:57,119
in this and it's not going to be it's

698
00:29:56,098 --> 00:30:00,749
not gonna be so easy

699
00:29:57,118 --> 00:30:03,688
all right reducing emissions this is

700
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:08,399
funny I put a bunch of students together

701
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:10,949
back in 2007 and then in 2008 we

702
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:13,888
published the study that we did we just

703
00:30:10,949 --> 00:30:16,229
took and interviewed about 15 golf

704
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:18,298
courses throughout New York State and

705
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:20,639
asked them about their fertilizer and

706
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:22,618
chemicals and mowing programs we got

707
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:26,208
averages for what the average golf

708
00:30:22,618 --> 00:30:28,769
course in New York State would emit in

709
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:30,359
carbon emissions now we didn't look at

710
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:31,618
nitrogen emissions that I'll talk to

711
00:30:30,358 --> 00:30:33,328
about talk to you about in a minute

712
00:30:31,618 --> 00:30:35,218
but we didn't look at anything but

713
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:39,688
carbon and the question was can a golf

714
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:41,759
course be carbon neutral so we took our

715
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:43,589
survey information and applied it to

716
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,269
what the GCS a a the Goff

717
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:48,958
superintendent's Association of big

718
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:51,118
association in the Midwest says the

719
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:53,339
average golf course in the United States

720
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:56,128
is so the average golf course about 150

721
00:30:53,338 --> 00:30:58,279
acres you can see very little in the

722
00:30:56,128 --> 00:31:01,339
cutting surfaces and teeing ground

723
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:03,920
most of it is in fairways and rough on a

724
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:06,230
percentage basis right so most of the

725
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,170
chemical and fertilizer treatments are

726
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:11,990
confined to these three areas and around

727
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:14,240
here mostly to the greens in the central

728
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:16,730
New York area in particular so we looked

729
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,370
at direct energy consumption did some

730
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:22,549
calculations based on carbon equivalents

731
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:25,429
for the various energy units we had all

732
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:28,879
these units and not we'd have any

733
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:33,320
coal-fired equipment but we had all the

734
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:36,080
other ones and so we had a way of

735
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:38,589
calculating based on their fuel use and

736
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:41,839
the kind of fuel it was and then we

737
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:44,809
started looking at the way they mode and

738
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,759
this is some work that taught the total

739
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:49,700
company did and we looked at it as well

740
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:52,819
in this case this is a mowing power

741
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:55,130
mower with a GPS device on it and they

742
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:58,579
either collected the clippings off the

743
00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:00,770
fairway or didn't we can talk about how

744
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:03,169
much longer it takes the more fair way

745
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:05,720
to put these pretty stripes in it that's

746
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:08,690
about three times the carbon emission as

747
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,610
simply driving long ways right just

748
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,170
driving long way then a farmer will tell

749
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:14,389
you that because you spend most of your

750
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:19,700
time turning and when you dump the

751
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:23,630
clippings it adds about an hour to the

752
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:25,490
mow time yeah well you know if you're mo

753
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:27,380
fairways you're in no rush to get off

754
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:30,950
that piece of equipment as frequently as

755
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:33,230
yes so you tend to take your time do so

756
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,360
we finished putting robotic mowers we're

757
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,220
going to go crazy with this we've got

758
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:40,189
four of these guys running around mowing

759
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:42,200
day or night the proper amount or too

760
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,600
much and we're going to try to see if we

761
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,910
can build the crude elements of a smart

762
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:49,399
system by integrating irrigation sensors

763
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:53,150
into this because I don't believe people

764
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,130
can be trusted to manage their lives now

765
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,630
if we start plugging everything in then

766
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,280
we've got different issues and we've

767
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,880
talked to the industry nationally about

768
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:01,819
this

769
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,110
where does your power come from all

770
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:05,149
right if everybody starts plugging their

771
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:07,939
cars in and we're burning more coal or

772
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:10,220
burning other fossil fuels I'm not

773
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,200
entirely sure that helps us completely

774
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,880
so we've done a lot of edge

775
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,769
Kayson just hey guys think about where

776
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,389
your power comes from you know if you

777
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:20,990
start plugging in more and more things

778
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:23,839
and you're in Idaho where 93 percent of

779
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:25,579
your power is hydroelectric well maybe

780
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:26,408
that's not a bad thing to plug more

781
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:29,178
things

782
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:31,130
there's also embodied energy in the on

783
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:33,230
the golf course carbon equivalents

784
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:36,110
that's associated with nutrient use of

785
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:38,889
macronutrients in particular and the

786
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:41,388
ranges of materials that we can get from

787
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:44,058
West's work this is not the easiest

788
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:47,629
thing to do and the range you see is is

789
00:33:44,058 --> 00:33:49,609
very dramatic sometimes we have the

790
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:52,460
active ingredients carbon equivalents

791
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:54,709
many times we use the average right

792
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,899
because it's very not all the active

793
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,548
ingredients have been assessed for the

794
00:33:56,898 --> 00:34:02,048
carbon equivalents associated with their

795
00:33:58,548 --> 00:34:05,269
manufacture so we put this rule together

796
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:08,148
we did it against our Bethpage project

797
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:11,179
years ago where we had where we were

798
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:13,809
spraying less pesticides so you'll see

799
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:16,460
in general the numbers are the same

800
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:20,088
except we cut our fertilizer use

801
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:22,668
dramatically in our IPM program now

802
00:34:20,088 --> 00:34:27,078
interestingly the pesticide use went up

803
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:28,969
but a lot of these are softer materials

804
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:30,980
Omri certified materials but they're

805
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:33,828
still our pesticide so it gave us a big

806
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:36,559
number and obviously the biggest

807
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:38,629
reduction we saw was in fertilizer use

808
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,429
in that particular management now not

809
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:43,578
really interested in the different types

810
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:45,918
of management we looked at roughly the

811
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:47,899
equations you'd use for look at the

812
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,289
amount of carbon sequestered on the golf

813
00:34:47,898 --> 00:34:50,148
course

814
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:54,500
an average golf course in a season and

815
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:57,259
then roughly what we would emit from

816
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,880
from carbon not not the nitrogen

817
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:03,200
component and that was the weaknesses

818
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,140
preliminary work anyway so you you saw a

819
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:10,549
slight reduction maybe about four or

820
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:14,598
five tons per tons of carbon equivalents

821
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:16,670
per year a u.s. auto is about 3.6 so you

822
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:19,309
know of course at least at least the way

823
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:21,680
we measured it this first time is not

824
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:23,659
necessarily problematic from a carbon

825
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,578
perspective but I think the total

826
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:26,379
greenhouse gas thing I'm going to show

827
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:28,630
you a different

828
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:32,260
um actual science done on it not a

829
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:34,329
student project but actual science we've

830
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,100
also been studying emerging pests I

831
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:40,289
published a paper with our D Gaetano

832
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:43,569
back in 2006 where we looked at the

833
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:46,480
increasing disease pressure associated

834
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:49,390
with the changing climate so we had a

835
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,150
model that predicts fungal infection of

836
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:54,549
turf and we ground Trude it to

837
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,530
diagnostic labs in the Northeast so that

838
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,360
for a couple of years we were you know

839
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,220
looking at our model and seeing if it

840
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,559
was predicting it where we were testing

841
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:04,119
it and then checking diagnostic labs if

842
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,400
regionally we were on target

843
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:09,460
and we use this in our extension program

844
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,400
in our forecasting and moving towards

845
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:15,159
push notifications for when risks of

846
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,809
disease go up so hoping to get that kind

847
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:18,969
of thing added but it's all predicated

848
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:20,980
on the environmental conditions

849
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:23,199
conducive to the disease so we knew what

850
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:26,440
the conditions were art went back in

851
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,969
scanned the 50 years of data to see if

852
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,070
we're getting any more of and this is

853
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:31,599
what happens when you do no pesticide

854
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,750
work on a golf course where they've been

855
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,389
spraying pesticides for 50 years and

856
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:40,599
what you notice in this slide is all

857
00:36:37,389 --> 00:36:43,359
these black dots are where we reviewed

858
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:46,389
the weather and found that the weather

859
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:48,640
conditions are increasing for the

860
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:51,509
incidence of this disease in the last 50

861
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:54,190
years in fact the model even picked up

862
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:57,100
something we've been observing now for

863
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:59,470
the last decade that we're seeing more

864
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:02,230
of this fungal pathogen pressure in the

865
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:04,119
late fall than we used to see so we are

866
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:07,840
definitely at least with this pest

867
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:10,239
seeing big big changes and that requires

868
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,510
us to spray more at a time when the

869
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:17,139
public is less interested in a spray

870
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:21,010
this is my our most recent venture the

871
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:24,429
Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn probably

872
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:26,050
I hope I hope I can study out there for

873
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:29,589
the rest of my career and into my

874
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:32,140
retirement because some of the things I

875
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:35,260
want to do can really only be done in a

876
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:37,210
commercial setting first you sometimes

877
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,980
the public won't really understand that

878
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,068
if it can't be sort of done in a

879
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,900
commercial way and

880
00:37:40,068 --> 00:37:43,608
and scale down I think they're going to

881
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,959
accept robot mowers we're gonna try

882
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:47,058
robot motors out here

883
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:49,489
but the problem Greenwood Cemetery is

884
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:52,640
having doesn't seem like a big deal but

885
00:37:49,489 --> 00:37:55,400
that's Zoe grass that started to be it

886
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,828
was about three acres by general

887
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,920
estimation about five or six years ago

888
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:03,048
and now it's close to eight acres

889
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,180
covering the cemetery and that has to be

890
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:06,739
directly related especially in the last

891
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:12,379
few years with the very very warm

892
00:38:06,739 --> 00:38:14,568
winters zoycha japonica is a imported

893
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:17,209
Voyager species to this country

894
00:38:14,568 --> 00:38:20,778
naturalized for turf throughout the

895
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:24,588
United States and planted cold hardy

896
00:38:20,778 --> 00:38:26,389
varieties planted north and they are

897
00:38:24,588 --> 00:38:28,248
pretty good when they're green which is

898
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:32,118
two and a half months three months a

899
00:38:28,248 --> 00:38:36,278
year and when you're in a cemetery the

900
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:36,278
most important day of the year is

901
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:44,989
Mother's Day Mother's Day and this grass

902
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,900
is straw brown on Mother's Day and it's

903
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:51,369
growing in population now our question

904
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:54,170
is chemically we can spray it and

905
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:56,778
intercede into it some of the landscapes

906
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:59,358
are tricky to do that in I'm wondering

907
00:38:56,778 --> 00:39:03,498
if we can't have a mixed warm season

908
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:06,558
cool season grass mixture of c3 and c4

909
00:39:03,498 --> 00:39:08,659
plants in your lawn this has happened I

910
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,190
was in st. Louis last week and I visit

911
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:12,170
that area particularly because I'm

912
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,659
interested in the transition zone where

913
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:17,289
you watch climate change in action the

914
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:20,058
line of where Bermuda grass can grow

915
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:22,249
rights i know domme keeps creeping up

916
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:24,229
and creeping up about five to ten miles

917
00:39:22,248 --> 00:39:26,689
a year the guys will tell you yeah that

918
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:28,098
guy used to add Bermuda now he's you

919
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:30,259
know or he used to have Bank grass now

920
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:33,048
he's got Bermuda because it's too warm

921
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:35,298
now can't keep the cool season grass all

922
00:39:33,048 --> 00:39:39,469
right I'll wrap it up sorry for I hope

923
00:39:35,298 --> 00:39:42,079
make it right to the ten mark how do we

924
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:46,190
maximize the benefits and minimize the

925
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:49,009
impacts to me from my perspective if I

926
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:51,528
can get a decent answer to that question

927
00:39:49,009 --> 00:39:53,389
I'll feel like we're closer to

928
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:55,909
sustainability than we were before

929
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:58,308
and let's be fair the amount of inputs

930
00:39:55,909 --> 00:40:02,568
we use for the grasses sometimes is the

931
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:05,719
problem we get the same amount of

932
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:10,880
benefits in many cases without a lot of

933
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:13,190
inputs without a lot of inputs so the

934
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,559
what we need and of course this is the

935
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:17,269
trendy thing right there these resilient

936
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:20,660
landscapes these landscapes that can

937
00:40:17,268 --> 00:40:24,618
take these cold and warm conditions dry

938
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:27,588
and wet conditions this is what they did

939
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:29,749
with the lawns in California and you

940
00:40:27,588 --> 00:40:32,748
know what's funny this was right after

941
00:40:29,748 --> 00:40:34,159
they were planted no water was put in

942
00:40:32,748 --> 00:40:37,669
here how long do you think those plants

943
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:40,639
left what's the over-under maybe three

944
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:42,499
weeks but before they admit they were

945
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,028
actually dead but they didn't pull him

946
00:40:42,498 --> 00:40:46,909
out probably for six months and

947
00:40:44,028 --> 00:40:49,369
companies ran around California taking

948
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:55,190
money doing this and then now they live

949
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:57,769
in the Caymans so how do you affect this

950
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:59,420
kind of change and so the first thing

951
00:40:57,768 --> 00:41:01,399
you do is you get to the architects

952
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,130
because many of them design the

953
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,680
landscape is late landscape said look on

954
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:09,199
our paper other things look good on

955
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:11,778
paper and then managing them and the

956
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,369
benefits that they provide so a number

957
00:41:11,778 --> 00:41:14,659
of years ago I had another group of

958
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:16,660
students and I don't know if this has

959
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:19,088
ever actually become part of the sites

960
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:21,078
initiative but the sites initiative

961
00:41:19,088 --> 00:41:23,389
sustainable sites initiative I'm sure

962
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:27,140
you've heard Nena maybe Don other people

963
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:30,379
talk about this collection of standards

964
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:33,440
it's basically the lead system that the

965
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:36,108
US Green Building Council uses that idea

966
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,929
for landscapes how we build landscapes

967
00:41:36,108 --> 00:41:44,139
that are sustainable and the first go at

968
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:47,659
this they said no grass for you Frank

969
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:49,699
well if you had grass in your landscape

970
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:52,368
you could not be viewed as a sustainable

971
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:54,019
site all right I think hopefully they

972
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:56,719
changed it a little bit and here's what

973
00:41:54,018 --> 00:41:59,088
we proposed first of all we want to get

974
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:01,249
old grasslands to require minimum energy

975
00:41:59,088 --> 00:42:04,278
water and chemical inputs for their

976
00:42:01,248 --> 00:42:06,759
intended use while supporting outdoor

977
00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:09,789
exercise so design

978
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,920
points activity point design activity

979
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:15,789
points they support no community

980
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,920
activity that just for look passive

981
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:20,139
recreation picnicking walking okay a

982
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,570
little bit of traffic and then supports

983
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:24,009
athletic activities this is the kind of

984
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:25,990
thing we've got to get people to

985
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,220
understand and of course you see this in

986
00:42:25,989 --> 00:42:29,769
action when you go to a place like

987
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:32,500
Central Park where they've prioritized

988
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:34,809
the lawns they've got intensely traffic

989
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,179
soccer fields and the sheep's meadow and

990
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:38,799
then another area where it's fenced off

991
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,809
and no one goes in and other areas where

992
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,620
the dogs go and there's very little

993
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:47,769
grass the other part is the ecology how

994
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:50,549
do we put this together what we're using

995
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:53,259
it for with the benefits it provides

996
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:55,780
right sites designed for require

997
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:58,450
maintenance for any low usage area you

998
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:00,100
get if you have to high maintain just

999
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:02,199
for aesthetic purpose is an area that

1000
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:05,019
doesn't get used much you get no points

1001
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:07,359
for that to for moderate maintenance

1002
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:09,429
right and we put some other things in

1003
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:12,460
here and it comes up with an equation

1004
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:14,649
now this may seem goofy to you but this

1005
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:17,320
is the world people who build things

1006
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:19,570
live it and if we can get them thinking

1007
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,309
like this at the front and the

1008
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:24,720
management of these landscapes are

1009
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:27,279
inherently more focused and sustainable

1010
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,139
when they've started to study this is

1011
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,450
happening more and more now they've

1012
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:36,400
studied how do how can I urban grassland

1013
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:40,269
reduce a mission and increase carbon

1014
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,010
sequestration so Erin Patton at Purdue

1015
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:44,739
University had a graduate student that

1016
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:48,100
looked at this and this isn't that study

1017
00:43:44,739 --> 00:43:50,319
this is a study of sort of how you have

1018
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:51,940
to fertilize Kentucky bluegrass to keep

1019
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,490
the weeds out but that's aesthetics

1020
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:56,590
right except that this is awful thin and

1021
00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:59,139
maybe the runoff will be bad but if you

1022
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:02,140
seeded it and maybe more grass would

1023
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:05,460
emerge so if you want the lowest

1024
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:07,900
emissions that managing turf can give um

1025
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:10,659
there's a you can plant Kentucky

1026
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:14,559
bluegrass never to foliated more than

1027
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:16,809
30% and return the clippings all right

1028
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,480
let's get back now if you want the

1029
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:20,590
greatest carbon accumulation you plant

1030
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,079
tall fescue

1031
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:26,079
rapidly growing rapidly organic matter

1032
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:27,579
producing species the foliated 30

1033
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,670
percent of the times returned the

1034
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:32,590
clipping so it's right now these are the

1035
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:35,349
pieces of data we've got we've got a

1036
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:37,600
long way to go in terms our approach

1037
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:39,099
with the homeowner is the lawn care

1038
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:46,210
stuff I wonder if I'm gonna skip right

1039
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:48,130
to it so sorry for the delay sorry to

1040
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:50,050
keep you so don't feel like if you gotta

1041
00:44:48,130 --> 00:45:02,230
go you can't go I'm happy to stay and

1042
00:44:50,050 --> 00:45:10,600
answer questions like you're saying that

1043
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:21,400
I guess I'm wondering what your fingers

1044
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:25,480
for the barriers to homeowners these

1045
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:27,789
issues so so it seems to me the question

1046
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,619
is how do we get homeowners to look at

1047
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:44,529
their lawn beyond just what it looks

1048
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:46,480
like it's right I mean what I would tell

1049
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:49,510
you is just make sure it's densely

1050
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:53,019
vegetated right now that's the best data

1051
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:55,000
we've got that even if you have what you

1052
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:57,159
don't want is a lot of annual weeds that

1053
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,230
come and go but if you can maintain a

1054
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:02,230
perennial vegetation that's a collection

1055
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:06,039
of we broad leaves and grassy plants and

1056
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:08,920
they're dense we're good the problem is

1057
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:10,719
there's you know this is a big cultural

1058
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,670
thing and I can I could write a whole

1059
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:14,919
paper on just the cultural things about

1060
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:16,329
this but you know the parents did it

1061
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,480
it's one of those things that we still

1062
00:46:16,329 --> 00:46:21,909
can't let go from Leave It to Beaver and

1063
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,099
I also think that you know Scott's plows

1064
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:28,329
a lot of money Scott's alone is a three

1065
00:46:24,099 --> 00:46:30,699
billion dollar company so so it's a like

1066
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:33,309
many things in a capitalist society we

1067
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:34,449
have industry an industry sometimes

1068
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:36,849
drives

1069
00:46:34,449 --> 00:46:38,909
option just like you know pictures in

1070
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:42,039
magazines drive the cosmetic industry

1071
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:44,769
you see you see a pretty baseball field

1072
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:48,070
or a beautiful golf course I want that

1073
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:50,619
now I can tell you that's a shrinking

1074
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:53,619
proportion of the population it looks

1075
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:56,320
like the next generation could give to

1076
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:57,608
whatever for their lawn just because

1077
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,320
they got so much they don't have a lot

1078
00:46:57,608 --> 00:47:01,179
of time to take care of it that's the

1079
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:04,030
big thing time becomes a bigger

1080
00:47:01,179 --> 00:47:06,338
commodity that that how do we break

1081
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:08,320
through it's a tough thing because we're

1082
00:47:06,338 --> 00:47:11,519
not well funded with a marketing program

1083
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:16,150
you know our our lawn website gets about

1084
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:19,119
1400 hits a day in April and May 1400

1085
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:21,250
and that's nothing compared to what guys

1086
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:28,930
who make goofy videos on YouTube about

1087
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:35,889
lawns yes Mike the insects the insect

1088
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:37,719
yeah in terms of like so yeah so right

1089
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:39,809
so the question about ticks in these

1090
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:43,000
landscapes you know we don't know Mike

1091
00:47:39,809 --> 00:47:45,429
there was some suggestions that and it's

1092
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:51,338
and generally we see it but not as a

1093
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:55,210
rule that mowed lawns where deer don't

1094
00:47:51,338 --> 00:47:58,199
frequent and lay and you know because

1095
00:47:55,210 --> 00:48:01,210
it's a fairly dry environment out there

1096
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:04,088
generally aren't big havens but ecotones

1097
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:06,099
the edges are enormous because they're

1098
00:48:04,088 --> 00:48:08,858
all sitting there like it's a it's the

1099
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:10,690
gladiators right that they breathe they

1100
00:48:08,858 --> 00:48:13,059
see all the carbon dioxide out there

1101
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:14,079
with the people right but then are going

1102
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:16,539
out there because it's something

1103
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,420
inhospitable to them unless they get on

1104
00:48:16,539 --> 00:48:21,639
a deer they get on a deer then they're

1105
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,170
in your lawn it's a little bit trickier

1106
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:25,239
to get on you unless you're a little

1107
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:27,639
person and you're going your bare feet

1108
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:29,769
in your onesie now you're a little bit

1109
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:34,750
more even on a lawn a little bit more at

1110
00:48:29,769 --> 00:48:37,329
risk but no definitive population we

1111
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:39,579
don't have enough ecological data to say

1112
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:42,280
yet what's going on but we know for sure

1113
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:45,190
they're at the wood lines around the

1114
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:48,660
lawns in enormous lehigh populations as

1115
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,659
we'd expect after a master

1116
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:26,179
[Music]

1117
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:37,269
of course right that's what all the

1118
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:37,269
studies yeah of course of course right

1119
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:40,679
[Music]

1120
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:48,289
that's good advice

1121
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:52,869
I think this is basically saying it has

1122
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:52,869
no there's no community

1123
00:49:54,789 --> 00:50:02,239
your point is well think we should give

1124
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:06,380
that place for sure yes yeah we made it

1125
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:12,799
this isn't for real no no they won't let

1126
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:14,809
us we proposed this to them and we put

1127
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:23,620
it in the format to send it to them but

1128
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:26,659
I still don't does but not this stuff

1129
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:28,819
yeah no but did they take the points

1130
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:36,920
approach which we propose they did okay

1131
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:38,390
good so maybe we should look to see so

1132
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,559
if they giving it a zero we should

1133
00:50:38,389 --> 00:50:47,599
probably go back and fix it okay thank

1134
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:50,869
