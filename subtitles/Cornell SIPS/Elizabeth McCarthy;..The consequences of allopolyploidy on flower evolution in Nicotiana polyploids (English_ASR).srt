1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,480
University all right well thank you so

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,000
much Jeff for the introduction I'm

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,200
really excited to be here with y'all

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
today um like Jeff said I'm Elizabeth

6
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:19,839
McCarthy my pronouns are she or hers and

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,920
yeah my um love affair with niiko Shana

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,839
Valentine's Day we're going to talk

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,640
about love of plants um started when I

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,839
was undergrad and I never want to leave

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,880
it um I took a little bit of a hatus

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,880
occasionally but not very much um so so

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,119
I'm excited to talk to you about how

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,239
poly and hybridization affect um flower

15
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,159
evolution in these awesome species there

16
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:41,799
all right so I'm going to start with an

17
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,799
introduction and then I'm going to tell

18
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:46,038
you two stories about flower color

19
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,839
evolution in polyploids one on a young

20
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,558
polyploid that's involving homeologue

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,199
bias and subgene abdomin and one on some

22
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,358
older polyploids that involves some

23
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,000
transgressive delin and production and

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,600
then I'm going to finish up with some of

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,079
the things that we're doing in the lab

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,160
right now so you can see what my awesome

27
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,239
undergrads soon Portland are

28
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,599
doing um so alop poly involves two

29
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,840
things both whole genome duplication um

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,319
and interspecific hybridization so as we

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,478
can see up here we have two different

32
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,758
diploid species here are um their sets

33
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:19,359
of chromosomes different colors um and

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,560
they come together um to create hybrids

35
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,359
that have um four sets of chromosomes

36
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,640
but two different diverg genomes back in

37
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,438
the same nucleus um and this leads to

38
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,320
this genomic shock where they have to

39
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,639
figure out how to work with each other

40
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:32,319
um and this leads leads to all sorts of

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,079
different changes but can also lead to

42
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,879
changes in phenotype like we can see um

43
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:39,319
in these poly plates here and so I'm

44
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,759
interested in how these phenomena lead

45
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:45,199
to differences um in flower

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,399
phenotypes poly is everywhere especially

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,320
in land plants um so we have ancient

48
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,759
poly at least in all seed plants another

49
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,319
in all flowering plants and when we have

50
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,280
so many genomes access that we have now

51
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,919
we can see that all of these red um

52
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,960
lineages are holding genome duplications

53
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,799
across land plants so we have ancient

54
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,879
poly

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,800
everywhere on the flower side of things

56
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,919
we know that morphology and color is

57
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,520
going to affect the type of pollinators

58
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,559
um that interact with these flowers so

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,040
here are just a subset of pollinators

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,439
and you can see that the flowers that

61
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,159
they're visiting have different colors

62
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,479
different shapes they open at different

63
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,439
times if we could smell them they would

64
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,479
smell different um so we have this

65
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,959
really exciting system where we can look

66
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,280
at differences not only in the plants

67
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,039
but see how they're interacting um with

68
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,080
animal

69
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,439
pollinators and we're going to see this

70
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,920
pathway a lot don't worry it's coming

71
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,840
back um and this is the flavonoid

72
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,598
biosynthetic pathway which is a branch

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,719
pathway with many enzymes working

74
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,598
together so the enzymes are in bolded by

75
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,199
the arrows and they produce all of these

76
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,000
different types of pigments that lead to

77
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,439
flower colors so on the bottom down here

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,239
we have our anthocyanins those are

79
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:59,239
colorful we have red ponin Pinker

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,560
magenta cyanidin and purple dadin and

81
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,920
then up here we have flavanol these are

82
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,840
colorless to humans but they absorb UV

83
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,878
so differences in flavanol can give

84
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,920
differences in signals to pollinators

85
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,359
that have UV receptors so all of them

86
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,280
are important for um the formations of

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
flower colors and how they interact with

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,199
pollinators and we also have some

89
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,799
understanding of some transcription

90
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,518
factors that are promoting um expression

91
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,760
of some of these flavonoid biosynthetic

92
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,158
pathway

93
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:29,039
genes so my overarching research

94
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:31,079
questions in my research program are

95
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,120
again how does this genome merger that

96
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,640
we get with hybridization yield the

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,959
novel and diverse phenotypes that we

98
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,199
observe in alop popoids and then how do

99
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,598
those phenotypes affect the evolution of

100
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,119
alop pooid

101
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:46,479
species um and nikana is a fantastic

102
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,599
system to study this in because we not

103
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,759
only have an amazing diversity of

104
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:54,560
flowers size shape color um but we also

105
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,598
have a ton of poly plates and they're

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,079
all different ages so we have some that

107
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,759
are young that have not undergone

108
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,640
speciation that are all less than a

109
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:04,919
million years old we have another

110
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,119
section that's about one or one and a

111
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,199
half million years old that has

112
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,719
speciated into a few species another

113
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,919
that is four million years old that is

114
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,799
speciated into a few more I ran out of

115
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,798
space on this slide there's yet another

116
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,439
one that is six million years old that

117
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,478
we think has maybe speciated into

118
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,959
potentially 90 different species what um

119
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,159
so there's a whole lot of stuff going on

120
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,198
here we have this really nice trajectory

121
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,320
of different age polypoid so we can ask

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,639
questions about the differences between

123
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,839
what's happening short-term and

124
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,000
long-term consequences of alop poly

125
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,239
boids as they

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,959
evolve today the stories I'm going to

127
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,918
tell you are involving Nico tobacum this

128
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,000
young polyploid and suction rande this

129
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,478
older one so we're going to get a flavor

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,560
of a couple of these

131
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,959
things all right so that first um story

132
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,120
I'm going to tell you about is about

133
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:55,079
niiko tobacum and home bias and subgene

134
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,478
OBD dominance and how it affects flower

135
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:01,758
color so Nicos tobacum is the product of

136
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:04,800
um nios sylvestris maternal progenitor

137
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,479
and Nikos tomoris paternal progenitor we

138
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,400
have these natural polyads like I showed

139
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,279
you already that are point6 million

140
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,918
years old and we have some different

141
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,559
exceptions that have some variation in

142
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,560
flower color we have these really bright

143
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,839
magenta ones and some light pink ones

144
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,360
but we also have synthetic polyploids

145
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:23,799
that we have create not me I use them

146
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,800
other folks have created in the lab um

147
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,960
where we have first generation polypoid

148
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,720
so we can get an idea of what's

149
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,560
Happening immediately following polypoid

150
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,000
to then compare that to what's happening

151
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,160
over evolution in our natural ones and

152
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,319
we again even in our synthetic lines see

153
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,120
some variation in flower color so we

154
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,960
have light pink ones and we have darker

155
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,360
pink ones so we have a great system that

156
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:47,079
we can

157
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,600
compare again flab by synthetic pathway

158
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:51,719
um the differences we see in these pinks

159
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,160
is mainly due to differences in cyanidin

160
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,120
pigments so that's the focus we're going

161
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,880
to think about um for this story at

162
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,519
least and we're also going to think

163
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,319
about homog expression bias so when we

164
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,159
have have Alo poly plates we have

165
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,160
homeologs two different progenitor

166
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,199
copies inside um our um genome and so

167
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,080
for example dfr which is one of our

168
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,639
genes in our pathway will have a

169
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:18,439
maternal copy and a paternal copy here

170
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:21,240
in purple and um teal and um we can have

171
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:22,839
either equal homeologue expression where

172
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,960
there's equal expression from both of

173
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:27,638
these um copies or we could have unequal

174
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,159
expression and then we call that homog

175
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,918
expression bias so for example Le down

176
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,479
here we have more copies um or more

177
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,318
transcript of our paternal copy than our

178
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,800
maternal copy so that would be an

179
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,240
expression bias towards the paternal

180
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,000
over the maternal and in the talk I'm

181
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,879
going to be reporting that homog

182
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,199
expression bias as the percent of our

183
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:54,399
maternal homologue um that is present so

184
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:56,919
the proportion of sylvestris um in these

185
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,878
popoids that's at the gene level so

186
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:01,038
we're thinking about how are the um

187
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,120
what's the ratio of our two progenitor

188
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,399
copies if we build that up to the whole

189
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,840
transcripton level we can see whether we

190
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:11,038
have um a a skew in the bias do we have

191
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,318
more um sylvestris bias genes than

192
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,399
tomoris bias genes or do we have an

193
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,479
equal number of each so if we do have a

194
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:21,318
bias we call that sub genome dominance

195
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:25,159
where one um progenitor genome has more

196
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:27,360
um expression overall um than the

197
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,360
other okay so my questions for this

198
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,080
story are what's the genetic base is of

199
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,479
the pigment and flower color differences

200
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:39,240
that we observe in these tobacco Alo

201
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:42,240
poly plates and do those correlate with

202
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,960
homeologue bias differences um in the

203
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,720
polyplay so do we see that these flower

204
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,478
color differences are associated with

205
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,280
homog bias

206
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:52,199
differences so to answer this question

207
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,679
um this is part of my postto work um

208
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,520
with Amy lit at UC rever side um we did

209
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,038
a developmental series for all of our

210
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:02,038
different um accessions so we have um we

211
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:05,439
corrected collected Corolla tissue from

212
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:07,959
early buds mid Buds and late floral buds

213
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,918
um across all of our different um our

214
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:12,918
progenitors our natural poly ples and

215
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:16,758
our synthetic polyes um and this work

216
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:19,598
was um um done by um two undergrads

217
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,759
amber Lorn and amilda cty um at UC

218
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,319
Riverside with

219
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,800
me um we did a transcriptive analysis

220
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,439
from these accessions um with an

221
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,319
illuminum platform and a 1x 85 reads um

222
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,240
we used a jovo approach to um to analyze

223
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,120
that data but we found that these short

224
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,080
reads made it really difficult to

225
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,759
distinguish between our two progenitor

226
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,080
copies and so when I got here um y'all

227
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,919
might recognize him Jacob Landis you'll

228
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,160
see his face a couple times um so in

229
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,639
collaboration with Jacob um we added

230
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,159
some long raid Oxford nanapur sequencing

231
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,958
to our progenitors to be able to

232
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:57,480
increase the quality of our assemblies

233
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,199
we create um made those Diplo assemblies

234
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,000
put them together in silico to create

235
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,040
our Alo poly assembly and with that long

236
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,720
read data we were able to distinguish

237
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:11,799
between our two copies so doing

238
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,399
great so um we are looking at our

239
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,359
different biosynthetic pathway genes I

240
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,120
told you you were going to see this

241
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,680
pathway a lot um I've colorcoded it so

242
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,759
we can have an idea of where the

243
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:23,399
different genes are so the colors in the

244
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,838
pathway are related to the colors in our

245
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,320
points um the points on these graphs are

246
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,560
flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes the

247
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,480
violin plots behind them are the

248
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,639
transcription overall so in this graph

249
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,680
we're looking at differentially

250
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:39,039
expressed genes so on our x-axis we have

251
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:41,439
our different pairwise comparisons so

252
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,679
between our progenitors between our um

253
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,480
polyploids and our two different

254
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:47,199
progenitors and among our different

255
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,759
polyploids and then on our y- AIS we

256
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,120
have our log toold change of our

257
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,519
differentially expressed genes another

258
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,519
thing to notice is that our bold color

259
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:00,440
points are our tomoris Hogs and our um

260
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,399
transparent points are sylvestris looks

261
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,240
um so if we look and this is in our

262
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,679
early development so our early Bud

263
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,839
seeing what's going on there if we look

264
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,679
at our comparison between our

265
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,800
progenitors we see that most of our

266
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:14,319
genes are differentially expressed just

267
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:17,359
what we want to see um so our Sylvester

268
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,120
homeologs are upregulated in sylvestris

269
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,720
our tomoris Hogs are upregulated in

270
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,600
tomoris when we compare our tobacum or

271
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,800
polyploids to our maternal progenitor

272
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,240
unsurprisingly we see that our Eternal

273
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,359
Hogs are upregulated in the poly boids

274
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,720
compared to the maternal progenitor um

275
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,039
but we also see that we have some um

276
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,720
maternal Hogs that are upregulated in

277
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:45,519
the poly plates um compared to their um

278
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,800
progenitor similarly to our when we

279
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,399
compare to our paternal progenitor we

280
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,639
again see that the maternal copies are

281
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,440
upregulated in our polyploids but in

282
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,919
this case when we think about the

283
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,440
paternal hoges they're tend to be more

284
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:01,240
highly um expressed in the progenitor

285
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,200
compared to the polypoid and then when

286
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,759
we compare among our different types of

287
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,000
polyes um we are starting to really

288
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,159
tease out differences um that might be

289
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,039
involved in the differences in flower

290
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,958
color we see when we look at comparisons

291
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,599
between light pink and magenta flowers

292
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:20,119
we're starting to see genes that are

293
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,720
involved in producing anthocyanins um we

294
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,839
have the um black pig um points here our

295
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,320
FS Gene which gives us towards flavanols

296
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,320
and we see differences among our um

297
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,800
sessions here so we're starting to get

298
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,200
some of these pieces that might be

299
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,919
important in creating these differences

300
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,959
in flower

301
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:40,639
phenotype and so we looked at that a

302
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,799
little further we took these different

303
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,959
comparisons where we had light pink and

304
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,679
dark pink polyploids compared to each

305
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,518
other and we saw um whether there were

306
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,399
any commonly differentially expressed

307
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:56,480
genes to those comparisons um and so we

308
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:59,039
found a few um at least two comparisons

309
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,839
had an upregulation of dfr which is

310
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,958
again again this one that is the first

311
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,880
Gene towards making at the cyanin that

312
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:08,518
was upregulated in the dark pink um

313
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,958
phenotype whereas fls which is towards

314
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,959
making flavanols um is upregulated in

315
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,838
our light pink things and then we had a

316
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,039
handful of other genes that were single

317
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,320
tens but again they seem to be

318
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,639
concentrated in the genes they're um

319
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,079
producing um at the cyanin and they're

320
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,278
upregulated in our dark pink things um

321
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:31,159
or flavo were at the beginning of our

322
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:31,159
pathway for um our light pink um

323
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,879
types so let me took a step back and

324
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,240
we're asking this question about do

325
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,879
changes in homog bias in these genes

326
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,159
correlate with the differences in flower

327
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:44,278
color that we observe and so for these

328
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,799
plots um on our x-axis we have our

329
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:49,480
developmental time points so these are

330
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:51,198
our early mid and late um tissues and

331
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,240
then we're looking at our percent

332
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:57,679
sylvestris so that's our home bias so if

333
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,759
it's 0.5 that's equal if it's above 0.5

334
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:04,198
that's Sylvester's bias if it's below

335
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:06,919
0.5 that's tomoris biest um and our

336
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:10,078
sylvesters and toosi foris um are

337
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:12,559
behaving excellent we like to see that

338
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,638
um but in this case in LS we see that we

339
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,599
have pretty equal expression between our

340
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,799
two progenitors and that seems to be the

341
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,560
case for all of the accessions that we

342
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,479
looked

343
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:26,119
at um we did see some differences in

344
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,600
homeologue um expression bias but they

345
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,198
did not correlate with phenotype like we

346
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,159
hypothesized Iz they instead correlated

347
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:37,399
with the polyploid age so our synthetic

348
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:40,399
polyploids which are here in these um

349
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:42,240
pink and purple points um tended to be

350
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,839
more equally expressed whereas our

351
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,799
natural poly ples here in cyan and

352
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,880
orange are further away from that equal

353
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:52,559
expression so those are more biased um

354
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:54,759
and we saw that both in um Chi at the

355
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,758
beginning of the pathway and in dfr

356
00:13:54,759 --> 00:14:00,079
towards making

357
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,959
epins um and we we found this overall we

358
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,758
found that natural polyploids tended to

359
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:07,359
display a stronger homog bias more

360
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,480
different than equal um both on our

361
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,919
flavonoid biosynthe pathway genes that

362
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,000
we can see here so we have an um

363
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,479
increased distance from equal in our

364
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,679
natural polyploids compared to our

365
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,959
synthetics and that also held across the

366
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,239
entire transcript so we're seeing we

367
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:25,559
have stronger bias in our natural poly

368
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,240
blades compared to our synthetic

369
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:30,679
polys so then we can ask this question

370
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,120
we looked at in individual genes what

371
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:35,479
about overall do we see sub genome

372
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,039
dominance where we have more sylvest

373
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,000
bias or more Tomos formis bias genes

374
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:45,159
than the other um and in this plot we

375
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,639
have our progenitor ratio on the x-axis

376
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:49,679
and our polypoid home ratio on our y-

377
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,600
axis then we have a lot of points in

378
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:55,638
here so I also put these um histogram

379
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,480
curves along the sides to give us an

380
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,560
idea of the distribution of those points

381
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,440
and

382
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,719
we can see that our progenitor

383
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,839
ratios and most of the ratios of our

384
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,600
polypoides are pretty balanced um we

385
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:12,079
have a relatively symmetrical curve here

386
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,040
um but we see this pink one we have this

387
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,319
line that is a little bit higher on one

388
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,120
side than the other so qm24 seems to

389
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,320
have a little bit of a bias towards

390
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,399
sylvestris um biased Hogs over

391
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,639
tomoris and if we look at their floral

392
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:31,559
phenotypes here's qm24 here's are the

393
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,120
two parents you can see that um q24

394
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,359
shares some things with sylvestris um

395
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,240
that maybe a little bit further away

396
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,519
from tomoris it has a pillar color it

397
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,318
has a smaller tube opening um it's more

398
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:48,399
star-shaped and so maybe um that is

399
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:51,159
reflected in the morphology that we

400
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,000
observe okay so to really answer that

401
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:56,159
question of whether we have sub genome

402
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,519
dominance what I did is I partitioned um

403
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02,519
or grouped these genes into either

404
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:06,000
a sylvestris bias group or a tomoris

405
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:09,120
bias group um and then did a kisare test

406
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,039
to see whether we had um a a skew in

407
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,639
where um those genes fell but we did

408
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:17,599
this in several different thresholds so

409
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,839
first naively I think um I just split it

410
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,278
down the middle and if it was bigger

411
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,959
than 50% I put it in Sylvester's bias if

412
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:27,600
it was smaller than 50% I put it in to

413
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:30,879
toop foris bias but that gives us no um

414
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,519
no equal um expression and so we created

415
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:37,120
this buffer zone where we have equal

416
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,440
expression so we have a threshold where

417
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,799
it was considered Sylvester's bias if it

418
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:46,399
was 55% or above and tomoris biased if

419
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:49,278
it was 45% or below and then also

420
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,639
another threshold where it was 60%

421
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,679
versus 40 less than 40% everybody

422
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:57,480
feeling good about that can you tell

423
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:59,439
that I'm an undergrad person yes awesome

424
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,839
and then we took the

425
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,560
um the the numbers that are falling in

426
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,279
those categories to do the CH test to

427
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:09,119
see if we actually had sub genome

428
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:11,918
dominance um and what we found so here

429
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,318
on our x axis we have our progenitors we

430
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,280
have our different polyploids and then

431
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:21,078
on our y AIS we have bias so um our um

432
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:23,038
dotted line in the middle is no bias and

433
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:25,119
um above the line is atonement to sorus

434
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,599
bias and below the line is a sastrous

435
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,639
bias so what we see is we have a slight

436
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:34,119
bias across the Gen toward tomoris in

437
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,799
our progenitor ratio um a slight bias

438
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:41,479
toward sylvestris in qm24 like we saw in

439
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:44,839
our other plot but no bias in qm25 or

440
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,880
our natural poly blades so a little bit

441
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:48,079
of sub genome dominance here but not a

442
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,440
whole

443
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:53,359
lot okay but that's the whole genome

444
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,519
let's look at our at our flavo

445
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,519
biosynthetic pathway genes so we've seen

446
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:01,200
this um type of graph before we have our

447
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:04,200
pren ratio on the x-axis our polyploid

448
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,840
homog ratio on our y AIS um the gray

449
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,240
points are across the genome or trans

450
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,439
cryptum excuse me like we saw before but

451
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,359
now we're highlighting where our flavo

452
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,759
biosynthetic pathway genes are falling

453
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:19,240
out again they're colorcoded based on

454
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:21,079
our pathway um and what we can see is

455
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,960
that especially in our progenitor ratio

456
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:26,639
we have um a huge bias towards

457
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,240
tomoris we also have one in our poly

458
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,000
blades but it seems to be a little bit

459
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,319
less

460
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,400
but let's look at that in a slightly

461
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:36,439
easier way um we can see that our bias

462
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,559
has shifted a lot here right so we have

463
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,880
a huge bias towards Tomos foris in our

464
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:44,960
progenitors in our floid biosynthetic

465
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,440
pathway genes um but that is still

466
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,279
present but greatly reduced in our

467
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,279
polyads so we still see the stos foris

468
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:56,399
bias but it is way less present um

469
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:58,879
mostly our our synthetic poly voids are

470
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,960
unbiased um but we do see that

471
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,559
sylvestris um the whole genome um of

472
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,519
sylvestris is playing a role in

473
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,639
determining the flower color um of these

474
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,079
polyploids since we have that reduction

475
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,759
in the bias so even though sylvest does

476
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,639
not make pink colors it is involved in

477
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,240
making pink that its genome is involved

478
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,559
in making pink colors and

479
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,000
polyploids um so both of these genomes

480
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:26,079
are working together um to create our

481
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,079
differences that we see in

482
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,240
polys okay

483
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,319
again with these plots so a new thing

484
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,720
that we can think about um where Things

485
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:39,038
fall in these plots gives us an idea of

486
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,400
their regulation so if things fall out

487
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,119
in this horizontal line then they are

488
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,000
likely trans regulated because they're

489
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,399
in the same environment and so they're

490
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,919
going to have equal expression our

491
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,280
diagonal line represents our cyst

492
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,880
regulatory differences because those

493
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:57,000
cyst regulatory differences should track

494
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,640
with what we see in the progenitors to

495
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,679
what we see in the polyes giving us that

496
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,240
diagonal line and then anywhere else in

497
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,360
the plot is likely some sort of cyr

498
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,000
interaction um and what we can see from

499
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,759
this again we have our flavonoid

500
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,159
biosynthetic pathway genes pulled out

501
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,759
here here they're colorcoded by Gene

502
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:18,120
here they're colorcoded by our excession

503
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,279
so again our pink and our purple are our

504
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,599
synthetic ones and our cyan and our

505
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:25,240
orange are the natural ones um and what

506
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:28,959
we see is that often when we see

507
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:32,159
differences the um the synthetic poly

508
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,440
seem to have more equal expression and

509
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,880
then our natural polyploids have more

510
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,279
deviation and so this seems to suggest

511
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,760
that our natural polys are evolving cyst

512
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,519
regulatory differences um and cyst

513
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,599
regulatory changes as they're aging

514
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,400
based on what we're seeing in the

515
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,399
synthetics which I thought was pretty

516
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,199
cool when we were looking at the

517
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,679
sequences of these genes we also found

518
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,038
that a few of our tobac mix sessions had

519
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,679
a frame shift mutation in dfr which

520
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,759
again is that first Gene towards making

521
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,640
at the cyanin um and we have a one Bas

522
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:11,720
pair delation leading to this frame

523
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:13,759
shift um other folks um found this also

524
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,839
and did some um functional work on it

525
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,359
and they found that that frame shift led

526
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:21,240
to a non-functional gene um so when we

527
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:25,359
have the frame shift and we bombard

528
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:28,880
those um constructs into a white tobacco

529
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:32,038
mutant um the gene that does have a

530
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,919
frame shift is able to create um anth

531
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:35,960
thein you can see that in this cell

532
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,880
there's our control because our yfp is

533
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,319
there we know that our constructs are in

534
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,679
there um but when we have a frame shift

535
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,240
again we know this cell has that

536
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:47,200
construct but it can't produce any at

537
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,679
the sinin and so we know that this frame

538
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,278
shift is

539
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:54,840
nonfunctional so um we seem to see that

540
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:57,558
this dfr homologue and the Sylvester's

541
00:21:54,839 --> 00:22:00,759
copy might be becoming Aude even in

542
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:02,359
young poly blades um and also because of

543
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:05,000
this we know it's nonfunctional we did

544
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:07,079
not include the that transcript in our

545
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,079
overall transcript analyses which I'm

546
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,439
going to show you

547
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,678
next because we found that our

548
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,480
homeologue bias did not correlate with

549
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:20,159
flower color but when we pull our um po

550
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,960
um expression together we do see that

551
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,120
overall expression of these genes does

552
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,720
correlate with flower color so you've

553
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,000
heard about fls which is making

554
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,440
flavanols and dfr which is making at the

555
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,880
cyanin we're looking at those um

556
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,919
expression of those genes across

557
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,320
development in these plots but we can

558
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,840
also look at the ratio here um because

559
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:41,558
um they're competing for the same

560
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:43,678
substrates in the pathway um and so what

561
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:46,079
we noticed when we looked at that ratio

562
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,759
is that we have an elevated fls to dfr

563
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:51,199
ratio early on in development in our two

564
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,079
polypoides that have a light pink

565
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,880
phenotype which you can see

566
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:59,240
here um and so we think that that is um

567
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,320
driving the flux of the p way towards

568
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,480
making flavanols at the expense of

569
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:06,879
making it the cyanin um and it also

570
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,360
seems to be because dfr um isn't

571
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,200
expressed as much early in development

572
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:15,359
it's being turned on later that's giving

573
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,640
us that um elevated fls dfr ratio but

574
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,000
because we have this

575
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,360
competition having more fls means that

576
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,599
we're going to have more of our pathway

577
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:24,639
going towards making flavonols less

578
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:28,038
going towards e thein giving us that

579
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,038
light pink phenotype

580
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,760
we also looked at the sequence variation

581
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,639
in this Gene um so this is work that has

582
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:39,158
been done by um Abigail McCoy who just

583
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,600
graduated last semester um she worked

584
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:43,440
with me for seven semesters at Portland

585
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,319
um and she was doing another project

586
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,480
that I'll tell you little bit about at

587
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:50,558
the end um but what we could see from

588
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:53,038
that is that we do have some variation

589
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,798
especially in regions that are important

590
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,919
in which substrates this Gene um is

591
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:59,798
interacting with um because it works on

592
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,799
several different ones um and so

593
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:04,960
sequence um variation may also affect

594
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,599
how these enzymes are functioning um and

595
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,120
so it seems like there's both a

596
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:11,759
transcription um an expression story to

597
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:14,158
this story and potentially um a sequence

598
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:18,119
Evolution story to this

599
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:20,760
story okay so conclude on this story we

600
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,199
found that homog bias does not correlate

601
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,038
with the differences in flower color

602
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,640
that we

603
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,759
observe we do see that we have a

604
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,840
stronger homeologue bias in our natural

605
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,919
poly plates compared to our synthetic

606
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,839
ones we have a slight sub genome

607
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:38,038
dominance in tm24 but not the

608
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:40,240
others we have a reduction of tomoris

609
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:42,480
bias in our flavonoid biosynthetic

610
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,720
pathog and popoids compared to their

611
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,759
progenitors and the transregulatory

612
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,839
differences are important early on in

613
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:50,839
polypoid evolution but perhaps our

614
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,000
natural popoids are evolving more s

615
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,599
regulatory differences as they

616
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,119
age we've got this um potential

617
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:02,639
pseudogene popping up and that our high

618
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:05,479
fls to dfr ratio is potentially driving

619
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,120
um our L Pig flower phenotype and that

620
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,079
our pigments that we see that are

621
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,558
different across these species are

622
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:16,639
probably due both to transcript levels

623
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,639
and also um the efficiency of these

624
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:22,079
enzymes all right so let's shift gears

625
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,440
we're going to talk about transgressive

626
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:28,519
delin in in these older poly poids so

627
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,720
here's nikana section Renda you've seen

628
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:34,240
sylvestris before she gets around um and

629
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,440
then obus aolia is our um paternal

630
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,120
parent here um and this is a single

631
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,278
event that happened four million years

632
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,479
ago that has speciated into a few

633
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:45,240
different poly

634
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,759
plates and we also see again flavonoids

635
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,880
we're going to talk about our pathway

636
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:52,079
this one is going to be um a flavanol so

637
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,480
campol and cotin and a delphinidin story

638
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:57,398
because you can see these purple

639
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,079
arrowheads here nudis and Randa have

640
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:01,639
delphinidin

641
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:03,558
the purple pigment but soest obus FIA

642
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,278
don't so that's a transgressive

643
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:06,798
character because it is outside the

644
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,278
range that we see in the prors which

645
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,558
just makes me really excited that's why

646
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:12,960
I love poly because what where is it

647
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,678
coming from we're gonna find

648
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,399
out so we have that transgressive

649
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,640
delphinidin which is here we also have

650
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:23,519
transgressive levels of Cam forall in

651
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,200
two of our species Randa and stoni

652
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,079
compared to our parents um and if I

653
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,640
didn't convince you before even though

654
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,599
the look white we do have that delin in

655
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,000
um in the tubes of these two

656
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:38,959
flowers um and so my questions here are

657
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,519
is this delin in coming because of

658
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,440
differences in sequence evolution in

659
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,200
differential expression or a combination

660
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,720
of

661
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,919
both and if sequence evolution is

662
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,960
important then is it because we have

663
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,080
complementation from our progenitors

664
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,840
where coming together in the same genome

665
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:57,038
um means that they can then produce that

666
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:59,000
pigment they couldn't before or has

667
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:03,158
there been some sort of Resurrection

668
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,200
of function during polyploid

669
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:07,520
Evolution told you You' see his face

670
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,080
again um so we did another transcript

671
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:14,240
analysis um again with a um early mid

672
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:16,960
and late floral buds um this time we had

673
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,480
a little bit of better um alumina um 2x

674
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,200
150 reads that did allow us to do um a

675
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,399
denovo assembly for our two progenitors

676
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,278
which we again combined into our um Alo

677
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:29,398
polyplay transcriptome um and then Abby

678
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:32,278
who you've seen before or also maed

679
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:34,199
these to a specific um just the the

680
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:35,919
reads of known flavonoid biosynthetic

681
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,080
pathway genes so we can pull out the

682
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,480
sequences of these genes to look at

683
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:43,960
whether they're functional or

684
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,360
not um so we found that they tend to not

685
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,519
have any non-sensor frame shift

686
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,079
mutations there are no stock coant or

687
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,798
frame shifts in any of our genes in

688
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:54,519
thean sylvestris the maternal

689
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:58,839
progenitor we did find that

690
00:27:54,519 --> 00:28:01,200
obtusifolia has some either two or three

691
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:04,278
premature stop codons in ANS which is

692
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,159
our last um enzyme in our towards making

693
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:10,119
an thein um but we went and looked at

694
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:12,840
our homog copies of obtusa folio and our

695
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:16,359
poly blades and we didn't see those stop

696
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:18,599
codons we looked at another um younger

697
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:21,599
polyl that also has obtusifolia as a

698
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:23,599
parent and its obtusifolia homog also

699
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,879
doesn't have these stop codons so that

700
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:29,398
makes me think that these probably arose

701
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,519
in the lineage after it um created the

702
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:33,359
poly plates so it's not really playing a

703
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,599
role in the poly plates but maybe it's

704
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,319
playing a role in why um obtusifolia

705
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,319
cannot make any

706
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:44,000
antis um so because of a different

707
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,200
project one of my undergrads um who also

708
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,880
has graduated um Trinity Tobin found

709
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,880
that the ANS copy um of nikoa sylvestris

710
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,640
retains an intron in its transcripts so

711
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,480
here we have some gels here's our

712
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:03,038
genomic DNA from sylvestris um here's

713
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,640
cdna from another diploid so we can see

714
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,640
that we can definitely get

715
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,038
differentiation where we have with an

716
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,840
intron without an intron but in the cdna

717
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,319
from sylvestris we tend to have both so

718
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:15,879
we have some transcripts that have the

719
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:18,038
intron some that don't and this also

720
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,080
changes over time so early on in

721
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:22,519
development we have more transcript that

722
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,119
retain this Inon and less that don't

723
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,558
this is not DNA

724
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:28,599
contamination um if we do those same

725
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,918
samples in a different Gene we can see

726
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:33,319
that we only have um transcripts without

727
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:35,840
the Inon in our cdna samples so

728
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:38,359
something is going on here we looked at

729
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,678
the sequence um and if you leave that

730
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,798
intron in you get a stop Cod on pretty

731
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,038
much right away so likely these

732
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,558
transcripts with the intron in are

733
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,480
non-functional um and so this

734
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:51,798
potentially is playing a role in the

735
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,319
lack of anthocyanins in the maternal

736
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:55,798
progenitor so like we're going to look

737
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,519
into more about this because it's just

738
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:00,398
like what is happening here

739
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:02,759
okay if we look at our overall

740
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,558
expression of our flavonoid biosynthetic

741
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,398
pathway genes in our polyes we see good

742
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:09,599
correlation so our transgressive

743
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:11,839
flavanols um we have that those two that

744
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,918
have higher flavanols they have higher

745
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:16,240
expression of fls which is towards

746
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,120
making and the cyanin and two of these

747
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,278
genes that are early on in the pathway

748
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:21,798
which are going to give more flux

749
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:23,119
through the pathway overall so they're

750
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:26,839
increasing the amount of pigments that

751
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:28,798
are produced we also see really nice um

752
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:32,000
correlation between

753
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:34,960
um increased expression of Anin based

754
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,640
genes so at the bottom of the pathway or

755
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,960
the um transcription factors involved in

756
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,200
the two species the orange one and the

757
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,519
cyan one um that produce that

758
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,519
transgressive doin so it looks like we

759
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,480
have really good correlation between the

760
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:51,000
transcript differences and our pigment

761
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,278
differences in this

762
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,558
story um which we can see here right so

763
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:56,960
if we look and apologies for the um

764
00:30:55,558 --> 00:31:00,038
quality of these graphs I'm not sure

765
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,360
what happened there um if we look at dfr

766
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:04,638
transcripts and correlate it to dadin we

767
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:07,918
have a really nice correlation similar

768
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:09,959
to F3 prime5 frame H which branch brings

769
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,278
this the pathway to our delphinidin

770
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,079
Branch we see that there's an increase

771
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:15,519
um in delphinidin with an increase in

772
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,519
transcript

773
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,079
accumulation um similar with fls if we

774
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:22,278
have an increase in fls we have an

775
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:25,720
increase in flavonol and then we also

776
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:28,200
looked at the the ratio between fls

777
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,038
which brings us towards flavanol and F3

778
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,120
Prime H which is going to differentiate

779
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:34,720
towards whether we're making cerol or

780
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:38,359
cotin flavanol and we see a correlation

781
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,759
between that fls to F3 Prim a ratio and

782
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:42,638
our um camper altic coration ratio so

783
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:45,158
we're seeing really good correlation

784
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:47,240
between what we are expressing and what

785
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:50,600
pigments we are

786
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,798
producing so to conclude this story um

787
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:55,240
our ANS Gene in both of our diploid

788
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,558
progenitors may be nonfunctional or have

789
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,679
reduced function um which may explain

790
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:01,798
why they don't make anthocyanins but it

791
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,759
seems like those mutations happened

792
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:06,000
later after they produce our poly plates

793
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:09,200
so it's not telling us why our

794
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,480
polypoides can produce um or influencing

795
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,080
why our polypoides can or cannot produce

796
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,880
fles um we do have increased expression

797
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:20,158
of early and fls genes um correlating

798
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,679
with increased flavanol production um

799
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,399
and increased expression of anthocyanin

800
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,080
based genes correlating with the

801
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,839
transgressive

802
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:31,678
delphinidin so seems like this story is

803
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:34,879
an expression difference story and less

804
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,798
so um a sequence Evolution

805
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,519
story all right I have a little bit of

806
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:42,119
time yes just want to highlight a few

807
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:43,960
things that are going on with the

808
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:45,879
students that either have just graduated

809
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,679
or still working in my lab because I get

810
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,480
really excited about the work that my

811
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,240
undergrads well excuse me undergrads

812
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,880
that work with me do um so um Lan Jensen

813
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,519
graduated a little bit ago she um

814
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,399
they're actually doing um a PhD at the

815
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,200
University univers of Buffalo now they

816
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:05,439
worked on um evolutionary simulations of

817
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:08,759
the biosynthetic pathway we modified um

818
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,038
a simulations by wheer Smith um and

819
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:12,079
changed it so that we could evolve

820
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:14,398
towards having multiple Optima to

821
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,199
reflect the pigment data we have and so

822
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,239
we can ask questions about what are the

823
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,200
mutations that are necessary for flower

824
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,919
color shifts to happen and are some

825
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,399
shifts harder to evolve to than

826
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:29,278
others um you've seen Abby's face before

827
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:32,278
um Abby was working on um a positive

828
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:34,839
weather positive selection is connected

829
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:37,720
with floral pigment shifts um and so she

830
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:39,720
used gnds um ratio analyses to

831
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,679
investigate whether we see differences

832
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,720
um between Anin and no Anin producing

833
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:47,240
species and also cyanidin versus

834
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,720
delphinidin producing

835
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,759
species so Trinity was working on this

836
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,480
other project that then led to us

837
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:57,359
figuring out that we had that intron um

838
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,120
retained in an ANS she was looking to

839
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,158
develop a digit droplet digital PCR

840
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:04,839
protocol such that we could distinguish

841
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,159
between expression of our two hogs in a

842
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:10,039
single reaction so more bank for your

843
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,639
buck we made some progress unfortunately

844
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:13,119
it didn't really come to pass that it

845
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,720
was going to be feasible for what we're

846
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,720
doing but we still learned some really

847
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,519
cool stuff along the way um so we've

848
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,959
kind of shifted that project with some

849
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:25,878
new folks um I'm G to move this so we

850
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,720
can see Alissa's name um some new folks

851
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:29,838
who are using ddpcr but now we're

852
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:32,199
developing two different primers um to

853
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:35,599
still get the expression data out two

854
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:37,358
different um reactions this time um but

855
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,679
Elisa Pino and Brooke tillon are working

856
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:42,239
on this project and we're getting into a

857
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,440
different we're taking that those um one

858
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,878
million yearo polyploids and seeing

859
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,760
what's happening with home bias in

860
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,679
them um we have another set of folks

861
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,159
Edie Russo has been working with me for

862
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,760
about a year and a half looking at how

863
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:00,480
cellular Dynamics um changing over um

864
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,040
development are affecting the um flower

865
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,280
sizes that we have in poly ples um and

866
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:07,880
Tim MRA just joined the lab this

867
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,640
semester um so we're excited to see what

868
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,200
they're going to come up

869
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:17,838
with and then finally um I got a a grant

870
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:19,799
to go to um Q Gardens um in the summer

871
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,480
so full circle Jeff talked about how

872
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,039
that's how my story started and I got to

873
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,240
sorry I get excited um I got to take one

874
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,400
of my undergrads um to the place where I

875
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:32,719
started underg love of niiko Shana so it

876
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,400
was fantastic so Marissa mle and I went

877
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:38,439
and collected a flower morphology

878
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,639
photographic data set of a lot of these

879
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,240
really old polyploids that have exploded

880
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:47,279
um and we're actually right now they did

881
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:49,239
it um yesterday and this week um and I

882
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,920
did it last semester my intro biolab

883
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:52,959
students are measuring tube length and

884
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,680
width um from the photographs we brought

885
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,240
back which is super fun I'm having a

886
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:58,199
great time with it and then Kendra

887
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:59,959
Moscato joined the lab this semester and

888
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:04,039
so we're excited to see where we're

889
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,000
going to take that um um project so lots

890
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:07,880
of stuff going on um I'd like to

891
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,280
acknowledge a ton of people who have

892
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,920
made this niiko sheny journey possible

893
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,000
including my PhD and postto supervisors

894
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,200
collaborators from all of those places

895
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,559
and especially my undergraduates um

896
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:21,759
because mentoring them is really

897
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,199
valuable and really exciting for me and

898
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,319
that's why I do what I do so I'm excited

899
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:29,519
to see where they go and what they do

900
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:32,079
ALS o some funding sources and

901
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,679
computational resources um and with that

902
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,880
thank you for your attention and I'll

903
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:36,879
happily answer any

904
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,920
questions for

905
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:44,078
Elizabeth how do

906
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,880
I yeah I'm trying to figure out how I

907
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,160
can make it pop

908
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,358
up um maybe I can get some technical

909
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,639
assistance on the zoom while I answer

910
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:56,119
Rob's question me but I'll

911
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:59,279
try thanks Chelsea we made it disappear

912
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,720
and then um put it back Rock question

913
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,519
first of all thank you that was quite a

914
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,559
to force sorry I get excited and talk

915
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:06,639
real fast it's a nice lineage for so

916
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,480
many reasons

917
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,759
biogeographically you have a lot of

918
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,159
repeated Evolution gain and loss of

919
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:17,200
night blooming and color versus white

920
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:19,838
and scent um as you know and so

921
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:22,118
sylvestris is a major player in in

922
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,639
everything you've shown us today if I

923
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:26,680
remember correctly sylvestris is a

924
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:28,519
problem file genetically um that's off

925
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:31,199
on a limb on its own

926
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:33,079
right and and it the the cladistics are

927
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,358
are misleading because because of the

928
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:36,599
hybrids that it makes it looks like it's

929
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:41,119
closely related to things that it's

930
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:43,720
actually the progenitor of um so what

931
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,519
came be for sylvestris um thinking about

932
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:48,598
the stop codons and why it's white did

933
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:50,838
it have ancest so the stop codons are in

934
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,318
obtusifolia oh sorry it's the intron

935
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:54,920
retained that seems to be my Okay but

936
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:56,559
well so let's take a step back further

937
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,318
than that then is the ancestral

938
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,719
condition in the to be white and scented

939
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:04,480
or be

940
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:07,279
colored I can't tell you it's a um I I

941
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:11,519
wish I knew the answer the way the way

942
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:14,480
the nikana um um or the nikana sections

943
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:17,880
are connected it means that we have a

944
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,039
bifurcation at the the base and that

945
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,000
could be white or

946
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:25,559
colorful pretty much yeah right and so

947
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
we we do see a lot of um shifts in

948
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:30,358
whether things are colored or white

949
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,358
in the genus and so I don't know the

950
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:35,880
answer I guess let me follow back with a

951
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:38,000
kind of Stacy Smith question um when is

952
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,200
White not white you know so many of us

953
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,440
thought about white as null mutants but

954
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:44,078
obviously you were showing us the

955
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,358
flavanols can give you white flowers

956
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,720
they're very strongly pigmented and

957
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:51,480
they're antifungal but they're not nulls

958
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:52,719
yeah right so if you looked at the the

959
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,920
tree for the

960
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:58,679
genus um do you think there are many

961
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:00,599
different sources of whiteness o

962
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:03,440
that's a great question so something I

963
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:06,599
didn't talk about today um and so

964
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,679
sylvestris and many of these do have

965
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:12,039
flavonols and they um absorb UV instead

966
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:14,480
of reflecting UV up to

967
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:16,639
aolia um does not have very many

968
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,960
flavonols and it reflects UV so even

969
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:21,239
within our white flowers we have

970
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:23,358
phenotypic differences um I haven't um

971
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:25,439
manage to do those things with every

972
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:27,480
single um it's my goal to do this with

973
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,119
every single species of nikana totally

974
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,800
not feasible um but just one more the

975
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,318
Australian ones that you finished with

976
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,519
yeah those have a single origin and they

977
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:38,639
radiated yeah so they should all have

978
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:41,159
the same white so um they at least in

979
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,598
terms of UV absorption and reflection we

980
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:45,199
were able to do that I brought my spec

981
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,920
with me to London it was great um and so

982
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:50,318
those all seem to absorb clols um or

983
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,358
excuse me absorb UV we haven't done any

984
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:56,318
pigment data on them yet but hopefully

985
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:59,318
soon at least a handful um

986
00:39:56,318 --> 00:40:02,159
so in terms of the ones that do absorb

987
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:02,159
UV and produce

988
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,880
flavanols I think those are probably the

989
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,318
same white but then we have some that

990
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,200
have a ton of flavanol and some that

991
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:16,838
don't so like the um the two popoids

992
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,799
that have that really high levels of

993
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:23,078
flos that is that a different

994
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,200
phenotype I don't know how do we I don't

995
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:28,920
know so I guess again my answer to your

996
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:31,559
question is I don't know

997
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,079
yes yes thank you really interesed so

998
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:38,960
how did you calculate the age of this

999
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:41,400
6.5 million it would put you in the myos

1000
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,599
um so that was not data I did but um

1001
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:47,599
they used um molecular data um and um

1002
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,000
some sort of non-parametric test if I'm

1003
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,920
remembering correctly um to estimate

1004
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,318
times

1005
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:59,159
um we we don't have any within theana um

1006
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:03,719
off the top of my head I don't have the

1007
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:07,799
specifics but it's definitely um earlier

1008
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:09,639
than so I think so in AC but I I don't

1009
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,039
have a good I'm doing great on questions

1010
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:13,279
I don't know is the answer to your

1011
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:17,639
question also um but definitely a good

1012
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,240
point that that's um maybe we don't have

1013
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:22,440
um specifics like maybe our exact dates

1014
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:25,559
aren't great but I think our relative

1015
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,679
dates are certainly good so um even if

1016
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:29,199
we don't have the exact dates we still

1017
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:30,358
have that trajectory of understanding

1018
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,919
which ones are younger and which ones

1019
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:36,318
are older um so that still kind of fits

1020
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:38,480
with my um I wish we had more fossils is

1021
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:40,079
again the answer I saw hand over here

1022
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,800
and then you're on

1023
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,000
Deck it's a naive question a lot of

1024
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,359
these pigments that You' talked about

1025
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,760
appear in vegetative organs as well as

1026
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:53,799
floral orans is it a fair supposition

1027
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,520
that what you found in the

1028
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:00,760
petals is also happening in the

1029
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:02,960
vegetative orans I think yes and no for

1030
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,560
the flavanol I would assume yes I think

1031
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,199
it's way more likely that those

1032
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,358
vegetative tissues have flavonol

1033
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:11,598
compared to the anthocyanins um just by

1034
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,000
looking at the vegetative tissue in some

1035
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,000
of these plants as I've worked with them

1036
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,599
there are some that I I I call them they

1037
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,880
have purple leaves people are like no

1038
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,559
that's green I'm like yes but it's

1039
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,599
purpler than these ones so I think that

1040
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:26,200
maybe some of them have some antoin in

1041
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,119
them um but I would certainly guess

1042
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:32,318
flavonol the levels and the ratios of

1043
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:37,240
those things I'm not sure um but

1044
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:40,639
even hold the phone um even within the

1045
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:42,318
the flower tissue can I find that yeah

1046
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:44,679
so even in the flower tissue we have

1047
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,558
differences so the the the pigments are

1048
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:48,759
really concentrated in the limb and not

1049
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,599
in the tube um so I do think that for

1050
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:54,760
the anthocyanins at least we have um

1051
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,800
really specific um expression of when

1052
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:59,040
we're turning those pigments on um which

1053
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,079
is not happening in the vegetative

1054
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:08,279
tissue that answer your question I got

1055
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:11,480
one okay yes no um you see um sub genome

1056
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,760
dominance in the older like natural

1057
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:17,639
polyploids is is sub genome dominant

1058
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:22,240
it's we see a more expression bias okay

1059
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:25,558
so at the gene by Gene basis we see a um

1060
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:28,039
greater um deviation from equal

1061
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:29,720
expression but if we look at it overall

1062
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:34,119
we don't actually see sub genome

1063
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:36,399
dominance is that is that a function of

1064
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:38,920
um the age of the polypoid if you could

1065
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,680
look at that gradient of the ages of

1066
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:46,039
those polypoid events you see with older

1067
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:48,000
polypoid events more of that bias that's

1068
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:49,920
a great question and it's part of like

1069
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,280
I'm trying to piece this together right

1070
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,800
I'm working in all these different age

1071
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,359
polyploids and hopefully at some point

1072
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,480
I'm going to be able to put all of that

1073
00:43:55,358 --> 00:44:00,159
together I gu to follow up to that is

1074
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,960
there is a logical conclusion of that

1075
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:05,480
sub genome dominance and maybe a

1076
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:08,760
contraction that you see potentially

1077
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,240
yeah definitely um at least in um we

1078
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:14,640
don't have full genomes of all of these

1079
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:16,719
polyes um but for um the sequences that

1080
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:19,960
people have used phog gentically we do

1081
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:22,159
seem to have both copies of things in

1082
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,679
most of these poly voids maybe the

1083
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,719
oldest ones were starting to lose some

1084
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,519
things so maybe that's when

1085
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:27,919
fractionation is starting to happen but

1086
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:29,679
we don't have a answer to that yet

1087
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,720
either but definitely a great question

1088
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,519
and kind of fits with this idea of how

1089
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:34,598
can we use this trajectory to really

1090
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,480
answer cool

1091
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:38,280
questions yeah what about flower size

1092
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,760
and

1093
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:44,920
shape what about it tell me yeah I also

1094
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,839
care about those things

1095
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,920
I out interesting ways I guess say yeah

1096
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:52,000
and I we're trying to get at that in in

1097
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,318
some of the things that um that Edie and

1098
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,280
Tim are working on with the cell stuff

1099
00:44:54,318 --> 00:45:01,279
um also the Suave lentes project we have

1100
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:03,280
we have more differences in shape size

1101
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,200
um than color and those so those are

1102
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,640
things that we're we're getting into

1103
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:08,078
then again I don't have good answers to

1104
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:10,799
your questions but I would love to find

1105
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,960
out um I guess I can tell you a little

1106
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,920
bit right we do see that um we tend to

1107
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,440
have wider tubes in really young

1108
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,159
polypoides and that seems to be because

1109
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:25,240
the width of the cells are bigger with

1110
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:27,199
poly so polypoid increases the the width

1111
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:29,000
of the cells and increases the tube

1112
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:31,838
might influence pollination so maybe

1113
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,920
we're poly potentially is giving us more

1114
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,078
generalized pollination um but what

1115
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,159
we're what eating and Tim are looking at

1116
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,000
is the cell size in the older polypoides

1117
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:42,159
and preliminary data it looks like we

1118
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,760
lose that in our older ones so we're

1119
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:46,399
reducing the size in our older polys

1120
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,800
potentially like we're reducing genome

1121
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:52,079
size I'm excited to find out more about

1122
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:56,119
that Jeff and then Rob what's the link

1123
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,680
with pollinators in the sizes and the

1124
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:00,440
pigments

1125
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:04,799
um you know the amount of flavonoids for

1126
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:09,079
reflection for B's C versus bats not c

1127
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,880
yeah we we have some pollinator data um

1128
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:13,200
we have pollinator data more for

1129
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,838
diploids than we do for polyploids so

1130
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,639
that's another um whole trajectory that

1131
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:20,119
I would love to take my research program

1132
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:22,960
in the future is to look and see how

1133
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:25,079
these morphological and and phenotypic

1134
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,519
differences affect pollinators but

1135
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:28,839
unfortunately we don't know a whole lot

1136
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:30,358
about what's pollinating our poly plates

1137
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:31,960
so again I don't know the answer to that

1138
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:37,078
question but that's great I have so much

1139
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:39,199
to work on Rob Back Adrian's question um

1140
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:43,240
you also have a symmetry issue right

1141
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:45,960
like tophia and and oora are zygomorphic

1142
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:50,879
we know what genes are responsible in a

1143
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:52,440
lot of my families py morphy um are they

1144
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,559
um segregating between between the

1145
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,119
hybrids because sylvest does not look py

1146
00:46:55,559 --> 00:47:00,160
morphic to me no sylvest is not I would

1147
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:03,640
say that most neosan are not there are a

1148
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,440
handful um a lot of the alatte are also

1149
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:07,879
um

1150
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,318
zygomorphic um trying to just think

1151
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,920
about all the poly poids in my head for

1152
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:13,599
a

1153
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,400
second I think most of them are radial

1154
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,119
at least in the limb um there are some

1155
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,760
in the older poly blades that we were

1156
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,318
just investigating where they do start

1157
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,760
to have those um so again really great

1158
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:26,119
questions that we can investigate we

1159
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,040
know those genes um hopefully with more

1160
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:29,720
data we can again start answering those

1161
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:32,358
questions really great ones that get to

1162
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:34,000
just question too because certain kinds

1163
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:37,440
of pollinators like flowers that have an

1164
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,440
up and down yeah

1165
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:43,480
definitely yeah size question it'd be

1166
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,400
cool with more data to see if there's a

1167
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,358
relationship between polyploid and end

1168
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,920
maybe you can that if in these

1169
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:54,119
polyploids that um maybe you see less or

1170
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,838
if it's compensating or they're going to

1171
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:57,800
get their genomes one way or another

1172
00:47:55,838 --> 00:48:00,358
yeah I I don't know again really cool

1173
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,519
things um that hopefully be able to

1174
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:04,000
investigate at some point but yeah

1175
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:06,519
there's so many cool

1176
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,880
things other questions folks yeah go for

1177
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:12,000
it um because you made your owna

1178
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,240
transcripts were you able to see any

1179
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,239
bias when you took that same data and

1180
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:17,318
I'm assuming you did a concatenated

1181
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:21,358
transcript

1182
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:24,759
down in the mapping so were there any um

1183
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:27,679
reads that maps to one or the other

1184
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,960
incorrectly yeah and that's um part of

1185
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:32,719
why I didn't tell you a story about

1186
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,318
homog bias and rande um because we have

1187
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:38,879
um I need two hands for this um I need

1188
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:41,318
two hands for everything um we we have a

1189
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:45,000
threshold um for when we're looking at

1190
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:47,000
those um hom log bias where um less we

1191
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,039
can um have to have a less than 10%

1192
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,079
mismatch between our two copies and for

1193
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:54,440
many genes we reached that um for some

1194
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,920
we didn't luckily for the tacum story We

1195
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,119
reached that for Oliver flavonoid

1196
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:02,440
biosynthetic pathway gen we didn't hit

1197
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:04,680
that for um R um which is unfortunate

1198
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:07,639
I'm hoping maybe and maybe Jacob has a

1199
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:10,358
better um answer to this question like

1200
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:12,039
if we add more long reads um to those

1201
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:14,400
progenitors we didn't have that for this

1202
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:16,719
one whether we might be able to pull out

1203
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,599
um the differences we also have the

1204
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:21,239
added difficulty of there's four million

1205
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,838
years of evolution in the polyploids and

1206
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:27,479
in the Diplo lineages in that system and

1207
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:29,599
so being able to really figure out

1208
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,000
homes because the homes within the

1209
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,160
polypoides have diverged in sequence

1210
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,960
from the progenitors we see that way

1211
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:37,759
less inbam it happens sometimes but

1212
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:42,079
they're pretty tight so that's way

1213
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:43,960
easier um so so yes um and then we just

1214
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,200
can't ask those kind of questions for

1215
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:50,240
those genes does that answer your

1216
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:52,719
question a other questions folks I go

1217
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:55,000
quick so real quick that gets into like

1218
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:57,358
the next I keep thinking about as in the

1219
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,079
longterm one right got this 90 species

1220
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,920
or whatever it is thinking about copy

1221
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,880
them right whether you get retain

1222
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,318
retention of hogs over time and how that

1223
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,559
might lead to either sub or

1224
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:11,039
neofunctionalization yeah can you see

1225
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:13,559
how that you might attack that across

1226
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:16,159
those different time scales yeah um I

1227
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:20,400
think it'll probably have to be on a

1228
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:22,960
like candidate Gene basis more likely um

1229
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,400
um maybe not all the

1230
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:30,519
things um but at least like I said

1231
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:32,838
before folks have used some um um genes

1232
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:35,519
to look at phog gentics and we sometimes

1233
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:39,159
don't see the the second copy in some of

1234
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,559
those faules the old ones um it's

1235
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:44,000
certainly interesting I mean we're

1236
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:46,480
already seeing some puden in young

1237
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,838
polypoid sometimes um and I didn't talk

1238
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,159
about it today but when we looked at all

1239
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:52,920
of those flavonoid biosynthetic pathway

1240
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:55,558
genes in the rande there are a few more

1241
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,079
like some of the um Hogs within the poly

1242
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:59,760
plates have um um frame shifts and so

1243
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:03,079
we're starting to see some of those

1244
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,960
things um but yes again all of you have

1245
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:07,240
really great ideas um these are really

1246
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,838
good questions that um with more data

1247
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:14,279
will definitely be interesting to

1248
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:14,279
investigate right well let's thank right

1249
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:20,679
thanks this has been a production of
