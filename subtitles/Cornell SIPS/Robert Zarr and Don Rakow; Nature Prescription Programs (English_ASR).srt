1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:12,089
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:16,080
University first of all thanks to dr.

3
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:18,059
ray Cao and his wife for hosting us

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,469
while we're here in Ithaca thanks to

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,629
Cornell for having me back I think I was

6
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:24,089
here about a year and a half ago and

7
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:25,919
it's it's great to be back um so a

8
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,268
little bit myself I'm gonna speak a

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,630
little quickly just because I know I

10
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:32,549
have about 40 minutes and when I get to

11
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:34,799
about 30 minutes I'll go even faster

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,259
than I thought so they'll let me know

13
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,689
when I get close to that one but I'm a

14
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:41,878
pediatrician normally I practice five

15
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,339
days a week I'm actually traveling the

16
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:47,369
world for one year on a research year

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,510
with my wife Bella and my child kai here

18
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:51,419
sitting in the front row over here as

19
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:54,390
well so I've made the title of this talk

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,189
a bit broader than I usually do sort of

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,509
you know that the ties you know the ties

22
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,218
between nature and human health and sort

23
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:02,250
of reconnecting us back with nature

24
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,040
we've lived in natural settings for

25
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,450
thousands of years and evolved in

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,210
natural settings it's only really been

27
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,950
in a very recent history that we are now

28
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,228
spending about 90% of our time indoors

29
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,350
that's the average the average American

30
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:18,688
anyway my disclosures I think taun

31
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:20,158
already made for me dr. Reich how did

32
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:22,649
I'm the medical director for Parker X

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,159
America and there's no other commercial

34
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,290
affiliations as of yet learning

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,680
objectives are pretty straightforward I

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,150
want to talk about epidemics I also want

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,759
to talk about the epidemic in the

38
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,640
context of climate change natural

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,819
resources and this continuing trend

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,950
towards urbanization then I want to dive

41
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,078
in as fast as I can to the scientific

42
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,700
literature there's a lot out there

43
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:50,188
there's more than 500 published studies

44
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,659
scientific studies that have looked at a

45
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:53,669
connection between nature and human

46
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,770
health and then very quickly just give

47
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,049
you a little glimpse as to what kinds of

48
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:59,640
things are happening in the world of

49
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,020
applications so how can we take this

50
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,430
science and actually put it to some sort

51
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:06,899
of applied daily routines you hear about

52
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,250
climate change all the time not going to

53
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,439
spend a lot of time on this but just a

54
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,710
couple of graphics to remind us about

55
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,240
the the sort of you know do

56
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,650
they would hear about on a daily basis

57
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,670
not just here in the US but around the

58
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,340
world natural resources are a very

59
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:25,439
important topic I've been working in

60
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,300
this field this area for about 10 years

61
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,710
now and I've even heard people say let's

62
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,020
not use the word natural the phrase

63
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,330
natural resources because nature is more

64
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,000
than just a resource but having said

65
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,040
that just to remind us that those of us

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,039
who live in high-income countries are

67
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,629
using many more times to resources than

68
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,109
those who are living in low-income

69
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:49,560
countries that's the most important

70
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,600
context that I can that I can part with

71
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,129
you today is this issue of accelerating

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,949
urbanization so this is a picture that

73
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:00,810
you see all over the world mostly we

74
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:03,329
just got back from traveling in Lima in

75
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,939
Bullitt da and if anybody's been to

76
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,440
these capital cities of Latin America

77
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:09,960
you know what I'm talking about just

78
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:14,370
incredible density oftentimes very

79
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,800
little nature huge vast slums and this

80
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,900
is often how many of the world's

81
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,510
population is living and to compound

82
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,939
that we're moving as a species we're

83
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:26,969
moving into urban areas at a really high

84
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,949
rate so by 2050 2/3 of the world's

85
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:31,050
population will be living in cities that

86
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:33,899
to thee to me this means that we need to

87
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,520
rethink how we live in cities what is in

88
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,530
our cities how does that affect our

89
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,450
health and what I wanted to point it out

90
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,310
was even the United Nations one of

91
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,009
sustainable goals number 11 to be

92
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,699
specific mentions the importance of

93
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:50,549
creating green public space green public

94
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,500
space and I don't see that very often

95
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,939
like in literature I don't see a sort of

96
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,889
in the medical literature very often I

97
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:57,810
don't even see it that often in the

98
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:01,049
public health world which I also come

99
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,430
from but it's increasingly important as

100
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,740
you can tell as we have this

101
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,290
accelerating urbanization to think about

102
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,060
cities that's where we're going to be

103
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,579
living that's where we're moving to

104
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,439
and how can we incorporate a little more

105
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,959
greenness perhaps into our lives

106
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:19,110
so this is not the world this is

107
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,060
actually looking at the u.s. this is a

108
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,350
look at chronic disease in the US

109
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,540
according to the Centers for Disease

110
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,950
Control and Prevention just to give you

111
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,830
some scope of what we're talking about

112
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,839
here there's a lot going on this is what

113
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:33,849
I see on a daily basis although I'm a

114
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,099
pediatrician and I thought even though I

115
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,689
thought that I was going into a career

116
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,610
where I would deal with a lot of runny

117
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:42,040
noses and strep throats and things like

118
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,100
that what I'm dealing mostly with is

119
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,240
that stuff but in the context of

120
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,820
pre-diabetes diabetes high blood

121
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,800
pressure certainly lots and lots of

122
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:53,019
obesity and a ton of mental health

123
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,579
problems so that's really my life I give

124
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:56,349
vaccines and all that stuff that we do

125
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:58,479
as primary care features but I do it in

126
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,990
the context of a lot of chronic disease

127
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,210
so kids we were taught to say that kids

128
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,949
aren't little adults but to be honest

129
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:08,769
with you kids are looking more and more

130
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:10,120
like their adult peers and these are

131
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:13,240
problems that you usually think of in

132
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,610
the adult world there's also an epidemic

133
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,550
of nature deficit and this is very hard

134
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,740
to read for a reason because this is the

135
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,360
amount of time seven minutes four to

136
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,250
seven minutes is the average amount of

137
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,860
time a child spends in unstructured play

138
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:30,610
outside every day this is the amount of

139
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,139
time seven hours that they spend average

140
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,030
amount of time on some kind of

141
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:36,069
electronic device or some kind of screen

142
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:38,469
time now granted it may be doing

143
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,810
homework it's not always you know

144
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,240
playing video games but but this is a

145
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,790
good way to sort of see what's happening

146
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,220
in terms of the way we spend our days

147
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:50,760
and I didn't point out I don't think I

148
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,919
did this is in four to seven year olds

149
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,519
so you can only imagine what happens as

150
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,159
they grow up

151
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:59,019
it actually usually intensifies and it

152
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,730
established as a routine a pattern that

153
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:01,539
they actually did it that they use for

154
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,700
the rest of their life

155
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,110
the same is true with other behaviors we

156
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:07,479
know that smoking if you start smoking

157
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,830
before the age of 18 you're much much

158
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,290
more likely to smoke the rest of your

159
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:15,069
life then starting initiation of smoking

160
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:19,569
after the age of 18 these are the top 10

161
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:22,300
causes of death also that are I put up

162
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:24,728
here in part because every one of these

163
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,968
is either directly or indirectly related

164
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:29,438
to this our lifestyle

165
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:32,079
right this is a bit exaggerated here but

166
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,669
we sit a lot we don't always eat the

167
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,069
right kinds of food and the right kinds

168
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:37,988
of ways in the right amount of time we

169
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:39,848
have a lot of stress and then when you

170
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:41,558
have all these three things you develop

171
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:45,238
one of these three things and then you

172
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:45,239
come to me and you ask for these

173
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,179
generally my life what I see on my end

174
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,918
of things and and which is really true

175
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,748
for most of us who are in the practicing

176
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:59,019
world

177
00:06:54,749 --> 00:07:00,729
all right enough doom and gloom so this

178
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,588
is the nature pyramid there used to be a

179
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:05,199
food pyramid which you may or may not

180
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:07,418
remember which I don't like very much

181
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,788
now we use the plate and we portion it

182
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:12,218
out I actually really do like the nature

183
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:15,338
pyramid because it gives you a good idea

184
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:18,939
and this is from I believe the

185
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:20,829
University of North Carolina I was kind

186
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,019
of thing but anyway what I want to point

187
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:26,559
out is on the very bottom of the pyramid

188
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:28,389
is low frequency a high frequency low

189
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:32,319
intensity so these are the things like

190
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:34,119
the gardens the rooftops campus here you

191
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,329
have a lot of greenery here things that

192
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:39,339
you might actually see every day maybe

193
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:41,050
even every hours and as you move toward

194
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:43,360
the top of the pyramid it's much more

195
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:46,149
intense and less frequent so I just went

196
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,588
to you know hike on the Inca Trail I may

197
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,559
never do that again in my life

198
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:53,379
right so very very low frequency high

199
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:54,699
intensity right so it was amazing I saw

200
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:57,009
that little bomb by River

201
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,408
I saw orchids just peering over a

202
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,538
thousands of feet draw amazing things I

203
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:03,610
saw which is great wonderful but it's

204
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:06,098
not what we're going to do every day so

205
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,749
I'm focusing my career in my time down

206
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:09,610
here I happen to call it the

207
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:11,679
foundational work because it is the

208
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,299
vision of the pyramid but it is really

209
00:08:11,678 --> 00:08:16,359
important especially as we move into

210
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:19,328
cities and more so we live in cities we

211
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,499
move into cities because this is what

212
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:23,949
most people are going to have access to

213
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:25,838
not travelling to even a state park

214
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:27,038
which many of my patients I work at a

215
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:30,848
committee health center so I see

216
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:33,668
primarily low-income patients in DC

217
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:36,129
Columbia Heights so even they rarely get

218
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:38,918
to Rock Creek which is just a mile away

219
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:41,208
right and they even even rare rare more

220
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,769
rarely gets a Blue Ridge now

221
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:45,378
for example which is an hour-and-a-half

222
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:47,688
drive away so having city parks have an

223
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:49,308
urban areas having Gardens having

224
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:52,969
greenery around you is even more

225
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:56,509
important for these populations onto the

226
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,069
evidence so um not everybody here may

227
00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:00,889
know what a systematic review is I think

228
00:08:58,068 --> 00:09:02,409
the majority you probably do but it's

229
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:04,549
important to have inclusion criteria

230
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:06,198
often a meta analysis as part of a

231
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:07,698
systematic review and it's a quick way

232
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:10,008
for us to take a bunch of data at

233
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:12,258
different numbers of studies that that

234
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:14,600
might actually give you an in some

235
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:16,490
insight into certain questions that need

236
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,899
to be asked so the questions are you

237
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,178
know what happens when we spend time

238
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:21,980
outdoors I'm gonna go through a series

239
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:24,409
of studies and you'll see some of the

240
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,569
similarities as I go through this one

241
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:29,389
certainly is a there's a marker for

242
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:32,058
stress a biomarker cortisol stress

243
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:33,589
cortisol there's a decrease in decrease

244
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:35,749
in heart rate Israel decrease in blood

245
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:37,970
pressure cholesterol I want to read all

246
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:39,499
these you can read them yourself heart

247
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,809
rate variability is important and that

248
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:44,119
is our ability to go up and then back

249
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:46,730
down again and how quickly you get back

250
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:48,319
down again so you want actually a high

251
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,569
heart rate very but not a low heart rate

252
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:52,039
variability when I was a med student and

253
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:54,110
doing OB we talked about that with the

254
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,269
fetal the fetal rate but actually it's

255
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:00,459
now used oftentimes to talk about the

256
00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:00,459
effect of nature on on human health

257
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:06,618
another systematic review focused on 133

258
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:08,600
controlled studies and the intervention

259
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:11,990
itself was these adventure based

260
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,298
activities short-term walking seated

261
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,889
relaxation and national environments and

262
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:16,938
what do they find they found this is

263
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,709
more than a mental health piece but

264
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:21,649
psychological well-being psychosocial

265
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:23,508
function psychosis physiological stress

266
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:26,178
response cognitive performance all these

267
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,980
things improved one thing that's a

268
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:29,778
little difficult in this literature is

269
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,909
that even though I mentioned there over

270
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:34,759
500 studies that are published they're

271
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:36,798
all seemingly quite different in their

272
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:39,169
methodology and study design so it makes

273
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:40,759
doing a systematic review kind of hard

274
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:42,769
it makes coming with these grand

275
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,839
conclusions a little bit hard so I just

276
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:46,999
want to point that out that this is you

277
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,649
know we're still learning a lot about

278
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:51,139
nature and human health but learning

279
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:53,360
about the mechanisms as well there's

280
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:54,769
another study here done a 2018 I tried

281
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,430
to find the most sort of recent

282
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:59,689
group of studies that has come out and

283
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:02,539
you know you see a decrease in mortality

284
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,920
heart rate and violence some of the

285
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:05,870
earliest studies done by min Kuo

286
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:09,139
University of Illinois we're actually

287
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,269
looking at a low-income housing that was

288
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:14,179
built initially had greenery quite a bit

289
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:15,740
over the years wasn't maintained as some

290
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:18,469
areas was maintained in others and what

291
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,879
she found was to her not to her surprise

292
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,920
really because she worked with animals

293
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,450
before caged animals and animals living

294
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,919
in natural environments was that the

295
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,720
animals who lived in more natural

296
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:29,088
environments they lived longer they had

297
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,100
better social interactions and the same

298
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,839
she found was true for humans so where

299
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,149
humans lived in us in this low-income

300
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,560
housing that had some greenery they had

301
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:38,809
less violence they had better social

302
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,669
interactions so it's not surprising that

303
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:42,919
your you would live longer if you lived

304
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:45,439
closer to and therefore had more access

305
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:48,229
to green space another thing that's been

306
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,399
found which maybe is intuitive to many

307
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,769
people is an increase in physical

308
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,750
activity and it wasn't necessarily

309
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:55,819
intuitive to me initially but when I

310
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,500
think about it when I'm outside and when

311
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,020
you're outside you are much more likely

312
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,000
to move even if you picnic outside

313
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,740
you're more likely to get up and walk

314
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,690
around throw the frisbee maybe

315
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,610
investigate something you're more likely

316
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,620
to eat slowly actually when you're

317
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,120
outside so there's a there's a

318
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,879
interesting things that we've been able

319
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,799
to find attention and mood I'll get to

320
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,088
in just a second there has been some

321
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:19,669
research looking at ADHD and I'll

322
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:21,079
mention that and dr. Koh's work just a

323
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:23,599
little bit later on

324
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:25,578
Forest Therapy I wanted to share with

325
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,620
you a little bit I don't know if you

326
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,838
mentioned already but I'll be doing a

327
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,389
walk and it's really for dr. rake house

328
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,079
class and it's going to be a two and a

329
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:35,778
half hour

330
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:37,849
force therapy walk so the question is

331
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:39,559
being out in this forested area or being

332
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,149
out in nature you know what are the

333
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:43,219
effects you know what actually happens

334
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:47,480
so once that we did look at that a

335
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:50,839
relatively small sample size but they

336
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,730
did find some positive impacts of

337
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,720
lowering and high blood pressure some

338
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,089
cardiac and pulmonary function

339
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,540
improvement and you can see the rest of

340
00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:01,190
those things listed here there is strong

341
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:03,679
evidence that Green is associated with

342
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,220
even more thing so improvements in birth

343
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,909
weight

344
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:10,980
mentioned physical activity and this is

345
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:13,110
even some researchers to talk about

346
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,539
policy so we probably should be thinking

347
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,339
about once again you know how to design

348
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:21,328
how to change cities how to design

349
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:32,399
cities urban areas so that people all

350
00:13:21,328 --> 00:13:33,659
people have access to these areas I'm

351
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,649
gonna run over here though I'm running

352
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:36,958
at a time so I'm gonna go a little

353
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:38,399
faster okay I just want make sure we get

354
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,569
there's a lot of science in here but I

355
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,278
think for the purpose of this lecture

356
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,600
we'll go a little bit faster there's

357
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,278
some individual studies that I found

358
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,129
fastly want to share with you this is a

359
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,929
pretty recent study that in 2018 and it

360
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:50,759
was done in Spain there were two

361
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:54,509
different areas where they tracked

362
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:56,009
children through many years and what

363
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:58,679
they did was they had two areas one area

364
00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:00,870
had a and they look sort of geospatially

365
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:02,849
to see how green and not green these two

366
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,789
areas were so one area not very green

367
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,649
one area quite green and to my surprise

368
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:10,169
they actually did functional MRIs and

369
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:12,509
they measured the difference in brain

370
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:14,939
mass and what they found was that the

371
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:17,399
the kids who grew up in areas where it

372
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,860
was much greener actually had larger

373
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,269
brains that correlated with better

374
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,379
working memory and reduced in

375
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:28,350
attentiveness there are studies looking

376
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:30,750
at children and their school settings so

377
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,800
whether a forest school versus a non

378
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,769
forest school and what are the

379
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:36,599
differences in in cortisol I mentioned

380
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:38,250
cortisol is a stress hormone so we know

381
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,769
that for school students have a steady

382
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:43,139
decline in cortisol and we know it's

383
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:46,620
constant throughout the year and we also

384
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:49,500
know that the profile of these students

385
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,789
in the indoor class are similar to

386
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,339
individuals prone to stress associated

387
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:55,439
mental disorders like depression so

388
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,329
there is already some evidence looking

389
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,690
and evaluating the outcomes in these

390
00:14:57,328 --> 00:15:03,299
kinds of of educational settings this is

391
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:06,810
a study that I actually did there aren't

392
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:10,799
many studies yet looking at the park

393
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:12,899
prescription meaning a educator a health

394
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,159
professional would actually write a

395
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,740
prescription and by the way that's

396
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,958
happening has been happening for is it

397
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,930
two years now or more than important at

398
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:24,059
Cornell two years at Cornell health

399
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:26,009
and dr. Rekha we'll talk about that in

400
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:28,559
just a little bit so it's the idea of

401
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:30,539
actually writing a prescription for a

402
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,789
patient or a client to spend time in

403
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:34,439
nature and I'll talk more about the way

404
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:36,599
that I do it and that my nonprofit

405
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,510
actually promotes that this was done in

406
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,269
2013 and what we found was something

407
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:44,399
very important to me which was this is

408
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:45,449
sort of before and after so pre and post

409
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,730
intervention invention was the

410
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,960
prescription it was in children and what

411
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,480
we found was that children are

412
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,490
definitely more likely to visit a park

413
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,320
and actually increase their level of

414
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:58,680
physical activity by virtue of the

415
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,270
prescription there's another study done

416
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,629
by another pediatrician a colleague of

417
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:06,090
mine at at UCSF dr. rosani and what she

418
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:09,120
did was the randomized trial and she had

419
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:11,759
two groups of kids and families one

420
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,590
received the very plain park

421
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,480
prescription which I do and then one

422
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,340
group received the park prescription

423
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,230
plus all the bells and whistles which

424
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,120
means they got transportation provided

425
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,050
for them on Saturdays they went to a

426
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,789
local park

427
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:25,049
they had a naturalist with them they had

428
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:27,599
a photographer with them they had food

429
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:28,949
with them it was a production okay and

430
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,110
they do this every Saturday that's

431
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,730
called shine it's an acronym for the

432
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:35,519
organization that she would she's

433
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,649
founded and what she looked at was

434
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,279
stress reduction and to her surprise

435
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:42,659
um the group that got just the the plane

436
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,059
apart prescription with no bells and

437
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:48,269
whistles did just as well in stress

438
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:49,679
reduction so you know good for all of us

439
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:52,019
really not just good for me right

440
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,729
because I but I was reassured that you

441
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:56,909
don't have to have all those resources

442
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:58,500
necessarily to make some value out of

443
00:16:56,909 --> 00:17:00,539
this park prescription that there's

444
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,039
something happening there my own

445
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:04,319
hypothesis is that there's something

446
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:07,200
special in that relationship between a

447
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,399
client patient and their you know

448
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,069
primary care provider or the

449
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,380
psychologist their educator some trusted

450
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:15,359
professional in their life and I think

451
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:19,730
that has a lot to do with this is why

452
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:24,419
it's actually happening I mentioned dr.

453
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:26,390
dr. claman quo so dr. Taylor turquo did

454
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,920
a study that's really landmark studies

455
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:32,759
about attention deficit hyperactivity

456
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,050
disorder once again to actually were

457
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,640
more than two there are three treatment

458
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,740
arms one arm of

459
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,570
these are kids who all have ADHD one

460
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,990
went to a city park and the other two

461
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:48,210
went to urban settings and what she

462
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:52,019
found was that the kids who went to a

463
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:54,600
park and had unstructured play did just

464
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:56,309
as well in their ADHD symptom all of

465
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:58,769
symptom all symptomology so there's a

466
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:01,139
checklist of symptoms for ADHD as kids

467
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:04,559
who've had a dose of methylphenidate

468
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,970
which is a stimulant at four hours out

469
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,329
which is the maximal effect usually on a

470
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:12,990
short-acting stimulant medication as the

471
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:14,879
kids who who went on a walk in and just

472
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,069
I'm sorry played in a natural setting

473
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,960
this is not to say that you know if

474
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:21,480
anybody in here as ADHD should stop your

475
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,490
meds right away and go out to the

476
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,789
Botanic Gardens but it is a little bit

477
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:30,029
of food for thought to think about your

478
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:34,230
you know could nature actually be a

479
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:35,639
treatment option for many kids and and I

480
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,370
think the answer is from my own practice

481
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,440
that it's certainly an adjunct so when I

482
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:42,929
have kids who come in with attention

483
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,820
problems one of the first things I do is

484
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,970
we talk about diet or routine and

485
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:49,529
certainly clay when where do they play

486
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,839
goo they play outside things like that

487
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,519
and what I find even in the very very

488
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,659
low-income populations is that they just

489
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,269
don't have that kind of unstructured

490
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:02,160
time very similar to kids of high income

491
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:05,309
I mentioned forest bathing so shinrin

492
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,360
yoku is the japanese term for forest

493
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:11,129
bathing and there is a another realm of

494
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,139
research done in Japan how am i doing on

495
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,060
time good

496
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,920
and so dr. Lee did this research this

497
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:18,599
was pretty landmark research looking at

498
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,140
not just at natural killer cells but

499
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:23,039
that's what's talked about a lot and

500
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,750
natural killer cells are an important

501
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,279
part of our immune system they're a more

502
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,380
ancient part of our immune system and

503
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,750
thoughts really protect us against

504
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,190
cancer so they float around our blood

505
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,690
and they look for abnormality to look

506
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,549
for cells that are reproducing too fast

507
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,769
hence you know cells that might be

508
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,779
heading towards the cancer and they and

509
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:41,190
they take care of that problem so having

510
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,109
a natural killer cells is a good thing

511
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,220
having activity natural killer cell

512
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:46,559
activity is a good thing better thing

513
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,180
for you so one thing that has been

514
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,819
established is that the fighting sides

515
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,070
these essential oils

516
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:53,479
and I'm not a botanist I'm not a

517
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:54,769
horticulturalist but from what I

518
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:56,028
understand yell out if I'm saying

519
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:57,979
something completely off the mark here

520
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:02,528
but I think it's Cypress and pine are

521
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:02,528
two of these books

522
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:08,690
okay so Pines oak and okay and Oaks and

523
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:11,028
Cypress Cypress to give you an example

524
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,429
have these natural occurring chemicals

525
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:16,278
that do seem to increase our level of

526
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:17,570
natural killer cells and among other

527
00:20:16,278 --> 00:20:18,618
things I mentioned in here as well I

528
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:20,088
don't want to go there there's other

529
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,798
chemical meteors but I put him in if you

530
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:24,319
wanted to see I thought what was most

531
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:26,328
fascinating with this is that if you

532
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:29,088
look over here so this is these are

533
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:31,459
these are 2 9 three-day excursions going

534
00:20:29,088 --> 00:20:33,319
into a forested area in Japan and what

535
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:34,788
happens you know when you take blood

536
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:38,388
samples and you measure natural killer

537
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:40,759
cells on day on before day 1 to 7 and 30

538
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:43,488
and what what they found was that it's

539
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:46,159
it rises it elevates but it stays

540
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:48,440
elevated it stays elevated 30 days out

541
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,479
and when you compare that to an urban

542
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,028
setting you don't see any significant

543
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:54,588
change so one of the things that one of

544
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:56,808
the points that they suggested and in

545
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:59,239
this research is you know frequency

546
00:20:56,808 --> 00:21:01,219
right so how often should we go into a

547
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:04,219
forested area how often should we do

548
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:05,749
this these kinds of outings he's

549
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:08,179
suggesting and the team is suggesting

550
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:09,709
that maybe at least once a month which i

551
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:12,019
think is pretty phenomenal that there's

552
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:15,649
there's even a frequency and perhaps a

553
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:18,469
dose related to this so I've gone

554
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:20,868
through quite a bit of the research I

555
00:21:18,469 --> 00:21:23,690
hope I've left you with something

556
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:25,999
perhaps you haven't seen before there

557
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,159
are many places obviously this crowd

558
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:30,709
knows where to go to find scientific

559
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,359
studies but you may not have heard of

560
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:34,489
the children and Nature Network research

561
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:36,199
library and if you haven't heard of it

562
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:38,119
it's a good place and it's not just

563
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,719
about children it actually spans all

564
00:21:38,118 --> 00:21:43,398
ages and it's a nice compilation of the

565
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:46,038
research that's been done on nature and

566
00:21:43,398 --> 00:21:47,838
health in one place so I go to PubMed

567
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,398
too but it's a nice really easy place to

568
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:52,428
find a lot of what I've just gone

569
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:54,588
through with you so what does this mean

570
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:58,219
for me what does this mean for all my

571
00:21:54,588 --> 00:22:00,588
colleagues around the world frankly and

572
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:02,298
when I heard richelieu speak when I read

573
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:03,079
his book last child in the woods and

574
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:05,028
since then

575
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:07,339
many other books nature fixes another

576
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:09,349
one I've read by Florence Williams you

577
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:11,928
know I'm a doctor I'm a plumber I'm a

578
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:15,259
technician I'm not you know I've been a

579
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:17,630
researcher so intensely involved as many

580
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:19,250
of you have been or will be but I'm

581
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,299
practical I want to know what I can do

582
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,940
with this I want to know where do we

583
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:24,379
apply this as do you so but when I go

584
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,899
back to the office I don't know how can

585
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,700
I put this information into practice so

586
00:22:26,898 --> 00:22:30,558
I'm gonna give you some idea of what I

587
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,269
have done and what others have done so

588
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,599
there's there's four programs that come

589
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:36,649
to mind track trails walk with the Doc

590
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:40,730
Association of nature and forest therapy

591
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:42,798
and park corrects America I mentioned

592
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,929
forest bathing or shinrin yoku which is

593
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,000
an ancient Japanese tradition nothing

594
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:48,559
really new about that but the

595
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,369
association of nature and forest therapy

596
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:56,538
has taken the concept of nature nature

597
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:58,668
of a forest bathing and really gone in

598
00:22:56,538 --> 00:23:01,220
in a slightly different direction so

599
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:04,460
it's called nature therapy and the idea

600
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:11,350
is for a guide to really open the doors

601
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:14,298
so to speak to a therapy that is

602
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:17,418
experienced if I'm by virtue of being in

603
00:23:14,298 --> 00:23:19,519
nature to put it simply I'm talking a

604
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:20,809
little bit from from a scientific

605
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,700
perspective but I'm also talking from a

606
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:24,859
personal one because I'm right now a

607
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,480
guide I'm a guide in training for this

608
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:27,979
association nature force therapy so I

609
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,269
went through an eight day course and I'm

610
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,669
in my sixth month practicum right now

611
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:33,319
and I'm actually leading a walk a two

612
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:35,570
and a half walk our walk today

613
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:38,319
there's a standard set of principles and

614
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:42,138
values for all of us who are guides

615
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:43,908
there are over 600 guides this might be

616
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:44,898
a little outdated it's on their website

617
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:47,600
and I was trying to get you a more

618
00:23:44,898 --> 00:23:49,339
recent number I've in communication with

619
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,750
the with the two directors I think it's

620
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:52,519
closer to a thousand guys right now

621
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,038
around the world a majority of them are

622
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:56,359
going to be in the US Europe Australia

623
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,538
those countries but they are in

624
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:03,398
sprinting around around the world and

625
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:05,480
the idea really is that when you are

626
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:07,189
taking this science because there's a

627
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,490
lot of science now you know what do you

628
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:14,929
do with it and the role of the guide is

629
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:16,759
to you know create a safe place to use a

630
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:20,210
standard sequence

631
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:23,930
so it's not random what we do in that

632
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:25,610
sense and we start off with something

633
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,320
that we call we've got we do these

634
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:30,829
things called invitation so we invite

635
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:32,809
you to open your senses and wherever

636
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:35,689
that nature you know that place might be

637
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:36,950
and it really engage your senses and by

638
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,590
virtue of doing that

639
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,850
clearly there are physical outcomes that

640
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:42,769
come from that there are mental health

641
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:44,299
outcomes that come from that but in

642
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:46,250
addition to that in my own personal

643
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:48,710
experience there's also this relational

644
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:51,410
thing that happens so you start to from

645
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,960
a relationship with nature which i think

646
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:56,500
is also probably part of what's

647
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,569
happening in terms of our getting better

648
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,910
there's a concept in na na and ft an

649
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:03,980
association Asian force therapy called

650
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,350
medicine and it's not the medicine that

651
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,360
I was taught necessarily but medicine

652
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:11,629
for us we defined medicine is not my

653
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:14,419
curing you but rather a reciprocal

654
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:17,870
relationship so if I'm if I'm relating

655
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:20,269
to a tree or I'm relating to of fauna

656
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:22,819
there's they're also relating back to me

657
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,650
so oh a phrase that's often used is the

658
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:28,069
more than human world what's out there

659
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,690
and how do we relate to it a little

660
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:32,569
woowoo for some people when you first

661
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,039
hear about it it's ok I was one of my

662
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:35,299
edges when I first started like I don't

663
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,279
know I'm a doctor I don't like to do

664
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:38,629
this you know I write prescriptions but

665
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,910
I've really taken to it and I think

666
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,080
there's a lot of value in this and just

667
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,509
even being in the Botanic Gardens today

668
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:47,419
being walking alone gorges going to a

669
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:49,160
state park yesterday just being here on

670
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,580
this campus there's a lot that could

671
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:55,220
happen I think here on the campus that

672
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:56,779
might be done through this means pretty

673
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:01,700
amazing stuff that happens through this

674
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:03,500
association David I know all the

675
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,930
founders yep of all these really so

676
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,509
going back that Amos Clifford is the

677
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:10,850
person who started this David Sanger is

678
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:12,200
a cardiologist based in Ohio he started

679
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:14,299
an organization that's now international

680
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,920
called walk with a doc this is probably

681
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:17,450
a little more out in the you know

682
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,310
popular culture anybody heard of walk

683
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:25,519
with the dog huh that's not yet okay

684
00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:28,730
very simple idea right so yeah walk with

685
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,210
a doc it doesn't get too much deeper

686
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,769
than that

687
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,620
so David got frustrated

688
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:35,269
many years ago about you know patients

689
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:36,349
not doing so well there's a branch of

690
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:38,539
Cardiology called preventive cardiology

691
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:39,829
he doesn't just do that but you know if

692
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:42,109
I have a patient who's morbidly obese

693
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:44,389
and whatever is not working I sometimes

694
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:46,429
will refer to a preventive cardiologist

695
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,480
to see what can be done on their end as

696
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:50,360
well

697
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,920
so he suggested on some Saturday listen

698
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,639
and to all I don't know how he did this

699
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,080
but he must have sent out a

700
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,000
communication to all his patients I'm

701
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,079
gonna be at this park on Saturday if you

702
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,089
want to join me a gentleman I'm going

703
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:02,000
for a walk a hundred of his patients

704
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:03,679
showed up there is a first there's an

705
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,049
appetite for this much more than we

706
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,700
think and to walk with your doctor is

707
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:09,859
pretty cool because usually have to go

708
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,370
there office you have to pay insurance

709
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:17,059
and whatnot so a really neat idea it's

710
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:19,279
taken taken taken root and often I've

711
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:21,950
I've been on these walks before myself

712
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,779
they're great walks and usually as a

713
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,940
brief presentation before the walk and

714
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:28,369
it's usually done you know outdoors but

715
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,890
it can't be done indoors and questions

716
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:33,439
and and and the conversation happens as

717
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,060
you walk and the one I went on was Poe

718
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,740
about an hour and a half or so we did it

719
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:42,619
at the u.s. Arboretum there's over 500

720
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,930
chapters worldwide and you can see here

721
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,429
how fast it's growing from 14 to 18 the

722
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:49,549
number of walks and then the walker

723
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:51,590
visits per year so it is working I don't

724
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:52,879
have all of their data and but I

725
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:55,250
encourage you to visit the website and

726
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,860
learn more about them there is Cornell

727
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:59,900
health here there's a city here so I

728
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:01,309
mean there are doctors here doesn't have

729
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,930
to be a doctor now it's really been

730
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:05,839
there are nurse practitioners or other

731
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,130
types of specialists who are and gotten

732
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,309
and health practitioners who are doing

733
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:14,000
this as well

734
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:18,079
Jason euros runs walk sorry walk runs

735
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,049
track trails kids and parks and also a

736
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:23,299
very very wonderful program the idea

737
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:25,039
here is that this was really started

738
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:26,779
primarily focused on children although

739
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,389
now I understand it's also fitting

740
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:32,589
adults but the idea is that we can get

741
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:35,300
if we can get people out to trails and

742
00:28:32,589 --> 00:28:38,720
the initially partnered with

743
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:41,089
pediatricians offices it started and in

744
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,650
North Carolina they had some funding

745
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:43,879
from the Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation

746
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,420
the National Park Service and Blue Cross

747
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,300
Blue Shield

748
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:49,190
and the idea was to connect people with

749
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:50,930
these trails by virtue of the

750
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,509
pediatricians offices so they would put

751
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,980
up the the information about what can

752
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:56,690
happen how you can get connected to

753
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,130
these trails on the trails they're

754
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,600
keeping you engaged so they have

755
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:02,710
activities you can do actually on the

756
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:05,539
trails from biking hiking geocaching

757
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:07,309
paddling I remember way back they were

758
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:09,680
doing the disc golf as well so it's

759
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:12,379
keeping folks engaged there's also sort

760
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,580
of this treasure hunt sort of a thing so

761
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,310
when you're going I've gone on these

762
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:18,829
myself as well we have several in the DC

763
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:22,279
area and what they do is they partner

764
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:24,230
with Parks Park agencies national parks

765
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:25,549
state parks and municipal parks who

766
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,019
already have the trails so they're not

767
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:29,029
building trails they're partnering with

768
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:30,950
those agencies and they'll put up some

769
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:32,569
of the signage and allow the activities

770
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:35,509
to happen on those trails and they're

771
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:37,339
tracking the steps and the numbers of

772
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:39,349
times these kids are actually doing this

773
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:44,539
so they have fantastic data that this

774
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:47,299
actually works the last one is is my

775
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:50,029
organization Parker X America we started

776
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:52,730
out in DC we call we called ourselves DC

777
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:54,980
Parker X we had initially 20 parts

778
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:57,110
around the health center where I work

779
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:00,650
that were in a platform for us to

780
00:29:57,109 --> 00:30:04,219
prescribe we now have over 7,000 parks

781
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:06,320
in our in our platform we are not a

782
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,360
program parker x america is really a

783
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:11,960
platform meaning that you could take

784
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:13,490
this idea of prescribing to any place in

785
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,740
the world where you would find some

786
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:18,069
accessible green space some burden of

787
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:20,210
chronic disease and a willingness to

788
00:30:18,069 --> 00:30:22,519
prescribe those really the three

789
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:25,850
important ingredients we are a

790
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:28,220
non-profit the main goal our main

791
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:30,349
mission really is to educate educate

792
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:33,200
educate health professionals provide

793
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:35,139
them with a tool a platform for them to

794
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,850
actually prescribe to their patients

795
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:41,450
it's free so we don't charge anything

796
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:43,009
for it and the prescription itself is

797
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,809
something that I've struggled with for

798
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:46,250
years you think how would I swat what I

799
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:48,379
struggle with a prescription I'm a

800
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:51,200
doctor but what I mean by that is the

801
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,970
park prescription now clearly you know

802
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,009
if I were to prescribe an antibiotic or

803
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,799
some medication to you I wouldn't say to

804
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:58,369
you dr. ray cow take any antibiotic you

805
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,049
like for us

806
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:01,819
often as you like whatever dose you like

807
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:05,119
with with or without food and I'll see

808
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:06,679
you back whenever great it's a 10-day

809
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,449
course it's twice a day it's 500

810
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,250
milligrams or it's a liquid for child

811
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,620
it's palatable you know you with food

812
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:14,839
avoid the Sun you give somebody some

813
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:17,149
specific instructions that makes up the

814
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:19,399
prescription so I really ran with this

815
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:21,410
and I said you know what let's just do

816
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,480
this for the park prescription because I

817
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:25,160
was finding that all these incredible

818
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,769
program these parkour programs around

819
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:30,529
the country were kind of loosey-goosey

820
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:32,779
about the prescription and I wanted to I

821
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:35,779
don't think that's gonna work and so

822
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:37,700
what I wanted to do a trial on was let's

823
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:40,160
make it specific so the park

824
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,019
prescription that we do on our platform

825
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,480
is very specific it has to have a park

826
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:46,819
or place right it has to have an

827
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,140
activity now the activity could be you

828
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:49,519
can imagine a lot of different things

829
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,190
right

830
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,990
it could be stargazing it could be

831
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,610
forest bathing it could be playing

832
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:58,400
tennis we're taking your dog for a walk

833
00:31:55,609 --> 00:32:00,649
you know things that your patients tell

834
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,630
you about what they want to do what they

835
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:04,070
like to do the place is important

836
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,450
because I want them to tell me where

837
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:08,539
they feel comfortable where they feel

838
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:10,308
safe where as close to them so those are

839
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:13,069
the first two the second two things are

840
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:14,869
the frequency and the duration I need to

841
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:16,970
know how long they're willing to commit

842
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:20,209
to this activity when they do it and how

843
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:23,990
many times per week bingo now I've got

844
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:26,329
it my time is almost up or it's up so

845
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,349
this is how I define the park

846
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:29,299
prescription it's not how the world

847
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:30,589
defines it I would like the world to

848
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:32,539
define it this way but we're not there

849
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:34,189
yet so I'm really pushing for this I

850
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:35,480
think it's important to standardize and

851
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,890
harmonize who we can research and

852
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,569
evaluate and study and make it

853
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,050
clinically effective for all of us to do

854
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:44,210
it the same way within those parameters

855
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:46,460
it's electronic so I send my patient a

856
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,410
text or an email they get it and they

857
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,269
respond every time they go so when I see

858
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,320
them at the follow-up visit I know how

859
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:53,660
many times they filled the prescription

860
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:55,220
I don't know that about antibiotics I do

861
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,140
know that about the Parc prescription so

862
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,390
when I walk in I have knowledge and I'm

863
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,160
holding them to that contract as well we

864
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,860
have over 500 per scribers around the

865
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,420
world mostly in the u.s. right now we've

866
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:08,569
made a lot of prescriptions and we've

867
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:10,880
had a lot filled don't be discouraged

868
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,409
what's happening I have found there's a

869
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,660
lot of these 500-plus

870
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,519
are doing it their way and I'm

871
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,560
encouraging them to do it our way

872
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:20,329
so it's more clinically relevant to them

873
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,460
to their patients more effective and so

874
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:25,129
I can have the data with that I'm going

875
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:33,259
to pass it on to dr. ray Cao thank you

876
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:36,470
so much well thank you doctors are for

877
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:40,400
sharing so much meaningful and really

878
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:44,210
inspiring information with us what I'd

879
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:47,840
like to do is build from the remarks

880
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:51,110
that doctors are shared with us and talk

881
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:55,069
about a specific program that we have

882
00:33:51,109 --> 00:34:01,579
here at Cornell called nature rx at

883
00:33:55,069 --> 00:34:04,029
Cornell so many of you are graduate

884
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:07,129
students some of you are undergraduate

885
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:10,579
students and the first thing I'd like to

886
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:15,640
share is that college should be a time

887
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:19,639
of learning for exploration for

888
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:24,409
developing new skills and for fun

889
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:27,949
College should be fun but for so many

890
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:31,960
students college and university life is

891
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:35,418
filled with mental and physical and

892
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:39,500
performance related problems you know

893
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:42,918
the latest 2018 National Collegiate

894
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:47,239
health assessment just came out they

895
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:49,579
survey nearly 28,000 students on 44

896
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:53,389
campuses and here are some of the

897
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:57,650
findings from that large assessment in

898
00:34:53,389 --> 00:35:01,819
the previous 12 months 20% of students

899
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:06,349
felt that things were hopeless 20% of

900
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:09,230
students felt very lonely 17% of

901
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:13,630
students felt so depressed that it was

902
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:16,670
difficult to function and 18% felt

903
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:21,920
overwhelming anxiety or overwhelming

904
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:24,530
anger and nearly 7% indicated that they

905
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,150
had considered suicide these are

906
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:30,920
staggering and

907
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:33,289
very disturbing statistics so based on

908
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:37,068
all the doctors are just shared with

909
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:39,470
with us we know that there is a body of

910
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:42,710
scientific evidence that clearly

911
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:45,578
indicates that spending time in nature

912
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:51,260
is beneficial to us physically

913
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:54,890
physiologically behaviorally so our

914
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:58,520
challenge is how do we convince students

915
00:35:54,889 --> 00:36:02,480
here at Cornell and at other campuses to

916
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:04,670
actually spend intentional time out in

917
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,619
nature and the reason I include that

918
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:13,690
word intentional is that I've done some

919
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:17,750
very unscientific preliminary

920
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:20,289
investigating by standing on one end of

921
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:23,568
the trip hammer bridge and watched

922
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:25,430
students crossing over that bridge in

923
00:36:23,568 --> 00:36:29,808
the morning on their way to class and

924
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:32,259
90% of them are looking at their iPhones

925
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:35,569
they're not aware of the fact that this

926
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:38,630
spectacularly beautiful Beebe Lake and

927
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:42,528
trip hammer Falls are right there so to

928
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:46,990
me those are unintentional experiences

929
00:36:42,528 --> 00:36:50,929
in nature so a number of years ago

930
00:36:46,989 --> 00:36:52,338
several colleagues and I David cutter

931
00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:55,278
being one of them

932
00:36:52,338 --> 00:36:59,000
were on a coffee break during some

933
00:36:55,278 --> 00:37:01,900
Cornell conference and we started to

934
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,309
think about the fact that Cornell has

935
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:08,869
truly one of the most beautiful campuses

936
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:12,798
in America but that we also have one of

937
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:16,220
the highest percentages in our student

938
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:19,278
body of students suffering from mental

939
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:22,669
health problems so we thought couldn't

940
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:24,980
there be some way of better utilizing

941
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:28,420
all of that natural beauty and

942
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:31,608
horticultural beauty as a way of

943
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:34,608
contributing to the well-being of our

944
00:37:31,608 --> 00:37:39,469
students and that really was the genesis

945
00:37:34,608 --> 00:37:40,139
of nature rx at Cornell so there are

946
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:43,469
five

947
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:46,739
components of nature Rx and i'd like to

948
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:50,819
speak about each of these individually a

949
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:55,079
nature prescription program a nature rx

950
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:58,519
website nature rx class that doctors are

951
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:02,610
and I are about to go off to a nature

952
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:06,150
Ipoh stirring and finally a student

953
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:08,400
nature rx Club and I'm glad to see we

954
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,500
have some of the officers of the club

955
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,340
here

956
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:16,980
so first the nature prescriptions as

957
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,920
doctors are mentioned this program

958
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:25,050
started at Cornell Health a couple of

959
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:27,990
years ago and at that time we were

960
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:31,019
working with a relatively small number

961
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:34,199
of health professionals at Cornell

962
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:37,759
health but we had convinced these health

963
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:42,899
professionals to hand out a paper

964
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:46,050
prescription as part of the therapy or

965
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:49,430
treatment recommended for students who

966
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:53,030
were suffering from depression anxiety

967
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:57,179
high levels of stress obesity

968
00:38:53,030 --> 00:39:01,620
self-cutting suicidal ideation any of

969
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:04,139
those complexes and it said take a walk

970
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:07,199
or run around Beebe Lake rest on the

971
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:09,929
slope enjoy a sunset and spend twenty

972
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,960
minutes two to three times a week

973
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:14,879
well some students actually paid

974
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,250
attention to this we think that many

975
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:22,730
students did not so in this previous

976
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:27,119
academic year we actually were able to

977
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:29,909
integrate the nature prescription into

978
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,940
the electronic health record and it's

979
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:37,500
very hard for you to see from there but

980
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:42,179
you can see it says nature rx discussed

981
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:46,460
and recommended so now in this previous

982
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:50,099
academic year over 700 students were

983
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:53,550
recommended time in nature by more than

984
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:58,139
two dozen health professionals at

985
00:39:53,550 --> 00:40:01,289
now health before I move on to that a

986
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:04,289
new development that is about to start

987
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:09,059
which we are particularly excited about

988
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:13,279
is that this year Cornell Health has

989
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:17,159
developed a method to confidentially an

990
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:20,460
anonymously survey all of the students

991
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:24,420
getting prescribed nature so that we'll

992
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:27,119
be able to assess things like did they

993
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:30,409
in fact follow the prescription how

994
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:34,710
frequently are they going out in nature

995
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:38,159
where are they going out in nature is it

996
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:42,960
reducing their stress level so we'll

997
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:48,109
have an actual body of information about

998
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:52,470
Cornell students being prescribed nature

999
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:57,269
another component of the program is our

1000
00:40:52,469 --> 00:41:00,119
nature rx website on nature Rx cornell

1001
00:40:57,269 --> 00:41:02,429
dot edu don't look it up right now

1002
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:08,309
listen to me but do look it up right

1003
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:12,719
after the seminar so the idea behind the

1004
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:15,989
website is we wanted students we do want

1005
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:18,719
students to get over the mindset of oh

1006
00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:21,479
yeah you know I've heard nature is good

1007
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:24,059
for me but I don't have an hour to

1008
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,969
devote for that I have to get to class I

1009
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:32,039
have to go to lab I have to write papers

1010
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:36,169
so through this website we profile 15

1011
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:39,779
natural and landscape sites around

1012
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:44,900
campus many of them managed by Cornell

1013
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:48,300
Botanic Gardens and we provide GPS based

1014
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:51,240
walking directions on how to get from

1015
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:55,440
wherever you are right now to the

1016
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:59,189
nearest Nature rx site typically five

1017
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,740
minutes or less of walking time to get

1018
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:03,240
to that site so you don't have an hour

1019
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:07,259
that's fine

1020
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:09,869
take 15 minutes to walk to this site

1021
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:15,840
and a little time there and then walk to

1022
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:20,759
your next assignment a third element is

1023
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:25,019
our nature rx class we piloted this

1024
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,930
class last fall and based on the success

1025
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:33,929
of it we have now made it a regular part

1026
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:37,799
of the curriculum PL sei 1125 it's also

1027
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:41,149
part of engaged learning where you live

1028
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:44,760
at Cornell so its intended to appeal

1029
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:47,670
particularly to first-year students at

1030
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:51,830
North Campus and second year students

1031
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:55,680
and we're very grateful that engaged

1032
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:59,309
Cornell is providing funding for the

1033
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:02,429
class so we have 18 students enrolled in

1034
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:06,630
the course this fall and as doctors are

1035
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:11,039
just explained we're about to or he is

1036
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:16,260
about to take them on a to our nature

1037
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:19,230
therapy experience and walk so in the

1038
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:21,750
class last year as part of the

1039
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:25,679
curriculum I asked the students to

1040
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:28,079
develop a relationship with a spot on

1041
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:32,759
campus in which they would feel

1042
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:36,420
particularly safe and calm and I had

1043
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:39,780
them write critical reflections about

1044
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:42,900
their special spot but one week I said

1045
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:47,519
your assignment for next week is to

1046
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:52,559
develop a non written reflection on your

1047
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:56,699
spot of peace and calm so some students

1048
00:43:52,559 --> 00:44:01,920
did art pieces that were reflections of

1049
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:04,769
their special spot one student who what

1050
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,980
is a freshman so was here for the very

1051
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:11,820
first time had come from South Florida

1052
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:17,610
and had never experienced autumn before

1053
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:20,849
so she played the full component of the

1054
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:23,960
Valdez four seasons as her way

1055
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:29,338
of showing her appreciation for

1056
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:33,329
experiencing fall a fourth component of

1057
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:37,259
nature rx at Cornell we don't want just

1058
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:41,039
the students who are experiencing mental

1059
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:43,829
health problems and going to Cornell

1060
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:48,119
health to know about and take advantage

1061
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:51,239
of nature rx and just the students who

1062
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:54,298
are enrolled in our nature rx class we

1063
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:56,728
want all students to be aware of this so

1064
00:44:54,298 --> 00:44:59,278
working with the communications team at

1065
00:44:56,728 --> 00:45:02,098
Cornell Health we have developed this

1066
00:44:59,278 --> 00:45:04,710
series of Ipoh stirrers you may have

1067
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:08,068
seen them in the foyer of the plant

1068
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:11,728
science building and they say such

1069
00:45:08,068 --> 00:45:16,308
things as did you know that time spent

1070
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:20,518
in nature can improve your exam scores

1071
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:25,048
improve your social life improve your

1072
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:28,318
sleep patterns and reduce overall stress

1073
00:45:25,048 --> 00:45:33,349
levels and for each of these we cite

1074
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:37,650
papers that have verified that benefit

1075
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:40,710
finally we have a nature rx Club made up

1076
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:44,039
of both undergraduate students and grad

1077
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:47,460
students and the club is just forming

1078
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:51,769
for this academic year and they are

1079
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:56,009
planning a series of walks in nature

1080
00:45:51,768 --> 00:45:58,728
experiences in nature presentations by

1081
00:45:56,009 --> 00:46:03,028
people related to this field and

1082
00:45:58,728 --> 00:46:06,659
hopefully that nature rx Club is going

1083
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:14,778
to expand and engage more and more

1084
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:17,728
students also I recently wrote and or

1085
00:46:14,778 --> 00:46:22,318
co-authored and published a book with

1086
00:46:17,728 --> 00:46:29,509
dr. Gregory eels who until recently was

1087
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:32,909
the director of our counseling and and

1088
00:46:29,509 --> 00:46:34,099
psychiatric services division of Cornell

1089
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:37,549
health

1090
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:40,759
it is called nature rx improving college

1091
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:45,380
student mental health and in that book

1092
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:49,010
we provide an overview of the kinds of

1093
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:53,140
mental health challenges students are

1094
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:57,530
facing today we also provide a stepwise

1095
00:46:53,139 --> 00:47:00,759
process for developing a nature rx

1096
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:06,110
program on your campus and we talk about

1097
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:09,340
the role of nature rx programs in the

1098
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:14,390
context of the future of the American

1099
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:19,730
University the final thing I'll mention

1100
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:25,639
is that the nature rx program here at

1101
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:28,969
Cornell is just one of several nature rx

1102
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:32,750
programs on American campuses in our

1103
00:47:28,969 --> 00:47:35,899
book we profiled the programs at Cornell

1104
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:38,690
but also at three other campuses UC

1105
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:43,940
Davis University of Minnesota and

1106
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:47,929
College of William &amp; Mary from that core

1107
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:50,030
of four colleges and universities we

1108
00:47:47,929 --> 00:47:56,449
have just this year

1109
00:47:50,030 --> 00:48:01,730
developed a nature rx campus network and

1110
00:47:56,449 --> 00:48:08,029
the network members are all over the US

1111
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:11,090
and just starting to be in Canada also

1112
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:14,420
and its large universities small

1113
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:18,980
universities colleges geographically

1114
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:23,630
diverse and as the coordinator of the

1115
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:27,289
campus on nature rx network I send a

1116
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:30,680
weekly e-newsletter to the members in

1117
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:34,670
which the best practices at individual

1118
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:38,539
campuses are described opportunities for

1119
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:41,269
collaboration are brought out a recent

1120
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:47,779
literature that is pertinent to our

1121
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:51,050
field is cited and a subgroup of

1122
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:55,430
network members are now working on

1123
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:58,789
developing a virtual symposium for

1124
00:48:55,429 --> 00:49:01,960
campuses for next spring in which we're

1125
00:48:58,789 --> 00:49:08,809
hoping to involve a hundred or more

1126
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:14,090
campuses around North America so there's

1127
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:18,949
no doubt that we live in a very tense

1128
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:23,539
and stress filled world we live in a

1129
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:27,279
world with unfortunate but tremendous

1130
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:31,489
examples of environmental degradation

1131
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:35,870
but we also live in a world where there

1132
00:49:31,489 --> 00:49:39,409
are programs like Park rx America like

1133
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:41,529
our campus nature rx movement that

1134
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:45,589
really gives us hope for the future

1135
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:47,990
because they recognize the human

1136
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:51,230
benefits of time in nature and they

1137
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:54,199
provide mechanisms for people to spend

1138
00:49:51,230 --> 00:50:03,170
that time so thank you very much on

1139
00:49:54,199 --> 00:50:05,210
behalf of doctors our and myself and I

1140
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:08,260
would like to say that we have time for

1141
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:12,530
questions I think we can take maybe two

1142
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:15,830
and then we actually have to go off to

1143
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:21,410
the nature rx class so if there are a

1144
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:24,349
couple of questions David talks and

1145
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:32,509
programs and I particularly like the

1146
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:34,429
father-son matching shirt getting access

1147
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:37,810
to green spaces in different

1148
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:41,989
environments is to create smallish

1149
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:44,929
horticultural gardens as anybody looked

1150
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:47,239
at the difference between visiting a

1151
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:50,119
small horticultural garden versus

1152
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:54,609
getting out and I in our bigger nature

1153
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:57,019
place with big trees I can address that

1154
00:50:54,610 --> 00:51:00,019
so there have been a number of studies

1155
00:50:57,019 --> 00:51:01,460
that have looked at the human health

1156
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:04,519
benefits of spending

1157
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:08,630
time in a botanical garden those studies

1158
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:12,550
have not quantified size of garden and

1159
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:16,010
related that to impact but one study

1160
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:19,519
that looked at four different botanic

1161
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:21,589
gardens in Florida found that the

1162
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:25,309
experience of walking through the garden

1163
00:51:21,588 --> 00:51:29,599
was particularly impactful for that

1164
00:51:25,309 --> 00:51:32,269
cohort that had self-identified before

1165
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:35,780
the visit as having very high stress

1166
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:38,530
levels so we know that spending time in

1167
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:43,940
a botanic garden can reduce stress and

1168
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:46,820
cortisol levels and blood pressure so it

1169
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:51,619
does not I'm fond of saying it doesn't

1170
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:57,740
have to involve the forest primeval one

1171
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:59,358
more question anyone yes Ken the most of

1172
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:01,759
the experiment most of the studies you

1173
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:05,119
cited or fairly structured and long in

1174
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,970
prescription but what about a more

1175
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:13,660
natural experiment for example if as as

1176
00:52:07,969 --> 00:52:17,629
you know opportunity state parks or jism

1177
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:19,519
if you if you take a large random sample

1178
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:22,480
there are eight people you know not

1179
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:31,309
doing it destructively but - I see -

1180
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:33,409
those people yeah so just a quick thank

1181
00:52:31,309 --> 00:52:35,179
you for the question and the question is

1182
00:52:33,409 --> 00:52:37,279
you know in terms of the studies that I

1183
00:52:35,179 --> 00:52:39,169
was going through and just to be maybe I

1184
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,810
was I'm just a quickly you know

1185
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:44,358
clarification on the vast majority of

1186
00:52:41,809 --> 00:52:47,119
the research is actually not on the park

1187
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:49,219
prescription the vast majority of the

1188
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,440
research it has to do with the things

1189
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:54,829
that you just mentioned is just people

1190
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:58,338
being in green space living near green

1191
00:52:54,829 --> 00:53:02,210
space having access to green space group

1192
00:52:58,338 --> 00:53:05,000
outings things of that nature

1193
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:09,500
the and the literature is is pretty

1194
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:12,829
convincing that being in the in or near

1195
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:14,719
these green areas has a substantial

1196
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:15,500
health effect and I went through a lot

1197
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:18,980
of those with

1198
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:20,239
with all of you in fact the opposite is

1199
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,190
true with the studies that we have a

1200
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:25,429
paucity of studies that are more

1201
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:28,610
clinically focused and and on that note

1202
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:30,889
you know I I'll be partnering I am

1203
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:33,380
partner actually now already with RAND

1204
00:53:30,889 --> 00:53:37,699
Corporation Deb Cowan and we're going to

1205
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:40,340
be doing a randomized trial funded by

1206
00:53:37,699 --> 00:53:42,559
the NIH it's a five-year trial and we're

1207
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,170
going to look at the more clinical side

1208
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,900
of things we're going to be looking at

1209
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:49,280
the accelerometry so you know whether

1210
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,990
it's moderate to vigorous physical

1211
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,790
activity as a result of prescription

1212
00:53:50,989 --> 00:53:54,829
we're gonna be looking at some diabetes

1213
00:53:52,789 --> 00:53:57,500
measures cholesterol triglycerides and

1214
00:53:54,829 --> 00:53:59,509
ADHD so we're going to be looking at

1215
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,519
those but there as I mentioned earlier

1216
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:05,870
there's really just a handful of studies

1217
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:08,480
that are clinical studies but you know

1218
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:13,369
despite having so few clinical studies

1219
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:17,360
I'm very convinced with the science that

1220
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:21,529
being in nature has measurable and many

1221
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:24,890
positive effects on human health so I

1222
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:29,000
would love to have a stay and answer

1223
00:54:24,889 --> 00:54:32,089
further questions but class time beckons

1224
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,010
for us and probably for many of you so

1225
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:36,590
thank you for your attention this

1226
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:41,810
afternoon and we will see you again next

1227
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:45,530
Monday this has been a production of

1228
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:48,250
Cornell University on the web at Cornell

1229
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:48,250
