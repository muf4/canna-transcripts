1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,530
thank you yes I'm going to talk to you

4
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:15,929
today a little bit about development of

5
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:17,910
a frost Hardy Mays variety and a lot

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,219
about assembling a trip scum genome so

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:25,469
that we can frost tolerance in trips to

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:27,838
come remote here okay so just to

9
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:29,549
motivate the project plants with longer

10
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:31,410
growing seasons accumulate more biomass

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,509
we're looking at light capture

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,600
efficiency and Miscanthus and names in

13
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:39,449
side-by-side replicated field trials and

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,520
we see that Miscanthus due to emerging

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,190
earlier and finessing later in the

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,530
season is able to maximize folio canopy

17
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,709
cover throughout the growing season and

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,469
essentially do more photosynthesis

19
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:56,939
resulting in 59% greater productivity so

20
00:00:52,469 --> 00:01:00,799
can we emulate this in maize alright so

21
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:05,188
this is just a zoom in of the corn belts

22
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:06,599
we're looking at NDVI in averaged over a

23
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:10,829
two week window at the end of four

24
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:16,949
months so as I cycle through here we can

25
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:18,359
see the greenness and lasers yeah

26
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,799
greenness in this kind of area right

27
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:20,969
here right in the Corn Belt doesn't

28
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,119
really kick in until the end of July

29
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,049
which is after the summer solstice so

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,900
basically half of our growing season is

31
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,039
gone the for maize really gets kicking

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,810
now if we could develop a cold tolerant

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,690
maize variety it could potentially

34
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,670
overwinter in the southeastern US down

35
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,200
here it could be sown earlier in the

36
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,750
corn belts and it's been growing season

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,370
potentially getting its its canopy out

38
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,799
earlier and making better use of the

39
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,840
growing season and also potentially be

40
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:51,090
grown further north potentially as a

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,978
spring crop Oh in order to study

42
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,420
freezing tolerance and potentially

43
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:55,859
identify traits to move over to maize

44
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,719
we're looking at this species called

45
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:58,739
trips to come I'm realizing just now

46
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,239
that I don't have a nice picture of

47
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:02,399
trips come here I have some pictures of

48
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,618
sad trips to come a little bit later so

49
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,118
just bear with me it's a big bushy grass

50
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:09,239
but at the seedling stage it looks a lot

51
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:11,489
like maize so trips to come over winters

52
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,780
and temperate climates there's two main

53
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:14,759
species that are endemic to North

54
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,799
America trips come dr. Luiz and trips

55
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,968
come Florida on them it's their

56
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:20,409
distributions down on the bottom right

57
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:23,099
hand side of the pot here

58
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:26,939
trying to stand right in front of that

59
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,840
yeah so it this is a great degree of

60
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,719
natural variation for freezing tolerance

61
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,520
which exceeds that of nays it's very

62
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,650
closely related to maize having diverged

63
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,090
around 1.2 million years ago and it

64
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,700
shares the whole genome duplication

65
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,620
event things there even cross-compatible

66
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:45,280
although it's very tricky to get a

67
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,539
viable cross out of the two and it

68
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,039
hasn't undergone and domestication

69
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:51,009
bottleneck although I'll point out the

70
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:52,090
trips come floor Dhanam is isolated so

71
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:53,709
basically the southern tip of Florida

72
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,759
the whole states highlighted here but

73
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,219
really it's just found in a few counties

74
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,780
down in the southern tip that population

75
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:02,859
actually did undergo not a domestication

76
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,830
bottleneck but we expect that the

77
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,840
hypothesis is the last ice age

78
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:11,790
essentially it was it was trapped in a

79
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,960
refugium southern florida there and so

80
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:15,699
we expected have a much smaller

81
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,290
effective population size than trips

82
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:18,969
compact deloitte ease which is found

83
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:23,199
from North America all the way through

84
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:25,680
Central America and down into the South

85
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:30,459
America Peru there aren't natural

86
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,840
populations so just to talk a little bit

87
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,330
about the mapping population here this

88
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,090
is largely the work of Christy gulfs and

89
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,240
Nick lepak Christy Gaal was a former

90
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,789
postdoc and Butler lab essentially we

91
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,170
had a number of trips come dr. Loy days

92
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:46,659
and trips come floor dhanam collections

93
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:48,789
that were made by denise Kostich who was

94
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:50,979
our former lab manager and a series of

95
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:53,859
crosses were made between northern

96
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:56,229
varieties trips combat Deloitte ease and

97
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,410
then trips from Florida gnam these were

98
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:01,959
made reciprocally but essentially we

99
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:03,879
just picked the the f ones that were

100
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,699
viable and we selected one plant per

101
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,799
family from each viable cross we ended

102
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:11,500
up with 53 F ones that were then

103
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,330
clonally propagated as trips comes a

104
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,079
perennial you can just cut it in half

105
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:20,139
and plant the two halves and you have

106
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,449
you have a clone and then the f2 s have

107
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:24,099
been allowed I'm sorry the F ones have

108
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:25,870
been allowed to open pollinate in the

109
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,220
field through the last several years and

110
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,540
we collect the seed off of those F ones

111
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,540
and use that for our freezing screen

112
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:36,848
and we're taking a bulk segment analysis

113
00:04:33,278 --> 00:04:38,408
approach here where we subjects the f2

114
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:40,748
seed which has been germinated under

115
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:42,728
greenhouse conditions to first cold

116
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:45,969
acclamation followed by like a

117
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:48,428
essentially a hard frost at minus 8

118
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:49,899
degrees C overnight temperature slowly

119
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:51,968
ramps down and they get three hours of

120
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:54,519
hard freeze let them recover a little

121
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:57,509
bit and then we phenotype them basically

122
00:04:54,519 --> 00:05:00,129
for their maintenance of green leaf area

123
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:02,709
so you can see some sad plants in the

124
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:03,819
left and the susceptible bulk and happy

125
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:06,759
plants on the right and the tolerant

126
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:08,348
bulk so we take essentially the tails of

127
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:13,479
the phenotypic distribution we pull

128
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:16,149
tissue and then we sequence them now the

129
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:18,098
question arises what do we map them to

130
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:21,189
it is possible to map these reeds to

131
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:23,259
maize but as I said before the the

132
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:24,519
genomes while they have a lot in common

133
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:27,158
there was fundamentally different

134
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:29,050
architecture trip succumb has 18

135
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:31,808
chromosomes and a 3.5 you get based

136
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:35,199
genome while maize has a 2.3 gigabase

137
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:36,909
genome and only 10 chromosomes so that

138
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,860
motivates me to try to assemble a trip

139
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:40,978
scan genome and the technology we picked

140
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,059
was nanopore reads as I mentioned the

141
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:45,699
trips command maize genomes are highly

142
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:48,129
repetitive about 85 or greater percent

143
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:50,588
on repeat content so that makes short

144
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:52,959
read assembly on the challenge or at

145
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:55,689
least an expensive proposition nanopore

146
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,838
reads can reach clients of up to 200

147
00:05:55,689 --> 00:06:01,389
base 200 thousand base pairs and so it

148
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:03,069
can potentially span intergenic regions

149
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:04,360
so we're looking at on the bottom right

150
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,899
here where it says Maine's intergenic

151
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,939
regions that's a distribution of the

152
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:13,119
distance between consecutive sets of

153
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:14,439
maize genes and the b73 genome and then

154
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:16,779
the top we're looking at the

155
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:20,229
distribution of minyan reads a nicely

156
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:22,240
cover the intergenic region so this is a

157
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:24,718
technology that can potentially span

158
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,800
those gaps and allow us to assemble a

159
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:31,509
structurally complete trip scum genome

160
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,478
the drawback for nanopore reads is their

161
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:37,629
high error rate of around 15% which is

162
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,740
far worse than Illumina but fortunately

163
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,199
there are new algorithms that are

164
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,670
designed to account for this and so

165
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,460
about 30 X of

166
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,930
of long reads greater than 10 KB is what

167
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:48,459
is typically recommended for assembly

168
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,459
I'll show you the results we've gotten

169
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:53,969
using that approach so just a quick

170
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:57,339
overview of our assembly pipeline here

171
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,910
so we start with our long reads we feed

172
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:04,599
those into a software program called

173
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:06,640
wtvp g2 which is incredibly fast we

174
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,400
tried a number of other assembly

175
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,550
algorithms including canoe which is

176
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:15,639
probably more well known many sm fly and

177
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,960
the me cats and essentially what the

178
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,689
size of this data set we're talking

179
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,389
about 100 Giga bases of reads or a 200

180
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:24,910
gigabyte Q bytes worth of files the

181
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,349
memory requirements for overlapping all

182
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,610
of the reads against each other were

183
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,129
prohibitive so none of the other

184
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:34,240
approaches worked WT dbg to not only

185
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:37,930
worked but it worked quickly so out from

186
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,710
WT BBG we get raw contig so just sort of

187
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,120
draft still high error rate context and

188
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:45,729
what we do is we take the long reads we

189
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,649
map them back to those contexts and we

190
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,210
use a program called rake on to

191
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:50,679
essentially call consensus in companies

192
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:52,919
that improves the accuracy can we do

193
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,329
this iteratively one to three times

194
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,240
while the accuracy continues to improve

195
00:07:55,329 --> 00:08:00,339
I'll talk in a moment about how we

196
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,350
benchmark that accuracy and the final

197
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:05,199
step is to throw some short reads on top

198
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:09,240
again those short Illumina low error

199
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:12,310
rate reads and use those to you know to

200
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,949
correct the the residual base pair error

201
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,829
any base parent accuracies that remain

202
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:19,899
in the rake on corrected assembly and

203
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:22,659
out from that we get corrected context

204
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:25,359
these typically are much more fragmented

205
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,560
than a chromosome scale assembly but

206
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,569
they do contain a lot of structural

207
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,299
information okay so yeah the performance

208
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:36,729
of that pipeline depends a lot on genome

209
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,519
characteristics and the input data here

210
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:42,479
is a collaboration that we did with elad

211
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,519
oren he's an outdoors group from review

212
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,730
and this is a much smaller less complex

213
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,259
genome than trips a comb or maze at 450

214
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:54,009
mega bases with far lower repeat

215
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:55,789
contents and 30x worth of long read

216
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:58,519
coverage on this is 13 and a half

217
00:08:55,789 --> 00:09:01,789
Kika basis which works out to roughly 1

218
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:04,309
min allen flow cell so that's a very

219
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:08,539
small amount of data for the Nana for by

220
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:10,429
contrast we need about 10 well 7 to 10

221
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:12,379
depending on yields of these flow cells

222
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:16,339
to get the same coverage for a genome

223
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:19,960
size of maze right so the resource usage

224
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:23,740
in terms of compute time is minimal on a

225
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:27,650
medium memory cbsyou high-performance

226
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:30,590
computer computing server

227
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:32,659
it took about 500 CPU hours but just in

228
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:36,500
terms of wall clock time this ran in

229
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:40,009
about a day and the assembly size was

230
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:44,360
about 85% of what was expected and the

231
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:46,340
when aligning this assembly to the QQ

232
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,840
most mellow reference we can see that

233
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,060
it's generally collinear

234
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,280
there's a little bit of off diagonal but

235
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:54,589
it aligns very well tiles most of the

236
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:57,379
assembly and then down here on the right

237
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,030
we're looking at a boo scope plot and

238
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,710
what this is busca stands for

239
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,720
benchmarking the universal single copy

240
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,450
orthologs but it's it's just telling you

241
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,240
how many of the single copy genes that

242
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,330
are conserved within the embryo phyto

243
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,370
seed plants are present and correctly

244
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,220
assembled within your assembly so we can

245
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,330
see that for the reference genome versus

246
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,769
the Polish assembly they have very

247
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,480
similar numbers we're just looking at

248
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:23,870
the size of the blue bar versus the red

249
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,509
bar so it looks very good there now

250
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,700
maize p39 and trips can floor Donham

251
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:31,309
these are two assemblies that I've been

252
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:34,400
working on maize p39 more as a test case

253
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:37,519
because it's inbred and we have a closer

254
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,409
reference in p73 the compute time is

255
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,649
substantially longer but the clock time

256
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:44,990
is again only one to two days so we're

257
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:47,419
really talking about very rapid genome

258
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,950
assembly here and the contiguity we get

259
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:50,659
out of these is not quite as good as we

260
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,590
get with the smaller less repetitive

261
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:56,360
genome we are getting four hundred

262
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:59,300
kilobases worth of context or four

263
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,560
hundred kilobases and 50 so that's

264
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:04,579
saying half of our assemblies and

265
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:06,109
context that size or larger ok so again

266
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,330
another boost go plot we're looking at

267
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,959
these two assemblies maize p39 and trip

268
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,860
scum florid on them

269
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,629
and we're just looking at the

270
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,089
improvement of the busca score as we

271
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:19,110
iteratively polish with Ray Khan and we

272
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:21,660
can see that the assembly doesn't much

273
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,129
improve with repeated rounds of break on

274
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:26,429
but once we throw the short reads on

275
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:28,528
there with a pylon we get close to to

276
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:32,159
the reference completeness and the same

277
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:35,009
is true for trips come flora Dunham now

278
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,899
here is some work that bashing song my

279
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:40,318
colleague postdoc in the buffer lab did

280
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:43,230
he designed an alternative to boosts go

281
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:46,439
called Tabasco or basically take a wider

282
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:48,000
set of genes from the Andrew begonias so

283
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,130
more specific to maze and trip succumb

284
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,318
and we align them at the nucleotide

285
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:54,568
level rather than at the protein level

286
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:56,729
and so it's a little bit less sensitive

287
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:59,669
to base power errors and we can see that

288
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,069
essentially of the the gene space that

289
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:05,179
is not being picked up by basco oh sorry

290
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:08,639
by Musco as completes is actually there

291
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:10,679
so even before we polish anything we do

292
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,568
have the building blocks of a complete

293
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,899
assembly so this is the way that we can

294
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:17,729
rapidly check where our assemblies are

295
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:21,269
at it helps us with tuning parameters

296
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,560
and iterating ok so then just a couple

297
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:23,639
of whole genome alignments so once we

298
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,669
have these assemblies we want to know

299
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,379
how good we did so we take our

300
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:30,000
assemblies and we align them against

301
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:31,769
some kind of reference as I showed

302
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,129
before with QQ missed Mello versus the

303
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:37,259
reference genome there so these are

304
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,539
again the maze of p39 assembly and the

305
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:42,110
trips come floor Dhanam assembly aligned

306
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:44,879
against the maze b73 that's our sort of

307
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,528
quality reference genome and we can see

308
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,299
that the the features are very similar I

309
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:50,220
think I don't have time to get into

310
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:53,219
what's going on in these little red

311
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,629
circles here essentially there's a lot

312
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,000
of duplication in the maize genome

313
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:58,588
inherently as I said before and we're

314
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,328
picking it up in both the trips to comb

315
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:01,290
and the maize assemblies so that's the

316
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:01,888
thing I might have to dig into a little

317
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:04,019
bit further

318
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:06,000
another characteristic to note is that

319
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,948
this is slightly darker red and this is

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,750
a more orange here so we have higher

321
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:12,000
percent identity in the maze assembly

322
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:16,110
against maize then the trips come in

323
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,778
assembly against maize so in summary our

324
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,438
assemblies show good of contiguity and

325
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:21,000
collinearity

326
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:22,740
with the reference genome so we can

327
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,539
produce them quickly

328
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,220
and that shows that de novo nanopore

329
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:29,610
assembly is tractable for a large

330
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,560
repetitive genomes however whole genome

331
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,209
alignment remains problematic and we're

332
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,409
still looking at strategies to benchmark

333
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:37,739
our assemblies and assess their

334
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:39,000
completeness and accuracy yeah

335
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,430
we're also looking for higher depth

336
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,919
Illumina for our assemblies that will

337
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:45,449
help us to polish more accurately for

338
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,240
trips come we only have about three X

339
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,589
which is less than needed to polish and

340
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,200
then at some point I need to get around

341
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:54,149
to actually mapping freezing tolerance

342
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,660
and an interesting evolutionary question

343
00:13:54,149 --> 00:14:01,708
would be how genome fractionation has

344
00:13:56,659 --> 00:14:03,778
proceeded in trips come versus maze so

345
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,399
yeah just in summation I'd like to thank

346
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:06,778
everyone buckler lab I think I got all

347
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,089
the names up there with a big lab right

348
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:12,740
now Christi Gault so was the one who

349
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,740
originated this project she's now at NRI

350
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:24,480
yeah but to thank my committee who

351
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:28,109
didn't make it up here yeah Turin

352
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:49,350
bashing strong Center and thank you all

353
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:51,720
take your questions the question was if

354
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,579
the if it's difficult to cross maze and

355
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,259
trip scream how do we propose moving any

356
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:57,509
traits that we identify intimate so the

357
00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:02,028
answer would be genome editing if we can

358
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:05,669
identify specific alleles then we can

359
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:08,429
the plan is to is to attempts to edit

360
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:09,870
them both in a freezing acceptable

361
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:17,039
background and induce freezing tolerance

362
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:18,480
and then eventually into maze yep you

363
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:23,039
might have mentioned this and I missed

364
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,889
it but why did you decide to simple was

365
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:29,309
it just because it probably has has that

366
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:30,720
the bottleneck so the question was why

367
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:32,519
did we pick trips conferred on him to

368
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,639
assemble or not tap devotees and the

369
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,539
answer is we actually picked both the

370
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,730
reason this

371
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:40,110
killer species and one particular line

372
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,379
from the species came up is that it's

373
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:46,320
the majority it's a parent and I think

374
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:47,850
25 to 30 percent of the F one's about in

375
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,530
the field so it's it's alleles are over

376
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:54,990
represented in the population we do have

377
00:15:52,529 --> 00:16:07,799
further plans to sequence dr. Lloyd use

378
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:11,549
and others this has been a production of

379
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:14,240
Cornell University on the web at Cornell

380
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:14,240
