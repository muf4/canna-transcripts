00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,880
welcome you to the Northeast s

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,879
professional development project um soil

6
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:31,079
management and Berry crops as a model

7
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:34,200
for management education this is the

8
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,759
11th in a series of 12 in-depth Berry

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,039
crop nutrition and soil management

10
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:43,399
trainings and um we are really happy to

11
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:47,558

00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:58,759
who is from the University of Florida um

16
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:02,198
get a better idea of who is in the

17
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:04,558
audience um um I expect that we'll have

18
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:07,920

websites that are listed the webinar

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,519
archives and Northeast s are listed

28
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:35,319
there then in the lower right hand

29
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:37,879
corner are the files um that we would be

have not filled out the educator

32
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,599
Northeast s educator pretest and the

33
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,040
Northeast s demographics questioner both

34
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:52,718
of these are very important for the

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,680
grant information so we encourage you to

36
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:59,359
um do that and send that back to Kathy

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:02,439
heyen Reich um but let's just allow just

38
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,680
a few more moments for people to log on

39
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:06,359
and then I'm going to go into the second

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,159
part of the training but just let me

41
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,400
give them another minute or so to make

42
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:14,000
sure that everybody's logged

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,000
on I do want to draw your attention to

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,239
the fact that um we're looking for a

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,318
little bit of input and at the very

46
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,560
bottom of the notes po if you scroll

47
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,679
down Cathy has stated that there's um if

48
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,680
there's any topics or issues related to

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,040
Berry crop soil and nutrient management

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,040
that have not yet been addressed um next

51
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:37,120
week on

52
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:40,120
March uh what is that March 6th uh

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,680
excuse me March 9th um the that is the

54
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,239
last webinar for this series that'll be

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,680
at 2 o'clock pm and Dr Harold vaness

56
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,878
will be leading that but part of that

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,599
will be to address any remaining

58
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:55,878
questions that might

59
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:59,399
exist um so I think at this point let's

60
00:02:55,878 --> 00:03:00,919
um let's move into the second portion of

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,080
the

62
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:06,318
webinar and I'd like to introduce to you

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,480
our invited

64
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:13,399
speaker um Dr Santos Dr balinsky Santos

65
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,158
is an assistant professor of horiculture

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,920
with the University of Florida and EAS

67
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,199
he conducts research on strawberry

68
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:24,878
tomato bell pepper and increasingly High

69
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:26,598
Bush blueberry he works out of the um oh

70
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,158
sugar I should have read from the other

71
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:30,719
side I think it's the research station

72
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:35,438
the golf research station

73
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:38,359
um at Ias and he works specifically with

74
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:40,598
fertilizer irrigation protected

75
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,040
agriculture um with those remaining

76
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:44,560
crops and increasingly

77
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,959
blueberries

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,360
um and that's the Gulf Coast research

79
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:55,479
and Extension Center experiment Center

80
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,480
so thank you very much uh Dr Dr Santos

81
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,438
sorry I kind of got that introduction a

82
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,878
little bit bobbled but um um I'm going

83
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:05,639
to let you take it from here and people

84
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:08,560
will be continually logging on I think

85
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,759
that Dr Santos had asked um we spoke

86
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,239
about this earlier if you could hold

87
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:15,840
your questions till the end or if you

88
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,680
want to type them in go ahead but we'll

89
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,639
we'll take all the questions at the very

90
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,800
end of the presentation so thanks very

91
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,560
much and we'll get

92
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,960
started well thank you Laura uh I really

93
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,439
appreciate the opportunity to be here uh

94
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,918
today and talk to a very diverse group

95
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:36,279
of colleagues uh both in research and

96
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,000
extension really appreciate that and

97
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:40,079
also appreciate the fact that I am 80

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,439
degrees here in Florida where is kind of

99
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:46,359
cold up there uh so if you guys don't

100
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:49,120
fall asleep I'm going to try the best

101
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,639
that uh to try to keep your attention

102
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,918
towards this next uh few

103
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,600
minutes uh as Laura mention part of my

104
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:57,879
responsibilities at the University of

105
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,960
Florida

106
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:04,639
to direct the vegetables and small fruit

107
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:07,000
Horticultural program that focuses on

108
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,240
fertilization Water Management protected

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,720
egg and cultural practices for most of

110
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,160
our Target crops that include tomatoes

111
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,400
peppers strawberries blueberries and

112
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,639
most

113
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,519
cbits uh today uh we are going to be

114
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,918
talking mostly about

115
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:27,560
strawberries and how uh the fertigation

116
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:29,799
techniques and some of the Hydroponics

117
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,600
have been experimented here here in

118
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,720
Florida and abroad also because uh part

119
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,479
of the activities that we conduct uh

120
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,960
both research and extension uh not are

121
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,519
not only in Florida but also in

122
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,638
California Spain Argentina Chile and

123
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,799
other parts of the world where we have

124
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:49,800
all the research been conducted right

125
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,720
now

126
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,000
so with uh with that said we are going

127
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,960
to be focusing today on three basic

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,600
aspects and the fertigation by itself uh

129
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,279
we're going to be talking about a little

130
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,360
bit of the concepts of this um we're

131
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,439
going to be try to be really really

132
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,080
Broad in this knowing that previous

133
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,160
speakers probably touch a lot of the

134
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,318
aspects of the nutrition and

135
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,680
fertilization uh later we're going to go

136
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,000
to the rate determination which is

137
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,560
sometimes one of the most important

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,360
aspects and what relates to this when it

139
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,800
comes to fertigation and fertilization

140
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,840
of strawberries in general and also the

141
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,478
third touch aspect is going to be

142
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,159
touching on the some of the diagnostic

143
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,439
tools uh we are using right now I've

144
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,960
been asked

145
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,319
to look into not only the way that we

146
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:42,038
produce strawberries which is along with

147
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,439
California very different to the rest of

148
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:46,959
the country uh we deal with strawberries

149
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,759
as an annual crop uh we don't have a

150
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,359
second crop or the third crop like in

151
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:55,759
some cases we have in in in the north uh

152
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,280
but also some of the uh emergent

153
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,000
technologies that some Growers are using

154
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,638
not only here but in other parts of the

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,680
world when it comes to fertigation and

156
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,960
trying to determine the best way uh the

157
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,680
the best way the crops can

158
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:12,680
perform So within each one of the

159
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,160
subjects you're going to be seeing that

160
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,759
we have certain aspects that we're going

161
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,120
to be touching uh hopefully we're going

162
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:22,800
to be kind of thorough about it and give

163
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,199
practical examples of what each one of

164
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,038
these aspects mean and what we've been

165
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,919
doing in Florida with regard to each one

166
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:32,199
of them uh so

167
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:35,719
when we look at

168
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:38,240
fertigation uh we we cannot separate the

169
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,919
nutrition aspect from the irrigation PR

170
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,079
practices and we always tell everybody

171
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,598
that if there is one thing that

172
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:49,079
we when we talk about Fertilization in

173
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,519
general is that there are not uh certain

174
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:54,439
recipes that need to be followed uh

175
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,359
every situation is going to be different

176
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,079
and uh one thing that you're going to

177
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,840
see today is that we are not going to uh

178
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,359
give

179
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,719
specific recommendations blanket

180
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,720
recommendations for everybody to do

181
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,240
fertigation as opposed to touching the

182
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,759
principles that take you to those

183
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
recommendations and for you to adjust to

184
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,360
your own

185
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:19,598
programs so when we we call fertigation

186
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,840
in the process by which we apply

187
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:25,918
fertilizers uh through the irrigation

188
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:28,239
system and uh by doing that uh we can

189
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,959
use two types of specific specific

190
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,200
fertilizers the one that are ready to

191
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,838
use in a liquid Matrix uh which is the

192
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,039
most common method that is used by the

193
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:40,760
strawberry Growers here in Florida and

194
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:43,918
in in in in parts of California and also

195
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:47,120
we have the hydros soluble salts these

196
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,879
are solid uh salts uh just diluted in

197
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,759
water that you similar to the ones that

198
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:54,240
you buy sometimes in the in the hardware

199
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:57,080
stores that you go buy a salt and just

200
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,759
dissolve it and apply it both of them

201
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,079
have pros and cons obviously

202
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,919
when you carrying a big liquid Matrix of

203
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:06,639
fertilizer they charge you a lot more

204
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,439
for the for the cost of taking that

205
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,720
fertilizer to you uh because they're

206
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,800
carrying a lot of water with them

207
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,519
however these are fashionm made formulas

208
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,479
that you they are tailored to your

209
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,039
specific needs and you just apply the

210
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,959
formula don't have to worry about

211
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,759
usually about the formula precipitating

212
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,759
to the bottom of the tank unless that is

213
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,799
really cold uh and you know exactly

214
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:33,078
where you are applying the problem with

215
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,278
the salts when they are hydrosoluble in

216
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:38,120
contrast with that is that usually

217
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:41,480
people the the more that you handle this

218
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,679
the more R the uh opportunity for error

219
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,480
for human error that you're going to

220
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,599
find because one day somebody's making

221
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,560
the mixes in a week somebody is going to

222
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,159
be doing it uh and there might be

223
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:55,479
differences on the type on the

224
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:58,759
fertilizer you really applying in the

225
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,320
field however we at regardless of the

226
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,879
formula that you use no fertilization

227
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,800
program is going to be ever efficient if

228
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:08,720
a poort irrigation program is in place

229
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,199
and this is something that we've been

230
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,680
formulating to our Growers this second

231
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,720
aspect is extremely important uh

232
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:19,599
strawberry growers in Florida are very

233
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,399
efficient handling the water during the

234
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:27,959
season and that uh translates into good

235
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:29,919
use of uh the fertilizer that is applied

236
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:33,639
during that period

237
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:35,958
now uh we know and when we talk to our

238
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:40,360
Growers that usually this process is not

239
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:42,679
a a simple process that that they can do

240
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,120
uh on their own without the education

241
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:48,359
that we carry to them and one of the

242
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,959
principles that we uh tell them all the

243
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,839
time is that nutrients only move as far

244
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:56,679
as the water moves those nutrients so

245
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,079
they have to be clear about that and

246
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:00,919
that's that's why a lot of uh strawberry

247
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:03,039
Growers are very very successful in that

248
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:04,799
regard however many of you might be

249
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,000
wondering you know how they handle

250
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,759
Fertilization in a situation like they

251
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,440
do in Florida well soil this is the type

252
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:16,600
of soil that we have it's very Sandy

253
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,720
extremely Sandy is the closest that

254
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,480
you're going to find to a beach without

255
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,480
sodium in it uh and that makes it

256
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:28,320
extremely challenging in fact somebody

257
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,360
asked me the other day uh how we were

258
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,399
able to do this and I just tell them

259
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,680
that we take a lot of the hydroponic

260
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,278
principles to produce strawberries here

261
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,199
because it's the closest to the

262
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,838
hydroponic system that you're going to

263
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,759
find in real life when you got this deep

264
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,320
Sands infiltrate really quickly and

265
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,720
that's challenging to us because when

266
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,920
you have a soil like this when Growers

267
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,120
apply water and have a crop like

268
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:56,559
strawberries that we grow and a annual

269
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,879
health system like this when usually we

270
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,638
establish the strawberries with

271
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,159
sprinklers irrigation

272
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,839
protect the berries also with the

273
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:06,120
sprinklers and have one or two drip

274
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,600
tapes like the ones that you see here at

275
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:13,440
the bottom of this slideing each one of

276
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,519
the beds um it creates an opportunity to

277
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,959
apply fertilizers in a very efficient

278
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,839
way but at the same time it's a CH it's

279
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:24,638
challenging because you can have have a

280
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:27,079
high risk of leeching fertilizer and if

281
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,759
you don't believe me that I'm just going

282
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:32,319
to leave you with this picture when this

283
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:35,399
is a cross crosssection of a bed uh

284
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,959
Sandy bed like we have here in Florida

285
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:42,519
and the picture on top uh

286
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:45,119
represents uh watering that bed with one

287
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,480
drip tape for one hour that's how

288
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,959
quickly the water moves down without

289
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:54,560
moving further out on the

290
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:57,239
sides uh and that's when we have to

291
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,638
challenge ourselves to keep those

292
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,480
nutrients within the root Zone on and

293
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,198
making sure that nobody uh Waters

294
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,360
excessively so they can be efficient

295
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:09,039
when they apply

296
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,440
fertilizers uh the pictures the P the

297
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,679
second picture at the bottom of the

298
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:17,279
slide represents beds with two drip

299
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:21,599
tapes and in both cases this is one hour

300
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:24,759
of irrigation and the top uh uh in that

301
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,320
case we were able to achieve 31%

302
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:30,559
coverage of the bed of the area of the

303
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:34,160
bed whereas with two tapes you get

304
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:36,638
barely 67% that means 2/3 of the bed

305
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,240
have been are being water when when you

306
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,278
have one/ third of the bed that hasn't

307
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,879
been uh touched by water so you have to

308
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,838
be sure that you not only put the right

309
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:48,120
rate to fertilizer but also the

310
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,639
placement of that fertilizer along with

311
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,039
the irrigation program has to be

312
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:54,959
efficient for us to make sure that we

313
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:57,879
make uh we make make the best use

314
00:13:54,958 --> 00:14:00,838
possible of the uh resources that are

315
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:04,360
put out there in the field for producing

316
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,920
strawberries now uh going back a little

317
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,759
bit to the principles that we uh follow

318
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,399
here in Florida particularly we usually

319
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:15,360
tell our Growers that they shouldn't be

320
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,519
irrigating for more than an hour uh and

321
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,039
the reason is that those pictures that

322
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,720
you just saw after an hour of irrigation

323
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,360
you're probably dumping uh most of your

324
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,120
fertilizer into the

325
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:31,600
aquifers uh because it just leaked

326
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,600
down also another important

327
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,480
thing that we tell our Growers is that

328
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,399
they should have monitoring

329
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,480
equipment to make sure that they monitor

330
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,919
how much water they have in the beds and

331
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,079
knowing when to apply and when to not to

332
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,319
apply uh later on we're going to see

333
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,719
some uh pictures of the type of

334
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,440
equipment that they're being that is

335
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,079
being used right now to make sure that

336
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,040
the water is used

337
00:14:55,078 --> 00:15:02,799
appropriately also we extensively

338
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:04,919
educate our Growers on on on knowing uh

339
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,519
the kind of soil that they have they

340
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,039
have to calibrate their soil they have

341
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,639
to know what the Field capacity is

342
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:14,919
because believe it or not all the Sands

343
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:18,360
are not equal there are some Sandy areas

344
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:20,679
here that are very fast very fine sand

345
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,879
that you get the Field capacity when the

346
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:26,359
soil is barely in 12% whereas there are

347
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:28,799
other areas when you have a heavier type

348
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,079
of sand that where Field capacity is

349
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,919
around 18% so they need to know exactly

350
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,879
what kind of soil they have and even

351
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:39,679
within the same Farm knowing the pockets

352
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:42,919
of soils that they might have and I'm

353
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:46,879
going to provide more details later on

354
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:49,838
on the broad diagnostic of farms and how

355
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:52,480
Growers can section that farm uh

356
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,480
depending on what kind of soil they have

357
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,920
uh the whole objective of all this

358
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,000
obviously is to keep the water in the

359
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:01,559
rooting Zone and to do that we want to

360
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,519
make sure that our Growers at least have

361
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:09,039
one of these two if not both pieces of

362
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:11,639
equipment that allow them to uh monitor

363
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,639
water in the

364
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:21,600
soil for that uh we have two basic basic

365
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:24,159
pieces of equipment uh tensiometers

366
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,079
which are the traditional uh piece of

367
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,919
equipment that measures water tension in

368
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:31,039
the soil they have very decent accuracy

369
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,120
even though we are disputing this more

370
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:36,919
and more because sometimes in the middle

371
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,159
range uh of tensions you might not have

372
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:40,719
an accuracy that that will tell you

373
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,519
exactly how much water you should put

374
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,959
out

375
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,078
there the disadvantage is that you have

376
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:49,399
to use one unit per location that you're

377
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:53,599
going to be collecting data and making

378
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:55,559
sure that that uh unit is there and it's

379
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,959
clean that's it's not collecting algae

380
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:59,399
and anything like that extremely easy to

381
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,078
use and very

382
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,879
inexpensive however there are other

383
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,720
pieces of equipment like what you see on

384
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:09,199
the right here the which is called a

385
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,558
Time domain refle refle

386
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,318
reflectometer uh which is relatively

387
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:16,078
expensive one of these units can go

388
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:20,318
anywhere from 500 to thousands of

389
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:22,240
dollars uh it has this handheld unit

390
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:25,038
that gives you an instant reading of a

391
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,000
so volumetric water and has these prongs

392
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,558
that going into the soil that can be

393
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,919
calibrated at different depths and you

394
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:34,160
it can tell you instantly the the volume

395
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,080
of water that you have in the soil

396
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,960
therefore if you know that your soil fi

397
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:41,240
capacity is at

398
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,160
15% uh at 6 in deep you immediately get

399
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,720
a reading that tell you that that's what

400
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,640
you have over there uh the another

401
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,160
advantage of this unit is you can buy

402
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,559
one unit or two units for the whole Farm

403
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,320
you can have a farm manager just going

404
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:58,558
around and just collecting the the

405
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,319
volume of water in the soil uh the

406
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,960
beginning of the Cycles or before the

407
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,839
beginning of the irrigation Cycles it's

408
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,240
very easy to use however the downsizes

409
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,599
is that could be a little bit

410
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,759
unaffordable for some people there are

411
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:16,240
other units that are extremely more

412
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:19,158
complicated that are based on the same

413
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,159
uh principle or similar principles uh

414
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,120
but I think that that escapes the scope

415
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:25,880
of what we're trying to do today we're

416
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:28,399
not trying to do a seminar on how to

417
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,320
monitor water but rather to use prti

418
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,080
itical tools to monitor water and a in a

419
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:38,079
in a situation when Growers might be

420
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:41,720
struggling to make a profit

421
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:44,558
so uh usually when we go into into also

422
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,120
in farms we are try to make Growers

423
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,399
aware of the necessity of knowing what

424
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:53,719
kind of cultivar they have one thing

425
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,679
that we found is that uh ctiv might

426
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,480
respond totally different to the same

427
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,840
fertilization and irrigation programs uh

428
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,240
uh and obviously varieties that have

429
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,119
been bred in Florida will respond

430
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,558
different than varieties that have been

431
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,199
bred in California just basically

432
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:11,240
because they've been bred in to totally

433
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,120
different environments so the selection

434
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,319
pressure will be different and the

435
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,000
situation of the California soils would

436
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:18,879
be different to ours and that would be

437
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,679
true for a lot of varieties that are

438
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:26,720
bred in other regions too so we' been

439
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:29,120
trying to develop tools that allow us to

440
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,159
tailor different formul for different

441
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,479
varieties and we're going to talk about

442
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:37,120
that a little bit

443
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:40,000
later now um when it comes to the second

444
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,759
part of the fertigation uh soil versus

445
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,119
soiless culture I realize that the vast

446
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:49,038
majority of strawberries in the US are

447
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:52,359
grow on the soil however there is a a

448
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:54,158
increased uh movement of people going

449
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:57,158
into protect the culture and going into

450
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,159
soiless culture within those structures

451
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,880
and that requires all also for us to

452
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:06,200
provide knowledge to that increasing

453
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:08,000
group uh both for the traditional H uh

454
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,360
Market of strawberries and also the

455
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
organic market of

456
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,678
strawberries but for that we just have

457
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,038
to make sure that we know the physical

458
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:20,120
and chemical properties of our soils if

459
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,200
you're doing soils uh Field capacity as

460
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:25,558
I mentioned wieling Point texture

461
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,480
structure as as important as uh all the

462
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:30,519
chemical properties such as or organic

463
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,319
matter content pH nutrient content

464
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:36,240
salinity and Carion exchange capacity we

465
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,879
have to make sure that our Growers

466
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,120
understand that that's extremely

467
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,280
important uh to adjust those

468
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:45,678
fertilization programs when it comes to

469
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:47,639
soiless culture uh so you got three

470
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,080
different categories of soils that

471
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,080
you're going to find you got the solid

472
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:56,759
substrates uh that which we're going to

473
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,558
talk a little bit in the next slide we

474
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:02,079
got the pure Hydroponics that are the

475
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:05,319
plants just and the liquid Matrix of uh

476
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,918
solution uh nutritional solution and

477
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,240
also you got a something new that is

478
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,278
called relatively new that is called

479
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,640
aeroponics when the plant the plant

480
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:16,278
roots are in the air and you get the

481
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,360
constant mist of water with nutrients

482
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:22,200
that are spray into it obviously of all

483
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:24,519
this the solid substrates is the most

484
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,038
common and the most used uh not only

485
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:31,679
here in the US but in other parts of the

486
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:34,319
world now when talking about soiless

487
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,200
media uh the basic principle is that we

488
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:41,439
are just replacing the natural

489
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,200
soil with a lot of these materials uh

490
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,400
however many of them are naturally

491
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,960
deficient on a lot of nutrients you got

492
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,919
you you can you can pick whatever

493
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,440
soiless media is out there and you

494
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,278
always going to find deficiencies uh of

495
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,720
certain nutrients and that's when they

496
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:01,558
know how comes into place play you need

497
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,159
to know what kind of media you have uh

498
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:07,240
but we know that a so good soiless media

499
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,159
should provide good root support uh good

500
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,679
nutrient water retention allow gas gas

501
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,278
exchange and also be a pest-free

502
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,798
environment because is a way for us to

503
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:21,759
get away from the fumigation of the soil

504
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:25,798
and and and other problems that we may

505
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:28,879
have now when it comes to Mineral origin

506
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:31,400
media uh you got perlight mulite sand

507
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,240
and rock wool which are very common out

508
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:38,400
there and in the organic uh side you got

509
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,919
all from very vegetable or animal origin

510
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,519
you got coconut core Pete Pine Bar

511
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:46,320
compost different types of compost all

512
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:49,679
kind of compost out there and also rice

513
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,278
holes that I usually either used as they

514
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,919
are or

515
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:58,400
burnt uh you look at a lot of these

516
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:00,880
materials and as I mentioned as I put it

517
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,919
in a slide before not necessarily the

518
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,440
cheapest is the best uh it all depends

519
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,440
on what kind of needs you have what kind

520
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,960
of irrigation fertilization program and

521
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,159
Equipment you might have in the farm if

522
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,880
you have a an equipment that you can

523
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:17,440
only fertilize once per day you might

524
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,120
want to make sure that your soiless

525
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,120
media adjust to that type of regime uh

526
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,798
otherwise you're going to may be running

527
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:28,639
in trouble here in Florida we have some

528
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:30,960
specific examples of

529
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,080
soiless and containers that are being

530
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,960
used for strawberry production this is a

531
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:39,038
grower uh field here in Florida when we

532
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,360
get strawberries growing in troughs and

533
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:44,640
those troughs are filled with pine bark

534
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:47,399
uh all of this with drip tape and

535
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,880
fertigation uh also bags almost very

536
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:54,880
close to the soil over this uh concrete

537
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,600
blocks uh when when we fill the bags

538
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,760
with pine

539
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:03,599
bark also Soo you got other Growers that

540
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:06,919
have bags that are filled with coconut

541
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,719
core uh usually these bags are premix

542
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:10,120
and bring the coconut core and usually

543
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,839
it's imported from

544
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:16,519
Asia and

545
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:19,000
uh finally you have also Growers that

546
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:22,079
might been have been struggling in the

547
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,359
past and have tables like this and they

548
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,798
may be reusing those tables for

549
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:27,798
something else like people that had

550
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:30,398
nurseries before and we've been

551
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:32,079
converting some of these people to uh

552
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:33,959
producing strawberries on top of the

553
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,439
tables with

554
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,519
substrate also other people have been

555
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,120
looking into vertical production with

556
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:45,119
these vertical systems they they they

557
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:47,398
might save a lot of space however

558
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,158
usually when you run into these lower

559
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:52,479
levels the the light quality and

560
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,960
intensity is a problem and strawberries

561
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,159
might not flow too well down there

562
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,840
however for the first two three four

563
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,919
five levels depending on where you are

564
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,119
and the type of plastic cover that you

565
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,880
have on top you might be very successful

566
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:09,558
producing the

567
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,880
crop now moving on when we look at the

568
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:15,398
injection

569
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:18,120
equipment uh for fertilizers you usually

570
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:21,158
are talking about uh two or three

571
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:23,278
classical pieces of equipment that are

572
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:26,080
uh convenient and some of them are very

573
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:30,359
cheap and has pros and cons uh with

574
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,359
regard to one and to to the

575
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:38,278
other the first uh piece of equipment

576
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:42,278
that I want to show you is uh what they

577
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:46,359
call the ventory so uh suction uh

578
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:49,200
injector this is very simple uh uh

579
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:52,678
system however the problem is that when

580
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,798
you have a system like this you as the

581
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:58,480
pressure of the line of the water line

582
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:01,839
changes you might be changing

583
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,000
the pressure and the injection of this

584
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:07,319
uh each one of these uh ventes into the

585
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,558
line which is going to end giving you a

586
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:12,879
very variable fertilizer rate that

587
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:15,278
you're going to be applying so this is

588
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,600
very simple method very inexpensive for

589
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:20,839
a lot of Growers but they require to

590
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:23,000
monitor the injection of each fertilizer

591
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:26,079
more efficiently that they would do with

592
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,159
a system like this this is uh what

593
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,439
usually the very constant

594
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,080
uh injection they could be both

595
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,120
hydraulic like the one on the left or

596
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:38,000
they could be electric like the one on

597
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,558
the right and there's a company that is

598
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,640
called dosatron that's why we're taking

599
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:48,000
the name from uh no endorsement intended

600
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:51,640
here uh but these systems in inject a

601
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,240
very constant rate uh at at a very broad

602
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,759
range of pressure water pressure so if

603
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,440
you go from 20 psi to 10 psi you you're

604
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,640
going to continue injecting the same H

605
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,399
concentration of fertilizer into the

606
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,200
stream which is going to allow you to

607
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:08,239
have the same rate it's just that the

608
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,278
irrigation and the fertigation process

609
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:16,480
is going to last longer if the pressure

610
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:20,640
drops so for those of you who might uh

611
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:23,079
uh have plenty of money to go into it uh

612
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,200
especially Growers uh there are some

613
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:27,158
computerized consoles that do all this

614
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,880
for you and you you don't have to mess

615
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,600
around a lot with this system because

616
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,640
they adjust the fertilization throughout

617
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:36,839
the season by themselves you just have a

618
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,278
program that goes into but this these

619
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:41,519
are a lot more expensive that all those

620
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:44,599
methods and one thing that we want to

621
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,839
make sure is uh and take home message is

622
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:47,719
that more expensive not necessarily

623
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:52,079
means

624
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:54,839
better uh it depends also how you uh set

625
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:57,720
up your system and how committed you are

626
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,798
to be precise in terms of the fertility

627
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,200
ation that you're going to be applying

628
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:03,879
uh in many cases when you got

629
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,038
hydrosoluble fer fertilizers you got the

630
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,278
multi-tank injection point when you got

631
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:10,558
one tank for every type of fertilizer

632
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,960
that you're going to be applying out

633
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,158
there uh for example in this tank in the

634
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,399
left in this case you got the acids like

635
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:20,039
phosphoric acid is being injected

636
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:21,798
through that tank and this one you got

637
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:23,440
micronutrients uh that are being

638
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:25,798
injected in other cases you got

639
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,519
phosphates and sulfates and in the other

640
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:30,839
one you have nitrates the idea for this

641
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:32,159
is that you don't mix a lot of these

642
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:34,319
fertilizers

643
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:38,399
because they can precipitate to the

644
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:40,519
bottom so the if you have a hydrosoluble

645
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,239
fertilizer you need to separate them and

646
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,960
make sure that you inject inject the

647
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,240
right proportion of all of them this is

648
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,720
a very common system that is used in

649
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,120
green houses all over the world when

650
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,880
salts are added to water instead of

651
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:57,119
ready to use uh liquid solutions like we

652
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,320
use in the open field in Florida in many

653
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,759
parts of

654
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:04,678
California so moving on to rate

655
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:08,319
determination which is the second part

656
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:10,440
of our our conversation today uh you're

657
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,839
going to see a lot of now practical

658
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,919
examples of how we calculate rates for

659
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:16,879
strawberry production in Florida I just

660
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,120
want to put this slide here so you

661
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,519
refreshing to you what the macro

662
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,639
micronutrients are and a lot of this

663
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,480
formula sometimes might not have all the

664
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,880
micronutrients uh and they need to be

665
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,960
supplemented depend depending on the

666
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:33,799
soil needs that you have so but even

667
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,519
more important even as important as uh

668
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:38,679
rate determination also we need to make

669
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:40,798
sure that we know the sources the place

670
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:43,200
the placement of the fertilizer and the

671
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,480
timing when all this is going to be done

672
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,960
and to make

673
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,360
sure that we sometimes in some cases for

674
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,880
some micronutrients like for example

675
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:57,599
zinc or iron or sulfur uh we use blanket

676
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,519
recommendations because sometimes we

677
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:03,439
don't have specific calibrated uh test

678
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:06,440
that would tell you exactly how much we

679
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,080
need in a syst in that place or you

680
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,240
might have a piece of land that is brand

681
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,000
new that nobody has done any any

682
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,960
strawberries in that part of the the

683
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,440
state and you may need to do use blanket

684
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,679
recommendations while you calibrate the

685
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,399
system in anyways when you are

686
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,798
determining the the specific rate of

687
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:26,678
application you have to make sure that

688
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:29,398
you take into account the crop

689
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:32,000
requirement the leeching the losses

690
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:34,119
through volatilization and chemical and

691
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,720
biological immobilization in the soil

692
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:37,199
and that's going to give you a rough

693
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,600
application rate that you're going to be

694
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,000
applying all these tools we taken into

695
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,959
account when

696
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,720
determining uh the best rate for

697
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,679
producing uh for applying and

698
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,600
fertilizing and producing strawberries

699
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,679
in our state now at the same time that

700
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:54,038
we say that we mentioned earlier that

701
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,440
the different

702
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:58,798
cultivar uh with different growing rates

703
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,519
and plan arit tecture is going to play

704
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,200
major role on how much fertilizer you

705
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:05,599
put out there uh so we focus a lot of

706
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,759
our attention here in Florida to looking

707
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:12,038
at pre-planned and early n andp

708
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:14,558
fertilization as well as uh um at the

709
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:17,480
adjustments during the season of

710
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,079
nitrogen and potassium throughout the

711
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,079
the production

712
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:25,038
cycle uh

713
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:27,678
to give you a clear picture of what we

714
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:30,119
do in that regard

715
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,600
we concentrate a lot on nitrogen and

716
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:34,719
pottassium because these two are the

717
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:37,918
most used nutrients or the most applied

718
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,159
nutrients in our situation nitrogen is

719
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,679
usually apply 100% through the drip

720
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,720
tapes uh Sometimes some people might

721
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:48,159
apply a little bit and pre-plant uh 6

722
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:52,278
years ago this was around 60% of the

723
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:54,840
acreage right now uh we are only below

724
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:57,038
20% of the acreage of people that apply

725
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,439
pre-plant nitrogen uh and supplement

726
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:02,200
that that with drip later on the usually

727
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,600
the rates were between 20 and 50 pounds

728
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,519
per acre of nitrogen that were applied

729
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:09,558
before the drip tapes were in uh in the

730
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,240
case of potassium 100% is delivered

731
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:14,398
through the drip tapes uh a lot of this

732
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,000
has been changing in the recent years

733
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,879
because of the environmental concerns

734
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,759
that we have in terms of nitrate moving

735
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,000
into the groundwaters and uh also

736
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:27,638
implementing best management practices

737
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,319
for the crop however there is no single

738
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:33,079
best management practice better than

739
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:35,439
Rising prices of fertilizer and

740
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:39,678
sometimes I say that in a way that sound

741
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:42,679
sarcastic but that has created uh a more

742
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,840
conscience uh throughout Growers of how

743
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:47,480
to use fertilizer more efficiently

744
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:50,119
because the prices have been going up uh

745
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:54,720
in the year 2000 one Tong of fertilizer

746
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:58,359
was below $200 an acre the $200 a Tong

747
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,759
and right now fertilizers are above 500

748
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:03,079
and that's has created that conscience

749
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:05,839
of we need to be more efficient applying

750
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:07,960
fertilizer uh for strawberry

751
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:10,319
fertilization a common very common

752
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,000
fertilization program here in Florida is

753
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:15,839
using one to one and a half pounds of

754
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,798
nitrogen per acre per day which is going

755
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:21,959
to add up to around 150 to

756
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:24,519
175 pounds per acre per season remember

757
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,399
our season starts in October and we are

758
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:29,038
done at the beginning of March it's a

759
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:32,959
very short season because our

760
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:35,278
Market is the Winter Market and after

761
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,240
that other states take over the

762
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:40,398
production in the state and we become

763
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:43,159
really hot to produce strawberries so in

764
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:46,479
that short season we apply uh usually

765
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:48,480
between 150 175 pounds per acre

766
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,240
potassium is a little higher because

767
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,240
people have the perception that apply

768
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,278
more potassium at the end is going to

769
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,319
increase fruit quality uh which we're

770
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:01,159
going to try to illust rate you uh on

771
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:03,240
that regard in the next slides and also

772
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:05,039
we are more conscious now right now

773
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:09,199
about looking at phosphorus and the

774
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:11,759
early stages of production now when it

775
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,719
comes to using start the fertilizer for

776
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,800
applying nitrogen we've conducted

777
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:19,638
research in the past that that where we

778
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,480
compare uh the no application of

779
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:25,119
pre-plan fertilizer versus the

780
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,358
application of 50 pounds per acre of

781
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:31,838
pre-plan nitrogen using a monium nitrate

782
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:35,960
as the source and what we found uh in

783
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:38,398
that research consistently over time is

784
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,760
that uh there was no significant

785
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:45,480
difference across the board in any of

786
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:49,200
the months when we H compared the

787
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,878
production uh of strawberries by not

788
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,799
using stter fertilizer or using stter

789
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:56,398
fertilizer at the beginning and this was

790
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,000
done over a period of three years and

791
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,239
this this this is important because it

792
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,280
means not only that the Growers might be

793
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,039
saving around 17 to 20 bucks an acre on

794
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,320
the application plus the labor and

795
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:11,199
everything else but also it's 50 pounds

796
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,160
per acre and you multiply that by 10,000

797
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:14,960
acres that's a tremendous amount of

798
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:17,719
fertilizer that was just sitting there

799
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,358
and doing absolutely nothing uh for the

800
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:22,000
crop

801
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:24,000
so after that you know a lot of Growers

802
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,599
were moving out of the business of

803
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,519
applying pre-planned nitrogen uh to the

804
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:29,320
CR

805
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:32,639
and what they did is that they started

806
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:35,200
applying drip H connecting the drip tape

807
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:38,838
as early as possible to the crop and

808
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:41,598
started injecting uh nitrogen fertilizer

809
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:44,000
as soon as the plant was on the ground

810
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,160
and they did that for the first 10 days

811
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,320
well we also conducted research looking

812
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,078
at this but this time we made it a

813
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,519
little bit more complicated and we took

814
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,318
two different varieties two varieties

815
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:56,920
are standards for us Florida H

816
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:59,960
Strawberry Festival which is a most

817
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,599
grown variety uh here in Florida and

818
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,639
that is is the red line and Florida

819
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:08,039
Radiance that is the blue line and what

820
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:09,400
we found is that these two varieties

821
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,759
that had two totally different

822
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,760
architectures react totally different to

823
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,920
that initial fertilizer rate that you're

824
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,240
putting out there uh in this case we

825
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,240
compare zero

826
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:24,239
0.5 one and one and a half pounds per

827
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:26,879
acre per day in those two varieties for

828
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,799
the first 10 days after transplant we

829
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,838
injected that amount and we collected

830
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,560
the early yields of the varieties and

831
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:33,799
what we found is obviously with zero

832
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,318
there was no difference but there were

833
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,920
two totally different patterns as you

834
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:41,920
increase to two

835
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,960
0.5 pounds per acre you can see here

836
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,440
that Strawberry Festival continues

837
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,760
increasing its early yield As you move

838
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,318
to one pound and stabilizes after that

839
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,920
whereas with Florida Radiance the

840
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:58,119
maximum yield was obtained with 0.5 PBS

841
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,119
those are appli more than that there

842
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:04,920
were no significant differences uh from

843
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:08,200
that obtaining at 0.5 pounds per

844
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:12,358
acre that is giving us more confirmation

845
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:16,039
that we need to design uh more tailor

846
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:17,799
made formulas for specific cultivar and

847
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:20,759
taking into account that many Growers

848
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,440
apply as much as one and one and a half

849
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,880
pounds per acre across the board for all

850
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,079
the varieties uh now we have to come up

851
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,079
with ways to differentiate across the

852
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,880
cultivar and part of the research that

853
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,000
we've conducted uh had a lot to do with

854
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,838
that and and that's why you see right

855
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,239
there we look at two other two varieties

856
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:42,358
and then we started applying nitrogen

857
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,118
throughout the season which is different

858
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:47,598
what you just saw what you just saw

859
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:50,358
previously was nitrogen at the beginning

860
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,559
starting in the season

861
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:55,719
and uh we started looking at nitrogen

862
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:58,519
throughout the season now uh in two

863
00:37:55,719 --> 00:38:03,480
different varieties and I have to make a

864
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:05,599
a a a note here that this is regardless

865
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,440
of the source we didn't find any

866
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,480
significant differences if we were using

867
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,358
uh calcium nitrate and other nitrogen

868
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,559
sources we were getting similar

869
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:17,039
responses as you're going to see in a

870
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,719
second uh what we found again is that

871
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:21,119
there are different responses across

872
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:23,199
cultivar regardless of the source of the

873
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,160
fertilizer that you're using and some

874
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:29,559
varieties like this blue line winner

875
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:31,440
Dawn which is a very small plant uh all

876
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:34,000
it requires is 3/4 of a pound of

877
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,358
nitrogen per AC per day whereas a big

878
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,400
variety like strawberry festival needs

879
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:43,639
to get at least to 1.25 pounds per per

880
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,519
day to maximize early

881
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:48,440
yields

882
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:50,880
uh when when we look at that we say okay

883
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,400
what about if we start comparing this to

884
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,240
a newer variety like Florida radians and

885
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:59,200
we did a similar study when we were

886
00:38:55,239 --> 00:39:01,679
looking at that and we found that again

887
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:04,239
we had two very Sim two very different

888
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:08,159
patterns in the two varieties Radiance

889
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:09,679
and Festival when uh Radiance was

890
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:13,078
maximizing at

891
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:15,358
0.75 3/4 of a pound and Festival was

892
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:18,039
getting the maximum at

893
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:19,440
125 so that's giving us extra

894
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:22,079
confirmation where it's even more

895
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,639
important that extra half pound per per

896
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,000
day if you were applying an Radiance

897
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,920
without needing it it might mean 60

898
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,199
pounds per AC per season that's a

899
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:35,159
tremendous investment that you don't

900
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:37,159
need uh when you uh producing Florida

901
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:39,118
Radiance

902
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:41,920
so what

903
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,480
about nitrogen and potassium ratios

904
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,519
during the season we've been told and

905
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,358
led to believe that by switching

906
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:50,960
potassium towards the end in

907
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:54,759
strawberries is a good thing to incre

908
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,440
increase fruit quality well uh we've

909
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,079
been doing studies when we are looking

910
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,960
looking at the traditional grower

911
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:05,440
practice that is uh applying a formula

912
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,800
like 604 or 704 during the season until

913
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,760
mid December and switching later to a

914
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:14,599
heavy potassium formula like 406 or 408

915
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,079
towards the end supposedly to improve

916
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:20,760
quality well research has been conducted

917
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,400
in that regard and what we found out

918
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,720
consistently is that plan di diameter

919
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,680
when you go in different ratios one 1 to

920
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:33,399
one 1 to 1 to 125 and 1 to 1 and a half

921
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,078
nitrogen to

922
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,119
potassium there were no significant

923
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,119
differences across the

924
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:52,919
board however when we move to

925
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:55,280
Total uh uh fruit weight of the plants

926
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,559
there was the same pattern that was

927
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,760
occurring with uh plan diameter when

928
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:04,119
there were no differences uh among all

929
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:07,800
the ratios that were used the same occur

930
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:10,838
when we look into the the soluble solid

931
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:13,359
content or the bricks of the fruit there

932
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:15,039
were no differences of the ratios uh

933
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:18,799
remember that when I'm talking the

934
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:22,440
ratios here uh Growers tend to switch to

935
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,800
one to one and a half pounds during the

936
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,119
SE during the end of the season to

937
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:29,960
increase quality well that wasn't needed

938
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,559
of in any of the three varieties that we

939
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:37,159
tested uh consistently in the last two

940
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:39,880
years here so there goes that myth that

941
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:42,358
potassium heavy at the at the end

942
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:46,800
increases the quality and the total

943
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:48,159
fruit number and weight what we did find

944
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,680
and this was

945
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,799
expected were differences across the

946
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:55,239
cultivar and that was

947
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,000
expected uh

948
00:41:55,239 --> 00:42:01,118
so uh when it comes to changing nitrogen

949
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,239
and potassium during the season we can

950
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:07,760
conclude that uh that we can use a same

951
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:10,199
fertilizer rate to throughout the season

952
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,839
provided that you providing the correct

953
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:14,279
rate from the beginning and the plant

954
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:16,880
has develop a very good rooting system

955
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,319
to go down there and get the fertilizer

956
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,880
that you already been applying in the

957
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:24,119
beds and you keeping all those nutrients

958
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,640
without the root zone

959
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:30,400
now uh also we are looking into making

960
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:34,199
sure that we adjust the practices for a

961
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,440
specific Growers and that Growers design

962
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:39,279
programs that make sense for the needs

963
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,838
now how do we design these programs uh

964
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,079
in the sense and how we monitor all this

965
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:46,799
throughout the season

966
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:50,119
obviously the diagnos diagnostic tools

967
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,200
are going to be a tremendous help for us

968
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:57,480
and yeah I know a lot of

969
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:59,838
the uh uh visuals assessment has been

970
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,519
done during the season and nothing beats

971
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,480
your own eyes but the problem is that

972
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:07,400
usually when you see a deficiency is

973
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,280
kind of late it's usually it has taken a

974
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:14,079
toll on the crop and you see a situation

975
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:17,240
like like in this picture on the right

976
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:19,200
you got a severe deficiency here and and

977
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:22,199
you want to make sure that you get to

978
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:25,480
the plant before the leaves turn this

979
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:29,358
yellow uh obviously s deficiencies

980
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,880
cannot be seeing a plain sight and uh we

981
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:34,558
need to monitor uh nutrients throughout

982
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:38,039
the season we usually tell our Growers

983
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:39,480
that there are several tools out there

984
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:43,838
that they need to make sure that they

985
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,880
have and no specific tool is uh it's

986
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:50,558
going to help you

987
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:53,160
to do a one fits all type of diagnostic

988
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:55,640
sometimes you need you need your own

989
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:58,719
eyes out there looking at the field also

990
00:43:55,639 --> 00:44:01,118
you need need also uh to do probably

991
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:03,759
some kind of colorometric test at the

992
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:06,720
same time you might do the foler test of

993
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,920
uh to the plants uh in the past the

994
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:12,799
peral sap has been used uh there are

995
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,400
several there are severe contradictions

996
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,839
out there on whether this is the right

997
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,519
time to use a perial sap test and

998
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:25,199
whether this is a really valuable tool

999
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:28,079
to measure deficiencies in plant because

1000
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:31,279
uh some people argue that when you have

1001
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:35,559
high concentrations in the pedial perals

1002
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,440
act as reservoirs for uh nutrients and

1003
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:39,400
not necessarily means what is going

1004
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,200
through the vascular tissue to the

1005
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,358
leaves so that that's one thing that

1006
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:47,838
keep an eye on that not only to use

1007
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:51,920
perial sap as only test other people

1008
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:54,759
also look at colorimetric measurements

1009
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,480
to determine the greenness of the leaves

1010
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,640
especially if looking for nitrogen

1011
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:03,559
magnesium iron deficiencies uh and they

1012
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:07,799
use this pad meter which uh measures the

1013
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:09,519
greenness of the leaves and uh those are

1014
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,200
just two of the most common tools that

1015
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:14,000
are used out there however when you look

1016
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:18,239
at

1017
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,639
the uh composition of nutritional

1018
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:23,919
composition of the leaves uh usually

1019
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:26,960
nothing beats a a good Leaf analysis the

1020
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,318
downside of this is that obviously by

1021
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,159
the time you collect the samples and

1022
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:33,719
send it to the lab and you get results

1023
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:37,159
back several days might go by and that's

1024
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:38,639
why the mo the the proactive approach of

1025
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:41,399
making sure that your

1026
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,679
Solutions are accurate that you have the

1027
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,920
right pH that you have the right

1028
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:47,838
Electric electrical conductivity of the

1029
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,240
solution which by the way we haven't

1030
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:52,719
touched a lot but usually you got

1031
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:55,239
certain targets like for the pH of the

1032
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:59,480
solution you don't want to to go above

1033
00:45:55,239 --> 00:46:00,439
7. six or or even to eight nor lower

1034
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,280
than

1035
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,440
6.2 uh to make sure that you have the

1036
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,440
right solution out there it's also going

1037
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,079
to depend on what kind of media you have

1038
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,119
if you're growing in the soil or if

1039
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:13,400
you're growing in a media that captures

1040
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,400
or retains a lot of those nutrients that

1041
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,559
might give you more leeway in terms of

1042
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,720
what kind of solution you might want to

1043
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:22,400
apply out there at the same time uh the

1044
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,558
electrical conductivity of the solution

1045
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,079
you don't want it to be too high and I

1046
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:30,920
know that's particularly a Pro a problem

1047
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:33,559
in places when you have very high EC of

1048
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:38,720
the water for example here in Florida in

1049
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:42,599
in our station our water is 7 point 0.7

1050
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:44,959
DEC cement per meter uh uh the

1051
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,599
electrical conductivity of our solution

1052
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,199
so when we apply fertilizer we usually

1053
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,800
don't want to go above two because

1054
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:53,519
strawberries are extremely sensitive to

1055
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,839
any solution that is applied to them

1056
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:58,119
consistently above two the per meter so

1057
00:46:56,838 --> 00:46:59,639
you want to make sure that you keep a

1058
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:01,440
balance and that's going to have a

1059
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:04,078
direct influence on what frequency of

1060
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,679
fertilization you're going to use if for

1061
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,000
if to obtain the given fertilizer rate

1062
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:10,279
that you want it's going to take that

1063
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,800
solution above two then you probably

1064
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,119
better off lowering the concentration of

1065
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,720
your solution and applying the applying

1066
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,318
it more frequently so all those are

1067
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:21,558
aspects that we work with Growers to

1068
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:24,719
make sure that they have the

1069
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:27,720
right program in place so they don't go

1070
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:33,639
overboard and start seeing salinity uh

1071
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:36,000
problems and uh pH uh uh pH disorders

1072
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:38,159
and the soil uh that I going to I going

1073
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
to start showing in the plants some of

1074
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,358
these problems and also blocking the

1075
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,960
absorption of certain nutrients

1076
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:48,239
nevertheless we have a sufficiency range

1077
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,880
for strawberries that uh our university

1078
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:54,719
has put together in our uh production

1079
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:57,800
handbook and we get certain uh

1080
00:47:54,719 --> 00:48:00,239
guidelines not no written Stone but

1081
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,960
certain guidelines and how much nitrogen

1082
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:05,879
phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium

1083
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,960
sulfur iron manganese zinc Borum copper

1084
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:13,440
and M mum the plant needs uh in a

1085
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:16,559
driveway basis when when it comes to

1086
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,599
adequate range of fertilization all this

1087
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:22,960
is available either through our website

1088
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:25,039
uh here in my program or uh the

1089
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,400
extension website of the university is

1090
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:28,960
free of charge

1091
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,240
uh could be accessed from anywhere if

1092
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,838
anybody has a question about later on I

1093
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:35,519
would like that uh table to get to you

1094
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:37,880
you can either get a copy of the

1095
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:40,559
presentation or to access the website

1096
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:44,838
and I will be happy to direct you to the

1097
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:46,720
right right spot below that table we

1098
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:49,039
have another table as I mentioned

1099
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:51,879
earlier we use all these measurements

1100
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:54,960
all these diagnostic tools to complement

1101
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:58,119
each other you got a table that also

1102
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:01,599
show show you the perceived sufficiency

1103
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:04,358
ranges for our conditions for nitrate

1104
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:08,000
nitrogen and the perals and also for

1105
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:09,519
potassium uh in the in the leaves so all

1106
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,798
that is available at the same time and

1107
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:14,920
both tables are together like that so uh

1108
00:49:13,798 --> 00:49:17,119
we just want to make sure that we

1109
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:20,039
designed the right uh programs for our

1110
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:23,079
Growers now towards the end and we are

1111
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:25,358
in the last few slides here uh we want

1112
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:27,519
to concentrate all also in what it's out

1113
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:27,519
there

1114
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:34,318
um now uh I know a lot of people use

1115
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:37,798
area photographs as a tool to diagnose

1116
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:42,000
uh symptoms and this is extensively used

1117
00:49:37,798 --> 00:49:44,679
in agronomic crops uh when people uh

1118
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,798
corn uh soybean and other crops out

1119
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:49,879
there and it's a tool that has been used

1120
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:52,280
more increasingly more in vegetables now

1121
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:56,519
especially when this extend growing

1122
00:49:52,280 --> 00:50:00,400
extended uh ER areas uh people are using

1123
00:49:56,519 --> 00:50:03,239
S more actively nitrification Inhibitors

1124
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:08,440
uh just to slow down uh the process of

1125
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:11,558
conversion from from nh4 to uh

1126
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:14,760
nitrate uh and also uh more and more

1127
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:16,839
people are using crop crop refractance

1128
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:19,599
measurements that are is just a

1129
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:20,960
sophisticated method to determine uh the

1130
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,480
colors of the plant and what is

1131
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,199
reflecting from the plants and I know

1132
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:28,000
some fellow scientists have been working

1133
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:30,480
Act in this uh and I I wouldn't be

1134
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,440
surprised in the next few years this

1135
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:37,599
method takes uh is used a lot more

1136
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,519
extensively in the US one of the methods

1137
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,519
that has been used here in Florida

1138
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:46,559
especially for people who have large

1139
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:48,400
very large uh strawberry areas talking

1140
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,760
uh above 100

1141
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,280
acres is using the aerial infrared

1142
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,760
photographs as you can see in this

1143
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:00,559
picture it gives gives you a good idea

1144
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:03,400
of what the high uh Vigor areas in your

1145
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:07,920
field are and what the low areas are and

1146
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:10,119
usually that's tied up to the the

1147
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:14,358
specific properties of the soil or

1148
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:15,960
specific practices uh of that soil for

1149
00:51:14,358 --> 00:51:18,239
example in this specific case you're

1150
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,720
going to you're going to see H the areas

1151
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:23,879
in green that represent the low Vigor

1152
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:26,078
areas of that field and reading a little

1153
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:29,318
bit of The Narrative of this picture

1154
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:33,440
those were areas that were both either

1155
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:36,759
poor fumigated or uh have very uh

1156
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,599
limiting drainage situations in it and

1157
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,680
this is a a tool that has been used more

1158
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,318
actively now

1159
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:46,239
to know what you have in the field and

1160
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:48,960
make sure that you make adjustments

1161
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:52,239
either on that season or for next season

1162
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:55,880
uh to do amendments uh pinpointed to

1163
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:58,318
specific blocks of land of your field as

1164
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,760
you can see here you got in the left

1165
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:03,279
side of this picture you got nine

1166
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:06,119
different fields all of them with very

1167
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,880
different uh Vigor with the same

1168
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:12,000
variety uh and that allows that grower

1169
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,920
to to say okay this is a very low spot

1170
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,159
this is a very high spot or this is a

1171
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,680
spot that has higher organic matter than

1172
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:23,719
the other and that allows you to make

1173
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:26,000
adjustments now towards the end now uh

1174
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:29,000
we are looking more increasing

1175
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,119
into uh looking at the effect of

1176
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,039
nutrients and growth and quality not

1177
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,000
only the traditional nitrogen and

1178
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:38,159
potassium but also I mentioned that

1179
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,838
we've been focusing even more on

1180
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:43,960
phosphorus now uh the reason is because

1181
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:46,719
even our soils have a lot of phosphorus

1182
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:50,199
uh available uh sometimes we see

1183
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:53,118
phosphorus uh addition increasing the

1184
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:55,558
quality of the of the plant and then

1185
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,760
that's probably because when they own

1186
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:59,559
transplant is putting in the beds you

1187
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:03,240
don't have enough phosphorus around the

1188
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:05,160
root zone for the new uh roots to absorb

1189
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:07,039
at a given time so you might have

1190
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:09,798
phosphorus in the environment but might

1191
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:12,000
not have it where you want it so we we

1192
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:14,960
are working on that too the other thing

1193
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,838
that we're doing uh is working actively

1194
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,960
on management of soiless culture uh to

1195
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:24,880
make sure that Growers have what they

1196
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:27,559
need uh and every specific soilless uh

1197
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:30,358
meat I has specific

1198
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:32,640
characteristics and we want to make sure

1199
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:35,480
that we pinpoint to them what are the

1200
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,440
practices that they need for a specific

1201
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,280
conditions that they might have in the

1202
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:44,720
farm if you got any further questions

1203
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:48,599
Beyond this seminar um I'm putting my

1204
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:51,199
email there so anybody can feel free to

1205
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:53,079
expand over this and discuss this a

1206
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:56,039
little bit further or if any other

1207
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:58,318
subject was left out uh I would be more

1208
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:00,759
than happy to answer your question just

1209
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,838
allowed me couple days for it because I

1210
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,799
keep traveling all over the world so

1211
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:06,239
sometimes I might not even be in the

1212
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:08,440
country when I might be answering some

1213
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:11,639
of the questions but I will be happy to

1214
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:14,519
do it because this kind of a exchange uh

1215
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:17,838
with uh people from other states on

1216
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:20,599
colleagues researchers and extensionists

1217
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:23,558
is what really what enriches the process

1218
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:26,079
of uh gaining knowledge and generating

1219
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:28,839
Technologies for our Growers and all the

1220
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:31,000
growers in the US with that I'm going to

1221
00:54:28,838 --> 00:54:34,759
leave it for questions and I appreciate

1222
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:38,318
your attention today and your patience

1223
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:41,799
with all this uh

1224
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:44,119
presentation Dr Santos thank you so much

1225
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:46,280
um this is Laura speaking and we do have

1226
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:48,798
a couple of questions that people have

1227
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:51,000
typed in I imagine there's a few other

1228
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:52,559
questions out there so those of you in

1229
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,199
the audience go ahead and if you have

1230
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:58,480
them please type them in I have a few

1231
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:00,519
but first um Jeff Miller asks whether or

1232
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,519
not you've compared the use of calcium

1233
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:07,159
nitrate with Ura or ammonium sources of

1234
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:09,719
nitrogen for trickle

1235
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:12,039
Solutions well that's a great question

1236
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:14,879
uh and as I mentioned before uh We've

1237
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:17,558
compared those sources and uh talking

1238
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,720
about calcium nitrate and and ammonium

1239
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:22,920
sources and we have found no significant

1240
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:25,279
differences in the way that it's used

1241
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,240
for strawberries now if we were talking

1242
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,039
about other crops it might make a whole

1243
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:31,558
lot of a difference especially

1244
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:33,599
blueberries that we know that respond a

1245
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:38,680
lot better

1246
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:41,400
to uh NO3 sources than rather than

1247
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:42,679
ammoniacal sources uh but in the case of

1248
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,760
our strawberries and the way that

1249
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:47,960
Growers handle it uh and the rates that

1250
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,200
we use we haven't found any significant

1251
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:53,318
differences across the

1252
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:56,118
board all right thank you and the

1253
00:55:53,318 --> 00:55:59,119
beginning portion of you started talking

1254
00:55:56,119 --> 00:56:01,440
about ratios of n to K where K was less

1255
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:04,519
than a 1:1 ratio you were talking I

1256
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:07,559
think more about K being a higher ratio

1257
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:09,759
but can you uh mention if you check

1258
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:12,798
those ratios where K was actually

1259
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,400
less yes we have we have checked those

1260
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:16,880
ratios before and we decided to leave

1261
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,318
that out of the research because in

1262
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,318
preliminary studies we found out that

1263
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:25,599
those ratios that correspond to less

1264
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:28,318
than one pound per acre per day

1265
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:31,880
pottassium really start taking a toll on

1266
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:34,480
the plants so usually from the condition

1267
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:37,280
that the Growers have here in California

1268
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:40,639
Growers tend to over apply fertilizer

1269
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,839
not to under apply and but by looking at

1270
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:45,598
those ratios and preliminary stuff uh

1271
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:47,519
research that we conducted told us that

1272
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,280
yes we didn't need to go lower than that

1273
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:52,519
but rather to compare one one and a qu

1274
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,519
and one and a half pounds of potassium

1275
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:57,679
during the season which is the most

1276
00:56:54,519 --> 00:57:00,358
common practice for those Growers

1277
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:02,480
here okay and then we have one more

1278
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:05,199
question and I think you mentioned that

1279
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:09,240
the goal for the pH of your solution

1280
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:11,838
would be a 6.2 of a low and then the

1281
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:13,118
maximum would be somewhere between 7.6

1282
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:16,318
and

1283
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:19,920
8.0 that's correct and th those are the

1284
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:22,199
extremes and you try to have a a

1285
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:25,838
nutritional solution that doesn't go

1286
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:27,919
below 6.5 and doesn't go higher 7.3 or

1287
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:31,038
something like that if you have to deal

1288
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:34,119
for a short time with a solution that is

1289
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:37,720
7678 is not the end of the world but

1290
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:39,480
that tends to accumulate over time so

1291
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:41,798
for a given point in time when you're

1292
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,760
applying that you might might be fine

1293
00:57:41,798 --> 00:57:46,079
especially if the plants are big and

1294
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,400
vigorous they can take it really well

1295
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:51,318
however you try to stay close to

1296
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:54,079
neutrality as much as

1297
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:56,759
possible okay wonderful um we have

1298
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,760
another question
