1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,400
University hey thanks a lot Matt and

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,558
thank you all for coming out today um

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,199
it's a bit of pleasure it's been an

5
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:17,160
awesome trip I've been here since Monday

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,519
got to meet with a lot of you uh it's

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,039
excellent thank you so much for taking

8
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,839
the time to chat with me um a special

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,160
thanks to Natasha and Matt for hosting

10
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:29,759
me um I guess has been a wonderful trip

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,960
so uh I am going to share some research

12
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:36,039
with with

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,039
you if my clicker works but doesn't need

14
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:43,199
to so I am based in the Twin Cities and

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,800
with the other four million residents of

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,920
the Twin Cities metro area uh we don't

17
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:51,280
actually see Farmland every day um but

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,439
we do have an opportunity to see some of

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,558
the impacts of the our current farming

20
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:59,079
system um Even in our Urban environment

21
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:02,238
uh so this is a photo that was taken

22
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:05,560
about three miles from my house uh I

23
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,959
live back over here and um I'm sure

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,640
hundreds of thousands of people go over

25
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,319
the bridge every day that see this uh

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,519
and it's not coming through super clear

27
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:16,199
but this is actually the Confluence of

28
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,798
the Mississippi River and the Minnesota

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,280
River and if you can see there is a huge

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,280
amount of sedimentation coming in from

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,400
the Minnesota River phosphorus bound to

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,920
some of those sediments uh likely some

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,000
dissolved nitrogen in there as well and

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,640
entering the Mississippi River and which

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,438
goes to the Gulf of Mexico uh so this is

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,759
a major issue so why is this occurring

37
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,839
well here's the crop land data layer uh

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,399
of the landscape in Minnesota just kind

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,320
of the Southern half of it and here are

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,280
those two rivers roughly this is the

41
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,158
Minnesota River starts in the headwaters

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,118
up in itasa state park if you ever get a

43
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,520
chance to go it's absolutely gorgeous

44
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,680
check it out um and here's the Minnesota

45
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,718
River and you can see that the Minnesota

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,079
River is really surrounding Ed by corn

47
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,280
and soybeans totally dominated by corn

48
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:07,359
and soybeans that's the yellow and and

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,439
green pixels on this map and the

50
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,800
Mississippi largely flows through

51
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,439
natural habitat from the north down to

52
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,239
this

53
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:19,120
Confluence uh so along the Minnesota

54
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,599
River we see a lot of images like this

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,680
especially in the spring um there is

56
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,959
just no living cover on the landscape or

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,280
very little and as a consequence when we

58
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,400
get a lot of our precipitation in the

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,120
spring we see major erosion events and

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,599
like I said that erosion carries with it

61
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,120
nutrients and this super valuable top

62
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:39,399
soil um causing some major environmental

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,239
challenges and others we can't see like

64
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,599
greenhouse gas

65
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,400
emissions uh so this kind of sets us up

66
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,000
for the justification for doing this

67
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,959
research uh we need currently our

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,800
agricultural system is dominated by

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,439
these annual monocultures and they're

70
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,800
critical though for supporting Humanity

71
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:03,039
uh 50% of our Global crop land is

72
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,680
occupied by these five species and if

73
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,079
you look at these species two of them

74
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,439
are dominant seral annual

75
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,280
grains and most of these in a lot of

76
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,598
parts of the world uh are farmed with

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,959
annual tillage intensive use of

78
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,919
pesticides and fertilizers and other

79
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,840
inputs and largely as

80
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,479
monocultures so this is sort of the

81
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,840
situation we have we've created this

82
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,798
agricultural system that's really

83
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,598
productive and uh but at as a

84
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,200
consequence we've lost some of these

85
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,438
ecosystem services that were once

86
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,598
provided by our natural habitats and we

87
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:40,479
see some of these major

88
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:43,479
challenges uh so what we're working

89
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:46,438
toward is developing new agricultural

90
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:49,318
systems those that are perennial and

91
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:51,359
high diversity with the goal of

92
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:53,719
maintaining at least maintaining

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,560
productivity as well as providing some

94
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:58,079
ecosystem services and really I want to

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,400
push this system and see if we can

96
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,239
actually exceed productivity from our

97
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,760
current system because we have our

98
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,959
population continuing to grow and

99
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,878
getting richer and the demand for food

100
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,840
Fuel and fiber is

101
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,359
increasing so as Matt said um I have the

102
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,640
great pleasure of working in the

103
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,479
sustainable cropping systems lab and

104
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,478
this is our goal it's diversify and

105
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:22,560
perennial eyesee cropping systems to

106
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:24,599
improve productivity economic viability

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,199
and then eological

108
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,680
Integrity we do that largely by focusing

109
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,800
on perennial crops there's a list of

110
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,680
some of those that we work on here as

111
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,160
well as trying to enhance crop diversity

112
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,160
and that diversity can be enhanced

113
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,039
through time in terms of diversifying

114
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,600
crop rotations or in space via

115
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:44,680
intercropping which I'm going to talk

116
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
about

117
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,199
today and we focus a lot on agronomics

118
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,720
how can we develop these new systems

119
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,360
that farmers can actually adopt and

120
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,759
integrate into their practices how can

121
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,560
they be profitable and at the same time

122
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,520
we measure those environmental

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,560
impacts

124
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,680
uh so I'm just highlighted a few of the

125
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,439
topics that we're going to cover in

126
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,079
today's presentation which is largely

127
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,719
around intercropping you'll see a lot

128
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,918
about kza intermediate weat grass and

129
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,479
alala I'm not going to cover too much of

130
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,639
the environmental impacts we'll just

131
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:17,959
touch on the water quality um but mostly

132
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,680
talk about agronomics and and how this

133
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,318
system can actually be

134
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,918
feasible so why are we at all interested

135
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,039
in intercropping we already started

136
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,478
alluding to this it's a way to increase

137
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:30,038
biodiversity on the farm uh we can

138
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,439
increase plant diversity

139
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,959
within a field which there's a lot of

140
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,038
research that shows that that can lead

141
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,239
to higher diversity levels of other

142
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:40,439
taxonomic

143
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,759
groups agronomic efficiencies cover that

144
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,360
soon and also hopefully provide some

145
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,319
environmental benefits so in terms of

146
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,240
these agronomic efficiencies there's

147
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,840
been a lot of research looking at how

148
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,800
intercropping systems can increase water

149
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,478
use efficiency a couple of different

150
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,478
mechanisms for this um hydraulic lift um

151
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,359
just complimentarity of rooting systems

152
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:02,560
capturing more of the water that falls

153
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,520
with

154
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,918
precipitation could lead to more

155
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,719
yields intercropping can also um help

156
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:13,879
with pest suppression and disease

157
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,039
suppression physically alterate altering

158
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:19,478
uh the environment for pests to

159
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:22,240
move and a lot of these have been uh

160
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:24,680
synthesized and I think in a great way

161
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,319
presented in the paper um out of Matt

162
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,240
ran lab in 2018 check that out if you

163
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,680
want to see a full description of those

164
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,280
things

165
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,720
but then the other big agronomic

166
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,959
efficiency that we're really interested

167
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,120
here is the ability to provide nitrogen

168
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:41,439
to our grain cropping systems through

169
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,840
biological nitrogen fixation via legumes

170
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,879
and there's been a lot of work done on

171
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,519
this um these are just some rough

172
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,120
numbers from a few papers I was able to

173
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,198
pull and have citations for this

174
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,519
afterward if you're interested where

175
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,360
they come from um but atmospheric end

176
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:58,038
fixation by legumes 13 to 17% of that

177
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,479
has been observed to be transferred to

178
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:04,399
the grains up to 35% of the nitrogen in

179
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:06,079
a grain crop that's been intercropped um

180
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,719
has been found to come from BNF

181
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,878
biological nitrogen

182
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,800
fixation but the mechanisms are uh kind

183
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,560
of tricky to track as well so this

184
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,160
nitrogen can can come from the

185
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,800
decomposition of the above ground plant

186
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,240
tissues of legum tissues that can be

187
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,960
decomposed and nitrogen can be made

188
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,918
available for the cial crop roots and

189
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:30,560
actually the nodules themselves contain

190
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,038
nitrogen that can be decomposed and made

191
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,160
available to the grain

192
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:37,360
crop there are other maybe more direct

193
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,319
Pathways nitrogen transfer through micro

194
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:45,400
risal fungi through root exid

195
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:48,479
dates but all of this is in uh designed

196
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:50,679
to better synchronize the nitrogen

197
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,598
supply and demand of these cropping

198
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,000
systems and I'm going to talk a little

199
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:57,439
bit about how the potential um might be

200
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,879
enhanced with perennial

201
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,759
crops so what about yield what do we

202
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,840
know about the opportunity to increase

203
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,158
productivity and yield using

204
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,158
intercrops there's a couple of ways to

205
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:11,000
present this uh so and we can do these

206
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:12,959
intercropping experiments with different

207
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,759
designs there's a replacement design and

208
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,799
an additive design um so let's just take

209
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,960
a look at an example of how we might

210
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,280
calculate the yield benefit from an

211
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:26,478
intercropping uh in a replacement design

212
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,839
let's say we have our uh field of a

213
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:32,080
monoculture of a grain crop like maze

214
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:34,799
yield 10 units per per area we have a

215
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,839
soy bee maybe that's yielding four while

216
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,639
if we do a replacement design and do a

217
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,880
substitution of one row for another uh

218
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,360
this is what we'd expect right half with

219
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,439
half the amount of corn plants in that

220
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,879
field half the amount of soybeans is the

221
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,600
monocultures combine them this is our

222
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:53,519
expected intercropping yield but if

223
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,560
there's any sort of facilitation any uh

224
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,360
transfer of that lium inner crop to the

225
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:02,239
maze that benefits the yield we would

226
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,560
get this overyielding effect and this is

227
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,879
one way we can measure it um by

228
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,159
calculating this thing called a land

229
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,879
equivalent ratio if we're really just

230
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:13,759
focused on um the outcome of the grain

231
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:15,360
crop we can focus on what we call

232
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,200
relative yield and this is quite a

233
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,879
simple

234
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,079
calculation um and now here we're

235
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,919
looking at an additive design so where

236
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:24,439
we just have our

237
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,278
monoculture um keeping the population

238
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,760
the same and then adding a legum

239
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,838
intercrop to that not altering our grain

240
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:35,639
yeld population what is the outcome it's

241
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,800
simply yield of the intercrop over yield

242
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:39,120
of the

243
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,159
monoculture and you'll see this metric

244
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,078
used throughout my presentation so the

245
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:47,719
key here is that if the value is over

246
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:50,519
one we get a net benefit of the legum

247
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,160
inner crop to the grain crop if it's

248
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,600
less than one uh it's a detrimental

249
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,559
effect and I might refer to this as if

250
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,519
it's above one there's facilitation

251
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:02,399
going on it's below one competition

252
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,560
there's a little bit more to that but uh

253
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,000
those will be some of the terms I use to

254
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,359
describe these

255
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,039
outcomes uh there's a lot of examples of

256
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,399
intercropping out there around the world

257
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:14,240
I'm just going to show you a snapshot a

258
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,399
couple of these so there's uh sorghum

259
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,278
pigeon PE intercropping systems that can

260
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,360
be harvested for grain or for

261
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:22,679
forage um this one you might have seen

262
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,159
before here in New York um red clover

263
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:29,120
UND seeded into um spring

264
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,958
wheat and folks are even intercropping

265
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,879
corn and soybeans um it's one thing to

266
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:37,479
manage this for forage um but quite a

267
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,278
much more difficult thing to try to

268
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,200
manage this for grain as you can imagine

269
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,078
trying to harvest combine grain from

270
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,120
corn out of a stand like this could be

271
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,319
pretty

272
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,639
tricky so why don't we see these

273
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,399
intercrops if we know that they have

274
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,159
potential to provide environmental

275
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,559
benefits and boost productivity why

276
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,399
don't we see these a lot on the

277
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,439
landscape well there are a lot of

278
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,078
different reasons and there are some

279
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,360
specific agronomic challenges

280
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,199
so the two different species might have

281
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,959
very different needs in terms of

282
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,240
preparing a seeded or for establishment

283
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:13,278
the timing of seeding they might require

284
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,079
different fertility regimes in a lot of

285
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:19,078
cases the pesticides are

286
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:22,519
incompatible but i' argue that one of

287
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:25,479
the reasons is that some of the nitrogen

288
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:28,000
benefits take time and with an annual

289
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,000
cropping system we don't have a whole

290
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,799
lot of time um there's actually limited

291
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,559
time for these ecological processes to

292
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,199
play

293
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,919
out so uh this is just an example of a

294
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,160
timeline of a corn and soybean system in

295
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,479
the Upper Midwest really there's only

296
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,078
about four or five months for all those

297
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,519
processes production of the lium death

298
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:50,799
of the legum tissue decomposition of the

299
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,679
legum tissue transfer to some inorganic

300
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,519
source that could be taken up by end

301
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,799
those all can take time can it happen in

302
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,120
five months in the Upper Midwest uh

303
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,799
maybe but it might be more effective um

304
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,480
to give the system a little bit more

305
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,559
time by working with

306
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,519
perennials um we also have to think

307
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,759
about balancing this populations of the

308
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,879
two species really we're trying to

309
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,799
promote that facilitation and prevent

310
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,278
the competition um and that can be

311
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,759
tricky to

312
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:21,399
do so I think that uh by working with

313
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,439
perennials we have a potential to create

314
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,320
intercropping systems that achieve these

315
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,079
goals and there are some perennial

316
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,399
intercropping systems um we have alley

317
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,719
cropping with fruit and nut trees we

318
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,078
have a lot of intercropping that's

319
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,079
occurring in pastures and other forage

320
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,159
systems but until now there really

321
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,719
haven't been any intercropping systems

322
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,719
that really fit nicely within a

323
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,199
production row crop system and that

324
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,879
provides human consumable grains these

325
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:50,919
serial grains that are so important for

326
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:53,360
Humanity which leads me to intermediate

327
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:57,120
weak grass or kernza so intermediate

328
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,480
weat grass is a cool season Forge grass

329
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,839
perennial introduced to the US in the

330
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,079
early 20th century as a forage crop and

331
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,000
in the past 40 years folks have been

332
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,439
working to domesticate that and turn it

333
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,320
into a grain crop so breeding for larger

334
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,680
seeds higher seed

335
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,278
yield uh and it's proven to be uh rather

336
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,399
successful in some ways because it's

337
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,559
tolerant to a wide range of growing

338
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,360
conditions does require

339
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:26,838
vernalization um and the trade name for

340
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,480
the grain is kernza um so I'll try to

341
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,440
refer to the plant as intermediate weat

342
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,240
grass and whenever I refer to the grain

343
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,240
itself I'll try to speak to kernza but a

344
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,278
lot of times people use these terms

345
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,600
interchangeably so before I begin I need

346
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,639
to show you a timeline of a typical um

347
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,079
intermediate wheat grass production

348
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,519
system uh seeds are typically not all

349
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:50,198
the time but usually sewn in the fall

350
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:53,198
I'd say early summer or late summer

351
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:55,919
early fall the plants produce some

352
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:58,120
biomass just vegetative biomass then

353
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,599
they overwinter providing some cover on

354
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,879
the landscape that first year the

355
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,600
plantss come out of dormy very early in

356
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:08,559
the year for the Upper Midwest mid-march

357
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,399
sometimes um and begin vegetative growth

358
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,159
and they grow vegetatively for about two

359
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,240
more months and then stem elongation

360
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:17,278
begins in about the second week of May

361
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,839
in our region that's when the seed head

362
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:23,320
comes up flowering goes takes place in

363
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:27,160
around the Fourth of July and then grain

364
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,399
is uh ready to harvest Late July early

365
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:31,240
August and at that point all the grains

366
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,399
removed all the straws typically

367
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,720
harvested and then the plant continues

368
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:38,879
to grow just vegetatively for the rest

369
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,199
of the season and in Minnesota that can

370
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,198
actually be until early

371
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,519
November so now I want to just give you

372
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,199
a quick overview of the nitrogen budget

373
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,000
um give you an idea of how much plant

374
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:54,799
tissue and how much nitrogen is in that

375
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,799
those tissues in a typical intermediate

376
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,078
weak grass stand so these numbers are

377
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:02,399
not meta analysis averages is these are

378
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:05,278
just ballpark figures based on uh many

379
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,360
sight years of data for Minnesota so

380
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:12,439
typically we can see about 800 kilograms

381
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,680
of uh grain per hectare um which is

382
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,600
about 20% of the grain yields we might

383
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:19,838
see for spring wheat in Minnesota um so

384
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,360
nowhere near our annual yields but

385
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,959
that's what we're looking at and 3.4%

386
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,720
nitrogen content so in a field of kernza

387
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:31,879
we might have about 30 kilograms of

388
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:36,319
nitrogen per hectare the straw above

389
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:40,600
ground biomass about uh four metric tons

390
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:42,679
1.1% nitrogen we got 44 kilograms there

391
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,120
Roots uh we see a lot of variability in

392
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:47,719
root biomass we've had measurements up

393
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,078
to nine metric tons per hectare down to

394
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,278
a meter deep um so i' just say on

395
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:55,198
average here another four metric tons um

396
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,519
and then another 40 kilograms of n per

397
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:00,639
hectare so all in all we're looking at a

398
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:05,318
nitrogen need of about 100 kilograms of

399
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,318
nitrogen per hectare for this

400
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,879
crop so we have one of the first studies

401
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,919
we did with intermediate weat grass

402
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,120
agronomic studies was a simple nitrogen

403
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,278
rate trial try to figure out how much

404
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,318
nitrogen should be applied to maximize

405
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:22,198
grain yields uh we did this work at many

406
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:24,759
sites and years and identified this

407
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:27,000
Optimum nitrogen rate of about 60 to 90

408
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,560
kilograms per hectare Which is less than

409
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,240
what I just said in Med weak grass needs

410
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,318
per year um and just so you know the

411
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,919
average corn fertilizer rate in

412
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:38,958
Minnesota is almost 160 so we're talking

413
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:39,919
about 50% of what would be applied to a

414
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,679
corn

415
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:45,479
crop uh but it's kind of intriguing that

416
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:47,679
this n rate is less than what we just

417
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,240
showed you that the plant is actually uh

418
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,879
using in a given year um and what we've

419
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,000
noticed is that when we apply more

420
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:57,000
nitrogen fertilizer we get lower graani

421
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,240
yelds because of this lodging so the

422
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,559
plant is prone to lodging

423
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,918
one of the reasons it's using that

424
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:07,000
nitrogen to build taller stems and more

425
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:09,199
leaves um and at the expense of grain

426
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,720
production and then those plants topple

427
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,318
over and it's hard to harvest them so we

428
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,439
get a reduction in Grain

429
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,918
yield um but this is really important

430
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:20,919
because we uh are very interested in

431
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,720
identifying uh perennial crops to plant

432
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,199
in these ecologically sensitive areas

433
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,439
where nitrate leeching is a problem so

434
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:31,200
Minnesota has a big issue with nitrate

435
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,558
leaching to drinking water uh most

436
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,240
motans get their drinking water water

437
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:38,079
comes out of their tap comes from the

438
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,558
groundwater and we are seeing elevated

439
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,678
levels of nitrate in that drinking water

440
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,678
mostly as a product of nitrogen

441
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:48,200
fertilizers leeching into the the

442
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:50,640
aquifer and this has major human health

443
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,440
impacts uh the concept's pretty simple

444
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,200
we have these annual Ro crops that

445
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,159
require nitrogen in these aquifer uh

446
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,279
Headlands wellhe head protection areas

447
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:04,320
and we're applying anywhere between 140

448
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,639
and 160 pounds of end per acre and in

449
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,319
some areas of Southwest Minnesota it's

450
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,320
more closer to

451
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,918
200 and lots of lots of research has

452
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:15,399
been done on looking at nitrogen use

453
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:17,280
efficiency of corn um we're knowing we

454
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,200
know that only about 40% of that is

455
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,798
recovered into the Grain and many

456
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,038
Studies have documented the amount of

457
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:26,759
nitrogen that has actually escaped the

458
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:29,839
corn systems into the aquafer we're

459
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:32,839
looking at losing 25 to 50 pounds per

460
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,599
acre per year in corn again this isn't a

461
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:38,038
one value from a met analysis this is

462
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:40,000
kind of a range from various

463
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:41,558
studies uh and so we've been doing this

464
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,558
work with intermediate weak grass to

465
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:46,079
understand its potential to prevent

466
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:47,639
nitrate leeching we know it requires

467
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,798
less nitrogen for optimizing grain

468
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,919
yields we're not getting as much yield

469
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:55,639
per acre but less nitrogen's going in um

470
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,960
higher nitrogen use efficiency and over

471
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,799
and over again we're seeing a lot less

472
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,400
Nitro leeching to the groundwater

473
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:03,879
because of this extensive deep rooted

474
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,080
deep rooting

475
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,600
system so lots of modeling exercises

476
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:12,119
taken place done various field studies

477
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,000
comparing kernza intermed wheat grass to

478
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,959
corn to soybeans different fertilizer

479
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,279
rates we're seeing two orders of

480
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,720
magnitude less nitrate leeching uh

481
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:23,599
compared to our annual R crops okay so

482
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,440
where do this bring us though for

483
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:29,399
intercropping we are still interested in

484
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,240
making that um system more sustainable

485
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,000
by providing nitrogen to the crop via

486
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,519
biological nitrogen fixation it' be

487
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,759
really great to not have to fertilize

488
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:42,519
these current systems at all um we'd

489
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:45,158
also love to increase biodiversity and

490
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,918
potentially increase total biomass if we

491
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,679
can add another legum to the stand

492
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,360
increase total biomass and there's value

493
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,080
to that biomass that we're going to talk

494
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,079
about some of the challenges are though

495
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,359
balancing that competition and

496
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,599
facilitation establishing our legumes

497
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:02,759
and making sure that they persist give

498
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,279
the time required for those ecological

499
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:06,640
processes to play out um and I'll talk a

500
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,158
little bit more about whether or not

501
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,080
this is a sustainable

502
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,159
system so I'm going to show you some

503
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,519
results from just a couple of

504
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:16,200
experiments first um this is one of the

505
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:19,319
earlier studies and it was we really

506
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:23,360
wanted to screen what legumes could work

507
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:26,119
uh so we tested um these six different

508
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,639
legum species with intermediate weak

509
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:30,599
grass then we also had intermediate weak

510
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,520
grass mod no cultures um controls with

511
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:35,719
no fertilizer and then we fertilize some

512
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:37,038
plots with either 45 or 90 kilograms of

513
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,400
nitrogen per

514
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,038
hectare I am not going to go through all

515
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,200
the different traits of these lium

516
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:46,519
species um but just to kind of lump them

517
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,798
together we tested these two very common

518
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,279
uh legum forages alela and red clover

519
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:53,279
they have differences in their root

520
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,240
architectures their persistence their

521
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,720
yield so we wanted to see if any of

522
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,038
those might influence the competition

523
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,120
facilit ation

524
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,640
tradeoff we tested a few other not so

525
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:06,359
common legumes um but they also have

526
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,480
different traits white clover very

527
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,959
low-lying

528
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,720
um elide Clover and birds foot tree foil

529
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,759
and the last one we tested is actually

530
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,880
native to the Tallgrass Prairie um in in

531
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,319
the midwest that's Canada milk fetch so

532
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,760
we're just curious could we you know

533
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,200
potentially integrate this perennial

534
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:25,919
native perennial legum with intermediate

535
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,480
weak

536
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,400
grass all right so on to the data

537
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,720
this is the first figure you'll see a

538
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,519
few of these uh we're looking at the

539
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,038
relative uh

540
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:42,158
yield and I said anything above one is a

541
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,798
net facilitation uh there's more biomass

542
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,960
being produced by the intermediate weak

543
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:49,599
grass in the intercrop compared to no

544
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,919
intercrop compared to the monoculture

545
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,319
and with this figure we're looking at

546
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:57,038
total intermediate weak grass biomass so

547
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:59,678
the vegetative biomass and the grain

548
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:01,278
combined um and this is the first year

549
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,559
we did this study at three sites I'm

550
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,720
only going to show you data from one

551
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,759
site uh because it varied a lot across

552
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,960
sites and that's that'll just show you

553
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:12,720
even the variability within one site uh

554
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,319
so we saw a net increase in

555
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,159
biomass um as a response to some of

556
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:20,359
these legum species which was uh nice to

557
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,919
see some facilitation occurring in that

558
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:25,439
first year uh look at the red clover

559
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,320
which is a pretty common Forge legume we

560
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,120
actually saw some competition occurring

561
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:32,439
there less intermediate weak grass

562
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:34,519
biomass um alelo we saw some n

563
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,038
facilitation um but again this is

564
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:40,359
overall biomass so uh one could imagine

565
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:43,158
that in an environment with another

566
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,719
species and more competition turns of

567
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:46,960
intermediate weak grass might tend to

568
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,480
grow taller as there's more competition

569
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,200
for light and so maybe just that

570
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,640
increase in biomass is only coming from

571
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,319
the vegetation what we really want is an

572
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,759
increase in Grain yield um so this is

573
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,960
the first year and and just to show you

574
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,919
a snapshot of what happened in the

575
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,759
second and third year we got a lot of

576
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,159
variability there's no standout legum

577
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:09,839
here that consistently uh resulted in

578
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:12,000
overyielding in terms of total

579
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,038
biomass uh but let's look at the grain

580
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,240
so here's the grain relative to zero n

581
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:17,079
and this is what we're really interested

582
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,480
in are any of these legumes really

583
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:23,199
increasing grain yield when we intercrop

584
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,038
them and we are seeing some uh Lela um

585
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,200
red clover here did really well by the

586
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:31,400
third year elide clover but again

587
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,640
there's no real consistent pattern um

588
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,679
and then when you look at the other

589
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,679
sites again there's just no standout

590
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,440
lium species so there's a lot of things

591
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,000
happening occurring here and we got to

592
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,798
start to teas some of these things apart

593
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,480
so you also might wonder well M are

594
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:48,480
there actually legumes in those plots

595
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,640
where the grain yields are better or

596
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,798
worse like is there really a

597
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,919
relationship between the lium and the

598
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:56,720
intermediate weak grass one way to look

599
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,759
at that is simply by plotting legum

600
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,919
biomass yield against the relative grain

601
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:04,679
yield so as increase as there's more

602
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,278
lium biomass in a plot we're seeing less

603
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,840
grain yield um that makes some sense the

604
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,679
more plants you have in there the more

605
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:12,240
competition there's going to be but what

606
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,759
we're really interested in looking for

607
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,200
is this there's any points in this area

608
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:20,558
where we can get some legum biomass in

609
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,080
the plot but still have an increase Rel

610
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:23,839
in Grain yield relative to the

611
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,759
monocultures so we're looking for if

612
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,038
there's any area up in here and we see

613
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,480
some points and so we can start to

614
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:33,359
investigate you know why did those plots

615
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,558
have overyielding was it the species

616
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:39,240
what was the population things like

617
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:41,839
that uh and we're we're been thinking

618
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,120
that these legumes are going to benefit

619
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,000
the intermediate wheat grass via

620
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,879
nitrogen fixation and

621
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,798
transfer and that's tough to quantify

622
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,120
and um Evelyn Riley is a graduate

623
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:56,319
student on this project um worked with

624
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:58,479
Dr Jess guten who's at the University of

625
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,918
Minnesota she's a soil e colle ologist

626
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,960
and they did this work um tracking

627
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:05,559
nitrogen transfer using Natural

628
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,120
Abundance of nitrogen

629
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:12,359
Isotopes um and any asteris here

630
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:15,479
indicates a situation where there was a

631
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:19,719
statistically different difference in a

632
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,839
nitrogen transfer from zero so here we

633
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,240
actually none of these are statistically

634
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:27,079
significant um we didn't actually see a

635
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,000
transfer until the third year at this

636
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:32,599
site and only with three of these

637
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,079
species uh and if we look further into

638
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:38,199
this potential leg uh we can see that

639
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,918
year one leum biomass is actually

640
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:45,080
correlated with the year three relative

641
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:47,520
grain yield so plots that had a lot of

642
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:48,960
uh legum biomass in the first year it

643
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,038
appeared that there was actually some

644
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,919
competition in year one but that biomass

645
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:56,919
later translated to potentially being

646
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,799
beneficial for graani yields in years

647
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,759
two and actually year three when we

648
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,319
picked it up that it was because of the

649
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:05,480
nitrogen transfer now again there's a

650
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,439
lot lot of other mechanisms as to why

651
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,679
the legum in crops might influence grain

652
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,038
yields we talked about pest suppression

653
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,000
there's a lot of Water Dynamics

654
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,158
happening with these systems um so we're

655
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,880
just kind of getting at the tip of the

656
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:20,399
iceberg with

657
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,278
this um another question we have is can

658
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:25,759
a producer do something in the field to

659
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:28,880
manage these populations or to alter

660
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:31,759
this interaction between the species

661
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,480
um so we tried answering this question

662
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:37,679
um through an oi project that was led by

663
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,360
initially Steve Coleman and now Leo dice

664
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,559
at the Ohio State um Matt Ryan and Tim

665
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:46,119
Cruz um are also hosting this

666
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:48,000
experiment and we're looking at two

667
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,599
different legum species alala and red

668
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,679
clover um also comparing the results to

669
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:53,678
fertiliz intermediate weat grass with

670
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,320
Organic

671
00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:00,919
manure and what we're really uh testing

672
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:03,398
here is different um procedures for

673
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:05,360
establishing the legumes so let me

674
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:08,038
explain a little bit more about that

675
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:09,959
everything I've showed you so far uh we

676
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:12,319
have established the intermediate wheat

677
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,278
grass and the alala at the same time in

678
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:17,158
the fall and I've showed you these

679
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:18,919
configurations where we have rows sewn

680
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,200
rows of the two

681
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:22,600
species uh so we did that in this study

682
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,880
we have our intermediate weat grass

683
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:28,759
monoculture no fertilizer sew it in the

684
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,080
rows and then uh one set of treatments

685
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,599
we introduced our legum with the

686
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:37,038
intermediate wheat grass within the same

687
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:39,480
R so we mix the seed um and we have our

688
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:42,079
alala and our red clover established in

689
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,240
the fall we have another set of plots

690
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,359
where we sewed the intermediate weak

691
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,880
grass into rows in the fall and then

692
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:51,000
Frost seeded our legumes broadcast that

693
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,159
seed over the top so we gave the

694
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,278
intermediate weak grass a little bit of

695
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,278
a head start before sewing or planting

696
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:58,359
our

697
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:02,119
legumes and then the Third configuration

698
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:03,359
is this really delayed legume um seaing

699
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:05,119
we actually let the intermediate weak

700
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,479
grass go through a full life cycle we

701
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:10,278
harvested grain really gave it a head

702
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,079
start and then we planted our legumes in

703
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:15,720
the summer uh we broadcast seed it in

704
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:18,319
between those harvested

705
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,600
rows and we also have monocultures that

706
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:23,879
we appli um manure onto at different

707
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,439
rates and we applied that manure in the

708
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,799
spring important to know um three

709
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,278
different rates from 56 kilograms per

710
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:34,960
hectare to

711
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:36,519
224 all right uh so that's just a list

712
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,319
of the

713
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,319
treatments um we're going to look right

714
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:43,278
away at the relative grain yield and

715
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,639
this is relative to the unfertilized

716
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:48,240
monocultures and we can only look at the

717
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,960
two establishment systems the the fall

718
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,519
sewing and the frost eating because the

719
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,679
summer wasn't seated yet in the first

720
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:57,120
year um we saw some overyielding with

721
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:59,120
that red clover it's kind of opposite of

722
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,439
what we saw in the first

723
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:04,278
study um by year two there's not much of

724
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,519
a difference in terms of yield and by

725
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:08,398
three we had a lot of variability so

726
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:10,440
here might be a good time to start

727
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:11,558
looking at the actual population of the

728
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,480
legum in the

729
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:16,278
plots some of these are not very

730
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,278
persistent like red

731
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,120
clover so let me back up so this is

732
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,199
relative to the unfertilized

733
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:27,359
monocultures now we could take a look at

734
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,840
these plots and ask well what's the

735
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:32,639
nitrogen equivalency of that

736
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:35,798
overyielding uh so we could potentially

737
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,919
compare yields of these intercrops to

738
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:41,200
fertilize monocultures which is what we

739
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,120
do here um so everything all the points

740
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,080
go down as you'd expect because uh the

741
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:48,278
monoculture fertiliz yields are a little

742
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:51,480
bit higher um but we can still see that

743
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:54,079
we're getting close to that that's at 1X

744
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,919
so that's 112 kilograms of nitrogen per

745
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,720
hectare so that can be a one way to

746
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,080
quantify that benefit of the

747
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,519
intercropping in that

748
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:04,278
system same plot as before I showed you

749
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,480
lium biomass correlated with the

750
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:08,599
relative grein yield so the

751
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,640
unfertilized seeing the same thing we're

752
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:13,519
seeing a as expected a reduction in the

753
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,799
relative yield as you get on the high

754
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,558
end of these lium populations but we're

755
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:19,960
looking for these spots right where we

756
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:22,158
can get a balance of high grain yields

757
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,399
and lium intercrop

758
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,919
biomass now for the first time I'm just

759
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,719
going to show you actual yields um

760
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,000
because we also have to think about this

761
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,759
from a farmer's perspective relative

762
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,919
yield is great and all but what's the

763
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:37,720
actual economic viability of these

764
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:39,480
systems um so this is green yield in

765
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,558
kilograms per hectare you know I said

766
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,960
around 800 is kind of this ballpark

767
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:46,839
figure that we see a lot of times from

768
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,200
our trials in Minnesota um so we have

769
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:51,959
our alala intercrops our red clover

770
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,720
intercrops and then the uh control and

771
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,639
three nitrogen rates year one pretty

772
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,558
similar yields for some of these inner

773
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:01,678
crops compared to the fertilized rates

774
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:03,558
we see this nice classic curve of

775
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,559
increasing nitrogen fertilizer rate you

776
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:09,359
get more yield um and we're seeing uh

777
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:11,918
yields exceeding those of the inner

778
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,678
crops in year two and we see this

779
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,360
classic also decline in Grain yield by

780
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:19,919
the 30 year this is ubiquitous in a lot

781
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,199
of our experiments um but for some

782
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,440
reason that high-end plot was a little

783
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,679
the yield crash wasn't as great which is

784
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,880
an interesting point in its own um and

785
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,440
then here's the same figure but with

786
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,679
total forage yield and now I'm calling

787
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,000
it forage yield because we are thinking

788
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,080
about using this biomass so this is the

789
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,638
mix of the alala and the intermediate

790
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:42,720
weat grass

791
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:44,839
biomass uh and we should really be

792
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,639
thinking about this uh in terms of

793
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:50,839
economic value that legu material has a

794
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:53,359
higher nitrogen content has more crude

795
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:56,319
protein has more nutritive value and and

796
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:59,199
actually has more economic value so as I

797
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,879
mentioned this is a dual use um system

798
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,840
we're looking at harvesting the forage

799
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,760
at different times uh going back to our

800
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,439
timeline of intermediate weat grass we

801
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,839
can harvest the

802
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,880
forage uh in late April early May long

803
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:14,599
as we do it before stem elongation

804
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,320
otherwise we take off the seed heads and

805
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,439
there won't be any grain that year uh

806
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:22,480
producers can Harvest that forage or

807
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,798
graze the field um there's also quite a

808
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,360
bit of value to the straw and I'm

809
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,879
calling it straw but it is higher nut

810
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:32,798
value than like wheat straw it's Greener

811
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,559
there's more nutrients there and then um

812
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,200
the plant as I mentioned continues to

813
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,879
regrow only vegetatively in the fall and

814
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,720
there's another opportunity there to

815
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,799
either mechanically Harvest or graze

816
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,240
that material so if you count it there's

817
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:48,480
actually four opportunities of revenue

818
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:53,159
for a producer spring graze uh summer

819
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:55,120
grain straw forage and then a fall

820
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,360
forage it's important to actually

821
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:01,359
quantify these uh which is what Mitch

822
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:04,558
Hunter did as a postto a few years back

823
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:08,638
and this is just um forage yield and

824
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:11,519
quality um at the different utilization

825
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:13,959
periods so spring forage summer straw

826
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,440
fall forage do in a nutshell there's not

827
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,240
much there in the spring but it's

828
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,519
excellent quality really high quality uh

829
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,359
straw in the summer there's a lot of it

830
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,960
there but it's pretty you know meager in

831
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,558
terms of quality fall fall right in the

832
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,880
middle

833
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:32,240
uh so it's useful to actually quantify

834
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,320
this um and we did this in a study where

835
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,278
we actually grazed uh stands of

836
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:38,879
intermediate wheat grass that was

837
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,480
managed as the monoculture with

838
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,519
fertilizer or with legum inner crops

839
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,038
it's replicated complete block design

840
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:49,399
you can't really see this very well but

841
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:51,839
there you can see the paddock um in this

842
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:54,638
picture and so these are the values

843
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,959
after a three-year production period um

844
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:58,839
so we have our intercropping system

845
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,600
system and then our monoculture the

846
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:03,158
intercropping we actually had to put

847
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:04,519
down about 50 units of n um in one of

848
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:07,720
the years because it was looking quite

849
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,679
nitrogen depleted um the other system

850
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,320
was over those three years was 450

851
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,760
kilograms of nitrogen were applied this

852
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,440
is the total amount of biomass removed

853
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,240
from both systems we had a little bit

854
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,079
more from the legum inter crop as we

855
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:22,239
might

856
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,839
expect um we actually measured the

857
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,398
amount of nitrogen harvested uh because

858
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:29,480
we looked at the nitrogen content both

859
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:32,118
the intermediate wheat grass and the

860
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,119
forage legume um and then we can see

861
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:37,838
what the soil n available nitrogen was

862
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,960
after the study um and substantially low

863
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:42,159
this is a really Dynamic number but um

864
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,240
we did see significantly lower available

865
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,800
then um in the

866
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:51,638
intercrop uh relative yields from this

867
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:55,079
system so the Green Point is uh relative

868
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:56,280
total forage yield so higher yields with

869
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:57,480
the inner crop compared to the

870
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,800
monoculture

871
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:03,358
but grain declined with stand age um so

872
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,240
in the first year there wasn't much of a

873
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,159
difference between intercrop and

874
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:10,519
monoculture um but the monoculture

875
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,598
yielded more grain in year two and

876
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:16,000
three so how do we yeah value this

877
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,440
addition of the legum to the system in

878
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,599
terms of the forage and what is the

879
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,039
economic cost of that reduction in Grain

880
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:24,680
yal by adding the ligu um we did a

881
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,800
simple Enterprise budget here and I'm

882
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:28,358
not going to walk through all the

883
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,880
numbers but some important assumptions

884
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:35,078
are the value of the grain we valued

885
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,880
that at $2.50 per kilogram um value of

886
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:41,519
the unit of crude protein

887
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,920
$122 cost of Ura was pulled from what we

888
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,000
paid for it and when we come down the

889
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,480
net return this isn't really a net

890
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,400
return because we didn't quantify the

891
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,599
cost of the Harvest but just to uh

892
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,599
apples the apples here a little bit more

893
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:57,680
of a potential return from the leum

894
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:00,200
incraft so to summarize that anything

895
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:02,118
that's above the line there's more of in

896
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:04,399
the in crop below is more of in the

897
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:07,200
monoculture a lot more fertilizer was

898
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,000
applied to the monoculture we had more

899
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:13,719
grain in the monoculture but we had more

900
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,519
forage and more protein was harvested uh

901
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:18,598
in terms of um you know potential

902
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:22,800
benefit for dairy

903
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:25,800
system and a slight increase in Revenue

904
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,480
Potential from the intercropping so this

905
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,160
all needs a lot of work and much more

906
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,000
replication but it's I think a starting

907
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:34,920
point for starting to assess this um but

908
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,800
in summer we've noticed that the

909
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,880
biological nitrogen fixation from those

910
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,800
legumes might not be enough um to make

911
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,318
up for all that nitrogen we're removing

912
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,240
with the forage nitrogen depletion is

913
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:49,279
probably one of the reasons why we saw

914
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:51,679
that uh grain yeld decline with stand

915
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,640
age in the indrop because it just wasn't

916
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,639
getting enough n uh and the value of the

917
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:59,358
increased protein from legumes seem

918
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,879
seems to be able to offset that grain uh

919
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:02,318
decline right now but again it's it's

920
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,559
going to depend on the price of the

921
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:06,440
Grain and the

922
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:07,719
forage um so I wish I had a whole

923
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,639
another seminar to talk about the

924
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:11,439
environmental impacts of this system but

925
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,679
I don't have much time left here so I'm

926
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,720
just going to give you a snapshot um do

927
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,598
lium inner crops affect yeah these

928
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:21,000
environmental uh issues that we're

929
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:23,119
concerned with um just talk about water

930
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,039
quality we measure water quality by

931
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,519
using lysimeters so we can sample soil

932
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:29,000
water beneath the rooting Zone and then

933
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,880
we look at how much nitrate is in that

934
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,760
soil water and we did this in

935
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,519
monocultures with without fertilizer and

936
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,880
then we did this with an alphaalpha in

937
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:42,280
crop but all of those in crops did have

938
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,440
uh 40 kilos of n applied to them so it

939
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,839
was the legum in crop plus

940
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,559
fertilizer just show you some results so

941
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:51,559
in the first year this is the

942
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:55,599
concentration of that nitrate in the

943
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:57,639
soil water um 10 parts per million is

944
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,480
sort of the magic number EPA set that as

945
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:02,719
the safe drinking limit um and so you

946
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,318
can kind of think about that number

947
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:08,679
there we saw some elevated nitrate

948
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:10,719
levels in the in the soil water beneath

949
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:13,598
the intercrop with fertilizer compared

950
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:15,279
to the no fertilizer control but it was

951
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,559
a lot less than our fertilized

952
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,440
intermediate weak grass uh to give you

953
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,519
some sense of how what this is relative

954
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:26,599
to annual row crops in our corn system

955
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:28,440
we often see the value between 25 and 60

956
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,280
so we're still substantially lower than

957
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,119
what we'd seen an annual um but then we

958
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,839
saw that decline with stand age and

959
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,240
actually by the third year um there was

960
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:39,838
less nitrate in the soil water even

961
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:42,000
compared to the

962
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:44,639
unfertilized monoculture so there's

963
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,159
potential there um for to mitigate

964
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:50,159
nitrate leeching while using these in

965
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:52,679
crops so thinking uh forward what's the

966
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:57,078
future research on this well um working

967
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:59,598
with Jenny Moore and others here um do

968
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:01,800
figure out if we can breed legums for

969
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,480
intercropping specifically in this case

970
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,119
Alfalfa there's a lot of different

971
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,480
Alfalfa cultivars out there with a lot

972
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,000
of different traits um so we want to

973
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,480
start to understand what traits are

974
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,079
important uh we're looking at alal with

975
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,000
different fall dormy values um different

976
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,800
kind of

977
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,079
phenotypes um we're also combining this

978
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,119
with different n rates and Megan's going

979
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,079
to be summarizing some of this research

980
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:26,599
you'll probably hear from her pretty

981
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,760
soon um on the other end of the spect

982
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:31,400
we're also looking at can we breed

983
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,200
intermediate wheat grass to be uh a

984
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,559
better partner in an intercropping

985
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:38,279
system what are the right traits of the

986
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:41,039
grass to help promote that facilitation

987
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,280
and balance that competition uh so we're

988
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:44,400
working with the Kern of breeders and we

989
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,560
have different lines with different

990
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,720
traits and we're intercropping those

991
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:51,559
with two different species alala and red

992
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,159
clover and also varying the uh

993
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:55,440
configuration just a little

994
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:58,279
bit last thing we're kind of interested

995
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,358
in is looking at mixtures of legumes and

996
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,000
this research is actually done we should

997
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:03,920
be writing this up pretty quick but we

998
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,800
did test different mixtures these

999
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,800
mixtures were actually handpicked from

1000
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,200
farmers in the different states um based

1001
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,079
on what they're interested in and used

1002
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,118
to working with so it was really a

1003
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,039
farmer informed study we're really

1004
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,119
excited to be analyzing that

1005
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,358
soon uh so I just want to acknowledge a

1006
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:21,640
whole bunch of people who contributed to

1007
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:24,000
this work these are past postdocs and

1008
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:25,559
graduate students who've graduated um

1009
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,838
since I joined the sustainable cropping

1010
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:32,119
systems lab like 2017 current post STS I

1011
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:33,960
really want to highlight research staff

1012
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:36,960
um these are really hard experiments to

1013
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,400
do and very complex and they do such an

1014
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,838
amazing job um at making these things

1015
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,000
work it just blows my mind every day so

1016
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:46,000
mad props to the research staff and then

1017
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,519
current students who are working on this

1018
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,719
um also all the summer undergraduate

1019
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:52,719
interns who uh sweat a lot and fight off

1020
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:55,078
insects during the summer to collect

1021
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:56,959
this valuable data um want to

1022
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,280
acknowledge teammates at University of

1023
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,440
Minnesota and then definitely the what I

1024
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,800
call perennial crop Pioneers these are

1025
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,000
farmers who I've had the pleasure of

1026
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,400
working with um a lot of these folks

1027
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,800
have hosted on Farm trials and uh meet

1028
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,440
with to inform our research goals and

1029
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,119
priorities um they've taken a big risk

1030
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,280
in uh not just working with us but also

1031
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,880
trying to advance this perennial crop

1032
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,720
vision and thanks to the funders and

1033
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,680
that's all I got so I think I take some

1034
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:25,239
questions you have plenty of time for

1035
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,679
questions

1036
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:29,519
here you want to call people up yeah

1037
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:30,838
just check in the zoom chat there's none

1038
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,559
there yet

1039
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:35,799
so yeah this was a really cool talk one

1040
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:37,719
of the things I was curious about when

1041
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,960
you were talking about the threee study

1042
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:42,000
and you were talking about nitrogen in

1043
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,880
your grain yield and how that

1044
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,760
corresponds to protein did you ever

1045
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,079
measure the protein in the grain

1046
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,280
specifically compared with the

1047
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,960
monoculture as opposed to just total

1048
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,000
nitrogen and the biomass I don't think

1049
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,559
we have and that would be a good thing

1050
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,119
to do um the protein so because it's

1051
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:04,279
really interesting kza does have higher

1052
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,880
protein levels uh per unit of grain than

1053
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,519
wheat so that's one of the selling

1054
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,160
points of actually of kernza high

1055
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:12,039
protein grain um so that should be

1056
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:15,920
looked at I don't think we we analyzed

1057
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:18,800
that it's a good point thanks for

1058
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,039
that go ahead hi thank you thank you

1059
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,480
very much I'm wondering side of the

1060
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:26,759
nitrogen fixed BYU may not compensate

1061
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,679
nitrogen

1062
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:34,359
yeah if you I think those you are

1063
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:36,960
thinking about biomass how about soil

1064
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:39,318
nitrogen how about soil nitrogen as it

1065
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,199
and what was the contribution of that to

1066
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:44,599
the nitrogen that if you include soil

1067
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:48,078
nitrogen

1068
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:50,079
that yeah well I think um I didn't show

1069
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:54,200
this but we did see a depletion in soal

1070
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:56,480
nitrogen through time um so the it

1071
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:58,558
appears that the intermediate weak grass

1072
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,280
was using nitrogen that was being

1073
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:03,920
mineralized from organic matter through

1074
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,040
time um because we saw that uh and now

1075
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,960
we have this spurred some new

1076
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:10,199
experiments so we're actually now

1077
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,920
quantifying nitrogen mineralization

1078
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:15,838
rates in intercrop versus monoculture

1079
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,318
systems um so that is sort of an

1080
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,440
unanswered question that we're trying to

1081
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:23,759
get at right now by collecting some new

1082
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,480
data um yeah hopefully that can help us

1083
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,839
uh understand this these outcomes a

1084
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,159
little bit more

1085
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:33,719
yeah thanks for that excellent

1086
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:36,239
presentation J what do you think uh like

1087
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:39,679
why do you think kza is so variable in

1088
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:42,358
its responses to things like red clover

1089
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,318
and and just management I mean you point

1090
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:46,480
this out in your uh

1091
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:49,400
presentation you know different studies

1092
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,679
having different results and and that

1093
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,240
can also be found things like mowing

1094
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:56,719
oration like some sites certain

1095
00:43:55,239 --> 00:44:00,679
practices help

1096
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:03,480
others it doesn't what makes so

1097
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:05,399
variable it's an open pollinated uh

1098
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,639
species for one thing and I think the

1099
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,000
genetics are part of it it's there's a

1100
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:11,400
lot of variability so this isn't like

1101
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,519
wheat where you look out of the field

1102
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,599
and all looks homogeneous and the same

1103
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:18,960
you have plants that are different uh

1104
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:20,599
sizes in terms of stature and um

1105
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,960
different number of seed heads per plant

1106
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:24,599
and there's just a lot of genetic

1107
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,159
variability out there and a lot of just

1108
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:27,760
variability in the phenotypes as well

1109
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:31,318
and even a given field so I think that's

1110
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,760
one reason um another is that not all of

1111
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:35,079
these Studies have been conducted with

1112
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,520
the exact same agronomics like seating

1113
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:40,519
rate row spacing time of seating so when

1114
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:42,199
we compare those some of those lium

1115
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:43,719
intercropping studies from other

1116
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:46,799
institutions and things we kind of have

1117
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:49,639
to be aware of what differences there

1118
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,039
were for just a basic agronomics um

1119
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:54,159
Baseline soil nitrogen

1120
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:56,558
levels uh there just a lot of things

1121
00:44:54,159 --> 00:45:00,799
that kind of that could confound the

1122
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:02,519
treatments in these studies um there's

1123
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,160
recently been one meta analysis that

1124
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:06,440
just came out um from some collaborators

1125
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:08,000
of mine at the University of Minnesota

1126
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,200
trying to account for those differences

1127
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,838
and all the studies that were conducted

1128
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,679
in

1129
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:13,960
Minnesota um so I can point you to that

1130
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:16,279
paper if you want to dig into the weeds

1131
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,280
a little

1132
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:24,480
bit go ahead ch um yes maybe a bigger

1133
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:28,160
picture question um so

1134
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,719
we I guess curious um someone on the

1135
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:33,558
Forefront uh where do you

1136
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:35,799
see graphs uh going you know let's say

1137
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:37,160
25 years like you know where you think

1138
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,318
it will go or where would you like to

1139
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:43,719
see okay yeah great question um I like I

1140
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:45,920
think for the next five to 10 years from

1141
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:47,919
now I think Growers should be thinking

1142
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,200
of it as a three-year crop that would

1143
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:53,760
fit into a rotation potentially

1144
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:55,598
following an alala stand um preferably

1145
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,800
in a situation where they can use the

1146
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,640
for forage uh that's going to be an

1147
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:03,079
economic safety net because the grain

1148
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:04,558
market is quite volatile right now um so

1149
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:06,359
in the in the near term that's kind of

1150
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,599
where I see it producers who can use the

1151
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:10,000
forage and are comfortable marketing

1152
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,400
their grain or working to Market their

1153
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,880
grain a little bit um and and there's

1154
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,559
probably going to be a premium too for

1155
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:19,519
organic regenerative organic

1156
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:22,079
specifically uh longer term so the plant

1157
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:24,838
breeders are thinking that if we stick

1158
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:28,359
on this the trajectory that we're at now

1159
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:32,078
for increasing C size um I think proban

1160
00:46:28,358 --> 00:46:34,159
said 23 years we'll have kernels that

1161
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,680
are the same size as spring wheat in

1162
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:38,960
Minnesota and that but now as the

1163
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:41,039
breeding program continues diversity is

1164
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,920
going to decrease so that rate might not

1165
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:46,920
increase but if we could hold that rate

1166
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:49,880
steady 23 years um so I I could see it

1167
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,519
be becoming less of a niche crop and

1168
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,079
more of a mainstream crop if we can

1169
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,079
achieve those

1170
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,800
yields

1171
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,629
[Music]

1172
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:22,239
okay

1173
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:30,358
experim yes always have first

1174
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,920
y

1175
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:40,400
yep yeah I'm super happy you brought

1176
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,639
that up um I do think weather is a

1177
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,680
really important confounding variable

1178
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:47,239
that's making it difficult to understand

1179
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:49,199
how yields are changing with stand age

1180
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:51,759
um we have some evidence that suggests

1181
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,480
that too um but in terms of the

1182
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,680
staggered start that's exactly where

1183
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,800
we're heading and we we've we've initi

1184
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,919
iated two experiments with a staggered

1185
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:04,400
start design um and what this means is

1186
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,838
we we start the experiment in one year

1187
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,480
um in in a randomized plot design and

1188
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:11,480
then the second year we plant the exact

1189
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,039
same treatments again third year plant

1190
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:18,639
the exact same treatments that way yeah

1191
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:21,838
we could tease apart stand age from year

1192
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:24,719
of growth uh so we just initiated this

1193
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:26,719
and we're planting the third year we're

1194
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:28,838
starting our third year of a study it's

1195
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:32,318
pretty much a nitrogen rate trial Stager

1196
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:33,799
start and we're we're quantifying um the

1197
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:36,039
fate of the nitrogen more

1198
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:39,359
comprehensively in this study and we're

1199
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:40,920
hiring a postto so I'm really happy you

1200
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,000
reminded me of that I brought the

1201
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,200
announcement and I'll uh send it to Matt

1202
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,239
and others and if that can be

1203
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:48,838
distributed that would be great um that

1204
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:50,118
job is open and um it's exciting time to

1205
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:52,239
join the team because there's some data

1206
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:55,838
there we got a couple more years of the

1207
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:57,759
project to go so excited about it your

1208
00:48:55,838 --> 00:49:01,960
trials do you ever have any extreme

1209
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:04,680
weather events so put itout yeah we've

1210
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,838
had unusually low precipitation values

1211
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:09,199
for probably two or three out of the

1212
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:11,880
years that I showed you the data I

1213
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:14,039
showed you Spann from probably 2017 to

1214
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,599
2023 and I think there were two or three

1215
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:21,400
years where there was uh like a

1216
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:23,519
statistical drought um and that's yeah

1217
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,920
tricky because we don't and not all

1218
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:29,480
these experiments have our Stager start

1219
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,639
um one of the motivations for doing that

1220
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,639
um so can that the effect of that

1221
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:36,440
drought be tease the part with

1222
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:38,440
Statistics I think in some cases it can

1223
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:42,280
and in a lot of the situations here

1224
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:44,679
we've just tried to to analyze the data

1225
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:47,359
based on the measure the response

1226
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:49,199
variables you know from comparing across

1227
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:50,960
treatments and then step two is to

1228
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:52,598
really dive in a little bit more and try

1229
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,679
to see if we can tease apart these

1230
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:56,160
year-to-year

1231
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:59,960
things yeah thinking along with line

1232
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:02,719
lines of ecosystem Services yep at some

1233
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:05,358
point did you ever measure uh soil

1234
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:08,480
health or to organic matter Dynamics in

1235
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:11,239
these two systems again thinking also

1236
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:14,519
from the Qui question maybe with carbon

1237
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:18,358
credit yeah becoming a thing yeah in the

1238
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:21,960
next 20 years that be potential at peral

1239
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:23,480
cing system the um the PO the folks who

1240
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,240
are going to make products with kurza

1241
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,599
and sell those are really hoping that we

1242
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:29,318
measure that data soon because they want

1243
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,960
to Market those environmental benefits

1244
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:33,599
specifically those related to soil

1245
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,440
health and carbon uh and we have been

1246
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:39,480
measuring um some of those variables J

1247
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:42,280
scoot connect my collaborator at du um

1248
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,920
leads a lot of that work and um some of

1249
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,240
those studies are are really close to

1250
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,960
being published actually one was

1251
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:50,039
published by maner rockar um egg

1252
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,960
ecosystems environment

1253
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:56,279
2023 and um she looks at enzyme

1254
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:58,039
activities microbial biomass PL FAS all

1255
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,920
that sort of stuff in response to kernz

1256
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:02,838
on and annual crops there's one question

1257
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:06,200
on the zoom can I take that one quick we

1258
00:51:02,838 --> 00:51:08,119
have enough time sure it's Sandra uh if

1259
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:09,480
you have to leave it certainly yeah feel

1260
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:11,559
free to step out if you have to as far

1261
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,039
as forthcoming breeding work with kernza

1262
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:15,880
which traits will be focused on as a

1263
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,318
priority grain size kernel size is

1264
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,720
number one grain yield is what we want

1265
00:51:17,318 --> 00:51:22,159
to maximize um but a couple important

1266
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:24,039
traits include threshability so the

1267
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:26,199
grain retains its hall right now for the

1268
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:28,279
most part we want to have free threshing

1269
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:30,399
grain and then we also want to reduce

1270
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,640
shattering so it's still sort of a wild

1271
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,798
plant and if farmer Waits too long seed

1272
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:37,358
falls off loses yield and uh we actually

1273
00:51:35,798 --> 00:51:39,599
have recruitment in the field and that

1274
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:41,759
causes some problems so those are the

1275
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:45,359
main traits we're focusing

1276
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,359
on all right let's get

1277
