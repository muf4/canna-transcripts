this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:06,229
University

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,289
we are late for lunch so I will make

4
00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:12,500
this brief but hopefully challenging is

5
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:14,538
well New York Farm Bureau's and advocacy

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,210
organization spent a lot of time here at

7
00:00:14,538 --> 00:00:19,189
the Capitol lobbying legislators in

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,650
staff on a whole host of agricultural

9
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:23,600
issues including soil health a lot of

10
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:25,309
people we actually lobby here so I want

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,140
to thank the people from the Senate the

12
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:29,359
assembly staff for being here in this

13
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,359
much it's real real testament to their

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,738
dedication so thank you how many people

15
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:36,219
here are from South of West Chester

16
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:36,218
County

17
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:44,378
that's good welcome but that's not

18
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:47,539
enough we have this whole soil health

19
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:52,000
equals farm profitability equation

20
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:55,219
nailed to the greatest extent I will

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,689
almost a great extent we have a lot of

22
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:00,228
legislative partners from upstate New

23
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:03,679
York who help with incentives the pass

24
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:07,549
incentives legislation for soil carbon

25
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,959
sequestration we have people from taking

26
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:12,618
your championing Environmental

27
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,389
Protection Fund in AEM program

28
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:17,959
Nonpoint program I don't lose a

29
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:20,210
Brazilian farming but that's not enough

30
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:24,079
there's 20 million people in New York

31
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:27,019
State this is us we are the 40 percent

32
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,269
upstate people with representation

33
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:31,549
there's a whole other 60 percent Long

34
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:35,259
Island in the five boroughs in Manhattan

35
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:38,719
who don't really honestly care about

36
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:41,450
soil health but we are in the sweet spot

37
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,920
though there's always a lot of to borrow

38
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,259
a phrase from one of the earlier sides

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,599
slides a lot of cussing and fussing

40
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:49,000
about agriculture here in Albany and

41
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,368
even within our industry whether it's

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,420
GMO versus conventional whether it's

43
00:01:52,368 --> 00:01:59,780
pesticide use labor issues big versus

44
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,969
small this issue is not one of those

45
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,060
custom custom issues because we can tell

46
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:07,939
the story to farm allegedly of districts

47
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,189
about farm profitability that comes from

48
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:12,289
soil health but even more importantly we

49
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:15,979
can start talking to urban legislators

50
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:20,389
about climate change in the mitigation

51
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:23,449
impacts that soil health has they care

52
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:26,179
about much more frankly about climate

53
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:28,789
change in place will health and our

54
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,739
mission our goal is to tell that story

55
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:32,989
this has been a lot of farmer-to-farmer

56
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:34,789
stuff and that's really needed because

57
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:38,060
we need to extend this knowledge base

58
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:39,739
across the state but we can't ignore the

59
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,030
work that's done here because this

60
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:43,580
conference wouldn't have happened

61
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,640
without state funding

62
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,799
Dave's programs the research wouldn't

63
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,119
happen without state funding EPF funding

64
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:51,469
for AEM

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,469
Patrick hooker talking about extending

66
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:56,658
technical knowledge in technical advice

67
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:59,979
on soil health and the AEM program

68
00:02:56,658 --> 00:03:03,709
wouldn't happen without state support

69
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:05,329
funding in legislation and so I guess my

70
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:09,199
challenge and the short time I have

71
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,180
today is to say let this not be the only

72
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,878
time that you come to Albany to talk

73
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,010
about soil health we need to continue

74
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:18,859
this drumbeat the well legislative

75
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:21,378
session throughout the year with

76
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,420
legislators and staff because there's so

77
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:26,479
many issues out there that are outside

78
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:29,149
of Agriculture that they are hit with

79
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,679
every single day this needs to be one of

80
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,840
those issues as well or else oh forget

81
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,569
about it and this issue is far far too

82
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,359
important far far far too many powerful

83
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:40,009
legs to have that happen so that's the

84
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:44,810
challenge and mouse time for lunch thank

85
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:48,378
