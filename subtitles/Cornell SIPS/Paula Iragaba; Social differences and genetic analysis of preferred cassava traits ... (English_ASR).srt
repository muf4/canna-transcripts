00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,780
hello everyone my name is Khalil Ogawa

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:16,079
and I'm happy to share with you my

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:19,199
research on cassava touch preferences of

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,329
smaller farmers in Uganda in this

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,730
picture the farmer was telling me that

8
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:28,589
he was impressed by the use of this

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:31,469
cassava plant cassava is an important

10
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:35,219
source of food and it is estimated that

11
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:38,759
over 500 million people eat cassava on a

12
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,649
daily basis and in Uganda where I come

13
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:44,519
from cassava is our second most

14
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:46,769
important staple food crop all the parts

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,340
of the cassava plant are usually in one

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:53,910
way or another but for food we normally

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,700
use the cassava roots over the recent

18
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:59,849
past a lot of efforts have been focused

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:04,469
on improving cassava for agronomic

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:08,570
traits our butter has been less emphasis

21
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:11,658
put on researching on improving quality

22
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:14,728
preferences most especially those of

23
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:17,850
women who do a lot of work regarding

24
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:20,969
cassava production and processing and

25
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:23,728
hence this consequently our limits the

26
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:27,569
adoption and usage of improved cassava

27
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:29,789
varieties hence there is need to link

28
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:34,949
FAMAS knowledge to that of the breeders

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:37,440
and my work will be trying to address to

30
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,260
contribute to $1 wings they are

31
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,798
knowledge gap in three different ways

32
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:46,409
the first one will be to identify the

33
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,070
traits differences of smaller farmers

34
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:53,280
then second they will be to optimize the

35
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:57,688
phenotypes phenotyping protocols for the

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,939
identified trees and the studies to

37
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:01,938
understand the genetic basis of the

38
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:05,658
preferred trait

39
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:08,579
our first study was aimed at

40
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:12,209
identification as cassava traits

41
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,790
differences of smaller farmers we

42
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:17,599
conducted this study in four districts

43
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:19,429
in Uganda and

44
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,129
we had a number of factors that we'll

45
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,950
consider to select the four districts

46
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:28,490
which included were interested in areas

47
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:31,159
with high cassava production high

48
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:36,710
diversity of land races and low disease

49
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:41,539
pressure so within each district we

50
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:44,030
randomly selected 128 farmers stratified

51
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:47,620
by age and sex to participate in the

52
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:50,569
study and we collected the data by

53
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,599
holding focus group discussions with

54
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:55,159
small groups of farmers and

55
00:02:52,599 --> 00:03:00,799
administering some structured interviews

56
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:03,169
to individual farmers in total we had we

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:09,080
had started to focus group discussions

58
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:12,619
and administered 192 interviews we also

59
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:17,720
collected cassava leaf samples from all

60
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:21,890
the farmers fields our window cover with

61
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:23,479
on the older pummels with inversion to

62
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:26,589
the cassava varieties that they were

63
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:29,419
growing and this will help us to

64
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,960
understand the genetic diversity of the

65
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:36,159
familes

66
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:39,760
cultivars during the data collection the

67
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:43,549
farmers responses were handwritten and

68
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:48,289
but as a measure for quality control we

69
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:50,390
also did audio recordings so one the

70
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:53,599
first steps we did in processing the

71
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:59,139
data was to convert the handwritten

72
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:02,299
notes to the digital format and do the

73
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:06,259
transcription of the audio recording

74
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,939
store documents and lesser translate the

75
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:10,759
word documents from the three-row core

76
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:14,060
language is to English then we did the

77
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:15,949
data analysis using SPSS which is the

78
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:21,680
software that is commonly used for

79
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:24,289
analyzing social science data one of the

80
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,329
questions we ask the farmers was to tell

81
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:30,919
us the different legs above the cassava

82
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:34,930
varieties that they were blowing

83
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:39,049
and in this graph I'm showing the top

84
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:43,639
the top nine traits that the summation

85
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:47,028
on x-axis the Tres with the stars are

86
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:49,400
what some are mentioned but they are

87
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:52,999
currently not being addressed in the

88
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:56,408
breeding program so much as the family

89
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:59,930
are interested in high-yielding

90
00:04:56,408 --> 00:05:02,149
customers with edema chirring they also

91
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,449
mentioned that they wanted customer

92
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:08,478
groups that castle varieties who do get

93
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:11,468
soft on boiling and whose roots can show

94
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,468
a longer in ground

95
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:18,528
we also asked the farmers to tell us the

96
00:05:15,468 --> 00:05:24,168
different ways in which they eat cassava

97
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:27,848
and in inhale the boiled form of had the

98
00:05:24,168 --> 00:05:30,258
highest proportion fold by the front and

99
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:33,228
the lives were had the smallest

100
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:36,288
proportion so the other question we

101
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:39,408
asked was to tell us about the different

102
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:42,408
attributes of cassava that we are

103
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:45,740
desirable for for it to be eaten in each

104
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:48,829
of these phones and in this graph I'm

105
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:52,189
showing the subservient traits that they

106
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:56,079
mentioned that were priority for the

107
00:05:52,189 --> 00:06:01,550
cassava to be eaten in the boiled form

108
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:04,430
as in the previous bar graph the trips

109
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:07,038
with the stars are what the farmers

110
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,250
mention but are currently not being

111
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:15,728
addressed in the breeding program and

112
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:19,310
for my next to my next two studies have

113
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:23,598
decided to focus on softness of the

114
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:26,528
cassava roots because currently it was

115
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:28,968
mentioned as the number one trick for

116
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:30,978
cassava to bitten the world foam but

117
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:36,889
currently it's not being addressed in

118
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:40,189
the breeding program so the next study

119
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:45,009
will be aimed at optimizing the

120
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:45,009
protocols we can use to measure softness

121
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:55,889
we established the trail to use for this

122
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:59,640
today in 2015 as to face in Uganda using

123
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:04,110
augmented block design and the genotypes

124
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:06,120
that we used we're 210 accession that

125
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:10,110
will collected from the farmers who

126
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,709
participated in the survey along with 70

127
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:17,069
vendors who will vote from the breeding

128
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:21,799
program in Uganda then we have vested

129
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:24,629
arm this trial last year in October and

130
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:29,819
Travis who collected the cassava loot

131
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:32,040
samples which are being analyzed before

132
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:39,060
biochemical properties that might relate

133
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:42,090
to softness so when we go to the

134
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,519
laboratory with boiled the equal

135
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:47,909
sections of the cassava root at a

136
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:52,918
constant temperature and we measured

137
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:56,340
softness using the electrometer and this

138
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:59,939
is the picture for the parameter for

139
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:04,709
those who are not familiar we we are

140
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:09,240
also analyzing the samples for different

141
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:13,620
biochemical properties that may that may

142
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:16,319
correlate to the quality preferences and

143
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,959
this could be there is a leading this

144
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,779
because if they are more highly

145
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,149
heritable and higher created to the

146
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:26,879
quality preferences that we identified W

147
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:35,610
- Code Blue in direct reading for those

148
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:38,490
traits in this prod in this program I am

149
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:42,870
showing the phenotypic variations for

150
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:45,180
the results we got for softness using

151
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:50,399
the combined data set from the two sides

152
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:52,859
and on the y axis this is the force this

153
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,559
is on the y axis is the force that was

154
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,789
used to penetrate through the loops

155
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,729
after we boiled them

156
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:01,559
and on the x-axis the different time

157
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,820
intervals at which we measured the

158
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:09,269
softness and one thing to say as we

159
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,370
increase the same of boiling dub you the

160
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:14,039
first you used to penetrate through the

161
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:18,299
loops goes on decreasing and this is

162
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:22,939
because as we boiled the roots they get

163
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:24,089
softer we also consider the blood

164
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,650
Sensibility

165
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:32,370
using Joomla Roland's method and once

166
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:35,009
observed is the serviceability estimate

167
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:38,399
increases also increase the time of

168
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:41,279
waiting but as we move from 45 minutes

169
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,919
to 60 minutes the health ability

170
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,740
estimate becomes law and this is because

171
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:50,519
of at sixty minutes most of the loop

172
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:56,750
samples have overcooked and it becomes

173
00:09:50,519 --> 00:10:00,840
hard to precisely measure softness so

174
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:04,019
the analysis is still ongoing and once

175
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,940
we complete rest will render the

176
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,340
correlations between the basecoat

177
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,430
biochemical properties and the quality

178
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,620
preferences and for the biochemical

179
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:16,469
properties that are highly related to

180
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,389
softness we will establish the scoring

181
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:23,820
skills that can be used for the

182
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:29,460
measurement our last study is looking at

183
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:33,690
market rate associations for softness we

184
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:37,019
established to the trail to use last

185
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:40,230
year in October at 2000 Uganda using

186
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:46,980
augmented block design and we used a

187
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:50,700
diverse panel of 430 accession in this

188
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:54,149
picture arm this is a to destroy at one

189
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:57,120
of the site and we'll be harvesting the

190
00:10:54,149 --> 00:11:00,720
trial in October this year and you will

191
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,620
see no tape the loop samples for

192
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,769
softness using the protocol which we are

193
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,870
going to devote in study to

194
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,269
and then after that we'll perform a

195
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:15,029
genome-wide Association study to

196
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:17,519
identify markers across the genome that

197
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:24,480
are associated with genetic variation

198
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:27,809
for softness earlier on I said that we

199
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,259
also collected the cassava leaf samples

200
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:32,399
from the farmer's field during the

201
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,539
service

202
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:40,740
we have genotype 2 this one's and using

203
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:45,539
GBS and here I'm showing them the tips a

204
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:50,399
plot for the for the genotype data and

205
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:52,860
the different colors represent the four

206
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:58,230
districts where we collected the samples

207
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:02,009
and one thing to note is much as they

208
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:04,680
are some related genotypes grown across

209
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:08,549
all retinas across all the districts

210
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:14,059
there are some genotypes that are only

211
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:17,250
grown in some locations and this could

212
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:21,509
explain some of the differences that we

213
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:24,330
observed across the that some of the

214
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:29,429
differences in quality preferences

215
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:32,520
across the districts and the genetic

216
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:35,579
diversity of the formals materials could

217
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,620
also be exploited by the breeders to

218
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:42,030
improve cassava for the quality

219
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:45,659
sequences of smaller farmers so in

220
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:50,039
summary we have been able to identify

221
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:52,829
the trade preferences that are important

222
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:55,529
to smallholder farmers and we are

223
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,900
currently optimizing protocols that we

224
00:12:55,529 --> 00:13:03,059
can use to measure some of the

225
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:06,059
identified traits and we'll be doing the

226
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:08,549
genetic studies to help us understand

227
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:11,099
the genetic architecture for the

228
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:13,529
identified traits and all this

229
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,810
information will be useful to the

230
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:18,870
breeders in designing appropriate

231
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:21,029
reading strategies for the preferred

232
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,029
tricks

233
