1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,000
University okay great yes no thanks for

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,960
the invitation to do this it was very

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,960
nice to meet uh way back earlier in the

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,320
year liby over in

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,960
Cambridge um so yeah the the

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,518
presentation I'm going to give you today

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,439
is um entitled defining the core

9
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:25,959
infection biology of the wheat pathogen

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,118
as I'm seor tritici through multiomic

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,240
approaches so I'm a member of

12
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:32,000
rothamstead research that I'll int uce

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,920
in a moment in the department of

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,840
protecting crops in the

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,640
environment ah there we go okay yeah so

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,399
in answer to the question about how old

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,239
we

18
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:45,399
are um as far as I'm aware we are one of

19
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:47,679
the world's oldest agricultural research

20
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,679
institutes so we are based about 20

21
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,519
kilometers north of London in the United

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,399
Kingdom we were established in about

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,120
1843 by the gentleman in the top left uh

24
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,320
corner of the picture there Sir John

25
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,718
Bennett

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,600
lws and as such we've been sort of

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,879
Hosting some of the longest um

28
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,960
continuous AG agronomic experiments that

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,840
are that are currently known a notable

30
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,039
one is one we call on a field called

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,040
broad Bor which is a winter winter wheat

32
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,640
field and that experiment has been

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,118
pretty much running as long as

34
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,319
rothamstead has been going since about

35
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,519
1844 and the ladies you can see on the

36
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,319
picture there have been storing away uh

37
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,438
wheat samples from that particular

38
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,559
experiment so um vegetative tissues root

39
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,279
tissues soil Etc

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,879
year on Year from that date for us to

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,079
analyze any point um in in the current

42
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,719
time and still going forward but I

43
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,559
really just show this slide to highlight

44
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,718
the fact that wheat has been a major

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,320
focus of of rothamstead research for a

46
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:50,519
long long time and it continues to be

47
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,279
so so in the presentation I'm going to

48
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:53,879
give today I'm going to start with some

49
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,359
key aspects of the pathogen and the

50
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,359
disease problem introducing it and then

51
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:01,478
I'm going to give you five time permits

52
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,000
uh many presentations if you like many

53
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:06,799
scientific um research areas that we're

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,239
working on um starting with looking at

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,439
pangenomics there's a method to identify

56
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,959
core genes for functional analysis I'll

57
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,959
give an update on some work we've been

58
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,640
doing on characterization of a core

59
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,080
virulence infector protein from the

60
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,000
pathogen I'll introduce what I call the

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,400
fast forward genetic screen for

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,120
virulence Gene Discovery with a focus

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,599
currently on cell wall uh and then I'll

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
touch on the what we call the Abraham

65
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:32,719
Wald essential Gene screen

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,719
and the associated mutant collection and

67
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,318
at the end I'll shift tracks a little

68
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,359
bit and talk about some work that we've

69
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:41,799
done using this fungus as a tool for the

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,080
discovery of new microb derived crop

71
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,080
protection

72
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:51,480
products okay so the most important uh

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,680
Folia wheat pathogen um of wheat in the

74
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:57,399
UK is zeporia trii uh it causes septor

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,280
tritide blotch disease which you can see

76
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,319
in the picture in the middle there you

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,560
end up with necrotic lesions bearing

78
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,119
asexual sporulation structures waiting

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,840
for rainsplash to propagate the the

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,560
disease onto onto new areas of the

81
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,598
vegetative tissue so the ultimate cost

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,000
of the disease is through loss of

83
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,479
photosynthetic uh capacity um and this

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,439
is currently the number one disease

85
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:22,639
problem for UK and European wheat

86
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,239
Farmers um to put that in perspective Uh

87
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:28,158
current calculations have have suggested

88
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:31,319
that 70% of all fungicides that are

89
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:33,519
applied on arable land in Europe in

90
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,318
Western Europe in particular are applied

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,438
principally to control this disease the

92
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:39,318
farmers really do not want this disease

93
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:42,239
to get into their wheat crop so that is

94
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:44,518
is economic and environmental

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,480
footprint it's a representative species

96
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,400
of the globally important aium I class

97
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,959
of pant

98
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,400
pathogens and importantly really I think

99
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,560
um for today's presentation and and for

100
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,360
the system as a whole is it's long been

101
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,719
regarded uh long been known to be a

102
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,599
rapidly evolving pathogen with a highly

103
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,799
flexible sexual reproductive system very

104
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,280
unstable genome lots and lots of ways of

105
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,799
shuffling the deck in terms of

106
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,079
genomics and it's been a model system

107
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,560
for looking at uh pathogen uh population

108
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,720
Dynamics well before we ever sequenced

109
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,839
any any pathogen genomes so it's a model

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,520
organism for rapidly evolving

111
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,799
species and it's haid in all but it's

112
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,359
sexual phase which AIDS some of the work

113
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,319
which you'll hear about today that we do

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,000
on it and in control in terms of

115
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,240
controlling this pathogen obviously due

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,399
to this rapid Evolution there is poor

117
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,600
host resistance and there is whenever

118
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:43,159
new fungicides are applied resistance uh

119
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,759
occurs very very quickly and gets fixed

120
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,479
and is prevalent in populations and

121
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,000
there currently is not one single

122
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,879
fungicide on the market if used in

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,800
isolation is effective against this

124
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,918
pathogen so basically what we need are

125
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,199
new Disease Control targets and and our

126
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:02,279
research um focuses on how we can

127
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,280
identify the weaknesses that could form

128
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:07,198
those

129
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:09,239
targets so uh to just give you our

130
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,478
overall research objectives and our

131
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,160
methods basically we need to understand

132
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,279
or we we're trying to understand the

133
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,840
genes and Pathways which enable Leaf

134
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,918
infection but also more recently we've

135
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,079
been starting to look in at the

136
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,719
potential genes and Pathways that might

137
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,038
be essential for life because these are

138
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,160
also potentially useful targets for

139
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,639
Disease

140
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,000
Control so therefore we focus on things

141
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,600
that we think will hopefully prove

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,639
useful in the mid near or or long term

143
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,000
for future Disease Control interventions

144
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,560
whatever they may be the sort of methods

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,560
we use are comparative genomics and B

146
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,120
informatics we use functional genomics

147
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,478
and transformation so we can make

148
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,399
Knockouts we can overexpress genes and

149
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:51,758
we can very quick quickly and easily

150
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,918
generate uh random mutant libraries and

151
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,600
I'll show you some of that data

152
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:59,000
later uh whole genome sequencing is now

153
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,759
very affordable so we can use that to

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,800
identify mutations and to look at the um

155
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,479
variation in pathogen populations

156
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,199
between between strains um for for

157
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,279
pangenomics and then we' obviously

158
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,639
conduct infection assay do microscopy uh

159
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,638
conduct biochemical characterization and

160
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,918
so

161
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,519
on and one of the key things that we've

162
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:22,399
been exploiting um in our research is a

163
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,519
very unusual characteristic of this

164
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,159
particular fungus in that

165
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:30,560
it's classified as being

166
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,520
dimorphic so in certain growth condition

167
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,360
this particular fungus will grow almost

168
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,000
as yeastlike colonies which you can see

169
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,680
in the in in the left hand side of the

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,399
slide there and these are not directly

171
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,639
plant pathogenic because to become a

172
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,239
pathogen to infect wheat leaves these

173
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,079
must germinate these cells must

174
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,038
germinate Hy to go in through stamata to

175
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,000
start

176
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:52,159
colonization and that can be triggered

177
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,079
also in vitro by switching those

178
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,879
colonies onto low nutrients or high

179
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,839
temperatures on low nutrient AAR for

180
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,120
example water AAR there which simul

181
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,560
effectively what happens on the leaf

182
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,879
surface and and those yeastlike spores

183
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,360
start to germinate Hy which enable the

184
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,000
the fungus to penetrate the stamata and

185
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,800
and begin the early phases of infection

186
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,120
so this is a very simple laboratory

187
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,319
assay which forms the good b a very good

188
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,918
basis for a for a genetic screen to

189
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,560
identify core virulence genes basically

190
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:26,399
if your particular mutant of this

191
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,519
particular fungus um gets locked in the

192
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,878
yeast light State and cannot transition

193
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,598
into the hle grow State you pretty got a

194
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,400
good chance that it's not going to be

195
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:36,800
pathogenic on wheat so you're you're

196
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,799
getting into into virulence

197
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,720
genes just to reinforce that and make it

198
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,639
very very obvious and clear is that uh

199
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,560
what this also enables is gives you

200
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,038
great power for looking at genetics and

201
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,720
genomics whereby if you look at a single

202
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,800
standard AAR plate for zeptor trisi you

203
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,840
can have hundreds to a thousand

204
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,038
genotypes whether they're natural

205
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:01,918
populations or or induced mutants

206
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:03,719
um whereas a similar plate for most of

207
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,240
the fungi that you might be aware of

208
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,199
you'll have a single genotype colonizing

209
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,079
an entire plate so it it really does

210
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,639
bulk up the power you have for doing

211
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:15,279
functional genomics types analysis on

212
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,560
this

213
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,918
system the other um important feature

214
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,478
was that obviously we've had fully

215
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,598
sequenced genomes for some time uh we

216
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:28,000
tend to work on this one which is one of

217
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,918
the um globally accepted um reference uh

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,559
strains of this pathogen and it's called

219
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:36,559
ipo323 you can see here the the fully

220
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:39,759
finished Genome of ipo323 which was done

221
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,359
wow some time ago now by the jgi uh over

222
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:44,200
in the US and it was at the time it was

223
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,800
the first complete finished genome for

224
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,000
any fungus so quite a scoop really for

225
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,159
what was then called micos graminicola

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,240
before it now became more recently ayos

227
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:56,480
spor tritide you can see there all all

228
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,919
the um in the red bars all the different

229
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,800
genes that are predicted and where they

230
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,958
are on those chromosomes and you can see

231
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:04,399
for this particular iser we have 21

232
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:07,078
chromosomes now an interesting feature

233
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,720
and slightly confusing feature of this

234
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:10,838
organism is that those small chromosomes

235
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,720
14 to

236
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:16,320
21 can be lost and gained in natural

237
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,120
populations and they can also be lost in

238
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,440
experiments as I frequently find which

239
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,560
drives me a little bit crazy uh you can

240
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,079
start an experiment with ipo323 with 21

241
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,439
chromosomes and you can finish your

242
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:29,919
experiment even though you're not trying

243
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,959
to affect the chromosomes with 20 or

244
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,078
less so these are highly unstable and

245
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,039
therefore they're likely to be

246
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:38,479
dispensable for virulence because

247
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:41,159
natural wheat infecting path strains of

248
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,440
this fungus can lack any number of those

249
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,919
small

250
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,440
chromosomes another important feature is

251
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,199
which is a bug bear of mine and what I

252
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,360
really want to get into going forward is

253
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,519
that typical of most filamentous fungi

254
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,560
actually typical of most UK cariot uh if

255
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,879
you like is that still 40% of the coding

256
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,559
genes present in genomes are are of

257
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,200
unknown function so these are the sort

258
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,199
of things that are predicted

259
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,000
hypothetical proteins proteins with

260
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,720
domain of unknown functions etc etc so

261
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,879
there's a lot of stuff we don't

262
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,759
understand about fungal genomes and

263
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,439
probably eukaryotic genomes in um in

264
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,958
general and this is something that I'm

265
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,760
I'm trying to address in future and I'll

266
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,319
hopefully show you how we plan to do

267
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:25,919
that going forward throughout the

268
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,600
presentation so the other key aspect of

269
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,799
for the work we do is to look at the

270
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,159
virulence assays of the fungus on wheat

271
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,919
leaves uh this was one of the better

272
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:39,159
experiments we ever did way back in the

273
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:41,639
day where we set up a an attached Leaf

274
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:44,000
um infection assay where which you can

275
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,839
see here is where we put spores on the

276
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,958
surface of a wheat leaf and we can

277
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,440
photograph it every single day in this

278
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,799
case it's from day 14 to day

279
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,440
18 and what you can see is this very

280
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,159
long period of symptomless colon

281
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,360
colonization at the start where you're

282
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,958
not actually sure whether you put the

283
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,800
fungus on you you think it's not going

284
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:04,319
to happen at all but then typically

285
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,319
around about 10 11 12 13 days you start

286
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,959
to see some discoloration and collapse

287
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,440
of the tissue and by 14 day onwards you

288
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,599
seem that that very same area where you

289
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,560
applied the spores on completely

290
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,240
collapse and be necrotic and dry and

291
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,039
bear those pic Nidia those fungal

292
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,039
sporulation structures so the way we set

293
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,759
this up obviously it allows us to do

294
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,199
many many different quantitative

295
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:29,639
measurements for for aggressiveness of

296
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,600
strains for host resistance but also to

297
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,120
test induced mutants of xpor that we

298
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,360
make in the lab for any loss of

299
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,560
virulence or reduction in virulence and

300
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,399
we can score that by any change in the

301
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:44,239
time taken to disease symptoms or any um

302
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,600
difference in the leaf area where we

303
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,720
inoculate that actually establish

304
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,560
symptoms and also we can measure the

305
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,800
levels of fungal sporulation in the

306
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,399
tissue simply by washing spores from the

307
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,639
tissue or by qpcr methods so a very

308
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,120
quantitative assay that again forms a

309
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,039
basis of what we do much of what what we

310
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,320
do okay and now I'm going to touch on

311
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,719
one of the first mini scientific areas

312
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,399
that we've been working on and this is

313
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,200
unpublished data actually no it is

314
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,958
published data this one some of the

315
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,278
other stuff is unpublished so this is

316
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:17,439
exploiting pathogen pangenomics to

317
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:19,799
prioritize core genes for functional

318
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,240
analysis so whether or not you're aware

319
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:24,479
of Pang genomes but everybody now is

320
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,198
starting to generate Pang genomes for

321
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,759
whatever species uh they are working on

322
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:32,759
scientifically biologically and the Pang

323
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,759
genome in summary is the sum of all

324
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,399
genes that you might expect to see in

325
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:40,039
the entire species basically so each

326
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,360
individual will have a core set of genes

327
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:44,679
but then each individual and will will

328
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,560
contribute its own unique set of genes

329
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:48,198
to the

330
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:52,000
mix and if you sequence enough

331
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:54,359
individuals you will start to re reduce

332
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,360
the size of the core if you like a set

333
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,240
of genes that are present and functional

334
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,199
in the entire species but you will also

335
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,879
start to uncover some of the genetic

336
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:06,198
variation uh which we term accessory

337
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:09,000
genes that potentially allow the

338
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:11,078
selective interactions of pathogens for

339
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,559
example with changing environments and

340
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:16,759
the larger that the size of that

341
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:19,399
accessory or unique uh fraction is the

342
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,600
greater adaptil adaptil of the species

343
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:24,000
is thought to have uh to change to

344
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,440
environmental stresses but I thought

345
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,078
about this in a different term so what I

346
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,800
really wanted to do and you realize that

347
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,239
zos sepor is going to going to be super

348
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:34,559
diverse and it's going to try and

349
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,039
Shuffle the deck as often as it can but

350
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,518
surely there will be stuff in there that

351
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:40,679
it can't Shuffle so the idea for us was

352
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,759
to try and Define and to harden down on

353
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,879
what is the core genes so the likely

354
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,399
Gene set that are indispensible for the

355
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,480
lifestyle of all of all the individuals

356
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,759
of this pathogen because we thought

357
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,519
within there there could be some

358
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,759
interesting new potential targets for

359
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,320
future Disease

360
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,440
Control so we did a little pangenome

361
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,000
analysis not as big as as some others

362
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,120
have done but a very focused and

363
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,958
targeted one which we started with

364
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,519
reannotating uh the IPO 323 uh genome

365
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:12,758
which needed a little bit of work and

366
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,360
then we took genome sequences of of 17

367
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:17,440
other European isolates that we

368
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,240
collected as far west as Ireland and as

369
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,199
far east as as as

370
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Poland uh we pathotype them all on on

371
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,439
all on wheat genotypes and selected very

372
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,079
aggressive strains and then we also did

373
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,920
RNA sequencing on those strains so the

374
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,479
majority of those strains as well

375
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,198
including in culture and during

376
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,159
infection and effectively we built a pan

377
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:42,120
genome which was about just short of

378
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:44,600
18,000 genes from all this data and then

379
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,720
we assigned them as either core or

380
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,639
accessory so the core genes were we

381
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,160
assigned as being so due to being

382
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,039
present in all isolates with no loss of

383
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:58,519
function mutations in any of the uh of

384
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,120
the isolates and they were all expressed

385
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,560
by all of the the isolat so we didn't

386
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,480
have any particular strains where a gene

387
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,518
was present but was but had no

388
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,800
expression

389
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,078
support on the contrary something was uh

390
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,879
deemed accessory if it was missing from

391
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,359
one or more isolates had a loss of

392
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,078
function mutation in one or more

393
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,240
isolates or had no expression in one or

394
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:20,638
more isolates and the key point about

395
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,039
this is that you can see the size of the

396
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,560
accessory chromosome is almost as large

397
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,958
as the core and this fits well with with

398
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,919
other pangenome studies done on this on

399
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,958
this pathogen and and and again

400
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:35,000
reinforces the fact that this is a a a

401
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,799
species that is um capable of Rapid

402
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,039
Evolution it's a very uh large accessory

403
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:42,159
Gene set but we have started to then

404
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,759
drill into the core genes which was our

405
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,078
initial

406
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,360
objective so then what we started to do

407
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,078
was start to do something which was

408
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,680
perhaps a little bit crazy and simple at

409
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,239
the time but it's kind of worked and to

410
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,120
start to look at

411
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,799
variation um chromosome by chromosome in

412
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,560
terms of Gene uh Gene variation

413
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,120
expresses chromosome by chromosome and

414
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,919
Gene variation expresses genes to

415
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,399
compare and contrast firstly core and

416
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:13,039
accessible chromosomes but then also all

417
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,559
genes so we did this by looking at the

418
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:18,879
mutations we had in each um newly

419
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:21,719
sequenced um genome versus the ipo323

420
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,838
template and did a a simple snipf

421
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,839
mutation calling which gives you three

422
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,240
outputs for every Gene and every

423
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,319
mutation and whether it confers a low

424
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,720
effect I.E the the DNA sequence changes

425
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:34,479
but the amino acid stays the same where

426
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,519
there is a moderate effect on the

427
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,639
protein DNA sequence changes which

428
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,639
changes the amino acid or whether there

429
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,560
is a high effect the DNA sequence change

430
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,680
results in a loss of function mutation

431
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,838
such as a premature stop code on a frame

432
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,719
shift Etc and we just thought we'd have

433
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,560
a look what this looked like so looking

434
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,639
at it on average chromosome level um

435
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,719
data was was very very clear in a way

436
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:03,480
when you looked at all combine different

437
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,679
types of mutations High moderate and low

438
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,439
per Gene averaged over the chromosomes

439
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,480
which is the top graph there you can see

440
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,519
okay there was a little bit more uh

441
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,120
variation in the accessory chromosomes

442
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:18,359
of the core but not very much but once

443
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,838
you removed the low effect mutations

444
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,078
which don't induce amino acid changes

445
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:25,678
you started to see the blue bars in the

446
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:28,038
second graph down be much higher in the

447
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,480
accessory chromosomes than the core

448
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:32,400
chromosomes and then when you remove the

449
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,440
moderate effect mutations and go down to

450
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,400
the orange bars you can see that pretty

451
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,360
much the percentage of genes with high

452
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,120
effect mutations on those accessory

453
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,879
chromosomes are way way higher than the

454
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:47,519
average um number present on the core

455
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,720
chromosomes 1 to 13 and you get a mirror

456
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,400
image when you look at the gene

457
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,679
expression of every Gene averaged out on

458
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,320
those chromosomes whereby those small

459
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,120
chromosomes hardly Express at all

460
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,918
relative to the average expression on

461
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:03,359
genes on the C chromosomes so this was a

462
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,200
clear compartmentalization which we

463
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,678
suspected and had been partially

464
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,558
reported before but a clear

465
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,640
compartmentalization of the function and

466
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:13,960
structure of the core and accessory

467
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,280
chromosomes of the

468
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,360
pathogen then started to look at the

469
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:24,200
individual genes thinking whether we can

470
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:25,959
actually start to select genes um for

471
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,960
analysis based on the fact that they

472
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,960
might have lower mutations than expected

473
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,600
meaning the F the fungus is not really

474
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,400
shuffling the deck in their particular

475
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:37,599
case and just to test this out initially

476
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,679
we started doing some data mining on all

477
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,158
the published genes that were uh

478
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,320
available for for zeporia including our

479
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:47,159
own and we found divided them into three

480
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:49,798
categories and we looked at all the

481
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,760
genes that were experimentally shown and

482
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:54,038
published not to be required for

483
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,079
veilance those that have been required

484
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:59,599
for virence and also we defined by

485
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:01,759
orthology um the predict essential for

486
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,439
life geneses that are known from asilis

487
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,119
fumigatus and Drew them across to

488
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,320
zeporia ttii and then we looked at the

489
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:13,759
protein level uh polymorphism um in

490
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:15,798
terms of moderate um Snips um that we

491
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,359
can find in each of those and we found a

492
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:21,918
very simple um result here is that those

493
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,399
genes that are not required uh for

494
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,520
virulence had higher levels of

495
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,519
polymorphism in the population than

496
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,639
those that were required or those that

497
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,480
were predicted to be essential

498
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,200
so this gave us a sort of idea is that

499
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:37,000
can we use natural protein sequence

500
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,440
polymorphism to prioritize genes for

501
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,720
functional analysis can we actually

502
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,960
Identify some important new genes by

503
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:48,240
looking for low levels of

504
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:52,960
polymorphism and to test this in the lab

505
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:55,558
we had um um a tdna fungal mutant um so

506
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,519
we we generated this by random tdna

507
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:01,519
mutagenesis some years ago it was called

508
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:04,480
2310 so it was the 10th Colony picked

509
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:07,119
from experiment 23 That's the basis of

510
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,079
the name and way back we knew that this

511
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:13,119
particular mutant uh although it could

512
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:16,158
grow perfectly well on Rich AAR um and

513
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:18,918
it could generate hyy sorry it it could

514
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,799
not generate Hy on poor nutrient AAR and

515
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:24,240
it was uh severely impaired in virulence

516
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:25,679
on on wheat relative to the wild type as

517
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,798
you can see on the on the left side of

518
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,880
the slide so we did a whole genome

519
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:34,519
resequence of this particular strain and

520
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,960
we identified a 13 kilobase tdna um

521
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:39,440
Associated deletion which effectively

522
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,120
removed five genes from The genome of

523
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,679
this of this pathogen those genes are

524
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:48,839
are shown there a potential sip 51 SI C

525
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,798
p450 A methyl transferase a

526
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:53,279
transcription factor a nucleoside

527
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:56,599
diphosphate kinase and a glycoside hydr

528
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,599
is all gone in the 2310 mutant and then

529
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:01,918
when we started to look at the Pang

530
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:04,918
genome mutation rates amongst those five

531
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,038
genes in our mini population we started

532
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,320
to see quite clearly that Gene 4 which

533
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:12,640
is the ndk had far less sequence

534
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,399
polymorphism between strains than the

535
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,400
other genes present in that cluster and

536
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,120
conversely it was the most expressed

537
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,400
gene on average of all the genes in that

538
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:24,439
cluster okay so that was interesting so

539
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,200
we went does this mean anything in terms

540
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,400
of if we start to reintroduce those

541
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,400
genes one by one into the 20 310 mutant

542
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,720
can we actually restore veillance by

543
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,679
reintroducing any one of them so each

544
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,278
gene was reintroduced with its own

545
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:43,120
promotor back into the 2310 mutant by

546
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:46,359
transformation and very nicely for us I

547
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:48,798
suppose is that reintroduction of Gene 4

548
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:51,918
the ndk the nucleoside diphosphate

549
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:54,480
kinase uh was sufficient to restore full

550
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,360
virulence to the 2310

551
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,519
mutant uh and also restore the highill

552
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,839
growth um effect uh seen on water AAR so

553
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,639
that was kind of nice and and it

554
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:07,599
supports our idea that we're currently

555
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,759
running with that we can use pangenomics

556
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,759
as a useful predictive tool for Gene

557
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,759
functional prioriti

558
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,879
prioritization and one of the elements

559
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,359
that I'm going that we're currently

560
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,360
using this in that I'll come back to

561
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:20,558
later is to see whether we can really

562
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,079
get into core genes with current unknown

563
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:26,359
function that have low levels of

564
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,119
variation okay moving on to a second

565
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:30,158
little mini topic which follows on from

566
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:31,918
the Pand genome analysis tell you a

567
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,080
little bit about the identification and

568
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,080
characterization of a core secreted

569
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,319
virulence effector this project started

570
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,639
some years ago but we've updated it a

571
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,240
little bit recently and I think it's

572
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,360
potentially

573
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:47,278
interesting so there was one secreted a

574
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:51,558
gene encoding a secreted protein uh with

575
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:54,159
the lysm domains um that um is

576
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:56,119
consistently and very reproducibly

577
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,120
strongly expressed during infection by

578
00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:01,959
all strains of zeporia I what you can

579
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:04,158
see on the right side of the screen

580
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,440
there is what I call a wagon wheel plot

581
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,640
of of relative gene expression on the

582
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,558
very Outer Rim the numbers represent the

583
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,480
different strains we've tested the

584
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:15,678
pluses say that it was present and

585
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,200
functional in all of those strains and

586
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,159
then the C6 and N are the expression

587
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,400
data for growing in culture growing at

588
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,440
six days during plant infection and nine

589
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,320
days of plant infection so this

590
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,480
particular lysm um secreted protein

591
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:33,558
um was very very consistently and nicely

592
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,000
expressed in the same way by all strains

593
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:38,960
and is a core Gene so we called this

594
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,558
some years ago zt3 lysm because when you

595
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,720
actually look at the protein structure

596
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,879
it has a signal peptide for secretion

597
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,720
and then it has three lysm domains which

598
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,679
are potential carbohydrate binding

599
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,278
domains and those are the only main

600
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:53,759
those are the only real features of the

601
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:56,319
protein we many years ago in

602
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,720
collaboration with Boma we characterized

603
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,079
that protein and showed that it is

604
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,480
actually a kite binding protein so

605
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,879
kiteen being one of the major

606
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,120
constituents of the fungal cell wall

607
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,720
which is also a pamp in terms of uh

608
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:13,439
plant defense response induction and zt3

609
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,079
lysm binds very specifically kiteen and

610
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,440
not other complex carbohydrates and we

611
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,839
also so some time ago that if you

612
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,200
introduce it into a kiteen elicitation

613
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,158
as say the protein that it will dampen

614
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,960
down that

615
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:30,039
elicitation so it is a well-known kiteen

616
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,798
binding protein when you knock in out in

617
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:35,119
the fungus we also saw a really quite

618
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,759
significant reduction in virulence which

619
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,798
you can see in terms of the the

620
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:41,919
infection process in terms of green

621
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:44,038
tissue uh that is left at 21 days post

622
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,640
infection and also the fungal biomas

623
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:48,919
that ACC accumulates in that infected

624
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,960
tissue so we've long known it was quite

625
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,240
a major virulence factor for wheat we

626
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,519
did some other work on this which I'm

627
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,880
not showing today but basically we

628
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,000
showed that if you were to silence the

629
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,159
putative wheat kiteen receptors which

630
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,960
are called Circ one and C bip then the

631
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:08,840
zt3 LM mutant could infect again so it

632
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,360
was a clear Gene for Gene relationship

633
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:13,798
between uh one single effector present

634
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,879
in the pathogen and some cognate

635
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:18,278
receptors uh for kiteen that were

636
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,080
present in the plant and what this also

637
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:23,000
told us that basically the success or

638
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:25,119
failure to induce disease is pretty much

639
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,440
a straight battle between wheat and

640
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:30,278
fungal kiteen binding proteins in this

641
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,840
system which again is something that is

642
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,319
potentially tractable in terms of

643
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,398
Disease

644
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:37,038
Control what we've since gone on to do

645
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:40,158
is ask a little bit more fundamental

646
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:42,278
questions in terms of lysm fector

647
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,679
protein so this was work done by I think

648
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:47,240
you would say graduate student I would

649
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,399
say PhD student um she did some work

650
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,960
looking at the orthologues of lysm

651
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:55,158
factors throughout the fungal Kingdom uh

652
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,278
so these are basically lysen domain

653
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:59,278
containing proteins with signal peptides

654
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,839
for secretion so they're likely to to be

655
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:02,640
secreted out of fungal cells for

656
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,798
whatever reason but you can actually

657
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,840
find them in in in fungi with various

658
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:09,639
different Lifestyles including saites

659
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:13,119
endites obviously pathogens you can also

660
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,000
find them in both bidam myits and asamy

661
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:15,918
and even in some of the early lineages

662
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,640
of

663
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:22,679
fungi um in different types of numbers

664
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,120
basically uh depending on the species

665
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,399
but one of the key questions there's

666
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,678
been many reports on the importance of

667
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:31,599
lysm effectors in plant pathogen

668
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:34,840
interactions and even plant Endo sorry

669
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,678
endophytic interactions but one question

670
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:38,359
we had is whether or not they could be

671
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,278
functionally interchangeable between

672
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:41,959
species particularly if they kind of

673
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:45,119
structurally look the

674
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,798
same so I let her go and pick um some

675
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,319
lysm effectors from her analysis that we

676
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:53,240
would do some functional uh work

677
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,480
on as long as she also picked the

678
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,200
cladosporium fulum

679
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:02,079
ecp6 uh protein which was the first lysm

680
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,399
fector identified in any plant pathogen

681
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:07,199
from cladosporium fulvum by Bart toer

682
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:08,918
and colleague some years ago and that we

683
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,880
we had to include in the project because

684
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:14,960
it's very structurally similar to the

685
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,919
zt3 lysm if you do alpha predictions Etc

686
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,120
which you can see boxed up there but

687
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:21,559
then I also let her uh pick out some

688
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,719
other lysm affectors from with different

689
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,359
structures and from different species

690
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,720
including some from G graminis which is

691
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:32,038
guanyy graminis which is a root

692
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,440
infecting uh wheat pathogen so she

693
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:35,759
picked a couple from there and a couple

694
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,919
of other species from from literature a

695
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,480
couple of other effect candidate

696
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:42,240
effectors from other um species uh and

697
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,919
and then we basically decided to try and

698
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,640
test whether there's any evidence that

699
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,480
putative lysm effectors could be

700
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:51,240
functionally interchangeable between

701
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:53,558
species so we did this by effectively

702
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,000
taking all of those candidate effectors

703
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:58,639
hooking them up behind the 3M promoter

704
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,038
with a 3M Terminator behind them

705
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,720
and transforming them back into the zt3

706
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:06,759
LM mutant and then testing whether or

707
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,519
not they regained any virulence on wheat

708
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:11,278
and in a nutshell this is where we are

709
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:14,599
with this work is that only the three

710
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:18,038
lysm protein when reintroduced into

711
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:21,038
zeptor triy mutant can Restore for

712
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:23,480
virulence intriguingly ecp6 from

713
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,879
cladosporium fulum despite looking

714
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,558
structurally very similar um cannot do

715
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,840
that and neither can any of the other

716
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,119
tested lysm effectors thus far so we

717
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:34,558
have a little bit more work to do this

718
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:36,959
on this but it starts to suggest that

719
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:40,240
there might be specialization in lysm

720
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,038
infectors uh in uh plant pathogen

721
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,599
interactions perhaps to deal with the

722
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:46,440
different types of kiteen structures

723
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:48,759
that are made during those interactions

724
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,159
or or the way kiteen is bound during

725
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:53,158
those interactions so it's not so easy

726
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:56,039
as just yeah moving them between the two

727
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:57,760
that they've clearly evolved

728
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:59,798
specialization okay now we're going to

729
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,200
move to the next little mini topic which

730
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:04,038
is a fastforward genetic screen that

731
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,200
we've been running for virence Gene

732
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:07,079
Discovery and I'll try and tell you why

733
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,640
I think it's fast forwards

734
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:11,519
initially so one of the very simple and

735
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,200
easy ways we can generate large

736
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,679
collections of mutants in zeptor titisi

737
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,360
is to zap them by UV light in a

738
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:22,120
transilluminator if you like and this

739
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,599
generates a lot of phenotypic diversity

740
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:26,599
quickly and cheaply without any

741
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:29,079
antibiotics Etc and you can just see two

742
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:31,480
examples here of the sort of diversity

743
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:35,038
you can really get just from UV light

744
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:37,120
exposing ipo323 on the left there are

745
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:41,798
lots of pigmentation mutants where you

746
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:43,798
have dark pink white albino uh mutants

747
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:45,519
coming through very simply and on the

748
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,359
right you can see the sort of variation

749
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,120
you can get in Eiffel growth when you

750
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,398
start spotting these different mutants

751
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:54,119
out on water AAR so this is really

752
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,038
simple really cheap it allows you to

753
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:58,359
build up huge mutant collections very

754
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:01,119
quickly and again is a is a good basis

755
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:04,000
for establishing forward genetic

756
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:07,798
screens so the fast forward genetic

757
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,480
screen that we've adapted thus far uses

758
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:15,240
this technology basically where we by we

759
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,919
you we UV mutagenize um our uh standard

760
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,720
sequenced strain and then we select for

761
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,360
whatever particular phenotype of

762
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,278
Interest it may be either it strains

763
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:26,918
that cannot transition into hyy from

764
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:28,200
yeastlike cells or directly on Plants

765
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,480
although that takes a little bit bit

766
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,720
longer as you might expect but whenever

767
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,839
we get a mutant of Interest we do whole

768
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,120
genome resequencing and snip indel

769
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:41,158
analysis because it's very costeffective

770
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:43,359
about 80 UK pounds per strain to do this

771
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,320
at the moment to see what genes we have

772
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,918
mutated uh whether there's any

773
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:49,720
interesting genes in there that come out

774
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:52,000
of multiple strains that become uh

775
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,480
strong candidates and then we start to

776
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,519
investigate them in the lab via an

777
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,240
independent knockout or or a

778
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,679
complementation and and repeat the

779
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,440
phenotypic check and the first way we

780
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,960
adapted the screen was to see if we

781
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,278
could form a hypothesis around whether

782
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,038
fungal cell wall mutants would be

783
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:12,398
affected in virulence on Plants the

784
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:14,240
reason we did this was basically because

785
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,038
when you look around the literature for

786
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,558
plant infecting fungi there are

787
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:22,720
remarkably few model systems uh anyway

788
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,558
actually for fungal cell wall study

789
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,639
outside of looking at Classic yeast

790
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:30,240
sacris sarisi the three major species

791
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:32,479
are candida cryptococcus and aspila

792
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,240
fumigatus which are all opportunistic

793
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,120
animal pathogens they are either asamy

794
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:40,679
or bidia my seeds so basically there

795
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:42,759
wasn't there isn't still I think an

796
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,360
intensively studied cell wall model

797
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:46,919
model for any plant infecting fungi and

798
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,678
I thought it would be kind of nice if we

799
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:53,038
could try to establish zeporia

800
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,759
trii in this area and as a first step

801
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,038
towards this we obviously needed to

802
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:59,519
generate a collection of mutants uh in

803
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:03,119
cell wall Str L and viability to to see

804
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,960
what's going on so we did this using

805
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:08,000
literally a very simple assay that was

806
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,558
developed many many years ago for yeasts

807
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,919
uh which is to test um sensitivity of

808
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:16,638
induced mutant strains to the um stain

809
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,159
califl white so calflor white has been

810
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:21,359
used in yeast and in fungi as a

811
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:24,159
screening tool to identify cell wall

812
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:26,398
mutants on the basis of that if a

813
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,120
particular mutant strain has a defect in

814
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,879
its cell wall strength it cannot grow

815
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:34,319
back on calka FL white despite being

816
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:37,760
able to grow grow back in on media um uh

817
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:40,000
sorry it can with without calflor white

818
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,480
basically so it's it's a powerful screen

819
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,440
well known in literature and I thought

820
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,919
we should be able to adapt it as Z seor

821
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,278
tritis ey so this is what we did

822
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,880
basically this is a classical yeast

823
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:54,398
replica plating screen uh which we've

824
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,960
used for the um yeast uh cells of of

825
00:32:54,398 --> 00:33:00,759
zeptor trii so we've done a UV uh

826
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,240
treatment of the sing single cells to a

827
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:05,038
95% kill rate we let them grow up a

828
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,839
little bit on a plate and then we print

829
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:09,960
them onto Black Velvet if you like which

830
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:12,199
makes a little imprint a marker of what

831
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,840
was growing on the plate and then onto

832
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,080
that black velvet plate you print you

833
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:19,519
you print your control plate and your

834
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:21,798
test plate which has calflor white in it

835
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,839
in this particular case and you grow

836
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:27,599
them up and then effectively you look

837
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:30,519
for colonies that grow back on the AAR

838
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:33,359
uh that don't have calflor white which

839
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:35,440
don't grow back on the AAR that do have

840
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:39,439
calaor white and you pick the former

841
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,558
colony and and and analyze it further so

842
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,679
this very quickly got us to a a nice

843
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:47,278
collection of zeporia cell wall

844
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:48,320
mutants uh in total we've got so far

845
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:52,240
about

846
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:54,638
53 um mutant strains um based on hypers

847
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,399
sensitivity to 200 micr per mil calflor

848
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:59,199
white and interestingly enough um almost

849
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:01,518
all of those strains also have a

850
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,759
reduction in the switch to hyle growth

851
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,720
on yeast on um water AAR media and

852
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,519
interestingly even more is that the

853
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,559
majority of them also have a a dramatic

854
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:15,199
reduction in virence on wheat leaves so

855
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:17,039
this is quite a nice way of linking

856
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,559
potential cell wall defects to to

857
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,000
virulence defects but obviously the

858
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,000
question is can you get to the

859
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,398
underlying genes that are affected in

860
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,480
the process so what we did was sequence

861
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:33,159
the whole did whole Jun re sequencing

862
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,280
again of 39 of those 53 available

863
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,639
mutants and this is a summary of the

864
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,280
types of mutate mutations and number of

865
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:44,039
mutations we got in those strains so

866
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,839
when in total of the 39 uh strains we

867
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:50,960
resequenced we identified 186 genes um

868
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:53,398
across those mutants that had high

869
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,599
effect loss of function mutations so

870
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,799
that averaged that just short of five

871
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,838
genes were affected by a high effect

872
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,480
loss of function mutation in each mutant

873
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:05,119
we obviously got more uh mutations

874
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,000
causing moderate effects which are a

875
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,480
little bit difficult uh certainly for

876
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,679
our analysis so a few thousand in in

877
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,800
total and an average of 61 per

878
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,440
strain but you know that's not too bad I

879
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,240
was expecting a lot worse than that

880
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,320
initially so this is why we did it as a

881
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:23,679
little bit of a look see it was still a

882
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,559
question of whether we can make some

883
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:27,440
sense of the genes that are affected by

884
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:29,759
that so those those mutations and

885
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,720
whether we could nail it down to single

886
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,839
genes being important for the calka Flor

887
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:37,838
white hyp sensitivity and the plant

888
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:41,199
infection data and overall we have been

889
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:43,920
able to um it's about 50% success rate

890
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:45,358
so far when we analyze the data look at

891
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,280
all the data we have in terms of

892
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:49,519
expression data and other data sets as

893
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,440
well for all the candidate genes but we

894
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:55,039
have been able to validate I just show

895
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,960
you here seven genes in total um that

896
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:00,599
are specifically inactivated to cause

897
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,880
cell War weakness and loss of function

898
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,119
loss of virulence and I give you three

899
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,039
examples there uh different aspects of

900
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,800
cell War biology Manan polymerase uh uh

901
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,440
generates the actual physical structure

902
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,400
of the wall kr4 is likely a signal

903
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,159
transduction integrator and the RO GT

904
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,960
gef protein is is again a signal

905
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:23,559
transduction protein so this is looking

906
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,318
good we're starting to write this up as

907
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:28,078
a pipeline but the pipeline is very

908
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:29,719
adaptable for screening mutant anything

909
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,640
we've we've done it for calca Flor white

910
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:34,559
but you could do it for oxidative stress

911
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:37,279
fungicides etc etc so it's quite un

912
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,440
useful and Powerful pipeline I

913
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,400
think which brings me nicely into the

914
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,800
Abraham wal essential Gene screen and

915
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,800
mutant collection because it kind of

916
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,160
Builds on from the same data so when we

917
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,359
did that resequencing of the UV induced

918
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:53,920
mutations um and looked at the numbers

919
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,719
that we got when you actually think

920
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,720
about it so if we sequence 39 individual

921
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,799
mutants we managed to get 186 genes that

922
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:03,439
were clearly not essential for life

923
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,560
because the fungus would not have grown

924
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,000
back and we wouldn't have been able to

925
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:09,719
sequence it if uh if they had been

926
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,119
essential for life so on typically you

927
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:14,159
know four

928
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:17,119
4.95 genes could be inactivated by high

929
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:19,799
effect mutation per strain using this

930
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,200
approach led us to the sort of idea to

931
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,720
start of think whether it might be

932
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,759
possible to generate sufficient UV

933
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:27,639
mutant strains that if we resequence

934
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,480
them all would be allow us to to

935
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:32,838
identify genes which could never be

936
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:36,119
mutated so never never incurred a high

937
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:37,759
fet mutation in the data set indicating

938
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:41,680
they could be putative essential for

939
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:44,079
Life genes and this is very similar to

940
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,960
the concept developed by Abraham Wald

941
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,359
which is the Abraham wal survivorship

942
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:52,639
bias screen um which he employed during

943
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:55,480
World War II to study aircraft that

944
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,078
returned successfully from missions

945
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,039
bomber aircraft and he looked on the

946
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:00,920
aircraft

947
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:03,239
to see where they had artillery damage

948
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,800
and also where they never had artillery

949
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:07,559
damage and the principle being that if

950
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,800
something if a region of the aircraft

951
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:12,880
never had artillery damage it probably

952
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,720
never made it home so therefore it was

953
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,519
of critical function for the aircraft

954
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:20,639
and basically that led to to um the

955
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:22,318
Allies reinforcing certain areas of

956
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,719
those particular aircraft to make them

957
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:27,318
more uh resilient to to potential

958
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:29,279
artillery fire so we thought whether we

959
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:32,800
could do something similar for a fungal

960
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:35,319
genome just pepper it uh with random

961
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,720
induced mutations and identify the genes

962
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:40,400
that perhaps never ever could be mutated

963
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:43,318
so that we never found them mutated in

964
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,720
inviable strains and therefore whether

965
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:48,400
those genes are likely essential for the

966
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,000
life of the

967
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,519
fungus so this is what we did we

968
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,440
actually you UV mutagenized again our

969
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:59,759
reference strain of ipo323 and we picked

970
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:02,639
25,000 colonies into 24 well plates by

971
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,359
hand it's a bit of a team effort uh grew

972
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,960
them all up until they were saturated

973
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:09,719
and then we made pools of them uh for

974
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,760
genomic DNA extraction so we made 500

975
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:15,239
pools of 48 individual mutants but we've

976
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:19,079
also got a collection of each and every

977
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:21,679
25,000 mutant as a glycerol stock taking

978
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,960
half a minus 80 freezer and or several

979
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:26,838
half minus 80 freezers down in our

980
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,159
basement but we did um together with a

981
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:32,400
with an indust Ral sponsor we did

982
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:35,000
sequencing of these pools um and

983
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,960
basically the whole idea was to identify

984
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,280
whether or not uh we could um whether we

985
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,838
could identify genes in the genome that

986
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,480
had no or fewer than expected high

987
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:48,000
effect mutations and then to test and

988
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,519
validate some of those predictions in

989
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,280
the

990
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:54,920
lab so the top here is the global

991
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,440
overview of the of the data that we got

992
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,519
which was kind of great so this is just

993
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,838
data for the high effect mutation rate

994
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:05,358
relative to the predicted uh length of

995
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:07,440
the protein or the gene as is expressed

996
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:10,039
here there should in general be if

997
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,119
there's no link between no no link

998
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:14,639
between mutation rate and Gene length um

999
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,760
most of the data should fall on that

1000
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:19,358
line of expected mutations per Gene

1001
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,599
length and many does as you can see

1002
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:23,078
those that are above the line are genes

1003
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,640
with higher number of mutation than

1004
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:28,160
expected which for us not of interest

1005
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,118
but the ones that fell below the line

1006
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,078
are obviously of extreme interest which

1007
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,440
are genes with lower numbers of

1008
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,440
mutations than you would expect given

1009
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,960
the size of the predicted Gene and

1010
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,639
protein length so that was looking

1011
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,000
pretty good and then we started to break

1012
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,679
this down into different categories of

1013
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,559
genes you can see on average you know

1014
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:49,598
the number of for all proteins in the

1015
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:51,639
ipo323 genome you can see the number of

1016
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,800
high effect indel mutations and high

1017
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:56,679
effect snit mutations then we looked at

1018
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,400
the major facilitator Transporters which

1019
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:01,358
are known to be very redundant in

1020
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,920
function in zeporia there's 40 400 of

1021
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:06,598
them and those had a very high high rate

1022
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,039
of indel and snip mutations induced by

1023
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:10,960
the UV but when we looked at the known

1024
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,639
and predicted Essentials and and current

1025
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,838
fungicide Target genes these genes came

1026
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:20,039
out with much lower um levels of UV

1027
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:22,400
induced mutations so it sort of our our

1028
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:24,039
original idea for what we tried to do uh

1029
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,720
seems to have

1030
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:29,039
worked but we've gone on S since then to

1031
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:31,078
do some experimental candidate

1032
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,039
validation of of these candidate new

1033
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:34,960
essential genes and what we use here is

1034
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:38,358
a technology we're able to do where we

1035
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,119
where we swap the gene of interest um

1036
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:42,679
with its own promoter we effectively

1037
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:44,920
replace its own promoter with a promoter

1038
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:46,358
we can control under laboratory

1039
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,800
conditions so we use the nitrate

1040
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:53,039
reductase promoter which effectively

1041
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,519
facilitates growth on nitrogen um sorry

1042
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,920
growth on nitrate the gene the promoter

1043
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:01,679
is on so switch the gene on but if you

1044
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,240
grow The Strain on more complex nitrogen

1045
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,719
media it switches it off so it's a it's

1046
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:08,719
a growth no growth iay if you like for

1047
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,799
your Gene of interest whereby you you

1048
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,598
effectively control it by replacing its

1049
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,839
native promoter with that

1050
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:16,880
promoter the rest of the data just shows

1051
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:21,558
how we kind of select the strains so we

1052
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:24,960
we We Gather we identify um targeted

1053
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:26,720
um uh promoter replacement strains by

1054
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,679
having only the single upper band with

1055
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:29,759
the green

1056
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,558
thing there in a PCR based assay whereas

1057
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,359
ectopic strains where our trans Gene has

1058
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:35,920
gone somewhere else and the wild type

1059
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:39,598
Gene is still there you you end up with

1060
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,920
the two um PCR um fragments

1061
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,318
basically and then when you identify

1062
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,800
those you can start screening them for

1063
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:48,838
the onoff switch and I've given you an

1064
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,839
example here of two genes that we have

1065
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:52,558
identified so far I can't give you the

1066
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:54,279
exact details of what they are due to

1067
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,240
confidentiality but one is a

1068
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,079
transcription factor and one is involved

1069
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:01,598
in the general pro process of protein

1070
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:03,200
tination and you can see uh starting

1071
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,720
with the left panel when you take these

1072
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:08,480
mutants so we have ectopic mutants which

1073
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:10,399
are pink they are controls ipo323 is a

1074
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,440
control at the bottom and then you have

1075
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,960
the greens which are the validated

1076
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,358
promoter swaps where we've we've

1077
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,280
effectively introduced the nitrate

1078
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,239
reductase promoter instead of the Native

1079
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,280
promoter and then when you switch those

1080
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:25,759
strains onto um off Media which either

1081
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,079
contains an amino acid like glutamate or

1082
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,200
on rich media like YP PD hopefully you

1083
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,559
can see for both examples that uh that

1084
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,919
those strains can no longer grow uh when

1085
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:37,160
those genes are switched off so this is

1086
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,159
really good it's kind of working

1087
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:43,480
reasonably well we've validated 15 genes

1088
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:45,639
to dat from the wall data uh for being

1089
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,440
uh candidate essential for Life genes in

1090
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:50,239
inzy sepor trti although there is some

1091
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,079
confidentiality on that at the moment

1092
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:55,639
due to the company being

1093
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:57,280
involved what we're also able to do of

1094
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:59,519
course now going forward is that we have

1095
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,319
this fantastic resource of 25,000

1096
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,159
mutants in our minus 80 freezer and

1097
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,480
we've started doing High throughput

1098
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,920
screening of those basically in 96 well

1099
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,760
plate assays for different stress

1100
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,838
responses uh to pre-screen them for then

1101
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,119
testing them on on wheat and again to

1102
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:19,119
resequence their genomes individually to

1103
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,559
identify candidate genes and validate

1104
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,838
them as novel targets and so on and

1105
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:24,720
that's going to be a Cornerstone of what

1106
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:27,719
we're going to do for quite a few

1107
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:29,879
years okay the final uh part of the

1108
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:32,838
presentation is some slightly different

1109
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,318
work in about how we're using zeporia as

1110
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:37,599
a tool for discovery of new microb

1111
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:41,558
derived crop protection

1112
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:43,480
products so rothamstead research uh we

1113
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:45,720
are quite diverse in in the number of

1114
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:49,079
staff and colleagues we have but we have

1115
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:51,439
many many field trials spread uh spread

1116
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,519
over um the areas of our different

1117
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,760
research stations which are being

1118
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:58,039
sampled continuously different crops uh

1119
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,960
different environments different

1120
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:02,239
treatment regimes and they sampled

1121
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,720
continuously for many things but also

1122
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:07,239
they're being sampled continuously also

1123
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:09,399
for by our microbiologists who are

1124
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:11,558
establishing cultures of various

1125
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,680
different bacteria but in this

1126
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:16,599
particular example I show you examples

1127
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:18,759
of some of the collections they're

1128
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:21,160
making of

1129
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:23,960
pseudomonads and um these guys are known

1130
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:25,960
to have antifungal activities this is um

1131
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,199
through bio control and all the other

1132
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,800
types of assays in the past so we

1133
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:31,719
thought we would just set up a simple

1134
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,119
assay again exploiting the yeastlike

1135
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:36,719
cells of zeporia tritide so we could

1136
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:38,559
effectively form a cell lawn there which

1137
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,799
you can see gfp tagged at the bottom

1138
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,359
just to be fancy but you can make a cell

1139
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,839
loan of of zeporia cells and you can

1140
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:48,358
start spotting these little bacteria on

1141
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,799
the top of that lawn to see whether any

1142
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:53,078
create a zone of inhibition which is a

1143
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,280
nice clear Zone around where the the

1144
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:58,760
bacterial spot has gone and this work

1145
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,280
really really well and in a PhD project

1146
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,839
and we got 37 inhibitory bacteria

1147
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,160
through the assay uh which we sent for

1148
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:08,119
whole genome sequencing the idea was to

1149
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:09,838
start looking at secondary metabolism to

1150
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:11,559
see if they had the opport the

1151
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:13,920
capability to produce any interesting

1152
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:17,640
secondary metabolites and we compared

1153
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,680
those 37 again B sequencing uh 40 uh

1154
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:22,400
strains also that had no inhibitory

1155
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:24,838
activity in the antifungal aay as well

1156
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,119
as a control we also have chemists at

1157
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:27,519
rothamstead we're very lucky they're

1158
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:30,358
just down the corridor

1159
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:33,199
and what they also did was generate lcms

1160
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:34,759
traces from the AAR surrounding the the

1161
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,439
zone of interaction if you like the

1162
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,720
little Halos that you can see there on

1163
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,880
the

1164
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:45,039
plate so um then they we were entered

1165
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,760
the sphere of U bacterial um secondary

1166
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:49,400
metabolite predictions and and our

1167
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:51,280
student uh has generated a really nice

1168
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,519
pipeline using available resources that

1169
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,519
are out there plus some new uh tools and

1170
00:46:54,519 --> 00:47:00,000
he was able from his particular Mini

1171
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:02,280
colle of 39 strains to identify 120

1172
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,318
putative Gene clusters for secondary

1173
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,240
metabolites in inhib in the inhibitory

1174
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:09,279
bacteria only 10 of which were known so

1175
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:10,919
it mean it meant that even from that

1176
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,640
quite small collection of strains we

1177
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,800
have something in the region of0 unknown

1178
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:17,960
secondary metabolites potentially being

1179
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,760
produced by those bacteria some of which

1180
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,079
could be

1181
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,480
antifungal uh we decided to tweak the

1182
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,240
assay as well so as I started this

1183
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,358
presentation I told you about how much

1184
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,479
genetic VAR variation we we can see

1185
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:32,440
between zeporia strains and there's no

1186
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,318
point going down a fungicide Discovery

1187
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,358
route if you at the end find your

1188
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,759
fungicide will only target two or three

1189
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:40,440
of those strains and not all of them so

1190
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,400
we started screening all the bugs

1191
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:46,119
against um different zeporia titiy

1192
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,720
isolates which was very worthwhile

1193
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:50,358
because we could start to see that some

1194
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:53,199
isolates were more resistant to

1195
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:55,920
inhibition by some of the bacteria

1196
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:58,719
whereas some were were more sensitive so

1197
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,119
then we we started Focus down on those

1198
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,919
bacteria that were always able to give a

1199
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,680
good strong level of inhibition of all

1200
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,039
isolates of xpor Desire because this is

1201
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:11,598
yet another quantitative trait in in the

1202
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:13,880
fungus basically this

1203
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,519
sensitivity and as a proof of principle

1204
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,280
what we did identify in the Genome of

1205
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:20,559
some of these inhibitory bacteria were a

1206
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,920
biosynthetic gene cluster that is likely

1207
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:26,960
to produce the known uh product dapg so

1208
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,000
24 diety floroglucinol which is been

1209
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,639
shown to be antifungal in various

1210
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,760
different assays in historically against

1211
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:36,159
various different species we were able

1212
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,280
to identify that particular cluster in

1213
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,598
reproducibly in strains that inhibited

1214
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,200
all

1215
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,519
zeporia isolates we were able to find it

1216
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:47,199
in the genome and we were also able to

1217
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:49,838
identify the peak in the lcms for 24

1218
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:52,159
dapg in the zone of inhibition but we

1219
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:54,159
still had to prove or test as a proof of

1220
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,118
concept that it was the APG in those

1221
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,679
bacteria that were responsible for the

1222
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:00,440
antifungal

1223
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:02,480
activity so we've developed mutagenesis

1224
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,480
in bacteria as well now which is quite

1225
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,719
nice and this is the example of what we

1226
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:10,960
did so we we targeted by mutagenesis in

1227
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:13,879
activation um a key dapg biosynthetic

1228
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,240
Gene called uh uh

1229
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,280
phld um and when you knock that

1230
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,759
particular Gene out in in two of the

1231
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,119
inhibitory bacterial strains you can see

1232
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,799
on the slide there uh on the right hand

1233
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,960
side you can see that they lose their

1234
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:29,719
Halo they use lose their ability to

1235
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,240
inhibit the fungus so quite clearly um

1236
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:33,879
dapg was the secondary metabolite

1237
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:38,118
produced by that which was giving such

1238
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:40,440
consistent uh control of the fungus in a

1239
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:41,960
in an invitro assay and our pipeline now

1240
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,119
is obviously focusing more on some of

1241
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,920
these unknown these new products that

1242
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:49,000
we've got from the genomic bacterial

1243
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,838
predictions but an obvious question for

1244
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,519
about dapg which is something that that

1245
00:49:50,838 --> 00:49:55,440
I found curious was that um so what is

1246
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:57,239
it can it be used as a as a crop

1247
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,240
protection product in itself or Can the

1248
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:00,679
bacteria that make it be used as a crop

1249
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:03,798
protection product so we did a kind of

1250
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:06,879
biocontrol and a chemical control

1251
00:50:03,798 --> 00:50:08,519
assay in summary the biocontrol assay so

1252
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,480
actually putting the bacteria on the

1253
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:14,199
wheat leaf with the fungus um these are

1254
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,798
bacteria that that produce the dapg were

1255
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:18,838
unable to control the fungus so they

1256
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:21,599
were obviously not resilient to the to

1257
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:23,400
the leaf environment not producing theg

1258
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,680
or whatever we don't quite know why yet

1259
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,519
but it doesn't work whereas the chemical

1260
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:31,639
control using the APG itself was giving

1261
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:34,880
as a dose response um relationship for

1262
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:36,519
protecting leaves against zyo so overall

1263
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,119
I think this supports our general

1264
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:40,358
approach that we have for this project

1265
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:42,838
which is to go using the genome mining

1266
00:50:40,358 --> 00:50:45,358
of the bacteria to go after the um

1267
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:48,039
secondary metabolite clusters and go

1268
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:51,078
after the chemistries themselves rather

1269
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:52,838
than using the the bugs as as bio

1270
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:55,079
control agents I think that might be

1271
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:58,039
more difficult but perhaps not not

1272
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:59,720
impossible might be more difficult

1273
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:00,920
okay I think that was my last slide I'm

1274
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:02,519
just going to summarize there and give

1275
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,720
some perspectives I hope what I've shown

1276
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:08,280
you is that um the G genetic diversity

1277
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:10,118
that you can see within xceptor trai

1278
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:13,480
populations can actually be used against

1279
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:16,039
it um if you deploy pangenomics that

1280
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:19,280
focuses down on what is core and what

1281
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:21,519
cannot be mutated at a high rate um with

1282
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,680
it by individuals in the

1283
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:25,000
population hopefully I've also shown you

1284
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,279
which we've known some time that the

1285
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,280
outcome of the fungal plant battle if

1286
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,559
you like is almost dictated by the fight

1287
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,720
between two fungal kiten uh binding

1288
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,200
proteins and the fungus the fungal

1289
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:37,759
protein is currently winning that

1290
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:40,039
against the plant

1291
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,880
receptors also what I hope I've shown is

1292
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:44,558
that the yeastlike morphological growth

1293
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,838
phase is a super tool um for many of the

1294
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:51,119
work we do on zeptor ey for generating

1295
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:53,599
mutations populations Etc and it's quite

1296
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,680
unusual um for a haploid filamentous

1297
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,039
plant pathogen so it makes it a really

1298
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:58,960
good system

1299
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:00,679
fungal cell walls are a valid Target for

1300
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,400
future methods of methods of

1301
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:04,759
intervention I believe uh and in terms

1302
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,519
of going forward I mentioned right at

1303
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,359
the start my my thing about all these

1304
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:10,440
genes of unknown function and how can

1305
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:13,078
you actually prioritize them and

1306
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,400
motivate yourself to work on those genes

1307
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:17,039
well what we're currently doing is

1308
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,798
combining these two large data sets of

1309
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:22,679
the protein specific natural variation

1310
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:26,159
we can see Pang genome data with our

1311
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:28,318
induced um Abraham wal data to look at

1312
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,440
each individual encoded protein of

1313
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:33,199
unknown function and to see what is

1314
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,559
mutating very very on a very low rate uh

1315
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:37,039
potentially in both data sets and we're

1316
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:38,559
going to prioritize those for some

1317
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:41,159
functional analysis to see if we can

1318
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:44,240
start revealing some of the functions of

1319
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:46,558
the the dark matter of of fungal

1320
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:49,039
genomes okay uh that's it I'd just like

1321
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,160
to acknowledge everybody whose uh data I

1322
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:53,199
presented specifically today that's on

1323
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:56,199
the left is my rothamstead team from now

1324
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,000
and before PhD students technicians and

1325
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:58,759
by

1326
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,639
informaticians uh we've been lucky

1327
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:04,200
enough on two of the major projects to

1328
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:05,759
have support from senta and Baer uh and

1329
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:07,279
obviously Bart TOA was a key

1330
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,720
collaborator for us in all the work

1331
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,400
we've done uh on the lysm infectors and

1332
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:17,598
the image there that I finish with shows

1333
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:20,519
um the gfp tagged zeporia trii emerging

1334
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:23,039
th stamata of a destroyed wheat leaf and

1335
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:26,679
getting ready to infect uh other green

1336
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:29,039
areas of the of the plant tissue

1337
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:32,838
okay thank you very much I'd be happy to

1338
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:36,239
take any questions if there are

1339
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:37,639
any thanks Jason um yeah if anyone has

1340
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:41,679
any questions please feel free to put

1341
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:41,679
them in the chat or unmute and

1342
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:49,199
ask if not um Jason I have a a question

1343
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:52,679
about your the work that you presented

1344
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:58,439
in the beginning on The kitan Binding

1345
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:59,719
protein um gosh it ct3 mym yeah um for

1346
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,440
the the

1347
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:06,480
transcriptomics your sampling began 6

1348
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:10,000
days post inoculation yeah um and I was

1349
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:12,679
curious what role do you think that that

1350
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,719
protein plays in the latent

1351
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:21,399
phase and um if it does how early would

1352
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:23,598
you expect to see differences in ex I

1353
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:26,160
did just for Simplicity I didn't show um

1354
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:29,400
so basically uh Luca the PHD student

1355
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:32,598
that that took on this work um well she

1356
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:34,559
made some um uh three LM promoter gfp

1357
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:36,720
expressing strains so we actually

1358
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,440
started to look at when the fungus

1359
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:41,838
lights up uh when you start inoculating

1360
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,798
wheat leaves with it and it's on super

1361
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:47,318
early within a few hours actually so so

1362
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:49,759
I think I think the the expression of

1363
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:51,599
that particular Gene may be linked in

1364
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,559
with the transition to hle growth

1365
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,440
basically I think it might be baked in

1366
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:58,200
the fungus knows it's going hyle and it

1367
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:01,798
may just be switching that on at the

1368
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:06,318
same time I don't know whether they're

1369
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:10,440
separable very early yeah interesting um

1370
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:13,519
Gillian you had raised your hand yes um

1371
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:19,798
can you nice

1372
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:28,318
talk um can you comment in general about

1373
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:28,318
genes and Jean structure on dispensable

1374
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:35,480
chromosomes Yeah so basically

1375
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:38,279
um there there are some key features um

1376
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:40,880
a lot of the um predicted genes on the

1377
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,880
dispensable chromosomes a lot of them

1378
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,559
have a lot of evidence for rip so they

1379
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,559
look like they're inactivated uh

1380
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,119
duplicated copies of things that are

1381
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:52,519
sometimes on the core

1382
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:55,200
chromosomes um I think there's also more

1383
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:56,960
uh epigenetic um silencing on them as

1384
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:58,838
well which is probably responsible for

1385
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,599
the for the very low level of expression

1386
00:55:58,838 --> 00:56:03,759
of them and very few of them have

1387
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,359
obvious predicted functions they tend to

1388
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,119
be smaller than the genes on the core

1389
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:10,318
chromosomes and there's very few uh

1390
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:12,519
really clear predicted functions on them

1391
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:13,798
so obviously many of our colleagues uh

1392
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:15,559
are very interested in this I'm

1393
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:16,960
interested in this well but but my goal

1394
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:20,119
is to identify the things that are

1395
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,960
really important for the so I I I tend

1396
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:23,680
not to spend too much time looking at

1397
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:27,679
them apart from

1398
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:27,679
superficially thanks

1399
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,358
Jason I had I suppose not a a question

1400
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:39,279
more so a a comment um that I'm feeling

1401
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:43,759
inspired by um your results in the last

1402
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:45,280
component um revealing that um when

1403
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,079
applying

1404
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,640
bacterial um cultures directly to leaves

1405
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:53,559
you're um in many cases not getting

1406
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:56,639
effective management of a disease and so

1407
00:56:53,559 --> 00:57:00,359
I think for a lot of us who um are

1408
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:03,159
applying trying to identify biocontrol

1409
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:05,598
products um to manage diseases we're

1410
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:08,078
we're often using products that say they

1411
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:10,440
have active cultures and and you're

1412
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:14,079
waiting for colonization to occur on the

1413
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:16,039
foliage in order for bacteria to produce

1414
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:19,039
the secondary metabolites and other

1415
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:21,400
products and so perhaps if we're if we

1416
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:25,119
look instead for products that just have

1417
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:27,400
the the chemical of interest and bypass

1418
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:29,519
the need yeah yeah that's that's that's

1419
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,280
our angle basically just because that's

1420
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,880
the way we are set up we've got chemists

1421
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,000
we've got microbiologists bi

1422
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,640
informaticians um we just think that

1423
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,920
this is something that we can that we

1424
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:41,759
can run with in terms of natural product

1425
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:45,079
Discovery pipelines rather than

1426
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,559
Biologicals basically I mean the data

1427
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:48,039
I've shown you is obviously just a

1428
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,519
couple of different bacteria that

1429
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:50,839
doesn't mean to say it won't ever work

1430
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:53,199
or anything like that that's just what

1431
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:55,318
we've tested so far but it does

1432
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:58,078
reinforce what what we thought would be

1433
00:57:55,318 --> 00:57:59,599
our best approach or our preferred

1434
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,559
approach would be to go after the

1435
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:04,000
chemistry if we can basically and how

1436
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,839
how the microbes make this stuff and

1437
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,719
what they are and to see whether they

1438
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:12,358
can be synthesized or or in in another

1439
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,679
way to be tested as a as a natural crop

1440
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:17,519
protection product

1441
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:19,759
basically um yeah I think it's a I think

1442
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:23,599
the wheat Leaf obviously is a pretty

1443
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,520
Barren place for a for a microbe to live

1444
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,559
maybe I mean we have started now

1445
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:29,960
generating um collections of of bacteria

1446
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,400
directly from wheat leaves so they

1447
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:34,679
should be able to persist there at least

1448
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,200
that is their natural growth habitat

1449
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:38,399
whether they will Faire any better or

1450
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:42,719
whether they will have fungal inhibition

1451
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,720
uh uh capability we'll find out in due

1452
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,318
course I think there was something in

1453
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:49,399
the chat I don't know whether something

1454
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:51,440
popped up oh yes um yes so we have a

1455
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,440
seminar room um in a building and

1456
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,159
they're they're saying uh I particularly

1457
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,639
appreciated thinking about the essential

1458
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:59,960
genes through the of the Abraham wal

1459
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:02,879
metaphor yeah thank you yeah it's fun

1460
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:05,480
it's been fun that one good

1461
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,838
project oh and yeah there's a a question

1462
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:11,000
in the chat um do you think the

1463
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:13,239
fastforward genetics pipeline could work

1464
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,480
for other closely related species or is

1465
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:18,318
it specific for this pathogen I I

1466
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,400
basically the way we've set it up is

1467
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:22,400
we're taking advantage of this sort of

1468
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,720
yeastlike growth we can have on on Rich

1469
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,838
nutrient AAR that's what allows us to

1470
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:30,038
print onto velvet and and to effectively

1471
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:32,038
treat it like a yeast I think if you if

1472
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:33,599
you have a very filamentous pathogen it

1473
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:36,280
would be more difficult to get the

1474
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:40,039
throughput um that we can with a more

1475
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:43,119
yeast like pathogen like XY septoria so

1476
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:46,079
if you can manipulate your pathogen to

1477
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:47,599
to not be too highle under a particular
