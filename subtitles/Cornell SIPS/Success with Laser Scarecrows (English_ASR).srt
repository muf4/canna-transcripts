island and they will both be presenting

17
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,439
about the scarecrow that they've

18
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,959
developed and tested

19
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,359
and then

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,359
one of my collaborators chuck bourne

21
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,000
who's also with cornell cooperative

22
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,799
extension in the eastern part of the

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,119
state of new york the eastern new york

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,519

25
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,079
so we welcome both of them

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,920
i do want to acknowledge the funding

27
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,959
sources that have made development of

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,960
the laser scarecrow possible and also

29
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,839
testing

30
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,079
so

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,478
currently we have a

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,200
specialty crop multi-state

33
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,519
block grant program that rebecca brown

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,640
is the lead pi on it comes from the

35
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,399
univer the usda agriculture marketing

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,280
service

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,719
uh

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,280
chuck and myself and marion zuffle from

39
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:39,039
the new york state ipm program have a

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,200
new york farm viability grant

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,000
allowing us to help also do some of the

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,399
work and rebecca and david brown and

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,640
others have had pass funding from the

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,960
rhode island farm viability

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,000
specialty crop block grant

46
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,000
and

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,359
sustainable agriculture research and

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
education

49
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,319
projects

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,159
so

51
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,919
um

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,000
i guess i was the one that kind of

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:10,239
dreamed up this uh this webinar

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,239
oops sorry i think i uh

55
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,919
advanced that without wanting to do that

56
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:18,959
and so what what are we trying to do

57
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,679
here i think our learning objectives are

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,959
one to provide a background on laser

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,560
scarecrows so dr rebecca brown is going

60
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,039
to do that

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,199
we have people on here who don't know

62
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,679
anything about the laser scarecrows if

63
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:36,000
curious for the first time

64
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,920
and we have some folks that have tested

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,400
the university of rhode island or other

66
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,399
scarecrows on their farm previously

67
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,359
rebecca has experience with

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,719
definitely sweet corn

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,959
and some grapes and small fruits

70
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,719
and i know we have some other folks who

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,800
are on there who might be interested in

72
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,840
tree fruits or other things so i think

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,400
you'll be interested at least to hear

74
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,719
the general background and if you're not

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,519
interested in continuing

76
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,759
with the more

77
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,400
probably specific discussion

78
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,878
that focuses a lot around sweet corn

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,959
which is our primary crop you're welcome

80
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,079
to leave at any time i'm not going to be

81
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,680
offended

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,920
or anything but

83
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,000
after the general background we're going

84
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,719
to give an overview of the university of

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,318
rhode island laser scarecrow device

86
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,799
and the improvements that have been

87
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,280
planned for 2022

88
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,360
and how to get hooked up for getting a

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,439
kit for those

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,440
devices

91
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,959
and then throughout this

92
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,560
both in rebecca and david's

93
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,640
presentations

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,759
we want to really help growers

95
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,479
understand how to set up and adjust the

96
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,479
devices in their on their farm so that

97
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,840
they have success

98
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,759
so

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,640
we did some

100
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,280
had some test lasers out chuck and i did

101
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,759
last year and grower field

102
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,438
there were also growers throughout

103
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,318
the northeast and some other regions

104
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,079
that

105
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,158
purchased devices

106
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,840
kits put them together and then put them

107
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:18,399
out in their own field so we had a

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,759
kind of a wrap up webinar back in early

109
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,279
november

110
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,439
talking more about the research and

111
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,599
had some of the growers on

112
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,839
talking about their devices

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,320
and so a number of people have

114
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:35,279
had success with the devices

115
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,719
i was picking up on and concerned about

116
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,519
the number of growers that said they

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,360
really didn't have success

118
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:45,359
i came in on this project last year

119
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,600
and

120
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,400
it was a huge learning curve for me

121
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,800
about how to set up the devices how to

122
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,879
adjust them and whatnot

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,478
and i think i'm really set up for good

124
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,918
success this year

125
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,399
but um

126
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,959
we i personally learned a lot we learned

127
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,560
a lot that uh

128
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,319
you know informed

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,560
what improvements needed about the

130
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:13,839
devices and so our goal really is

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,759
anybody that's interested is to try to

132
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,519
right from the start this is what you

133
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,759
need for success

134
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,359
we are going to be around

135
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,479
all season

136
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,879
as resource folks and we want this to

137
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,560
work for you if this is the right thing

138
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,800
for your farm

139
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,120
so

140
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,600
we chuck and i are going to give some

141
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,478
tips from our programs we would like any

142
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,600
of the growers that tested to also chime

143
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:44,319
in and give some some tips and then we

144
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,240
hope to have a good period for question

145
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,680
and answers but we do need to end by

146
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,199
10 30.

147
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,918
so um that's that's kind of my part

148
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,038
and um hopefully now we've got everybody

149
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:02,240
in on board and ready to go

150
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:06,478
and i'm going to stop sharing my screen

151
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,560
and invite dr rebecca brown to share

152
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,240
what she has

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,160
and

154
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,680
we'll get started with her presentation

155
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,680
so rebecca if you could share

156
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,199
okay good morning everyone

157
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,720
um hopefully you can see my screen now

158
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,160
and

159
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:36,160
i can see that yes yes okay

160
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,840
um so i am going to start things off

161
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,759
this morning um with just a general

162
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,399
introduction

163
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,520
to laser scarecrows

164
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,918
um

165
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:53,198
and then i will hand the microphone over

166
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,639
to david who will talk more specifically

167
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,960
about

168
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,680
the mechanics and the engineering and

169
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,680
things like that

170
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,880
so

171
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:08,478
laser scarecrows are very much

172
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,360
designed to work against birds

173
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,478
um

174
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:17,439
they take advantage of the fact that

175
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:19,758
birds rely on sight to detect threat

176
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,959
people often ask about using laser

177
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,038
scarecrows against deer

178
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,839
and they don't work as well against deer

179
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:31,199
because deer don't rely on sight as

180
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:34,638
their primary threat detection sets

181
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:38,720
birds have really good eyesight it

182
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,639
varies from species to species of course

183
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,400
but in general

184
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,439
birds eyesight is ten times better than

185
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,478
humans

186
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:51,759
both their ability to see colors and

187
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:54,079
their ability to sense motion

188
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,960
it's said that pigeons

189
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:59,439
can see the stars move

190
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,239
and they can also

191
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,639
see

192
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,759
things that are moving much faster than

193
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,800
we can make them out

194
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,439
um

195
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,560
birds of course especially flocking

196
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,918
birds find a certain amount of safety in

197
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,240
numbers

198
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,198
and one of the things that this means is

199
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,759
that if you have a stationary visual

200
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,960
deterrent such as

201
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,560
a tube man or a windmill or something

202
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,038
like that

203
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,160
the effect radius is going to be fairly

204
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:31,439
small

205
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,639
because

206
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,918
the birds are willing to take the chance

207
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,639
that

208
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:41,598
there might be an attack because there's

209
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:44,240
so many of them you know odds are that

210
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,120
it'll be somebody else who gets caught

211
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,879
they're also very intelligent and birds

212
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,600
are able to quickly identify and ignore

213
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,958
things like scary eye balloons and

214
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,920
effigies

215
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,278
as well as startling noises this is one

216
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,559
reason why

217
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:05,838
propane cannons have a limited

218
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:08,639
effectiveness is that just like we tune

219
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,720
out a constant background noise

220
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,720
the birds will start to tune it out

221
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,519
so the challenge

222
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,800
given all of this

223
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,000
is how do we repel birds from a large

224
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:26,079
area without physically traversing the

225
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,559
area and you could

226
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,120
hire someone to drive around your corn

227
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,278
fields all day with an atv and i've

228
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,000
heard of farmers doing that

229
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:38,958
but of course that gets very expensive

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,480
and it requires that

231
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:44,879
you give up land for the atv to drive on

232
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,639
so that it's not crushing the crop

233
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,919
and this is a problem not only in

234
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:53,199
agriculture it's also a problem in

235
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,919
situations such as airfields where you

236
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,080
don't necessarily want someone

237
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,479
rushing around the airfield all the time

238
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,839
with you know in a vehicle

239
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,639
but you need to keep the birds

240
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,519
away from the planes that are taking off

241
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,519
or landing

242
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,360
so the solution to this

243
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,720
which was actually come up with quite a

244
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,959
while ago

245
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,160
was to use light

246
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,319
and in particular highly focused light

247
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,039
which is what we call lasers

248
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,920
the advantage of light

249
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,599
is

250
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:33,679
that it can

251
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,440
reach a very long distance and of course

252
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,799
it doesn't

253
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,320
um

254
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,919
pose any sort of physical resistance so

255
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
it can move

256
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,479
right past things right through a

257
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,160
cropped canopy without causing any

258
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,159
injury

259
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,799
for this reason lasers have been

260
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,719
investigated for bird control since

261
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,359
really the early days of laser

262
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,480
technology the first researchers working

263
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,039
on this were in the 1970s

264
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,159
those researchers at the time

265
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:09,519
were limited by the state of the laser

266
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:11,838
technology in those days

267
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,120
they were using gas lasers which were

268
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,560
very fragile and also required an

269
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,639
extremely large amount of power

270
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,039
and that limited their use they also

271
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,639
didn't really in those days have any way

272
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,919
to automate the lasers

273
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,559
since then

274
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:33,599
improvements in both laser diode

275
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:36,159
technology and battery technology have

276
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,320
removed most of these limitations

277
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:41,278
and you're probably all familiar with

278
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,879
handheld laser pointers

279
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:47,120
which take advantage of both of these

280
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:50,159
in the 1990s

281
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,440
we started seeing lasers adopted by

282
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,879
airports and industrial sites primarily

283
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,920
in europe

284
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:01,838
these were mostly hand-held human

285
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:04,159
operated units they often look like

286
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,800
large flashlights

287
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,759
they have a greatly expanded beam and

288
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,078
they're

289
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,799
powered by batteries

290
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:16,399
there were also some stationary

291
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:20,559
automated units that would turn on in

292
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:23,360
response to stimuli but didn't move

293
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:26,078
with these units the emphasis was on

294
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,919
covering large areas so the beam ranges

295
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,958
were up to

296
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,639
um

297
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:35,359
8 000 feet or more and these handheld

298
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,799
devices are very much still on the

299
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,759
market

300
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,759
the limitation with them

301
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,319
is of course that you have to have a

302
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:48,799
human operator at all times

303
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,519
and so that makes the most useful for

304
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,719
situations such as airports

305
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,200
where

306
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,759
the um

307
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,959
risk of monetary

308
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,958
damage from a bird strike incident is so

309
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,799
much greater than the cost of having an

310
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,399
employee

311
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,719
you know patrolling

312
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,759
with a handheld laser that it makes

313
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,759
financial sense

314
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,599
since 2010

315
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:20,799
there have been further improvements

316
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,079
both in laser technology but even more

317
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,078
importantly in

318
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:30,078
microcomputer technology and in solar

319
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,439
panel photovoltaic panel

320
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,599
technology

321
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,279
that have made solar

322
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,000
autonomous laser scarecrows possible

323
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,078
and reasonably affordable

324
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,198
unfortunately

325
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:48,319
lasers

326
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:49,599
since they do pose a risk of harm

327
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,360
both

328
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,879
harm to eyesight and

329
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,440
for higher power lasers a risk of burns

330
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:03,198
or starting fires

331
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,320
lasers are very strictly regulated

332
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:09,198
and a lot of the regulations around

333
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,600
lasers are quite old

334
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,919
and so it creates a very complex

335
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,839
regulatory environment

336
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,159
and this has discouraged

337
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,440
commercialization

338
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,278
of

339
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,160
mid-range models so right now if you

340
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:29,198
look um

341
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:32,159
at the commercial landscape you have

342
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,879
very low power models

343
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,198
designed for consumer use

344
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:40,639
and then you have

345
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:42,479
expensive high-end models that have very

346
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,839
elaborate

347
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,839
um safety

348
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:52,958
programming and things like that

349
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:55,838
now early research with lasers through

350
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:59,119
the 90s and the early part of this

351
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:02,959
century assumed that lasers would only

352
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,759
be effective under low light conditions

353
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:09,278
and so most of the studies

354
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,399
targeted roosting birds in the evening

355
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,639
and

356
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,839
most of these studies were not very

357
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,159
effective at moving birds away from

358
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,240
their roosting sites

359
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:23,360
they could disturb the birds but

360
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,839
oftentimes the birds would come back

361
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,440
and certainly once they stopped treating

362
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,240
the roosting site

363
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,880
with

364
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,440
a laser the birds would come back

365
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,639
however more recent studies including

366
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,920
our work

367
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,839
has focused on daytime use targeting

368
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,679
feeding

369
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:45,839
birds and has been much more successful

370
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:48,719
particularly when the laser

371
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,120
is automated and able to operate

372
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,600
continuously

373
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,600
during the daytime

374
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,880
so this is just a clip taken at

375
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,079
late dusk

376
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:06,838
that shows you what the laser beam looks

377
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:10,078
like as it moves through a

378
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:13,680
cornfield and i just want to note that i

379
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:17,278
have slowed this down to one quarter of

380
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:20,000
its actual speed so that you can see it

381
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:24,919
um one advantage of the laser is that it

382
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,919
can cover an area pretty quickly

383
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,519
so as you saw in that um

384
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:08,240
you know the beam is basically moving

385
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:11,759
through the tassels on the corn

386
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,000
we can only see the laser beam

387
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,919
in low light conditions like this but

388
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,119
the birds because they have so much

389
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,559
better eyesight than we do can see the

390
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,399
laser

391
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,399
even when the sun is shining

392
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,480
so i just want to talk a little bit

393
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,120
about some of the questions that we

394
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,759
frequently get asked

395
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:40,959
um first of all why are birds scared of

396
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,359
lasers we don't actually know

397
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,519
because of course we can't get into the

398
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:49,759
mind of the bird

399
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:52,720
but people who study bird behavior

400
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:56,079
have suggested that birds may perceive

401
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,319
the beam as a solid object

402
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:02,079
and so they move

403
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:05,359
in order to avoid that object

404
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:08,480
and it is true that in corn what we have

405
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:10,719
seen is that the primary effectiveness

406
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,759
of the laser

407
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,360
is that it stops the birds from perching

408
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,759
on the tassels

409
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:20,240
which they usually do before they move

410
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,240
down into the canopy

411
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,679
to feed also

412
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,440
by stopping perching on the tassels

413
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,000
it will

414
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,000
cause the birds that are keeping watch

415
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,480
for all of their flock mates

416
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,919
to move and that will result in the

417
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,919
entire flock moving

418
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,880
many people ask if birds become

419
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,120
acclimated to the lasers this is a

420
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,400
really good question because of course

421
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,000
that is the failure of most bird scare

422
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,640
technology

423
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,558
is that the birds become acclimated to

424
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,400
it over time

425
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,639
and we have some colleagues at the

426
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,000
university of florida

427
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,919
who have

428
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,798
been testing

429
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,799
exactly this question

430
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:11,359
using captive

431
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:13,759
european starlings in an outdoor aviary

432
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,639
and what they have found

433
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,119
is that the birds do not appear to

434
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,600
become acclimated to the lasers

435
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,399
and they may actually become more

436
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,719
sensitive more afraid of the laser with

437
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,080
repeated exposure

438
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,558
this study is ongoing we have one season

439
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:35,359
worth of data at this point and are

440
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:37,038
going to start a second season within

441
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,558
about a month

442
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:41,200
so hopefully

443
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:44,160
by later this year we'll have

444
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,480
an even more conclusive answer to this

445
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,080
but it does appear

446
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,759
that birds do not become acclimated to

447
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,558
the lasers

448
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:57,279
another question we often get is what

449
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,038
birds are controlled by lasers and

450
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,519
obviously

451
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,519
not every species of bird has been

452
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:07,359
tested

453
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:11,440
in general lasers seem to work best on

454
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:13,038
birds that flock together rather than

455
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,360
moving about

456
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:20,079
as individuals or just a few of them

457
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:24,399
there have been research studies that

458
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:28,480
have successfully used lasers on geese

459
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,000
cormorants gulls blackbirds robins cedar

460
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,960
wax swings

461
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,599
starlings and cowbirds

462
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,840
and there are other studies

463
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,639
currently underway

464
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,918
you know lots of different species are

465
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,440
being

466
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,440
controlled using lasers

467
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:54,319
so i want to talk just a little bit

468
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,480
about um using lasers specifically in

469
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,839
different crops

470
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,000
so

471
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:03,279
for any crop

472
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,440
you need to start laser protection

473
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,480
before the birds begin feeding in the

474
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,360
crop

475
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,319
with sweet corn this means

476
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:15,439
starting before the corn is mature

477
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,639
before the birds begin moving into the

478
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,840
field

479
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,320
and checking the corn out

480
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:25,038
in sweet corn you want to mount the

481
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:28,000
laser at tassel height

482
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:31,200
with the beam horizontal and this field

483
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,960
this clip that julie was kind enough to

484
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,640
share with me

485
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,919
shows you

486
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,679
um

487
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,159
where it should be positioned you can

488
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,679
see she has the laser right in there

489
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,080
with the corn

490
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,840
and you can see the beam moving across

491
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,319
the green shield

492
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:53,319
showing that it's basically projecting

493
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,319
horizontally out over the field

494
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:07,038
um if your corn field is sloped you want

495
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,480
to put the scarecrow at the top of the

496
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,759
slope

497
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,720
and basically project the beam at an

498
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,839
angle down the slope so again it's

499
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,079
hitting

500
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,480
the tops of the tassels

501
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,678
the uri laser scarecrow has been

502
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,400
designed

503
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,400
so that the beam cannot be projected

504
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,080
more than five degrees above the

505
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,080
horizontal

506
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,839
and this is because

507
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:36,399
one of the risks of using lasers

508
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:39,759
is that if you're projecting a laser up

509
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,000
over the horizon into the sky

510
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:46,000
there's the possibility

511
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
of it shining through the windows

512
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,359
of an aircraft

513
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,200
that is

514
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:57,199
taking off or descending towards landing

515
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:00,080
and causing flash blindness of pilots

516
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,840
using a laser to interfere

517
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:06,079
with aircraft operation is illegal in

518
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,879
the united states um it will get you

519
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,240
into big trouble with the faa

520
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,280
and so

521
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,240
since many of the uri units are being

522
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:20,399
used in perry urban areas where they're

523
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:23,440
within 20 mile radius of an airport

524
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,240
we designed the units to make

525
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,679
projecting the beam up into the sky

526
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,720
impossible

527
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,600
um that said i know there are situations

528
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,120
such as fruit orchards where you may

529
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:39,519
want to project the beam at an angle

530
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,918
above the horizontal

531
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,558
and some of the commercial units can do

532
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,200
that but you have to be very careful

533
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:50,000
when you're doing that to make sure

534
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,400
that you're not impacting

535
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,599
air traffic

536
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,559
with

537
00:23:53,599 --> 00:24:00,000
plants that are of varying heights you

538
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:04,079
want to use the ability of the laser to

539
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,640
move back and forth on the vertical axis

540
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:09,678
to hit all of the tassels

541
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,679
if you've got a

542
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,798
crop

543
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,919
that say it's it's two different

544
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:20,240
planting blocks side by side and one is

545
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,320
shorter than the other

546
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,599
you need to make sure that you put the

547
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:28,000
laser scarecrow on the side

548
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:31,359
with the shorter plants

549
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
so that they're not being shaded

550
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,038
from the beam by the taller plants

551
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,400
because

552
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:40,079
remember that laser beams travel only in

553
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,278
line of sight

554
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:45,359
if you can't see something you can't hit

555
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,679
it with a laser beam

556
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:51,038
and birds will

557
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,840
sneak in under the beam if it's going

558
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:56,240
over the tops of the tassels

559
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,798
um they they'll just basically treat it

560
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,120
like a roof and duck in under that roof

561
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,119
and get into the canopy to cause damage

562
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,839
now as julie said most of our research

563
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,000
has actually been with sweet corn that

564
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:15,599
is what all of our grant funding has

565
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,400
focused on but we have done a little bit

566
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,480
of research on other crops we are

567
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,400
constantly seeking funding to do

568
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,480
research on

569
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,120
more crops

570
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,919
um and we have learned a little bit

571
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,199
about using lasers in crops other than

572
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,200
sweet corn

573
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,679
um one thing we've learned is that for

574
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,519
short crops whether it's seedling corn

575
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,360
that you're trying to protect from geese

576
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,918
and crows

577
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:46,678
or turf grass sod that you're trying to

578
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,400
protect from winter feeding by geese or

579
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,240
strawberries

580
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,440
any short crop

581
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,240
you actually want to mount the scarecrow

582
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,200
as high as practical you can see down

583
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,679
here

584
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,759
this is a commercial unit that

585
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,480
unfortunately is no longer available in

586
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:06,960
the us that we were testing

587
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,440
on a kentucky bluegrass sod farm and

588
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,640
we've got it mounted on top of a

589
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,240
traveling irrigation rig about 15 feet

590
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,360
off the ground

591
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,839
um and then you aim the beam down

592
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,798
and what you want to do is

593
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:25,519
set the vertical movement of the laser

594
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:28,480
so that you're sweeping the crop

595
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,240
from the base of the scarecrow to the

596
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,159
edge of the field

597
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,278
again you need to be careful with a

598
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:39,120
short crop that the beam doesn't go into

599
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:41,919
a roadway or a neighbor's windows

600
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,839
that you keep it to your field

601
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,159
but that does seem to be the most

602
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,439
effective way

603
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,600
to try and keep particularly geese out

604
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,240
of fields

605
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:57,038
for blueberries on the other hand you

606
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,400
want to mount the scarecrow about three

607
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:02,640
feet or one meter above the canopy

608
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,880
and then move the beam

609
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,240
through the entire vertical range of

610
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,320
motion as well as horizontally

611
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,880
so that you're covering as many

612
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:15,519
different points in the canopy as

613
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,520
possible

614
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:21,599
what little we've learned about using

615
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,319
laser scarecrows in grapes it seems like

616
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,798
the approach you take is going to depend

617
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,720
on your training system

618
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:31,759
if all of

619
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,240
the clusters are basically at the same

620
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,519
level then you can treat grapes like

621
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,960
corn

622
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:41,119
and use the laser to create a virtual

623
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,000
lid over the field

624
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,119
but if the clusters are at all different

625
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,839
heights

626
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:50,000
then probably it needs to be dealt with

627
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,959
more like blueberries

628
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,119
where you're moving the beam through

629
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,120
many different places in the canopy

630
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,720
okay i want to close here

631
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:05,440
just by mentioning

632
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:09,278
sources of laser scarecrows

633
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,960
um there is currently only um

634
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:16,159
one real source of

635
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,919
um commercial

636
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:22,399
lasers that are designed for use in

637
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,919
agriculture and

638
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,719
other serious

639
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,600
outdoor bird control settings

640
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,159
and that is the avix autonomic from bird

641
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,439
control group these are sold all over

642
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,399
the world

643
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,600
um

644
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:39,918
the company itself is in the netherlands

645
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:42,959
and then they have a north american

646
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,880
office out in oregon

647
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,278
it is a commercial product from a

648
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,600
full-service company they will even come

649
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,119
and install your unit for you they

650
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,599
provide

651
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,798
on-site tech support a lot of different

652
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,359
things

653
00:28:54,798 --> 00:29:00,079
these are 500 milliwatt lasers that can

654
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,719
cover very large areas depending on the

655
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,879
crop they a single unit can cover as

656
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,440
much as 100 acres

657
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,240
and they are designed to operate 24

658
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,798
hours a day year round

659
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,558
even in the winter with extremely low

660
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,398
temperatures

661
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,558
but of course

662
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:21,678
this is all going to cost you and the

663
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,678
list price of these units is about ten

664
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,480
thousand dollars

665
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:31,120
um so they're they're a good

666
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,960
unit but they're a very high-end unit

667
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,439
um

668
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,759
up next david is going to talk about the

669
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,679
uri laser scare pro which is the one

670
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,119
that we've been using in all of our

671
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,278
research

672
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,839
this is an

673
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:46,960
experimental

674
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:49,678
unit it's an open source

675
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,278
unit the design is available on our

676
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,559
website

677
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:57,759
we use 50 milliwatt lasers and we're

678
00:29:54,558 --> 00:30:00,879
only able to cover up to nine acres but

679
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:03,119
we are deliberately targeting

680
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:08,080
the um

681
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:11,119
grower with smaller fields or with um

682
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,960
fields with lots of different

683
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,038
elevations

684
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,600
where you're not going to get the

685
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:20,839
economy of scale

686
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:24,639
that justifies using the larger

687
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:27,519
lasers our units will not operate at

688
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,679
night or at temperatures under 40

689
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,759
degrees fahrenheit so they're not

690
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,840
currently a good option if you're trying

691
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:35,440
to keep geese off of fields in the

692
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,480
winter

693
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,240
but they are available as a kit

694
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,000
for

695
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,240
650. there is only a limited number of

696
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,839
these kits because we aren't actually a

697
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,440
commercial

698
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:49,839
enterprise

699
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,278
and unfortunately for those of you

700
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,278
tuning in from canada

701
00:30:53,759 --> 00:31:00,158
the complexity of shipping lasers across

702
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:03,439
international borders means that we're

703
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,559
only able to offer the kits in the u.s

704
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,919
we also

705
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:10,398
will not do on-site tech support

706
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,399
we do offer tech support via email or

707
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,719
phone but again

708
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,278
it's not like we have a large staff of

709
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,200
people who can come out to your farm

710
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,119
and help you set the thing up and

711
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:26,720
operate it

712
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:30,000
we that said we are actively looking for

713
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,038
someone or multiple someone's interested

714
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,839
in commercializing

715
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:37,599
the uri laser scarecrow or a design

716
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:40,558
based on our unit

717
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:43,918
there definitely seems to be a market

718
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,839
for a smaller

719
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,240
unit

720
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:50,158
that is able to sell at a significantly

721
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,679
lower list price

722
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,720
than the avix autonomic

723
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,440
so that's what i have i will open it up

724
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,440
to questions

725
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:05,038
uh thanks rebecca so i'd invite folks to

726
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,038
uh either put their questions in the

727
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,278
chat or unmute i think we'll just take a

728
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:10,398
few minutes here before we transition to

729
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:12,720
david

730
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:16,079
i have one question rebecca that i

731
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,360
thought about that someone asked me here

732
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:21,439
recently and that is

733
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,398
does the laser beam

734
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,278
hurt the eyes of the birds

735
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,359
that is a really good question julie

736
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:32,240
and it is a question

737
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:34,479
that many people have asked

738
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,079
and the answer to that is that actually

739
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,079
we don't know yet

740
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:42,000
um

741
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:45,599
dr esteban fernandez jurissic at purdue

742
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,599
university is actively working on this

743
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,359
question

744
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,240
he has found

745
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,759
that

746
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:57,120
if you shine a laser beam

747
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,640
a high power laser being directly into

748
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:02,239
the eye

749
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,960
of an immobilized bird it will in fact

750
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,440
damage the bird's eye this is not

751
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,079
all that surprising

752
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,120
however what we haven't been able to

753
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,798
determine yet because of limitations on

754
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:18,398
funding

755
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:20,000
is what the chances are

756
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:22,398
in

757
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,519
a real world situation where the birds

758
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:28,798
are moving around foraging free to fly

759
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:31,679
away or turn their heads

760
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,558
that a bird will actually take a direct

761
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,759
hit

762
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:39,200
to the eye from a laser beam

763
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:41,278
this is an area of active research and

764
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,080
an area that we're hoping to get some

765
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:47,038
answers to over the next few years if we

766
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,480
can get the funding unfortunately

767
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:53,359
um

768
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:58,159
detecting damage to birds eyes requires

769
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:59,359
um euthanizing the birds and then doing

770
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,960
a

771
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:06,479
pathological examination of the eye

772
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,280
and that is extremely expensive to do

773
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,000
so this really limits our ability to do

774
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,000
these studies

775
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,359
okay rebecca we've got a couple comments

776
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:21,199
in the question

777
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:23,759
uh the chat box so the first one

778
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:26,559
says hi we have been using the scarecrow

779
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,919
for a couple seasons here we haven't had

780
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,960
much luck

781
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:34,799
especially with crows has anyone noticed

782
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:38,480
crows being deterred

783
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:42,720
um that's a good question i have not

784
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,719
tested the lasers against crows we don't

785
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,480
have a big crow problem at the research

786
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,519
farm

787
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,199
they should work against crows but again

788
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:55,039
it really depends on um

789
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:58,239
whether you get the laser out there

790
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:01,759
before the crows find the corn

791
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:04,239
um and also probably on the flock size

792
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,560
and crows are pretty brave

793
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,759
and if there's only a small number of

794
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,400
them

795
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,400
they may

796
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,719
not be startled enough by the laser

797
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,559
okay rebecca that um

798
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,480
just reminds me of something we were

799
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,480
talking about uh

800
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,960
a couple days ago in preparation for

801
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,280
this meeting and that had to do with

802
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,159
crows in a

803
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,560
in an urban setting that that roast

804
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,879
roost on trees and whatnot

805
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,480
and maybe you could just address that

806
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,280
real quickly

807
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:45,440
right so there have actually been

808
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:49,280
studies done out in davis california

809
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:52,800
looking at using handheld lasers

810
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:56,560
to try and eliminate

811
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,920
crow roosts from urban areas

812
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:03,759
and what they found was that

813
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,880
the lasers were effective

814
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,680
at removing the crows from the roost if

815
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,920
the trees were treated

816
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:15,199
um right at dusk as the crows were

817
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,680
coming in to the roost

818
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,358
but that treatment

819
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:22,078
the effectiveness of the treatment

820
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,519
stopped if they stopped treating the

821
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,480
trees

822
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:30,000
so it would probably work

823
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:33,760
but in an urban setting

824
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,880
it would probably mean using a handheld

825
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,160
bird control laser and sending

826
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,240
a human operator out

827
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,799
every evening

828
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,879
to treat the trees as the birds were

829
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,359
coming into roost

830
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,760
the in an urban setting you have to be

831
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:53,920
really careful with an automated laser

832
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:58,400
because of course there are a lot of

833
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,079
people around and thus a lot of risk

834
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,480
um

835
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,760
that someone could be

836
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,480
impacted by the laser beam and

837
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,560
potentially suffer eye damage

838
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,199
so this is where you would want a human

839
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:13,199
operator

840
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,320
okay great we've got uh let's see if we

841
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,039
can work through some of these other

842
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,240
messages so the next one said you

843
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:26,159
mentioned a nine acre coverage

844
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:29,519
but do we know what the effective

845
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:32,719
distance of the beam from the scarecrow

846
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:35,039
and lineal feet and so i know that is

847
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,759
something we are still

848
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:40,000
trying to get to uh trying to get more

849
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,720
data on but do you have any other

850
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,838
comments on that rebecca well

851
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:48,559
basically that at present um we're

852
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:52,480
pretty comfortable saying that

853
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:54,159
a 300 foot radius would be protected by

854
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,960
our units

855
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:56,719
um

856
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,760
but yes this is something that we're

857
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:02,879
still trying to actually determine what

858
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,240
the maximum um

859
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,119
distance is and it does of course

860
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,559
depend on the terrain and also on the

861
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,920
crop um

862
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,279
in that

863
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,280
if you're projecting the laser down onto

864
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,640
something like

865
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,400
um

866
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:23,920
seedling corn

867
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:28,160
you can get a much larger radius than if

868
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,159
you're projecting horizontally

869
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:34,159
you know depending on the height i was

870
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:36,480
getting as much as 600 foot radius on

871
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:38,960
the unit mounted on the irrigation

872
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,960
system

873
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:45,599
but that was also a flat field and

874
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,039
the unit was 15 feet above the ground

875
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,760
okay great

876
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:52,960
hey rebecca yeah along along these lines

877
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,480
of a nine acre coverage area um because

878
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,760
you know we're you are designing these

879
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,960
units for

880
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,960
kind of multi multi plantable acres in

881
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,838
terms of yes you know we don't have one

882
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,960
planting usually in in one field so if

883
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:06,960
you had three or four different

884
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,720
plantings you know all coming in within

885
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,320
a week of each other

886
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:12,719
in one field

887
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,480
where would you recommend someone place

888
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,399
the laser would you put it in the middle

889
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,079
of the field would you put it

890
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,440
kind of like between two plantings and

891
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,119
then as soon as they're done start

892
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,480
moving it over to the the later

893
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,960
plantings

894
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,280
do you have any any thoughts on that um

895
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,400
well so it depends on a number of things

896
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,000
first of all

897
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,559
um

898
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,838
it would depend on

899
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,639
the

900
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:38,559
differences in plant height among the

901
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:40,000
varieties

902
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:41,199
if you've got

903
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,880
say

904
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:45,439
a um

905
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,920
you know a really early short variety

906
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,760
and then the next one to mature is a

907
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,519
taller variety

908
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,599
you would want to put it put the

909
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:54,719
scarecrow

910
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,599
on the

911
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:59,439
side towards the shorter variety

912
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,519
and then projecting into the taller

913
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,280
variety

914
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,358
because otherwise you're not going to be

915
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,200
able to protect both

916
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:10,400
you also of course have to take into

917
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:12,239
consideration things like roads

918
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,800
you don't want to be projecting the beam

919
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:15,919
towards a roadway

920
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,960
um

921
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,280
but

922
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,599
yeah i mean you certainly can put it in

923
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,480
the middle of the field if

924
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,838
that

925
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,400
is going to get you know that would give

926
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,719
you the widest coverage

927
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,119
um as long as you don't have too much

928
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,719
variation in plant height and you don't

929
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,680
have something such as a road that's

930
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:35,679
going to cause a problem

931
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,200
did that answer your question chuck

932
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,400
thank you yes all right

933
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,960
so i think that um

934
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,800
there's a lot of chat going on and david

935
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,800
and chuck have been helping answer some

936
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,640
of that and i think some of those

937
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,920
questions will be answered as we move on

938
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:00,799
um

939
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:05,280
one and i know this was a a question i

940
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,720
had wanted to raise was about safety

941
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,319
in the field

942
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:12,719
when you have workers out in the field

943
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,119
and whatnot and i think david sort of

944
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,358
adjusted

945
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,240
answered the question in the chat box

946
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,400
that

947
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:23,039
you know we would recommend turning that

948
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,160
laser off while you had workers in the

949
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,480
field but

950
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:29,039
uh do you have any other comments on

951
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,838
that rebecca before we move on

952
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:37,039
yeah um just that these are class 3b

953
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:40,318
lasers and so um

954
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:43,920
the regulations do require eye

955
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:46,800
protection um if people are working

956
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,920
inside the hazard distance

957
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,519
so if you're not turning the lasers off

958
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,159
when um

959
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,800
you have workers in the field

960
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:59,118
ideally they should have laser safety

961
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,760
glasses that they're wearing

962
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:06,800
there is no risk of burning but if you

963
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,319
stare directly into one of these beams

964
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,400
you could have

965
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:11,358
retinal damage

966
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,318
and

967
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:16,000
certainly repeated eye exposure over

968
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:19,440
time

969
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,800
is going to cause things like cataracts

970
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,960
and other

971
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,318
cumulative damage

972
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,480
so you don't want to look directly into

973
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,559
the beam

974
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,358
that said these beams

975
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:31,759
if the

976
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:35,119
is operating normally

977
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:38,800
are constantly moving and so that

978
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:41,680
combined with your blink reflex

979
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,240
really lowers the likelihood of actually

980
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:46,559
getting a beam directly in the eye for

981
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:48,479
long enough to cause damage

982
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,960
but still it's best to err on the side

983
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,960
of safety

984
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:56,719
okay great um

985
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:59,440
so somebody said what is the hazard

986
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:01,118
distance

987
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,720
um

988
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:07,358
we haven't actually measured it and i

989
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:08,959
would have to look it up for these

990
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,318
specific

991
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,639
lasers

992
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:15,119
um i don't know if dave remembers off

993
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:18,239
the top of his head what it is for these

994
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,079
yeah we did calculate this um near the

995
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,919
end of the season

996
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,760
we realized that was an omission from

997
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,760
the initial user manual and based on the

998
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,160
output power beam diameter and

999
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,920
divergence using the ansi

1000
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:36,799
z136.1 calculation

1001
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:41,119
we came up with a nominal ocular hazard

1002
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:44,800
distance of 16 meters or 53 feet

1003
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:49,838
so when you're outside that range

1004
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,599
you should not be adversely affected

1005
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:54,318
even if you did

1006
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,680
happen to look at the beam within that

1007
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,159
range

1008
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:00,318
i would suggest you keep your head down

1009
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:02,159
and walk over to the switch and turn it

1010
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:04,000
off

1011
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,078
so

1012
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,440
all right so that sounds good i think

1013
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,920
that uh it's time to uh for rebecca to

1014
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,358
stop sharing her screen and then david

1015
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,400
or if that's what what you're doing and

1016
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:18,880
then david could get set up um

1017
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,039
about his there was uh for his

1018
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,960
presentation rebecca real quickly there

1019
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,880
was another question about if you had

1020
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,400
tested the lasers

1021
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,800
in sweet cherry orchards at all

1022
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,920
we have not tested them in sweet cherry

1023
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,519
orchards

1024
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,920
that would be

1025
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,199
a very intriguing study to do we don't

1026
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,680
have any sweet

1027
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:43,439
cherry orchards in rhode island

1028
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:45,679
um i know that there have been reports

1029
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,480
of lasers being used in sweet cherry

1030
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:50,239
orchards um i think it was in british

1031
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,440
columbia

1032
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:55,598
but again this is a fairly new um

1033
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,119
technology in terms of being used in

1034
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,559
agriculture and so there's lots of

1035
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,559
studies that haven't been done yet

1036
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,280
okay

1037
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,879
ah thank you we do have uh some

1038
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,160
cherry orchards here in new york

1039
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,200
especially below the lake in uh

1040
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:15,358
lowell lake ontario so i know one of our

1041
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:17,358
fruit specialists is on so if you ever

1042
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:19,039
want to test them or they do

1043
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:21,039
yes this is what we can do i'd be

1044
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,279
interested in testing i could probably

1045
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,279
find a cooperator to test it in sweet

1046
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,440
cherry orchards for sure

1047
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,440
okay well you know it would be great if

1048
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,119
we could find some money too

1049
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,960
definitely

1050
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,920
all right craig uh we'll be in touch

1051
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,920
about that thanks

1052
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,680
okay uh david let's go ahead with your

1053
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,559
presentation

1054
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:46,078
okay

1055
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:49,358
thank you very much

1056
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:51,440
all right so i wanted to start just to

1057
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:57,358
address some of the chat questions a

1058
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:58,480
little bit if you go to http colon slash

1059
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:01,480
laser

1060
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,480
scarecrow

1061
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,800
that will redirect you over to this

1062
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:11,440
google page

1063
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,760
and from there if you click on the 2020

1064
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,159
design which we are no longer providing

1065
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,280
but some of you have

1066
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,239
you will be able to access for example

1067
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,079
the

1068
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:23,358
user manual

1069
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,200
and

1070
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:27,759
is that

1071
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:30,078
when i clicked on that did that open a

1072
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,000
new window and no longer be what's

1073
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,039
shared i think

1074
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,159
um

1075
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,559
let me

1076
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:41,118
i i believe so it looks like what you're

1077
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:44,318
trying to do yeah uh let me see if i can

1078
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:48,800
nope it i'll have to

1079
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:51,358
tell it to share that anyway if you

1080
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,160
i'll switch to the pdf i had opened

1081
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,559
uh

1082
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:57,039
that opens the pdf and

1083
00:46:54,559 --> 00:47:00,078
you know to answer one of the questions

1084
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:02,400
right here under laser specifications

1085
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,519
is where we provide the information from

1086
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,760
which we calculated for you that nominal

1087
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,039
ocular hazard distance

1088
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,240
um

1089
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:15,519
yeah it doesn't mean that the beam is

1090
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:18,078
perfectly safe beyond that distance but

1091
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:19,519
within this distance you should take

1092
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:23,359
extra care

1093
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:27,358
and there are numerous cautions and

1094
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:30,078
advice provided here in the manual and

1095
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:33,199
you will find similar text

1096
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:38,480
in the instructions from other

1097
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:40,719
devices that you might be able to obtain

1098
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,719
so

1099
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:48,239
so that's what we know about

1100
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,039
laser safety it is certainly a concern

1101
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:51,838
we

1102
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:53,519
believe that we have designed the device

1103
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:54,920
to comply

1104
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:56,480
with the

1105
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:01,358
required

1106
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:04,639
fd in the us fda has responsibility for

1107
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:06,400
it for lasers as a source of radiation

1108
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:10,558
that can affect health

1109
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:14,318
and so we believe that our design is in

1110
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:16,240
compliance with those

1111
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:17,358
regulations

1112
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:19,679
and

1113
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:21,519
you know file our paperwork and get our

1114
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,199
accession number

1115
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:24,880
so let me

1116
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:27,219
switch over to

1117
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,800
what the main idea was

1118
00:48:27,219 --> 00:48:31,598
[Music]

1119
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,200
all right wanting to talk about

1120
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,079
the

1121
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,919
design improvements and i'll try to make

1122
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:41,200
this understandable for people who

1123
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,838
haven't worked with the previous designs

1124
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:46,239
also and try to put some of these issues

1125
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:48,480
in context for you

1126
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:50,479
uh come on

1127
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,679
i presume somebody would have told me if

1128
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,559
that were these slides weren't visible

1129
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,679
so

1130
00:48:54,559 --> 00:49:00,800
a little bit of history on the

1131
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:04,719
scarecrow project my involvement started

1132
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,640
as a helpful faculty spouse when rebecca

1133
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,558
said hey you've been playing around with

1134
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:10,400
these arduino things

1135
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,599
do you think you can come up with a way

1136
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,680
of wiggling a laser around a

1137
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,760
field

1138
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:20,239
know first design was quite

1139
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,880
crude uh plywood everything kind of

1140
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:24,078
nailed or hot glued onto a plywood base

1141
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,200
with a

1142
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:30,640
chain drive and um

1143
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:32,239
is kind of kind of messy but we got the

1144
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,879
idea across

1145
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:38,239
after a couple of years we were able to

1146
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,280
upgrade that to a belt drive and circuit

1147
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:41,118
board

1148
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,160
had a little bit of trouble selecting

1149
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,559
the 3d printed material the first one we

1150
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:48,799
did kind of melted thus the need for the

1151
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:51,680
reinforcing wood blocks here well it

1152
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:55,119
didn't melt but softened

1153
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:58,078
2020 i think was a really substantial

1154
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,838
improvement in that we found a slip ring

1155
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,000
where we could put a drive shaft

1156
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:05,039
straight through it and not deal with

1157
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,719
either a belt or a chain

1158
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:09,599
we're continuing that idea in

1159
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:11,759
2022

1160
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,720
with the current design the major

1161
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:18,240
changes are that we no longer have that

1162
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:20,159
plywood base i had this idea i i was

1163
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,639
basically having trouble

1164
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,838
fitting some extra components we needed

1165
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:28,078
on the circuit board

1166
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:30,318
around the motor stand

1167
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,480
and suddenly had this idea well what if

1168
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:35,679
we just had the

1169
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,519
circuit board go around the motor stand

1170
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:38,960
and so now we have a circular circuit

1171
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,679
board

1172
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,358
uh the motor main board slip ring holder

1173
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:45,279
all mount to that bucket bottom with

1174
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,239
just four screws

1175
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,359
um

1176
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:49,598
the

1177
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:51,440
pinball tilt switch had been giving us a

1178
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,400
little bit of a trouble and so we've

1179
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,318
moved that to a tinier sensor on the

1180
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,280
main board

1181
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:02,079
and no longer having a plywood base just

1182
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,200
to that key switch that is required by

1183
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,359
fda

1184
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:09,039
is moved to the motor mount

1185
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:11,838
not shown are the external controls

1186
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:13,039
and you may notice that compared to the

1187
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:16,318
previous

1188
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:18,318
design based on a five gallon bucket

1189
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:19,679
this is based on a three and a half

1190
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:21,358
gallon bucket

1191
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,679
and so you know

1192
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:26,318
it's a little bit shorter reduces the

1193
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:26,318
wind load

1194
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,160
we went back to a white bucket with

1195
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:32,400
black tape partly because white buckets

1196
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:34,639
are what we could find and

1197
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,000
the the black tape versus the aluminum

1198
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:41,118
is a little easier to obtain

1199
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,119
but also we're looking we've had some

1200
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,318
difficulty with the tape sensor not

1201
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,760
being reliable you go from about two lux

1202
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:52,400
at dawn

1203
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:54,640
to 40 or 50 000 lux in full sun

1204
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,400
and it's just really difficult for the

1205
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:58,639
tape sensor to

1206
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,039
maintain accuracy

1207
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:04,639
through that range of ambient light

1208
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:07,119
and so we're planning i'm working on the

1209
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,159
software that will just kind of map out

1210
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,160
the

1211
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:14,558
range of rotation

1212
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:17,118
at power on and then use an extra magnet

1213
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,480
and magnet sensor to help track the

1214
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,640
rotation

1215
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,838
so those are some of the big changes

1216
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:26,318
many potential areas of

1217
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:30,558
improvement were suggested by growers

1218
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:33,279
and fellow researchers such as

1219
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,319
as chuck and julie

1220
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,880
um

1221
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:39,679
and i have organized the rest of the

1222
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,800
slides to kind of go at what the ones

1223
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:46,960
that i think are most relevant and most

1224
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,720
interesting uh and working on down

1225
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,679
so one of the

1226
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:54,558
challenges with operating the 2020 and

1227
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:57,199
earlier designs are that everything is

1228
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:59,920
basically on that one main circuit board

1229
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:02,480
which is inside the bucket under a very

1230
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,240
tight gasketed lid and on the top of

1231
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,639
your 10-foot pole

1232
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:09,039
so that makes control changes

1233
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:11,279
rather awkward

1234
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:14,239
there are also some

1235
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,559
slight confusion with using the software

1236
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:18,799
having to wait 15 seconds before it

1237
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,519
saves the changes

1238
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,559
so

1239
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:24,318
in 2022 um

1240
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,480
these little waterproof boxes are

1241
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:30,639
surprisingly expensive but some other

1242
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,639
cost savings help make it possible

1243
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,359
we've got that

1244
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,039
at the end of a 15 foot cable

1245
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:39,440
so you should be able to just stick that

1246
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:41,440
down on the bottom of the pole

1247
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,358
there's a push button on it so it knows

1248
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,280
when you're trying to make changes and

1249
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:47,519
then it'll just save the changes when

1250
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,960
you switch it off so that should be a

1251
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:50,800
lot easier

1252
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,679
in this one

1253
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,960
okay

1254
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:56,480
i mentioned that we've had some trouble

1255
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,519
with the tape sensor

1256
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,880
and

1257
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:04,159
so one couple changes we've made have

1258
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,318
found a sensor that is better optimized

1259
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:09,679
for longer distances

1260
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:13,519
there are still some divisive device

1261
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:16,000
variation and it seems to lose about 20

1262
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:17,199
percent of its sense range

1263
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,199
between

1264
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:22,000
a dark room versus

1265
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:25,679
full 40 000 lux sun which is what we got

1266
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,318
on a nice day recently

1267
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:31,199
but for i'm happy to say that despite

1268
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:33,199
that i still have a nice gap between the

1269
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:35,598
reflectance of the white bucket and the

1270
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:37,439
black tape where they we should always

1271
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:39,920
be able to tell the difference

1272
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,400
but just in case we can't

1273
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,960
we've got this little magnet will be

1274
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,798
mounted along with the tape sensor

1275
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,159
and this

1276
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:53,199
magnet sensor will be mounted inside the

1277
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:56,159
bottom bucket at a fixed position

1278
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:58,558
so that wherever you put the tape it can

1279
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:00,798
map that out initially

1280
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,559
and then it just counts how many steps

1281
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,199
it's taken with the motor to know its

1282
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,960
position and just in case it gets bumped

1283
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:10,798
or blown around by the wind or something

1284
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:13,358
every once in a while it will also

1285
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:14,400
double check its position against that

1286
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:15,920
magnet

1287
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,720
so that

1288
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,639
hope that that will be working

1289
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,239
reliably still have to finish the

1290
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:23,598
software on that

1291
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:26,798
hey dave um

1292
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:30,318
can you explain what the tape sensor is

1293
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:32,159
for oh right yeah thank you

1294
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:33,279
um the i

1295
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,279
the

1296
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:40,079
tape sensor it allows you to mark an

1297
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:43,359
area that the scarecrow should skip

1298
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:47,440
so for example if you need to

1299
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:49,920
put the scarecrow at the side of the

1300
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,079
field maybe because the field's right up

1301
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,760
against a road you might

1302
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,318
block off

1303
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,839
by marking the inside of the bucket with

1304
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:00,239
tape

1305
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:03,279
and the tape sensor would see that and

1306
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:06,239
say oh i should shut down the laser and

1307
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,319
skip rapidly over this area to get back

1308
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:11,519
to somewhere i can be useful

1309
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,639
uh that cover that well enough julie

1310
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,039
um

1311
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:18,000
uh yeah perfect thanks

1312
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,519
thank you yes uh

1313
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,358
so

1314
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:24,239
rebecca mentioned that we have ours

1315
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:26,719
designed not to work at night uh at

1316
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:29,279
least once it's truly dark

1317
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:31,598
we've had some trouble we've been using

1318
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,599
just a standard cadmium sulfide

1319
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:37,280
photoresistor which has been you know

1320
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:39,280
how light sensors have worked since

1321
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,000
you know forever

1322
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,880
but they're this these do seem to be

1323
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,679
inconsistent from part to part

1324
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:50,160
if you have one that won't turn on

1325
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:52,558
rapidly i can talk to you about putting

1326
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:55,838
in an extra parallel resistor

1327
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,200
to increase its sensitivity

1328
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:59,199
still working on figuring out the

1329
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:02,960
part-to-part consistency of a

1330
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:04,960
replacement photo transistor

1331
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,880
but this photo transistor has the

1332
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,400
advantage in that it is specifically

1333
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:14,000
designed for dawn dusk sensing

1334
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,440
and uh that should offer some

1335
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,358
improvements there

1336
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,000
basically i've found that

1337
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:23,279
um you know as soon as i get to like

1338
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,838
about 10 lux it's almost at full level

1339
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,160
and yeah

1340
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:32,480
the 10 lux is nothing that's like you

1341
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:34,960
can barely see where you're walking so

1342
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,358
um another reliability issue is the

1343
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,199
pinball tilt switch it works great for

1344
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:42,639
telling you when something's

1345
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:44,639
uh tilted over and this micro switch was

1346
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:47,039
able to completely remove power to the

1347
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,838
scarecrow

1348
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:51,358
but we had a weird thing happen where

1349
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:54,000
uh wind

1350
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:56,239
a consistent wind could make the

1351
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,838
scarecrow on the pole oscillate a little

1352
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:01,039
bit

1353
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:03,039
and at the right frequency that seemed

1354
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:06,159
to actually make the pinball lift off

1355
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:09,838
the switch and shut down the laser

1356
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:10,719
even though it hadn't really been tilted

1357
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:13,358
so

1358
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:17,199
the replacement for that is just this

1359
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:20,000
tiny little two millimeter square

1360
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,439
ic on the main circuit board that is an

1361
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,920
accelerometer

1362
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,960
and what that does is it measures the

1363
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:29,039
pull of gravity in

1364
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:32,318
three directions

1365
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:35,279
and so if we find that we've got less

1366
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:37,119
than 0.9 g pulling down we know that the

1367
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,280
scarecrow has tipped

1368
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:42,880
over 45 degrees

1369
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,319
and that would not happen in the light

1370
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,880
wind so

1371
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:50,639
the disadvantage being that's software

1372
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:53,200
only it won't completely shut off power

1373
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:55,199
but you know we can certainly turn off

1374
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:57,838
the laser and stop the motor if we

1375
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:57,838
detect that

1376
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,880
uh

1377
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:06,159
use of assembly and mounting in 2020 we

1378
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,680
i was able to provide a you know cnc

1379
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:10,480
pre-drilled

1380
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:12,558
plywood base so that you could get all

1381
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,199
your mounting holes in the right place

1382
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:17,200
but still there were 16 of them and

1383
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:20,078
some of them you can see the

1384
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:21,919
accessing the screws for the main motor

1385
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:24,160
here in the middle for a little

1386
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,159
difficult we had to prove i provided a

1387
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:29,118
custom tool for that

1388
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:33,039
i think if you

1389
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:36,400
assemble one of the 30 available 2022

1390
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:38,558
kits you'll find that it is much simpler

1391
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,440
we've got all these

1392
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,599
uh

1393
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,838
all these attachments have been replaced

1394
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:46,720
with just four machine screws that go

1395
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:48,159
into captive nylock nuts in the base of

1396
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:50,318
the motor stand

1397
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:52,639
so that's one of the things that having

1398
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:54,480
that idea of putting the circuit board

1399
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:57,838
around everything instead of off to the

1400
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,639
side facilitated

1401
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:02,960
a little bit of a challenge for some

1402
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:05,199
people in getting the spiral arm

1403
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:08,079
position it was easy to get it like too

1404
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:11,519
far away and so it would lose a lot of

1405
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,839
its range and not start pointing down

1406
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,759
um

1407
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:18,159
the there's there are some very slight

1408
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,160
differences in geometry to try to help

1409
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:21,838
ensure that you get the full range of

1410
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,000
motion but perhaps one of the most

1411
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:26,719
useful things will be just this little

1412
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,679
hole in the side of the spiral arm

1413
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:32,078
when you do your post assembly testing

1414
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:34,078
and turn it on turn it off again

1415
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:36,480
and the servo will have gone to this

1416
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:39,599
midpoint position and then you can just

1417
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,519
align that dot with the middle of the

1418
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:44,240
laser module

1419
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:46,639
this spiral iron pushes the laser down

1420
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:49,519
to get the lower angles and then when it

1421
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:51,679
comes up the laser points horizontally

1422
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:54,000
so that should be easier to assemble

1423
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:54,000
there

1424
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,559
we had some trouble with a 3d printed

1425
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:01,760
coupler

1426
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:05,359
pandemic issues we're not able to get um

1427
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:07,280
a good quality uh five millimeter

1428
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:10,000
adapter so i printed one that worked

1429
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:13,119
fine but you had to keep tightening it

1430
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,400
because if you use loctite it crumbles

1431
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:16,720
the plastic

1432
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,039
we were able to find a good source of

1433
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:22,639
aluminum couplers eventually and sent

1434
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:25,599
those out so if you had a 20 20 kit

1435
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:28,000
and you didn't get that upgraded yet you

1436
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:30,160
should have received those parts and

1437
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,599
can do that if you had any trouble with

1438
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:33,598
these screws coming out

1439
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,559
a couple unlucky people

1440
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,358
managed to

1441
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:43,680
damage one of the uh

1442
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:45,358
we start with 12 volts from your battery

1443
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:46,879
reduce that to 5 volts for the

1444
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:49,279
electronics and

1445
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:51,280
also to four and a half volts for the

1446
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,040
laser though honestly the laser would be

1447
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,839
as happy with five

1448
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,838
the way we were tackling the laser meant

1449
01:01:55,838 --> 01:02:00,239
that if you

1450
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:01,759
put that butt converter in one position

1451
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:03,439
off they were separate from the circuit

1452
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,039
board little daughter boards that you

1453
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,639
plugged in

1454
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,079
if you were off by one pin you could

1455
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:11,358
damage the converter board and

1456
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:14,000
microcontroller would and so

1457
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:14,960
we've just totally bypassed those

1458
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
separate

1459
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:20,559
power modules instead we have one shared

1460
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,960
power module that is

1461
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,640
designed right into the main circular

1462
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,838
board

1463
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:29,920
oh and i also threw in a couple of fuses

1464
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:32,318
uh right on little

1465
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:34,559
resettable fuses right on the circuit

1466
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:37,759
board so that should help make sure that

1467
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,760
nothing goes too weird

1468
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:45,679
uh one of the challenges with that lid

1469
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:47,519
and accessing the controls is the

1470
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:49,838
strength of the gasket you can see how

1471
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:52,480
these corners really pull right over

1472
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:55,679
where the bucket lid would be

1473
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:57,760
we've found a vendor that

1474
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:59,199
has an easy peel lid that goes with

1475
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,440
their buckets

1476
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:03,679
that seems to be enough we're not trying

1477
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,079
to keep liquid from escaping the bucket

1478
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:08,639
we just want rain to go somewhere else

1479
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,559
and we had a couple heavy rainstorms did

1480
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:12,159
not receive any

1481
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,760
water coming in

1482
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:15,679
certainly if you're more comfortable

1483
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,599
with the gasketed lid given that you no

1484
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:20,239
longer have to access the interior

1485
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:22,480
controls you could

1486
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:24,798
grab one of those at the hardware store

1487
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,920
but this easy peel lid is what we'll be

1488
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:27,920
providing

1489
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,039
in the kits

1490
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:34,079
for 2022.

1491
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:36,799
a little bit of ease of use uh the

1492
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:39,839
scarecrow itself is mounted if you if

1493
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:42,079
you follow our uh model of mounting it

1494
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:44,318
to a half inch

1495
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,920
uh i'm sorry one inch half inch half

1496
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:47,038
inch iron pipe

1497
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,760
uh

1498
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,280
we have the uh pipe hanger couple of

1499
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,400
screws and

1500
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:57,599
that's how the laser scarecrow holds

1501
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:59,920
itself onto the pipe with a little brace

1502
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:03,039
we use the same pipe hanger to mount the

1503
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:05,039
emergency stop switch box

1504
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:07,039
well now we've also got a box for the

1505
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:09,920
external controls and it's like six

1506
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,359
screws that's starting to sound a little

1507
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,639
bit annoying

1508
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:16,639
i found these spring clamps that we'll

1509
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:19,199
use instead they'll be on the back of

1510
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:21,199
these little pieces of pvc trim that

1511
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:23,679
hold the boxes and you should be able to

1512
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:24,879
just snap those by pushing them onto the

1513
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:26,960
pole

1514
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:30,480
or pulling them off and that should make

1515
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,480
things a little bit easier there

1516
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:36,719
added a piezo buzzer to provide a

1517
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:38,960
warning tone that will

1518
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:41,519
provide some

1519
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:44,318
feedback on well perhaps most

1520
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:45,280
importantly the pre-laser warning tone

1521
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:47,759
where

1522
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:50,480
in 2020 we don't have a buzzer so

1523
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,400
instead we just spin the arm around

1524
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,719
rapidly a few times

1525
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:58,079
as your pre-emission warning

1526
01:04:54,719 --> 01:05:00,239
uh we'll probably still do that but also

1527
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:02,640
uh have the

1528
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:04,239
buzzer going there too

1529
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,318
we'll also be able to use that to

1530
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:09,199
indicate error modes

1531
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:11,119
uh that for example if you've said we

1532
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:13,038
really need to make sure we see the tape

1533
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,318
here but it can't sense the tape for

1534
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:17,039
some reason

1535
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:19,920
uh or fails to home

1536
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:21,520
uh then we could indicate that with a

1537
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,119
tone

1538
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:24,798
yeah

1539
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,400
unfortunately i can't get the pitch low

1540
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:28,639
enough to make it sound like it's

1541
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:32,240
snoring when it's asleep but we'll maybe

1542
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:32,239
make it click every once in a while

1543
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:38,720
julie's video showed laser barriers hers

1544
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,559
were

1545
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:43,118
seemed to be a little bit translucent

1546
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:47,920
green which was sufficient to lower the

1547
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:50,960
intensity i think and diffuse the beam

1548
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:53,200
to make it easier to set that up

1549
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:56,000
we've found that

1550
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:58,639
uh black poly report covers that you can

1551
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,880
get at copy shops office supply shops

1552
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:02,798
and we'll include one with the kits

1553
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,880
seem to work really well you can cut

1554
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:08,318
them to size shape and they're stiff

1555
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:11,200
enough to just slide it in between the

1556
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:16,558
outer bucket and the inner bucket

1557
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:18,558
and do a fine job of blocking the laser

1558
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:21,680
not showing right here

1559
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:23,680
you see this is the uh tape sensor and

1560
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:26,000
so what you'd want it you you would also

1561
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:27,598
put some black tape around here

1562
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,480
if you were actually trying to block

1563
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:31,920
this area and that would instruct the

1564
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:35,280
laser

1565
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:39,039
this the circuitry to skip that area

1566
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:42,000
uh we're planning to also take a just a

1567
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:45,280
common deburring tool and peel off a

1568
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,519
little bevel from the outside of the

1569
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,760
inner bucket and the inside of the outer

1570
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:52,960
bucket just to make that easier for you

1571
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:57,520
to slide that in and so if you like this

1572
01:06:52,960 --> 01:07:00,159
idea and have a 20 20 design or earlier

1573
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,838
that's how we make the little bevel and

1574
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:03,679
you should be able to do that pretty

1575
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:05,759
easily if you don't have one of those

1576
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:08,480
tools there already they're fairly

1577
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,480
inexpensive

1578
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,798
um

1579
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:15,358
we the design for the laser attenuator

1580
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:17,599
the cap

1581
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:19,920
there's this little ring at the end of

1582
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:22,798
the laser that these ridges would hook

1583
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,079
onto in 2020

1584
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:26,880
i

1585
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:29,039
wanted something well i've never seen

1586
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:32,720
that they actually fall off it just

1587
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:35,599
seemed a little imprecise and

1588
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:38,318
with the addition of this o-ring around

1589
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,920
the end of the laser you can now kind of

1590
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:43,519
screw that on

1591
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:45,760
and that should that will hold

1592
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:46,798
even more securely than the previous

1593
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,520
version

1594
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:53,358
useful for transport and if you're

1595
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:53,358
setting it up and stuff like that

1596
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,639
one thing that was confusing is

1597
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:58,559
sometimes people go out to their field

1598
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:01,679
and look at the laser and hey it's not

1599
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:04,160
doing anything and it turns okay i turn

1600
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:06,719
it off and back on and it's fine again

1601
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:08,078
i think what we were seeing was that

1602
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:10,558
based on the manufacturer

1603
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:12,400
recommendations we were asking letting

1604
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,000
the laser cool down for five minutes

1605
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,719
every 30 minutes because they

1606
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,359
recommended a duty cycle of two to four

1607
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:21,359
hours which is nothing compared to a

1608
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:22,400
summer day

1609
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:24,960
um

1610
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:27,838
i did some testing and found that while

1611
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,798
the laser module would heat rapidly in

1612
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:34,318
the first couple of hours

1613
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:35,119
it after about it didn't continue to

1614
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,120
heat

1615
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:40,000
it went from an ambient temperature of

1616
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:42,719
about 22 to somewhere around 30 and just

1617
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
stayed there a little bit colder

1618
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,039
overnight

1619
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,880
um

1620
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:48,000
you know furnace came on in the morning

1621
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,880
i think

1622
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,920
uh

1623
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,039
and

1624
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:54,719
oh then that big drop is where i

1625
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:56,719
accidentally knocked it over and decided

1626
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,679
that was the end of the test but uh

1627
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:59,520
anyway

1628
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:01,359
the laser seemed fine it didn't seem to

1629
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:04,000
have any trouble

1630
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:07,440
living at 30 degrees centigrade instead

1631
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:11,679
of 25 and so we're not including that

1632
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:12,559
cooldown anymore in 2022.

1633
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:15,520
um

1634
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:18,400
couple people had trouble with the

1635
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:21,600
crimp terminals pulling off the

1636
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:23,519
wiring for the emergency stop switch

1637
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,880
uh we're going to

1638
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,560
um

1639
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,920
hired a student with greater hand

1640
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:33,120
strength to do the crimping and also are

1641
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:35,838
using marine style crimps with heat

1642
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:38,318
shrink and a waterproof wire nut for the

1643
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:40,640
ones that just go together instead of uh

1644
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:43,279
having spade

1645
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:45,759
tongue terminals on that

1646
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,759
um

1647
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,920
a little bit of uh

1648
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,838
pot

1649
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:57,039
when you when you put our scarecrow

1650
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:57,039
show it here um

1651
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:01,599
the

1652
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:03,198
i was just in this is really minor but

1653
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,360
if we're going to try to keep things

1654
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:07,599
straight and level it seem like we ought

1655
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:10,559
to try to fit the pipe better here's

1656
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,239
that half inch iron pipe into the one

1657
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:15,520
inch pvc

1658
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:18,479
so i made a little shim to take up that

1659
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:21,040
extra space and also spent some time

1660
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:24,079
calculating the taper

1661
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:26,560
of the bucket much more precisely and so

1662
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:28,880
we have a thicker pad on the bottom and

1663
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,280
a thinner pad on the outside

1664
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,199
it honestly probably doesn't make a big

1665
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:36,079
difference i mean your pole isn't

1666
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:39,119
necessarily straight anyway but

1667
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:39,119
it might help a bit

1668
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,880
minor assembly issue is that you have to

1669
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:47,280
be careful of the shaft when

1670
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,800
assembling it because the shaft you can

1671
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:51,599
see the end of the shaft was just a

1672
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,679
little too long and you wouldn't want to

1673
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,520
bend that i've shorted the shaft a

1674
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:58,319
little bit so now you can just put the

1675
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:01,040
bucket bottom on a flat surface and push

1676
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,880
the bucket top straight down onto it

1677
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:05,920
also makes it easier to stack multiple

1678
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:08,000
units if you do

1679
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:11,920
have that

1680
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:14,079
so those are the major changes that

1681
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:17,199
we've made for the

1682
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:20,719
design in 2022

1683
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:24,000
um well it's probably too late to make

1684
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:25,600
further changes to the kit design but if

1685
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,840
they're you know

1686
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,920
we definitely want to know if you

1687
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,360
experience issues or

1688
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,359
failures

1689
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:38,000
using the device anything i haven't

1690
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:41,039
mentioned please do let me know um

1691
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:44,158
so you know i as of right now i don't i

1692
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:46,880
think rebecca has said this is the last

1693
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:49,759
year of the grants we currently have so

1694
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:53,039
future development isn't certain but

1695
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:55,119
knowing what can be improved is always

1696
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:58,640
useful

1697
01:11:55,119 --> 01:12:00,880
i think thanks so much david um

1698
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:03,920
and um

1699
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:07,440
i'm going to have chuck bourne go next

1700
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:09,679
with some of his tips as we're about 10

1701
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:14,000
15

1702
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:15,760
so as he's preparing to share his slides

1703
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,560
david could you

1704
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:22,400
address how long do you think it takes

1705
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,520
to assemble one of the new kits roughly

1706
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:26,399
and

1707
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,719
again the cost and how to get

1708
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:30,879
one of the kits and then any other

1709
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:32,800
questions you might address in the chat

1710
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:36,239
itself

1711
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:38,640
right um one question was

1712
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:38,639
whether

1713
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:43,279
you can

1714
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:45,760
apply any of these upgrades

1715
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:47,519
most of the upgrades do require a

1716
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,600
different microcontroller and different

1717
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:52,400
software

1718
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:55,679
one grower has indicated an interest in

1719
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:57,759
upgrading two of the kits i have about

1720
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,880
five test boards that i might be able to

1721
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,760
do with

1722
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,760
with

1723
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,840
do upgrades with

1724
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,880
um

1725
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,760
so

1726
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,440
um

1727
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,440
you know i'll i'll start to be talking

1728
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:11,678
with that grower

1729
01:13:09,439 --> 01:13:15,279
still need to work on the details of

1730
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:20,399
this first assembly time i think it was

1731
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:21,759
it should be faster than the 2020 kits

1732
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:23,039
i would

1733
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,600
ex

1734
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:28,880
i haven't been able to do one from start

1735
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:31,280
to finish myself yet

1736
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,640
but i'm thinking it's probably about

1737
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:36,960
four hours

1738
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:39,119
um you know depending on your

1739
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,600
comfort level you know you can

1740
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:42,800
take a look at the assembly instructions

1741
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,320
from

1742
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:48,800
2020 on that website and we'll try to

1743
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:51,439
provide similar quality

1744
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,440
this year

1745
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:56,319
and the cost we are

1746
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:58,639
going to

1747
01:13:56,319 --> 01:14:01,759
um

1748
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:05,039
yeah so as rebecca said that 2018 kits

1749
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:06,560
cannot easily be upgraded there are

1750
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:09,600
because of the circuit board being

1751
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,800
completely new um but

1752
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,440
you know

1753
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,520
the drive mechanism is the same and the

1754
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:18,079
slip ring is the same so it's not

1755
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:21,199
completely impossible either

1756
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:23,600
uh not my current focus

1757
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:26,960
and your last question was the cost i

1758
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:30,159
think rebecca mentioned that we are

1759
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:33,039
trying to let these kits out the door at

1760
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:37,839
very close to our cost and

1761
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:37,840
expecting that to be 650 dollars

1762
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,439
okay great and so if people are

1763
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:46,479
interested they can email

1764
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:49,599
you and rebecca maybe rebecca can put

1765
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:51,599
that email in the chat again

1766
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,120
and we can certainly address that at the

1767
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:57,039
end

1768
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:58,079
so uh we're gonna move on with uh

1769
01:14:57,039 --> 01:15:00,238
chuck's

1770
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:02,719
short presentation

1771
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:03,519
um david if you want to address any of

1772
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:06,239
those

1773
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:08,880
uh chat questions you may certainly do

1774
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:11,119
that in the chat thank you

1775
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,719
so go ahead chuck bourne

1776
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:14,640
thank you julie good morning everyone

1777
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:16,880
hopefully you can hear me okay

1778
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,880
so uh i'm just gonna talk a little bit

1779
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,400
about how we mount our lasers because

1780
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,920
that's one of the questions that i seem

1781
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:23,519
to get quite a bit

1782
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,840
uh there's no

1783
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:28,159
i don't think easy way to do it and this

1784
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,760
is just how we you know decided to do

1785
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:31,599
ours i've seen other ways and i think

1786
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,239
julie has a really cool way

1787
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,520
that she developed for mounting hers

1788
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:37,359
but i just want to run through some of

1789
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,800
the general components and and why we

1790
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:39,679
use this but

1791
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,079
so

1792
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:44,719
you know we just make a simple cross

1793
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,679
with some treated uh two by fours uh and

1794
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,520
then

1795
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:49,600
go ahead and mount that floor flange

1796
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:52,080
that you see right here and then we went

1797
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,679
ahead and bought a 10 foot length of

1798
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:57,039
half inch

1799
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:58,560
threaded iron pipe that i cut in half

1800
01:15:57,039 --> 01:15:59,920
and then just screwed in so that's kind

1801
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,039
of our base

1802
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,960
right there

1803
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:04,560
as you can see it goes up that's again

1804
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,960
five feet

1805
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,640
i also have you'll see these two pieces

1806
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,319
of 3 8

1807
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:13,520
rebar

1808
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:15,039
we also used long bolts we had a bunch

1809
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,679
of different ways

1810
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:20,560
but these are essentially what we use to

1811
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:21,920
pound into the ground to keep that that

1812
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,600
base from moving

1813
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,119
uh and we had pretty good pretty good

1814
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,719
success with that you don't have to

1815
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:27,840
plunk obviously you don't put them in

1816
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:29,198
two foot

1817
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,520
but just get them in enough so that that

1818
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:32,559
base doesn't doesn't want to walk or

1819
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,719
you know

1820
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:37,120
move move on you

1821
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:37,119
all right

1822
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:49,840
and then just moving on uh so

1823
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,439
the upper half of our unit um because i

1824
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,719
had

1825
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:57,279
already purchased and had uh some

1826
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:59,279
uh half inch electrical conduit

1827
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:01,599
uh that's what we

1828
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:02,719
mounted the actual bracket that holds

1829
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,520
the bucket

1830
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:05,198
too

1831
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:08,000
and what that allows me to do is i can

1832
01:17:05,198 --> 01:17:08,960
then take the electrical conduit pretty

1833
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,039
much

1834
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,560
put it side by side to the electrical

1835
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:14,079
pipe and then

1836
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,159
i use two

1837
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:17,439
heavy duty hose clamps and i just

1838
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:19,519
tighten those down

1839
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:21,439
and that allows me to

1840
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,080
i can adjust that height anywhere i want

1841
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:25,039
to uh which is is really nice

1842
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:27,840
um

1843
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:29,359
it's a little cumbersome uh you can do

1844
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:32,560
it by yourself you just got to make sure

1845
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:35,439
you have a a good socket wrench with the

1846
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:36,880
the socket with with the right socket

1847
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:38,399
uh usually what i can do is i can

1848
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,480
unloosen one of these

1849
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:42,079
um get enough uh loosen this one a

1850
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,519
little bit slide it to where i think

1851
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:46,559
it's got to be and then tighten it right

1852
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:48,480
back down so it's pretty pretty quick uh

1853
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,800
also pretty inexpensive which is another

1854
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:52,718
thing i'm all about trying to fuse what

1855
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,159
i had around the house

1856
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:57,198
so that's what we did

1857
01:17:54,158 --> 01:18:00,238
now we also added a

1858
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:01,039
a solar charger uh trickle charger so

1859
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:03,119
that

1860
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:05,119
we you know don't have to keep swapping

1861
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:07,840
out batteries uh and this the one that

1862
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:08,960
we purchased was a 45 dollar unit off of

1863
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,880
amazon

1864
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:15,439
um it's a 20 watt uh 12 volt 10 amp

1865
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,880
mono crystalline waterproof solar panel

1866
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:19,119
and essentially

1867
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:21,920
they don't give you anything to mount

1868
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:25,198
those panels with

1869
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:27,279
so i just went ahead and i

1870
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:28,000
had some of these l brackets

1871
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:31,279
and

1872
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,279
just a simple pipe clamp

1873
01:18:31,279 --> 01:18:34,238
two of these one on the bottom one on

1874
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:35,279
the top

1875
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:36,879
um

1876
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:38,719
one's a little bit longer than the other

1877
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,760
just to get a little bit of an angle to

1878
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:42,399
it

1879
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,000
but but that worked out really good

1880
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:46,960
and we could move that

1881
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,359
unit around pretty quickly

1882
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:51,520
so that's you know that's essentially

1883
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:53,679
what my unit looks like in the field

1884
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,600
top to bottom it's also nice to put that

1885
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:57,119
battery up off the ground but it also

1886
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:00,000
gives some weight on that base to keep

1887
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:01,279
it from uh from floating or moving that

1888
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,960
much

1889
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:04,639
i will still say that the battery is

1890
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:06,399
probably still the hardest part to move

1891
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,840
it's the heaviest

1892
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:10,879
i've been able to walk this thing into

1893
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:13,840
the field um by myself with the battery

1894
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:15,679
the scarecrow unit the base and uh you

1895
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:19,119
know a two or three pound sledgehammer

1896
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:22,640
to pound those uh rebar uh pieces in

1897
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:24,640
uh so you can do it by yourself

1898
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,480
um

1899
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,640
i i guess this is just a really short

1900
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:31,599
video but um

1901
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:33,600
one of the things that we've noticed

1902
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,039
is the fact that even a little bit of

1903
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,400
breeze and you'll see the breeze kick up

1904
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:38,719
here in a second

1905
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:40,799
and david alluded to this earlier

1906
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:43,119
with the tilt switch that was in there i

1907
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,719
think that little bit of wiggle was

1908
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:47,359
bouncing that ball in there and we kept

1909
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:50,640
having the unit turn on and off

1910
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:52,079
with the new the new changes this year

1911
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,199
you know hopefully that's not going to

1912
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:55,039
be an issue

1913
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:57,279
um moving forward

1914
01:19:55,039 --> 01:19:59,119
we actually um and i think it might have

1915
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:01,439
been on david's recommendation took a

1916
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:03,359
piece of uh foam

1917
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:05,198
like off of pool noodle or something i

1918
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:07,519
had and stuck in the

1919
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:08,479
in the where the pinball is in that tilt

1920
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,199
switch

1921
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:12,479
just to try to to limit the movement

1922
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:14,719
um

1923
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:16,479
you know i'm not sure

1924
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,319
you know more rigid and and i think

1925
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:20,000
julie uses a t-post which might be a

1926
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:21,279
little more rigid but then takes a

1927
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,719
little more effort to get in and out of

1928
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:25,119
the field i think too

1929
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:28,079
um but that's essentially as i said how

1930
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:30,238
we uh have set ours up

1931
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:32,639
um and then i i need to point this out

1932
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:35,279
because i spent probably about an hour

1933
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:37,440
and a half one day

1934
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:40,158
on the cables that come david puts a

1935
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:42,079
little piece of red tape on the positive

1936
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:43,519
uh

1937
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:45,359
wire cable

1938
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,000
well somewhere along the lines that

1939
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,920
slipped off and i lost it um and then i

1940
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,198
have to follow all that cable back to

1941
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:55,039
figure out um which one is the positive

1942
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:56,960
and which one was the negative

1943
01:20:55,039 --> 01:20:58,719
and uh so go ahead and putting some

1944
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:01,600
alligator clips on those instead of just

1945
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:04,480
the bare wire um would probably help

1946
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,880
uh or just making sure that you you

1947
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:09,359
you know keep that uh

1948
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:11,679
that wire that red wire on there to make

1949
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:14,960
sure you always know what is your

1950
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:14,960
positive and what your your

1951
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,920
you could probably also just stick a

1952
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:23,519
piece of black tape on the on the um

1953
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,440
negative terminal

1954
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:28,320
uh negative wire too and that would

1955
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:30,559
would kind of clear that up a little bit

1956
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:32,158
um and just you know the things that we

1957
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,800
found and and we've been working with

1958
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:35,759
these units since 2017

1959
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,320
and

1960
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:41,440
i will say that you know as far as

1961
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:43,119
efficacy i do feel they work very well i

1962
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:44,479
think it's another tool to add to our

1963
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:46,238
tool box

1964
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:48,559
but like anything else there's these

1965
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:50,158
little caveats and and rebecca alluded

1966
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,080
to it earlier you got to get them out

1967
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:54,238
there early

1968
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:56,158
before those scout birds are actually

1969
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:58,079
out looking

1970
01:21:56,158 --> 01:21:59,839
because if they if you can keep them out

1971
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:01,920
uh i think you'll do a much better job

1972
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:04,079
of keeping the rest of the flock out

1973
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,560
so i like to i try to get it out there

1974
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:09,519
just as silking starts or midway through

1975
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:11,600
soaking or even at the very tail end of

1976
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,520
soaking

1977
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,880
you cannot set it and forget about it

1978
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,239
you need to go out and check on it once

1979
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,000
in a while make sure they're working

1980
01:22:16,238 --> 01:22:19,119
make sure the battery is charged or

1981
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,399
charging

1982
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:22,238
so it's

1983
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:24,238
it's still you know a little bit of time

1984
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:26,959
that you need to spend to just make sure

1985
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:28,559
that you're they're running properly

1986
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,920
um

1987
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,239
i

1988
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:33,920
everything that we've done 90 of what

1989
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:36,158
we've done there's been some other

1990
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,079
deterrent uh in the field and in this

1991
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:40,719
case we've been using it with propane

1992
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:43,359
cannons so we have a laser maybe on one

1993
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:45,439
end and a cannon on the other end

1994
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:46,719
and i think that just keeps those birds

1995
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:47,919
on edge enough because they don't know

1996
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:49,840
what's coming they don't know if it's

1997
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,920
the light they don't know if it's a

1998
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:54,159
scare and then if you can back that up

1999
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:56,560
there with a uh a shotgun blast every

2000
01:22:54,158 --> 01:22:58,000
once in a while um and i know that's

2001
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:00,960
hard to do in

2002
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,840
in places where uh you have neighbors

2003
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:06,079
uh but it's it just reinforces that

2004
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,360
whole idea and keeps them on their on

2005
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:09,600
their toes

2006
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:12,079
um and again you know

2007
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,000
these units really the the uri units

2008
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:15,760
have been great and

2009
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,079
they're they're low cost enough where i

2010
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,400
think you can have a couple units um and

2011
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:22,079
you need to have a couple especially in

2012
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:23,920
in fields where you have multiple

2013
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:25,760
plantings uh so that you can kind of

2014
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:27,199
keep moving them along

2015
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,199
along the line

2016
01:23:27,198 --> 01:23:31,359
so those are the tips that i had

2017
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:33,198
there's my contact information

2018
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:35,839
um i you know

2019
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:37,519
natasha and i uh our technician

2020
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,000
i will say that we got pretty good at

2021
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:41,600
assembling these units um and i think we

2022
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,960
had it down this would be two of us

2023
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,039
working on them

2024
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:48,158
um we had it down to about an hour a

2025
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:50,639
unit um which i thought was pretty good

2026
01:23:48,158 --> 01:23:52,960
um and uh i

2027
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:55,440
i will offer my assistance uh wherever i

2028
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,600
can at least for our region uh for those

2029
01:23:55,439 --> 01:23:59,759
of you that might want to try one or are

2030
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,760
interested in purchasing one so with

2031
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,880
that julie that's that's really all i

2032
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,560
had to

2033
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:08,239
to share

2034
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:10,159
uh thanks so much chuck and um

2035
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:13,439
so we're getting

2036
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:14,799
uh just about out of time here i just

2037
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:18,158
want to

2038
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,600
show a couple things about my

2039
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:21,920
setup

2040
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:24,239
and so i'm gonna skip through that a

2041
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:27,679
little bit

2042
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:31,319
let me make sure i'm doing a slide show

2043
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:31,319
okay yep

2044
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,639
sometimes these uh

2045
01:24:33,279 --> 01:24:37,279
things so

2046
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:39,840
okay uh just quickly this is how the

2047
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:42,319
kits came to us last year i worked on

2048
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,960
assembling them i had fun doing it but i

2049
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:46,000
wasn't the quickest person uh really

2050
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,279
well

2051
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,319
um

2052
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:50,880
really

2053
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:53,279
really great kids that are really well

2054
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,719
organized great directions

2055
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:57,920
um

2056
01:24:54,719 --> 01:25:00,480
i wanted to just emphasize one thing is

2057
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:03,359
say this is last year's kit and that is

2058
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:04,718
make sure before you go to the field you

2059
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:06,479
understand

2060
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:08,800
how to

2061
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:10,559
control the kits how they work that they

2062
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:14,320
actually are working

2063
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:17,120
um the last year's kits have a speed an

2064
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:17,119
angle that

2065
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:23,198
controls the tilt of the

2066
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:24,000
laser and then what was called a wiggle

2067
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:26,399
that

2068
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,880
can allow for motion

2069
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:31,359
in the vertical and of course david has

2070
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:33,520
changed this but it took a lot for me to

2071
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:34,799
understand how to

2072
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,520
um

2073
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,239
to

2074
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,800
operate all this what they did and let

2075
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:42,718
me tell you to go out in the field and

2076
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:45,360
try to do it the first time was not a

2077
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:47,359
good system for me i think i made almost

2078
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:49,359
all of the mistakes that everybody else

2079
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:51,198
talked about but in the end i i really

2080
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:53,119
understand how they work

2081
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:55,198
and um

2082
01:25:53,119 --> 01:25:59,439
and i think that that's a good thing for

2083
01:25:55,198 --> 01:26:01,198
success so again i had it in my office

2084
01:25:59,439 --> 01:26:03,279
and i was

2085
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:06,479
able to test it out so either if you

2086
01:26:03,279 --> 01:26:08,960
have a battery or david supplied me with

2087
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:11,198
an electrical cord that i could plug in

2088
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,480
in my office and that worked out great

2089
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:14,879
again

2090
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:17,119
to make sure with the this laser had a

2091
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:19,840
cap on it and you could watch it spin

2092
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:22,319
around or the one on the right i had

2093
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:24,639
just shining on the wall again please be

2094
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:27,119
careful to protect your eyes if you're

2095
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:29,600
doing this

2096
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:31,599
okay set up uh in the field rebecca

2097
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:34,480
already showed you this i was working in

2098
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:38,400
very large processing sweet corn fields

2099
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:42,158
in western new york uh my setup so i had

2100
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:45,198
on the left i had a very uh sturdy

2101
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:47,359
uh post that i got from our local

2102
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:49,359
lowe's department store

2103
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:52,079
these were the heaviest duty ones you

2104
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:54,880
could i pounded those in the ground and

2105
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:56,800
then i had to have something some kind

2106
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:59,600
of post that i could

2107
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:01,920
transport in my sedan car

2108
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:04,960
and i came up with these telescopic

2109
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:07,039
poles that are used for like the pool

2110
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:09,760
industry where you could attach your

2111
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:13,600
different uh net or whatever and then

2112
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:16,480
scope them out uh 10 12 feet into a pool

2113
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:18,880
to scope scoop up bugs or whatnot

2114
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:21,599
i wanted to make um

2115
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:23,840
the point that these posts at the bottom

2116
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:27,520
had some holes drilled through and i

2117
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:29,440
actually bolted those onto my steel post

2118
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,760
that didn't go all the way into the

2119
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:34,079
ground because i couldn't get it pounded

2120
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:36,480
in but they were pretty sturdy this

2121
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:39,920
particular setup i also

2122
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:41,039
put another post next to it and kind of

2123
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,440
um

2124
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:44,719
tied everything together with duct tape

2125
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:46,479
and little

2126
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:48,880
straps and things like that i didn't go

2127
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:50,399
with that later on and then you can see

2128
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:53,679
i chose

2129
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:55,519
a smaller size battery these are still

2130
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:58,480
12 volt they're something that would be

2131
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:00,960
used in like a golf cart or a scooter

2132
01:27:58,479 --> 01:28:05,198
they're 23 pounds there was no way in

2133
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:07,359
heck i was able to lift a 50 60 pound

2134
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:08,638
battery like chuck was doing

2135
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:11,599
and um

2136
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:14,639
that was how i managed uh the the

2137
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:17,920
advantage of the telescopic pole it was

2138
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:19,199
very easy to unscrew these

2139
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,840
two

2140
01:28:19,198 --> 01:28:24,479
sections and slide them up and down

2141
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,480
really easy

2142
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:29,119
so here's a little better this one again

2143
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:31,039
was where i had the two posts they were

2144
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:33,840
kind of duct taped together

2145
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:36,719
i had actually ended up having the on

2146
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:38,239
off switch up more at user height which

2147
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:39,920
made it really

2148
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:41,678
easy but here's how you know you

2149
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,600
basically unscrew these two different

2150
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:45,679
things or loosen them up and then you

2151
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,440
can adjust the height of the laser i

2152
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:50,158
spent a lot of time trying to get the

2153
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:50,158
laser height

2154
01:28:50,238 --> 01:28:54,319
right

2155
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:55,359
then in the end we were collecting data

2156
01:28:54,319 --> 01:28:57,198
and

2157
01:28:55,359 --> 01:29:00,639
we had a 10-foot

2158
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:03,279
pvc pipe or later on i actually did have

2159
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:06,800
a measuring tape out there and we were

2160
01:29:03,279 --> 01:29:10,000
collecting how many of the ears in that

2161
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,760
10-foot section had bird damaged bird

2162
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
peck

2163
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:16,320
um i also want to just show two of my

2164
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,079
grower setups this was one grower we

2165
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:20,960
were working with

2166
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:23,439
in niagara county he had a 10 foot

2167
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:26,560
pole and again he had it kind of he

2168
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:30,158
pounded in a t post and connected this

2169
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:32,000
laser to that it was pretty sturdy

2170
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:35,439
but i also wanted to point out he had

2171
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:38,079
scary balloons on this grower i think he

2172
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:40,479
had the laser too high up in the air but

2173
01:29:38,079 --> 01:29:43,840
the grower was pretty happy in reduction

2174
01:29:40,479 --> 01:29:46,559
in the number of flights the last

2175
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:49,679
slide i'm going to show this is another

2176
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:54,639
grower we had down in chautauqua county

2177
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:55,520
he mounted his black iron pipe onto this

2178
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:57,760
tote

2179
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:00,320
that has the wire gridding on the

2180
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:02,719
outside so he had it permanently mounted

2181
01:30:00,319 --> 01:30:05,679
to that again i think he's got it too

2182
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:08,399
high up in the field but he was able to

2183
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:10,880
move that tote around with a forklift or

2184
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:14,158
tractor or whatnot in his field and you

2185
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:16,719
can see he's got aisles or row laneways

2186
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:18,319
down his sweet corn fields and was able

2187
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:20,319
to move it around

2188
01:30:18,319 --> 01:30:24,000
and then on the right hand side he was

2189
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:26,639
also using these uh air dancers which he

2190
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:29,679
was actually fairly happy with and they

2191
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:32,319
were uh powered by a a little generator

2192
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:35,199
he had a series of four or five of them

2193
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:36,000
down his laneway so i'm going to end

2194
01:30:35,198 --> 01:30:38,079
that

2195
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,600
presentation

2196
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:43,519
and stop sharing that so we are a little

2197
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,000
bit over our time

2198
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:49,120
i would like so anyone that wants to

2199

01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:40,079
wants to unmute or

2221
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:41,920
put more questions in the chat box

2222
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:45,039
and another question

2223
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:46,880
about how do we order those laser

2224
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:49,279
scarecrow kits

2225
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:51,840
maybe rebecca or david want to unmute

2226
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:55,319
and just address that

2227
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:57,039
yeah the uh email brownweb

2228
01:31:55,319 --> 01:31:58,719
uri.edu

2229
01:31:57,039 --> 01:32:01,800
uh that's

2230
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:03,279
dr rebecca brown um

2231
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:05,760
[Music]

2232
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:09,439
and she put her email in the chat box

2233
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:13,119
also great and but i would also mention

2234
01:32:09,439 --> 01:32:16,319
that uri is not interested in us just

2235
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:17,279
selling kits when you request a kit from

2236
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:18,479
us

2237
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:21,279
you are

2238
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:23,599
paying for the parts and also agreeing

2239
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:24,880
to participate in the research we are

2240
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,960
allowed to

2241
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:29,359
distribute the kits as part of dr

2242
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,158
brown's research program and we'll ask

2243
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:33,439
you

2244
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:35,839
to contribute your observations from the

2245
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:38,399
field to that research

2246
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,679
and uh david when can you address when

2247
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:41,439
you think the kits are going to be

2248
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:42,399
available

2249
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:44,559
i

2250
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:45,439
am hoping for

2251
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,760
uh

2252
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:53,039
our semester and last day of classes is

2253
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:54,400
may 2nd and i hope to be have have those

2254
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:56,079
kits available

2255
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:56,879
right around then

2256
01:32:56,079 --> 01:32:58,158
i

2257
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:00,480
unfortunately

2258
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:02,799
need to be able to finish the user

2259
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:06,000
manual and

2260
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:08,079
to in order to send that to fda as part

2261
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:11,600
of our application for that a session

2262
01:33:08,079 --> 01:33:12,960
number before we can release it and

2263
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,079
then

2264
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,840
uh

2265
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:18,158
you know having the user manual done

2266
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:21,199
means having the software done and

2267
01:33:18,158 --> 01:33:23,119
yeah and all the kits design well anyway

2268
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:25,678
but yeah i'm hoping to be able to finish

2269
01:33:23,119 --> 01:33:27,519
that up in another month or so okay

2270
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:31,279
uh perfect yeah thanks for addressing

2271
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:33,440
that um i've been incredibly impressed

2272
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:35,279
of how much

2273
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:38,079
thought has gone into these laser

2274
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:39,198
scarecrows and and truly how much

2275
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:42,238
testing

2276
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:43,279
and just realized that uh to get to this

2277
01:33:42,238 --> 01:33:45,519
point

2278
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:46,880
you know there was a lot of work and so

2279
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,840
again

2280
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,560
we

2281
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:52,560
we are pretty confident that laser

2282
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,920
scarecrows as rebecca

2283
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,080
presented

2284
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:58,480
do work against birds

2285
01:33:56,079 --> 01:34:00,719
but we're trying to iron out a lot of

2286
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:04,399
the details and

2287
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:06,560
the feedback that came in last year

2288
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:10,238
after a number of growers had these out

2289
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:12,159
in the field really informed this design

2290
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:16,319
and you could see all of the changes

2291
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:18,479
that that took place for the 2022

2292
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:20,158
units so really looking forward to

2293
01:34:18,479 --> 01:34:21,519
testing those out

2294
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:24,638
in the field

2295
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,639
so appreciate that

2296
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:32,320
i just want to jump on and thank julie

2297
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:35,279
for organizing this whole thing

2298
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:36,238
uh yep you're very welcome

2299
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:38,800
um

2300
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:41,439
michael has asked a couple of times

2301
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:43,760
about

2302
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:46,559
any evidence anecdotal or otherwise of

2303
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:49,520
lasers working with mammals i believe

2304
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:52,880
the answer is that there is anecdotal

2305
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:55,119
evidence that it does not work

2306
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:58,000
there's actually studies that it does

2307
01:34:55,118 --> 01:35:02,399
not that lasers do not work with deer

2308
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:04,639
with deer species yes specifically okay

2309
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:06,879
i guess we could ask i'm thinking like

2310
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:08,480
what other mammals might there be so

2311
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:11,840
raccoons are

2312
01:35:08,479 --> 01:35:15,678
right a problem but as you said uh they

2313
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:19,199
tend to come in at night i believe so

2314
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:21,199
the units that we have turn off at night

2315
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:24,319
so the light sensor

2316
01:35:21,198 --> 01:35:26,960
uh when it gets you know to dusk or dark

2317
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:29,118
will turn the units off and then they

2318
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:30,880
will be turned back on

2319
01:35:29,118 --> 01:35:32,158
um

2320
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:35,199
at dawn

2321
01:35:32,158 --> 01:35:38,079
um because they are designed for

2322
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:40,479
you know the scaring the birds away

2323
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:42,960
so yeah and david was thinking about

2324
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:45,198
voles also so

2325
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:47,279
yeah i i don't i don't think that's

2326
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:49,919
going to it could volts mostly do their

2327
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:51,118
damage at night don't they rebecca

2328
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,440
um

2329
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:55,679
various times they'll do it during the

2330
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:57,118
day too but i really given how low they

2331
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:59,039
are to the ground i don't think they

2332
01:35:57,118 --> 01:36:01,759
would care about a laser i really wish

2333
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:04,000
they worked with bowls but

2334
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:05,199
yeah i also thought voles had poor

2335
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,158
eyesight

2336
01:36:05,198 --> 01:36:09,919
they probably do

2337
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:12,960
i mean they see better than moles do but

2338
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:15,600
i don't think they have great eyesight

2339
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:17,840
um quebec asked if fields are surrounded

2340
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:21,199
by houses does this present a safety

2341
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:23,279
concern yes absolutely anytime

2342
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:26,960
you're using a laser near humans you

2343
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:29,279
need to be concerned about safety

2344
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:31,840
one of the things you can do is mount

2345
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:35,198
the laser high and aim it down you can

2346
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:39,760
also set up the

2347
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:43,599
tape and barrier system to exclude the

2348
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:45,679
areas of houses uh you know if it's like

2349
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:48,480
on one side

2350
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:50,880
uh or you know a house here and a house

2351
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:53,359
there but

2352
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:56,079
i mean if you've got like a community

2353
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:58,960
garden plot surrounded by houses this is

2354
01:36:56,079 --> 01:37:02,238
probably not a good uh

2355
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:04,399
pest control approach lasers you know if

2356
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:07,519
they're if you just can't

2357
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:10,079
you know get it around humans so

2358
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:13,119
yeah that's that's a good point uh david

2359
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:14,479
so i i didn't get into my setup but one

2360
01:37:13,118 --> 01:37:18,000
of my

2361
01:37:14,479 --> 01:37:19,519
uh big processing fields that i had last

2362
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,600
year

2363
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:23,600
um even though the field

2364
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:28,880
you know i would have called the field

2365
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:31,199
mostly flat i didn't realize that

2366
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:34,400
where i entered the field was sort of

2367
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:37,039
like a dip and there was a road there

2368
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:40,000
and so as i was driving towards the

2369
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:42,479
field over the road one time

2370
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,238
i saw the flash of that laser and i

2371
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:46,079
scared the heck out of me i'm like and

2372
01:37:44,238 --> 01:37:47,519
there were houses

2373
01:37:46,079 --> 01:37:50,880
kind of on the other side of the road

2374
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:54,400
i'm like oh i can't have this so i

2375
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:57,679
did two things one is i put the laser

2376
01:37:54,399 --> 01:38:00,479
down a little bit further into the corn

2377
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:02,239
canopy and then that was where i also

2378
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:04,559
had that

2379
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:05,599
green plastic barrier and that was

2380
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,280
enough

2381
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:09,520
to

2382
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:11,840
you know eliminate that flash but i

2383
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:14,320
spent a lot of time looking

2384
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,360
at what was going on in that field and i

2385
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:18,000
also

2386
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:20,238
again if you can go out there either on

2387
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,198
a really cloudy day or preferably at

2388
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:26,079
dusk you'll see what's what's happening

2389
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:28,559
and so you know at dusk if the laser is

2390
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:31,039
turning off you can just shine a

2391
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:34,270
flashlight on the light center

2392
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:36,079
and that'll make it you know run

2393
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:37,920
[Music]

2394
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:40,158
and

2395
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:42,158
yeah i was really concerned about that

2396
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:44,719
so i think that you just have to be

2397
01:38:42,158 --> 01:38:46,238
aware and look at your setup if you're

2398
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:48,399
not on a really

2399
01:38:46,238 --> 01:38:49,599
flat surface again trying to be at the

2400
01:38:48,399 --> 01:38:52,638
top of the hill

2401
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:57,280
pointing it down it's it's so

2402
01:38:52,639 --> 01:39:00,480
that road was a good a thousand feet

2403
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:01,920
away from my laser setup and i was

2404
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:04,319
thinking oh you're only going to be able

2405
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:06,319
to see this like for 300 feet or

2406
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:08,799
something but not that it was gonna

2407
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:11,519
damage anybody's eyes or anything out

2408
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:14,400
that far but i could see the flash and i

2409
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:16,080
was kind of worried if one of the houses

2410
01:39:14,399 --> 01:39:18,238
you know they see me going in and out of

2411
01:39:16,079 --> 01:39:20,639
the field could probably see that unit

2412
01:39:18,238 --> 01:39:22,799
i'm like this is not good i never had

2413
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:25,679
any complaints from the farmer or the

2414
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:27,679
people but i was really really cautious

2415
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:29,679
about that

2416
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:31,840
and then again it looks like in the chat

2417
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:36,000
we're just talking about trying to get

2418
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:39,679
those uh the laser beam and sweet corn

2419
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:42,000
um across the top of those tassels so

2420
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:44,399
there's if you're too high right there's

2421
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:47,359
a possibility of

2422
01:39:44,399 --> 01:39:50,399
the birds flying underneath the beam

2423
01:39:47,359 --> 01:39:53,439
yep so that's that's that's

2424
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:53,439
something to consider

2425
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:57,840
and i guess i just say you know go out

2426
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:00,239
there see what the birds are doing does

2427
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:02,400
it look like they're deterring hopefully

2428
01:40:00,238 --> 01:40:05,118
you know hopefully we're

2429
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:06,960
scaring them away from your sweet corn

2430
01:40:05,118 --> 01:40:09,359
fields and that there's something else

2431
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,439
for them to eat somewhere else and they

2432
01:40:09,359 --> 01:40:13,599
just it's too much of a

2433
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:16,079
headache to be in the sweet corn but boy

2434
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:19,360
once they get the taste of that sweet

2435
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:22,158
corn then it's pretty hard to uh to stop

2436
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:24,799
them

2437
01:40:22,158 --> 01:40:27,359
so anybody have experience with finch or

2438
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:29,679
chickadee size birds and blueberries i

2439
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:33,118
would have to say i don't know rebecca's

2440
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:36,079
answer i i would say i had uh

2441
01:40:33,118 --> 01:40:37,439
some uh

2442
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:40,158
uh

2443
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:42,638
goldfinch right i think that's what

2444
01:40:40,158 --> 01:40:44,638
their name is you know the little yellow

2445
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:47,440
ones in the summer that come around eat

2446
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:49,840
the thistles and stuff goldfinches right

2447
01:40:47,439 --> 01:40:52,000
eastern goldfinch i'm the name is

2448
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:54,480
escaping me but they didn't seem to be

2449
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,079
bothered if they were sitting on the

2450
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:58,638
the tassels they didn't seem to be

2451
01:40:56,079 --> 01:41:01,920
bothered by the presence of the lasers

2452
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:04,639
or actually even my presence so

2453
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:06,319
anyway any experience with

2454
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:09,359
other birds

2455
01:41:06,319 --> 01:41:11,840
we haven't really tested it on finches

2456
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:15,198
and chickadees i

2457
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:17,279
have observed that sparrows are not

2458
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:18,799
impressed by lasers

2459
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:20,000
um they will

2460
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,679
ignore them

2461
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,639
um

2462
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:27,118
in general what i've seen in blueberries

2463
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:29,600
again is that the birds that tend to

2464
01:41:27,118 --> 01:41:31,359
feed in very small flocks or

2465
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:34,639
individually

2466
01:41:31,359 --> 01:41:37,198
are a lot less

2467
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:42,000
affected by the lasers

2468
01:41:37,198 --> 01:41:42,000
than the ones that feed in larger flocks

2469
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,880
all right thanks rebecca so i think

2470
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:52,159
looking at the time i need to let my

2471
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:53,199
presenters uh you know off the hook here

2472
01:41:52,158 --> 01:41:55,118
so

2473
01:41:53,198 --> 01:41:58,118
i'm going to go ahead and close the

2474
01:41:55,118 --> 01:41:58,118
meeting

2475
01:42:00,079 --> 01:42:07,639
this has been a production of cornell

2476
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:07,638
university on the web at cornell.edu
