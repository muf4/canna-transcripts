52
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:37,359
and see the sweep of plant

53
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,840
Evolution and look at an amazing plant

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,760
and then hold up a mobile

destinations across

76
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:49,238

designed uh Urban needen plantings right

78
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:56,039
here next to us and Elsewhere on campus

uh soon become a paleobotany fossil

82
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,799
fossil display on in plant science as

83
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:09,878
well as the Cornell plantations and many

84
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,640
other sites so I invite you to explore

85
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:15,319

experiment

100
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:04,120
[Applause]

101
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,279
thank you Alan okay so I just want to

102
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,680
acknowledge a few folks and inevitably

103
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,279
I'll miss a few but I I want to

104
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,000
acknowledge as many as I can who've

105
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,519
really been instrumental uh uh across

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,839
the experiment station with really

107
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,959
making this structure a reality and also

108
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,239
you know preserving the Integrity of

109
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,239
these 500 plus species that we have here

110
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,160
so it's really uh you know it's nice to

111
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
see where we're at now I think those of

112
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,880
you who have been at Cornell a while

113
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,720
you've seen sort of the the process that

114
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,360
it took to get to where we are now and

115
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,759
can probably appreciate it uh better

116
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
than most uh just how many steps are

117
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,000
have to go through uh to get something

118
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,319
like this into place and so uh there's

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
two areas I really want to express

120
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,960
thanks and and and the first is with the

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,800
plant material um so in the interm in

122
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:47,399
the absence of a conservatory while this

123
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,879
was being built and discussions were

124
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,000
being held about the future of the

125
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,079
conservatory all that plant material had

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,160
to be taken care of um and for anybody

127
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,959
who's ever had a house plant and had it

128
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,080
die well times that by 500 or a th000 or

129
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,638
maybe a bit more and that's really the

130
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,879
the the level of complexity that our

131
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,560
Greenhouse Growers and Greenhouse staff

132
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,839
had to do to move the plant material to

133
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,000
care for it to to manage the pests and

134
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:15,038
diseases and really keep it in a fine

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,759
shape so that when its new home was

136
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,719
finally built that everything looked

137
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:21,319
really well and so I really want to

138
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,080
express thanks we first of all to uh our

139
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,000
Tower Road Greenhouse crew and and I

140
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:29,879
know some of those are here today we've

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,240
got Trey and Merritt uh we've got Josh

142
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,639
uh I want to express uh thanks to Paul

143
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,360
Cooper and in particular uh Paul's the

144
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,598
head Greenhouse grower and really you

145
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,520
know throughout this process in in

146
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:42,639
managing this collection and maintaining

147
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:44,359
it in the fine shape that it's in uh you

148
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,918
know his expertise has been truly

149
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,080
invaluable and I also want to express a

150
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,918
sincere thanks to Melissa breckner uh

151
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,159
Melissa is the the supervisor for that

152
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:55,279
range and and manages these folks as a

153
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,759
team uh you know it really takes a team

154
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,318
of folks uh to manage this plan material

155
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,919
uh to keep it uh to keep it going and

156
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,879
evolving U just as we like to see it uh

157
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,038
the other area that's that's really been

158
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,000
uhu important throughout this process

159
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,839
has been in the structure itself and in

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,800
figuring out all the bits and pieces uh

161
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,318
so that they work together appropriately

162
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,680
and so anybody who's ever had a home

163
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,759
repair had a roof replace or re new

164
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,519
siding you know how uh things don't

165
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,080
always go quite the way they're supposed

166
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:27,439
to and they end up costing just a tad

167
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,159
more than maybe they should well this

168
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,680
structure is not exception to that it

169
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,199
really takes someone with a a Keen Eye

170
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,439
and attention to detail and really a

171
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,079
team effort to go through the entire

172
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,038
process of Designing it putting it out

173
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,719
the bid having all of the the

174
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:44,878
contractors and and folks on the job uh

175
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,199
put things in place so that inevitably

176
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,759
it'll be a long-term structure it'll be

177
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,240
successful uh and really functional and

178
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,560
geared to the the plant material and the

179
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,759
teaching purpose that this serves and so

180
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,680
I think you know we've been very

181
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,280
successful in that you know we've very

182
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,038
minor bugs left to work out at this

183
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,478
point Point uh and a few folks to thank

184
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:06,519
uh right here at C's facilities up in

185
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:09,038
Kennedy uh we've got a really good team

186
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,560
of facilities folks uh including Peter

187
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,079
paradise and Bill d uh in our

188
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,720
infrastructure properties and planning

189
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,478
which is sort of our Central facilities

190
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,479
group uh we've had really good project

191
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,439
management throughout the process uh

192
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,000
from Cass hotori and and art fivs and

193
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,279
and these are the guys who are really

194
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,079
are in and out of the project uh

195
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,719
throughout the build phase and really

196
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,000
making sure those bits and pieces come

197
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,560
together and last but certainly not

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,519
least I want to thank Andy lead Andy

199
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,879
lead is our our plant growth facilities

200
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,240
manager Andy's just an incredible

201
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,278
knowledge uh base uh throughout this

202
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,000
process really kind of catching things

203
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:47,759
in design um that would otherwise be a

204
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,519
major issue now and and and really uh

205
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,319
helping to evolve the design so as you

206
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,639
go through the structure you know please

207
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,760
don't just look at the plant material

208
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,360
take a look at the structure there's

209
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,600
some really cool features there

210
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,600
everything from energy saving uh shade

211
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
curtains some some high efficiency see

212
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,240
supplemental lights uh appropriate

213
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,120
Shades and Mist systems a really

214
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,159
sophisticated environmental control

215
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,839
system uh so all these features that

216
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,078
have to work together uh so that the

217
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,440
plan material is happy and so that

218
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:17,639
inevitably uh we're happy as well um so

219
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,680
that I'd like turn it over but I want to

220
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,879
say again thanks to all those folks

221
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,319
wouldn't mind give them a round of

222
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,320
applause they welld

223
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,839
deserved next uh thank youbody next have

224
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,838
next

225
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:39,360
one hi uh my involvement in this is

226
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,959
basically as manager and sort of curator

227
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,039
of the plant collection um of course I

228
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:46,759
need to thank a whole bunch of people

229
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,480
first most importantly would be Paul

230
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,439
Paul Cooper I couldn't have done

231
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,959
anything in here without Paul and um he

232
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,800
acts not only as a horticulturalist but

233
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,639
also just to bounce ideas off of in

234
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:04,479
terms of how to the plants do all that

235
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:07,159
kind of stuff um also Devon and Trey who

236
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,278
helped to plant this little Forest we

237
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:13,480
have in here and daily will take care of

238
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:16,039
everything Melissa Andy uh very

239
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,800
important in this whole process and I

240
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:20,838
know I forgot oh Craig Craig hasn't been

241
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,958
mentioned yet Craig has been deeply

242
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,959
involved in this the whole time of

243
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,119
course Ed uh Ed I don't think this would

244
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:30,958
be standing here right now if it wasn't

245
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,959
for Ed car and the students who really

246
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,078
put up a fight to get the conservatory

247
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,759
here so I I think it's a really a big

248
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:43,078
Community effort and um my involvement

249
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:46,200
goes way back with the old Conservatory

250
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:48,559
but this is we're kind of taking a new

251
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,200
uh approach here so what we're going to

252
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,479
do is have a very carefully managed

253
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,560
collection the old Conservatory there

254
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,159
were probably six or eight different

255
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:00,159
faculty members who had some kind of

256
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,838
involvement so just kind of was an

257
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,199
amorphous thing that went in various

258
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,279
directions so I am going to be the

259
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
curator and I'm I want to take any kind

260
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,600
of recommendations and advice from

261
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,800
anybody who would like to see things go

262
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,519
into the conservatory in other words I'm

263
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,838
not going to try to restrict what's in

264
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:22,240
there but I am going to try to augment

265
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:26,360
and develop a collection that has a very

266
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:30,919
wide uh uh birth if you will of

267
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,879
diversity right now we have 44 families

268
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:37,958
in the conservatory we have

269
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:40,200
347 Genera of plants and guess what I

270
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:44,399
forgot to count the number of species

271
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,680
but it's somewhere around 600 or more

272
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,278
the thing is we're numbering in the 800s

273
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:52,399
right now in terms of the accessions um

274
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:55,399
so one thing I'm going to be doing is

275
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,600
developing connections with other

276
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,799
conservatories particularly the New York

277
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,360
Botanical Garden there already

278
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:03,359
propagating new stuff for us to bring in

279
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,360
so I think we're going to have an

280
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,440
exciting time here of adding things my

281
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,560
intent is to add stuff that's

282
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,959
educational that fills uh uh you know

283
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:16,599
that it's a interest to a variety of

284
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:18,799
people from people who are interested in

285
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,800
evolution systematics

286
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,799
Horticulture house plants visitors can

287
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:26,039
see things here that they won't see

288
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:28,159
elsewhere and in that sense you will

289
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,360
start to see some things

290
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:33,360
disappear from the conservatory because

291
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,199
there's no point in us you know

292
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:40,320
cultivating a Bonia that you can see

293
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:42,479
every time you go to Lowe's so um with

294
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,839
that said the important thing about the

295
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,680
conservatory from my standpoint is that

296
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,519
it it is a biological collection and

297
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,399
since I'm curator of the herbarium we

298
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,440
already have a lot of experience in

299
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,639
terms of curating Collections and we

300
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,480
have a big database structure in the

301
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:04,159
herbarium and so I kind of taken that

302
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,879
idea and we've developed databases and

303
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,799
uh interfaces that will allow you to

304
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:12,600
actually interface information about

305
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:14,479
this collection on your cell phones or

306
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,079
tablets or you can do it from your

307
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,519
computer in your office as well uh some

308
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:24,319
of you are probably familiar with QR

309
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,360
codes so you in order to use a QR code

310
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,560
you need to go either to the Apple store

311
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,959
or the Android store or the windows do

312
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:35,039
anybody have a Windows phone

313
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:37,319
no I'm sure there's one for Windows and

314
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,679
then maybe even black I don't know if

315
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,440
the Blackberry has one okay but at any

316
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:45,078
rate it's you can get a free app whereby

317
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,279
you just take a picture basically

318
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:50,958
through the app of this QR code which

319
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:53,159
there's one on your pamphlet there and

320
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:56,039
then it will bring up the web page that

321
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:59,719
we' set up that accesses the database

322
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:01,559
about that plan that particular plan

323
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,759
um we're just developing this some of

324
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,239
these aren't going to have a lot of

325
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,079
information yet they're going to be

326
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,919
expanded but for instance if you if you

327
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,198
do the QR code for the carnivorous

328
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:14,198
plants you it actually links you to a

329
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,919
video showing a carnivorous plant eating

330
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:18,479
a little uh

331
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,078
arthropod so um there are various things

332
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,800
like that we're trying to add lots of

333
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,958
links in the the the information is thin

334
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:28,679
on some of these things but it will be

335
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:31,039
increasing as you go into the from the

336
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,559
other end and come up the center aisle

337
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,639
there on your right we're just starting

338
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:37,838
to put in an evolutionary sequence for

339
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,360
land plants that goes from liver warts

340
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,759
to angop sperms along that side but we

341
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,959
still are missing some things we need

342
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,879
some different Lop POS and things like

343
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:50,319
that so we're working on that um so I

344
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:51,799
don't know that there's much else I'd

345
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,160
like to say again I'd like to thank

346
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:56,240
everybody who's involved and who has

347
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,319
been involved and who will be involved

348
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,519
and any students who want to get

349
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,680
involved we're always looking for people

350
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:06,839
who want to work in the conservatory oh

351
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,198
which means I forgot to thank Nick and

352
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,600
Patty who are the ones that you'll see

353
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,159
in

354
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,360
there I'm glad I

355
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:18,759
didn't you'll see them we have it set up

356
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,839
now so they can actually enter data

357
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:22,759
through their cell phones and so it's a

358
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,360
good reason they just hang out now down

359
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,600
here entering data and so for instance

360
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,519
there's a little app they can enter data

361
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,319
so every time they go through

362
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,078
they check not every time but often

363
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:34,159
they'll check to see what's in flour and

364
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:36,078
they can just hit a little button it

365
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,719
says that's in flour so how many things

366
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:42,120
do you think are in flour right

367
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:46,800
now daddy knows

368
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:50,159
134 134 is that what it is I thought it

369
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,758
so there are 134 plants in here well a

370
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,639
few were in the purple house but most of

371
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,519
them were in here that have flowers on

372
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,120
them right now you might look sometimes

373
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,399
they're hard to see some plants don't

374
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,639
have very attractive flowers so at any

375
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,879
rate I'm very happy to be here and I'm

376
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,799
hoping that we'll be able to really

377
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,330
develop this into something great thank

378
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,939
you very

379
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,940
[Applause]

380
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,039
much so our next and final speaker is Ed

381
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,480
C so I've been to National meetings and

382
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,040
I always wonder why the historians pull

383
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,240
out a piece of paper and actually read

384
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,240
their

385
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,919
statements I don't

386
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:41,599

sir so um there have been four

393
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,719
Conservatory green houses built on the

394
00:16:54,679 --> 00:17:00,758
Corno campus the first Conservatory was

395
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:04,640
built in 188 2 and was attached to the

396
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:07,599
botney wing of sage College a smaller

397
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,559
Conservatory was built near this site

398
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:13,359
just this way um in

399
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,038
1909 it was designed to house tropical

400
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,879
plants for the new College of

401
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:20,759
agriculture in

402
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,439
1931 another Conservatory was built on

403
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:24,519
this exact

404
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,798
site when plant science the plant

405
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:28,960
science building was constructed

406
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,119
construction on the conservatory before

407
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,279
today was completed in late

408
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:36,038
2015 during Cornell's sus Centennial

409
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,720
Year yes

410
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:42,640
got only of the two buildings that can

411
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,558
be logged in for 2015 us and claran Hall

412
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,720
so uh Liberty High Bailey the first dean

413
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:49,960
of the still very active College of

414
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,000
Agriculture was involved in selecting

415
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,880
the curved glass design of the previous

416
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,440
Conservatory constructed by Lorden

417
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:02,080
Burnham starting in the 1920s

418
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,519
Dailey traveled extensively collecting

419
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,279
and studying Palms some of the very

420
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:10,158
first plants that were moved into the

421
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:12,519
new Conservatory in 1931 were palms and

422
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,960
we even have a glass slide that proves

423
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:16,319
it yeah shows the plant of in this

424
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,840
actual the previous

425
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:22,918
greenhous um so the plants were moved in

426
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,959
at the new conservator 1931 which Palms

427
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,679
as we know require special conditions

428
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,840
especially for survival in itha hosel

429
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,000
Winters

430
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,798
research on Palm anatomy and palm

431
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,119
taxonomy continued in the structure for

432
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:40,158
over 75 years with plants being

433
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,158
maintained in this

434
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,960
Conservatory so today this is a grand

435
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,600
day for Cornell and the plant Sciences

436
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,360
we have many people to thank for the

437
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:53,079
state of art state of art

438
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:55,038
structure after over 75 years of

439
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:57,960
continuous

440
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:00,038
use plans were drawn up for renovation

441
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,440
or rebuilding of the previous Liberty H

442
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:04,679
Valley

443
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,400
Conservatory however in the fall of 2010

444
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,440
it was announced that it was to be torn

445
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,440
down and not replaced particularly on

446
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,080
this

447
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,519
site uh this resulted in a Grassroots

448
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:19,720
movement within the Cornell Community to

449
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:23,440
save the conservatory in this location

450
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:26,798
for easy access by students and the

451
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,360
community Heather Holi president of hes

452

454
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,519
rebuilt in this

455
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,279
location within less than a week over

458
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:51,000

461
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,000
