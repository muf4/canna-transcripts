1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,599
some moves around the field it can

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,000
impact

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:10,879
neighbor it was very effective on

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,359
killing weed seeds and quite a few

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,719
Growers would use it before they plant

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:20,800
strawberries because it would kill the

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:23,399
we pathogens but we don't really have

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,400
that option

9
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:29,118
anymore a lot of girls are interested in

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,800
black plastic as a way of managing weeds

11
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:34,079
as well and strawberries in this case

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,160
and black plastic Works fairly well in

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,759
annual systems where you plant your

14
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,839
strawberries in the

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,799
fall after the long day lengths induce

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,520
Runing so you plant them in the fall

17
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,878
they don't Runner anymore they just go

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,320
through the fall and get exposed to

19
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,280
short days and cool temperatures and

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,558
induce flowers the following spring

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,039
those uh flowers open and and they set

22
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,399
fruit and fruits harvested early in the

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,000
spring and then the plants are ripped

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,280
out and it's cycle starts all over again

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
this is the annual system that you would

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,439
see in California and Florida and some

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,478
Growers are trying this black plastic

28
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,839
system up north here in New York too the

29
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,239
challenges with that are that in the

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,400
fall when you plant your strawberries

31
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,078
oftentimes we don't have a very long

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,799
period of cool warm temperatures in the

33
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:24,359
fall for those plants to get established

34
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,720
and initiate flower buds so they often

35
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,438
don't do so well the following spring

36
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,280
even though it's a pretty good way of

37
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,679
managing the weeds the black plastic

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,399
also has a big environmental impact too

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,000
and you don't really have a good way of

40
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,280
getting rid of the plastic once it's in

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,799
the ground and then the second year when

42
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,519
the strawberries do try to produce

43
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,439
Runners there's no place for those

44
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,438
Runners to root because the Plastics in

45
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,959
the way you have to either cut them off

46
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,879
or rip up the plastic that's a problem

47
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:54,158
as well and I did some calculations

48
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,839
earlier and strawberry Growers use

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,719
enough plastic each year to circle the

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,960
Earth 13 times that's a lot of plastic

51
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,919
that strawberry Growers use using so I'm

52
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,879
not a real big proponent of black

53
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,879
plastic on strawberries

54
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,479
that most of the growers in the

55
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,000
Northeast use a matted row and here they

56
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,840
plant their strawberries in the

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,519
springtime about 18 inches apart down a

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,719
row the rows are about four feet apart

59
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:26,280
they plant into a ESS site that's

60
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:28,519
prepared it's a real nice seed bed but

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,039
if you look at this field you can see

62
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,439
there's a lot of opportunity there are a

63
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:35,318
lot of initials for weeds to

64
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:37,919
grow there's not a lot of shading the

65
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:40,639
plants are small and lots of open ground

66
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,559
for weeds to grow typically what happens

67
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,479
is grow U Growers walk along and they

68
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,519
clip off those first flowers to promote

69
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:51,399
Runing so the idea is the runners then

70
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,480
will grow down the row and root and form

71
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,599
a nice mat hence the word matted row but

72
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,679
as you can see through all these

73
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,598
pictures there's bare ground throughout

74
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,799
much of that first year you know Growers

75
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:06,798
irrigate those plants as a runner to

76
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:10,959
establish but often times with all that

77
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,959
be ground you get a lot of

78
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,680
weeds be a real mess and indeed

79
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,360
strawberry Growers struggle uh endlessly

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,480
with weeds particularly under the Mad

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,920
Rose system so a lot of people think

82
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:26,318
well you know I can't have any weeds I

83
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,359
have to spend a lot of time out there

84
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,919
making sure there are absolutely no

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,920
weeds in my strawberries and that could

86
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,039
be a strategy to take although that's

87
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,479
very labor intensive but we wanted to

88
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,878
ask a few questions like how much we

89
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,560
growth is acceptable I mean can you

90
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:43,039
tolerate some weed growth if so how long

91
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,280
can you have weeds in your field before

92
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,359
you have to get them

93
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,400
out we a dead weed uh there are times

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,959
when weed growth can be tolerated and

95
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,519
there are times when it can't be

96
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,400
tolerated they're just too competitive

97
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,879
with strawberry plants so we thought

98
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,239
before we really start tackling this

99
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:59,399
whole problem of managing weed we ought

100
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,599
to be able to answer some of these

101
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,158
questions

102
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:06,158
questions we did an an experiment and

103
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:09,039
this experiment was take a planting of

104
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,719
strawberries newly planted field and let

105
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,719
the weeds grow for certain periods of

106
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:17,079
time and at certain times during that

107
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:20,519
first year so in this experiment we had

108
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:24,319
weeds growing for just the month of

109
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,918
June July August September or no weeds

110
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,159
at all throughout the entire year or we

111
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,198
had two week periods June and July July

112
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,160
and August August September three Monon

113
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,840
periods and for the entire season and

114
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,360
then we followed the yield of these

115
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,359
strawberry plants for the next couple of

116
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,360
years here's our plots you can see some

117
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,720
plots have weeds some don't depending on

118
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,520
the month of the

119
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,520
year and here's our graph of some of our

120
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,758
results over here on the left you can

121
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:58,319
see the X's indicate when weeds are

122
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,400
present this column here is Runners it

123
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,399
indicates how many Runners were

124
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,959
formed after those weed treatments are

125
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:09,319
present and then the yield the following

126
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:11,000
year and what you can see in this first

127
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:13,079
line is when you have weeds throughout

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,120
the whole first year you have very few

129
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,000
Runners and very low yield you back off

130
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,519
in the

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,839
weeds your yield goes up a little bit

132
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,478
back off a little bit more your yield

133
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:24,599
goes up a little bit if you only have

134
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,519
weeds during the month of June your

135
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,840
yields are higher and of course that

136
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:29,198
sort of makes intuitive sense but the

137
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,279
thing that's really interesting I think

138
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,840
is if you look at weeds in June or July

139
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,799
or August September and look at the

140
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:40,439
runners and look at the yield you can

141
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,478
see that early season weeds have a much

142
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:47,199
larger impact on yield and Runners

143
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:51,159
negative impact than do late season

144
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,759
weeds fact weeds in September there's

145
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,759
some small impact on Runner maybe not

146
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,879
much of an impact at all on yield so

147
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,919
weeds in the early part of the season

148
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,360
are much more detrimental than weeds at

149
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:05,719
the end of the season and we can look at

150
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,720
June and July weeds a two-month period

151
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,479
and look at our yield of a thousand

152
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,800
grams per plot and look at weeds during

153
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,519
a two-month period at the end of the

154
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,079
season down here and our yield is two

155
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,399
and a half times as much even though the

156
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,719
time of weed pressure was exactly the

157
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,918
same we can do the same thing with three

158
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,120
months of weed pressure early weeds low

159
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,198
yield three months of weeds at the end

160
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,478
of the later in the season the yields

161
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,120
are much higher so pretty clear to us

162
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,598
that those early season weeds in a

163
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,519
strawberry field are the most critical

164
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:38,360
and the ones we have to deal with the

165
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,879
most that's bottom line

166
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,000
here so we also know that we don't have

167
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:45,879
a lot of herbicides that work very well

168
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,519
on strawberries so the question is can

169
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,639
we use something else besides herbicides

170
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,639
like cultivation to remove weeds early

171
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,560
in the season when they're most

172
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,439
problematic we looked at a bunch of

173
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,519
different cultivation tools to see what

174
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,879
impact that would have on the

175
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,719
strawberries and on the weeds in the

176
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,120
planting

177
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,840
year this is a traditional instrument

178
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,720
that's used to manage we is a rototiller

179
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,918
or a multiv Vader it goes through and

180
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,080
cultivates the weing know I'm sure

181
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:18,359
you've all seen this the disadvantage of

182
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,198
a multiv Vader is it's very hard on soil

183
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,319
structure because when those times come

184
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:26,160
down into the soil it compacts the soil

185
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,120
two or three inches down on the ground

186
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,400
then it also on the upstroke it brings

187
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,079
up new weed seeds so even though you

188
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,439
work the weeds in you're also bringing

189
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,878
new weed seeds up because you're working

190
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,639
a soil down you know three or four

191
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,759
inches and it's hard in the structure

192
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,918
there's some other tools out there that

193
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:47,080
some of the vegetable Growers use that

194
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,719
don't cultivate down so deeply and get

195
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,719
weeds out right between the row one's a

196
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,879
finger weeder you can see it here

197
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,240
working on

198
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,319
some along and pulls the weeds out right

199
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,038
around the

200
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,960
plants there are also these Flex Harrows

201
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,240
and they can be driven right over top of

202
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:10,519
the plants and these timeses vibrate and

203
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,478
they shake out the small weeds as you

204
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:13,799
drive quickly over the field so the

205
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,719
strawberry plants can be right in the

206
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,319
ground you can drive right over here

207
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,520
those things wiggle back and forth and

208
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,680
vibrate strawberry plants stay intact

209
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,719
but any small weeds get vibrate out of

210
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,918
the ground you can set those to

211
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,240
different tensions and so forth take out

212
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,240
weeds of different sizes

213
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:38,799
this is our Reggie weer it goes in the

214
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,719
back of a tractor you sit in the back of

215
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:45,759
it and it has two

216
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,120
rotating discs down here with tines on

217
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:51,240
them that spin the weeds out and the

218
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,639
operator moves arms in and out to go

219
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,200
around the

220
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:57,439
plant and see here these spin like this

221
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,000
as you go around the plant so you can

222
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,480
get close to the plant far away from the

223
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,399
plant close and it only cultivates down

224
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,680
about an inch or so so the nice thing

225
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,480
about this instrument is it does not

226
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,039
compact the soil deeply it doesn't bring

227
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,120
up new weed seeds it just spins the

228
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,120
weeds out from around the

229
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,440
plant instrument is a brush ho it's like

230
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:20,639
a giant street sweeper it has a couple

231
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,600
of gaps in it that straddle the

232
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,120
strawberry plants and you can in your

233
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,720
case it's cabbage but you straddle the

234
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,039
rows and it just sweeps the weeds right

235
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,399
out of the ground it also creates a lot

236
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,799
of dust the dust settles back down on

237
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,679
the ground but that dust acts as a mulch

238
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,559
and covers up weed seeds so even though

239
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:41,159
it only cultivates really between the

240
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,759
rows it also suppresses weeds between

241
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,240
the plants as

242
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,240
well these are used a lot on vegetables

243
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,600
we wanted to see how they would work on

244
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:55,919
strawberry so this is a PL of strawberry

245
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,600
where we used a brush ho to sweep on

246
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,319
either side of the strawberry plants

247
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,720
with no cultivation or anything in

248
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,399
between the rows and it does a pretty

249
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,720
good

250
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,078
job this is Devol which is a standard

251
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,800
herbicide that would be used after

252
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:10,519
strawberry plant and you can see there's

253
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,159
you know weeds coming up there because

254
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,360
Devol is a pre-emergent herbicide it

255
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,439
doesn't get all the weeds but it gets

256
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,639
many of them but not all of them so

257
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,320
compared to the previous picture where

258
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,240
you use a cultivation tool the herbicide

259
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,959
you doesn't work quite as

260
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,278
well here's a flex T Harrow that was the

261
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,239
one that drags over top of the plants it

262
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:32,278
vibrates it doesn't pull the plants out

263
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,720
of the ground but it shakes the weeds

264
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,838
loose and it looks pretty good early in

265
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,200
the

266
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,480
season but later in the season we get a

267
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,320
lot of weed seed germination with this

268
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,800
Flex T Harrow because it doesn't bury

269
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,120
the weed seeds it just sort of stirs

270
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,838
them up a little bit even though it

271
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,078
takes the weeds

272
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,560
out when you stop using it then you get

273
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:56,599
a big flush of weeds and with

274
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:59,638
strawberries when they start to Runner

275
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,079
you can't use the flex Ty harl after

276
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,360
that because it'll tear the runners out

277
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,879
of the ground so you have to stop and

278
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,600
you get this big flush of weed so by the

279
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:09,559
end of the season our Flex time harop

280
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,560
plots are fairly

281
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,040
weedy again this is a brush hoe after

282
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:19,439
we've gone through early in the

283
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:21,120
season no herbicides just a brush ho and

284
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,760
this is a brush ho later in the season

285
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,240
so unlike the flex H Harrow which gave

286
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:31,039
us a big flush of weeds same plot same

287
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,720
year the brush ho kept the weeds of

288
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:37,078
bay so these cultivation tools these

289
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:40,278
Flex T Harrow seems to work pretty well

290
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:43,439
here's the flex T Harrow had lots of

291
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:46,439
weeds in the row and between the

292
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,440
row

293
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,959
see Rush ho had very few weeds in the

294
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:56,319
row and between the

295
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:59,000
row that seems like a pretty promising

296
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,839
implement the herbicide gave us quite a

297
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,240
few

298
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,560
weeds so we weren't quite as excited

299
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,560
about

300
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,759
that and if you look at yields it's

301
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,160
interesting where we use the multiv

302
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,600
Vader which is the standard Implement

303
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,519
our yields were you know kind of on the

304
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,120
low side the flex H Harrow where we kept

305
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,000
the weeds out early but we had a stop

306
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,480
later on actually the yields are pretty

307
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,399
good even though they were pretty weedy

308
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,039
at the end of the year again I think

309
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,320
that ties in with what we talked about

310
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,039
earlier that early season weeds if you

311
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,399
get those out of there uh that's a you

312
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,838
do a pretty good job

313
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,120
of G having your plants healthy going

314
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,680
into the year and the yields are pretty

315
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,600
high weeds later on don't matter so much

316
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,278
these plots had weeds later on but you

317
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,360
can see it didn't matter so much brush

318
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:50,799
ho yes Marvin can can I interrupt with

319
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,720
one question Jeff Miller is wondering if

320
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:56,799
there's any research on flamers um like

321
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,360
pros and cons and I'm sorry I just saw

322
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,359
that and I I thought I should yeah so

323
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,399
people have played around with flamers

324
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,720
but the thing you don't want to do with

325
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,399
a flamer is obviously burn the leaves of

326
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,720
the strawberry plant so you have to

327
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,278
focus that between the rows of

328
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,560
strawberries and indeed it it works as

329
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,958
long as you have annual plants or I'm

330
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,239
sorry annual weeds but if you have

331
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,599
prenal weeds it doesn't do a very good

332
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,839
job against them because they come

333
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,120
right right back and I really don't know

334
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:30,760
of anyone who is using flamers on

335
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,639
strawberry in the planting year some

336
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:36,078
people have experimented with the flamer

337
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,198
in the fruiting year like after harvest

338
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:41,239
to renovate and clean things up but they

339
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,000
seem to have damaged the plants and they

340
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,079
haven't gotten particularly good results

341
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,958
from using the flamers so I I just

342
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:48,958
haven't seen it

343
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,440
used so the brush ho and the finger weer

344
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,480
were more expensive to use because

345
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,040
there's a pretty expensive piece of

346
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,839
equipment application they're much more

347
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,879
effective at controlling weeds and over

348
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,199
the long run the brush ho is probably

349
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,480
cheaper certainly cheaper to use labor

350
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:15,240
wise than our standard practices because

351
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,199
it requires fewer passes fewer hand

352
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,959
weeding no Urban side and if I had a lot

353
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:23,479
of money and I was a strawberry grower I

354
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,278
think a combination of a brush ho and a

355
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,000
Reggie weeder would just be the trick a

356
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:31,278
brush ho to sweep the weeds up between

357
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,519
the rows and the Reggie weeder to go

358
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:37,198
along the plants down the row and I do

359
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:40,159
have a Reggie weeder home I haven't uh

360
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,838
gotten a brush ho but uh these in

361
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,480
implements are quite good because they

362
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,320
do control weeds early in the season and

363
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,560
they cultivate very shallowly and the

364
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,480
plants really respond to that and seem

365
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,479
to uh grow

366
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,600
well shift slots just a little bit to

367
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,519
blueberries although and you took this

368
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,800
poll but managing weeds in blueberries

369
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,759
is is quite a bit easier than it is in

370
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:10,719
strawberries the reason for that is

371
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,480
because we can plant perennial rye or

372
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,240
some type sort of a grass between the

373
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,440
rows of

374
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,278
blueberries our blueberries and then

375
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:23,560
mulch underneath those plants and we can

376
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:26,679
confine any herbicides to the plants to

377
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:27,958
that row that mulch row and we don't

378
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:30,239
really need a lot because the mulch

379
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,958
suppresses a lot the annual weeds and

380
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,120
then we can just mow the weeds off

381
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,239
between a row and so that works pretty

382
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,159
well most blueberry Growers they keep on

383
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,240
top of the weeds don't really have too

384
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,919
many troubles if things get out of hand

385
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,519
they get some vines in there and some

386
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,318
trees you

387
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,078
know but with blueberries you also have

388
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:51,318
the option with some of those Woody

389
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:54,239
perennials of going in in early November

390
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:55,599
with some Roundup and spot spraying it

391
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,919
doesn't seem to hurt the blueberries too

392
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,959
much as long as you're careful you can

393
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:04,879
in a pry weeds so blueberries is not too

394
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:07,399
difficult so the question is can we take

395
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,879
that concept and what works well for

396
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,039
blueberries and sort of apply that to a

397
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,559
crop like strawberry in other words can

398
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:16,278
we think about not doing so much

399
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,559
cultivation where we do bring up weed

400
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:21,078
seeds and think of it more of a system

401
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:24,758
where we plant an undisturbed soil like

402
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:26,799
we do here for blueberries and use a alt

403
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,759
again another Blueberry Field here with

404
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,399
you know fairly clean grass roads mulch

405
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,000
minerals take this concept to

406
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,679
strawberries and see if something might

407
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,078
work for them as well so what we did

408
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:42,838
here we took various cover crops and we

409
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,838
planted those cover crops in the fall we

410
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:48,199
let them go through the winter and then

411
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:50,759
the following spring we killed the cover

412
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:52,758
crops and we did that from different

413
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,919
ways uh some of them we had to use

414
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,159
Roundup to kill the cover crop others we

415
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:00,639
could just mow them and they would

416
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:02,799
die and other we sprayed paraquat on

417
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,759
them because they were annual and once

418
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,438
you kill them they wouldn't come back so

419
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:11,798
we had these essentially these dead

420
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:15,279
cover crops in the spring and then we

421
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:15,279
cultivated narrow

422
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,798
strips on these cover

423
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,798
crops and then we

424
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:29,919
planted narrow strips and we didn't

425
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:31,440
disturb the area in between the rows

426
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,440
up weed seeds and we wanted to suppress

427
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,840
weed seed

428
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:38,080
germination other thing we did here

429
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:39,720
between Rose is we also came in with uh

430
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,279
some malt between the rows and we

431
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,120
planted the strawberries at a fairly

432
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:46,359
close density because given the fact

433
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:47,879
that there's undisturbed soil around

434
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:51,038
here the runners would have a hard time

435
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,080
rooting so instead of asking the plant

436
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,240
to make a lot of Runners we just planted

437
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:57,558
the plants closer together figuring it's

438
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,480
cheaper to buy a few more plants than it

439
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:02,200
is to spend a lot of money weeding so he

440
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,400
wanted to see how that would work and

441
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,798
I'm not going to show you data but I'm

442
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,679
going to show you pictures and here are

443
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:11,038
some strawberry plants planted through a

444
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,400
rye cover crop that was

445
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,440
killed the strawberries were planted

446
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,480
fairly close spacing in a narrow strip

447
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,320
and then we came in with a little bit of

448
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,759
straw mulch and put over top of that

449
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,918
killed Rye so there was Rye plus there

450
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,440
was a little bit of R straw added to

451
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,240
give a little bit more

452
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,759
biomass this is in a really weedy

453
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,599
Fil A lot of nutsedge and those of you

454
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:37,599
who familiar with nut sge know that it's

455
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:39,119
just a terrible weed it's it's very uh

456
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,918
aggressive and it pushes up through

457
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,639
plastic and everything but if you see

458
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,200
where the arrows are here these

459
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,038
plots had no

460
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,679
herbicide and all they had was killed

461
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,119
dry with straw mulch over top of it and

462
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,519
the plants were a relatively high

463
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,119
density and they did extremely well at

464
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:59,639
least in keep terms of keeping the weeds

465
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,759
down

466
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,919
so this system here I think has some

467
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,599
promise especially on lighter soils

468
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,159
where you can get in and get those

469
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,158
strawberries into the ground at a higher

470
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,360
density so how I get in

471
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:27,000
there so okay okay so I wanted to show

472
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:29,240
you this is a a a row a conventional

473
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,919
planning that we use herbicides and

474
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,279
everything like that on and this is with

475
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,600
the mulches and the weeds are pretty

476
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:41,960
good in both cases so these uh

477
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:43,839
highdensity plannings with a sod mulch

478
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,279
work I think pretty well or at least

479
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,678
equivalent to what the standard way of

480
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,678
growing

481
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,319
strawberries now we can apply that same

482
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:57,000
principle

483
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:59,439
to raspberries we have some good data to

484
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,839
show that raspberries really really uh

485
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,080
thrive in their strong mulch in the

486
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,199
planting year not in subsequent years

487
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,519
but in the planting year raspberries

488
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,360
like to be surrounded by malt just like

489
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:12,759
I showed you for those strawberries so

490
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:15,879
this would be a typical way we might

491
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:18,038
recommend Growers plant raspberries you

492
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,360
know two or three feet apart down the

493
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:21,960
road with trickle irrigation and straw

494
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:23,119
mulch around the plants because I love

495
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,640
that straw

496
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:28,479
molds Marvin could I interrupt to um

497
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,720
just quickly we have another question

498
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,200
about using oats as a cover crop and

499
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,720
whether or not you could also use a

500
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,159
roller crimper on the Rye and maybe you

501
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,880
will be talking about that yeah I'll try

502
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,000
to get to both of those questions in the

503
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,000
next couple

504
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,038
minutes so we

505
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,919
haven't tried crimping the Rye uh but we

506
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:53,679
have treated it with paraquat or Roundup

507
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,320
because that way we pick up a few extra

508
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,679
weeds along the way but I think you

509
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,359
probably could crimp the Ry as long as

510
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,640
you're doing at the right stage where it

511
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,000
kills it what we did in this experiment

512
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,038
was we wanted to see if we could grow

513
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,919
the mulch in place when we planted the

514
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:11,720
raspberries so that we wouldn't have to

515
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,640
bring the straw in so here's a plot you

516
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,000
can see some of these plots here where

517
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,000
we had you know be

518
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:24,278
ground be ground and we had Rye then we

519
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,798
planted the

520
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:29,759
raspberries down the rows here to see

521
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,158
how they would do

522
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,839
here are the little raspberry plants

523
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:35,240
growing between that killed rye and then

524
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,678
we follow them for a couple of years and

525
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,240
it's interesting this photo here was

526
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,919
taken two years after the Rye was

527
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,798
planted and you can here are the control

528
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,960
plots where we had that bearr and here

529
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,200
are the plots where we had the Ry and

530
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,759
even though everything was treated

531
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,319
exactly the same in those two plots you

532
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:57,640
can see big differences between where we

533
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:00,558
had the Ry here and where we didn't have

534
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,600
the r here it's really remarkable so

535
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:03,960
that planting through that rye residue

536
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:06,359
had a really big impact on the

537
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,319
raspberries no difference in yield but

538
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:11,719
the weed pressure was certainly greater

539
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,839
where we did not use the R so that was I

540
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,798
thought pretty

541
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:18,000
dramatic now back to Jeff's question

542
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:20,879
about the could you also use some sort

543
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,440
of a oat cover crop wall now oats die in

544
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,039
the winter time so if you plant Rye if

545
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,080
you plant oats in the Winter or I'm

546
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:27,240
sorry in the fall and let them go

547
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,720
through the winter by the time spring

548
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,000
comes around there's not a lot of

549
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,400
residue there you could plant through it

550
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,679
but it's not a lot of residue I'm not

551
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,240
sure if it would be enough to really

552
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,278
suppress weeds whereas Rye gives you

553
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,200
more residue and is a little pathic and

554
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:43,200
suppresses weeds what we have done with

555
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,558
oats what we have done with Sudan grass

556
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,319
is after renovating strawberries we've

557
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:49,720
gone in and just

558
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:52,000
broadcast the seed over top of the

559
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,278
strawberry field so instead of going

560
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,480
through and having bare soil from say

561
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:58,919
August through October again more

562
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,599
opportunities for weeds to germinate

563
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:04,159
the idea was why not sew a seed in there

564
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:05,599
at least a plant that we know is going

565
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,600
to die in the winter time and not going

566
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:11,199
to go to seed so we over broadcast the

567
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:14,599
oats we broadcast the sedan grass they

568
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,000
grow they displace the weeds that

569
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:19,918
normally would grow and then they die in

570
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,720
the winter and leave us with a residue

571
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:26,960
between the strawberry plants

572
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,600
but no weeds and it looks pretty trashy

573
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,400
in the fall when you do that after the

574
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,759
frost comes but it does a pretty good

575
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,200
job of keeping the weeds out as

576
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,919
well so those are some of the approaches

577
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,880
we've used to trying to manage weeds and

578
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:43,360
strawberries again this is the

579
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,320
strawberry field in the spring after we

580
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,798
grew the Sudan grass between the Rosa

581
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:50,319
strawberries and it looks pretty clean

582
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,839
so here are some sort of new ways we're

583
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,558
thinking about managing weeds without

584
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,558
relying on herbicides all the time using

585
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:59,000
cover crops to reduce weed pressure

586
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,200
before planting focus our attention

587
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,759
early in the season if you have limited

588
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,319
time focus at early rather than late

589
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:09,519
some options are planning through killed

590
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:12,359
sods using shallow cultivation tools and

591
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,079
interplanting cover crops and that may

592
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:15,639
hold some promises opposed to going in

593
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,879
there with sinbar or something like that

594
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,880
after

595
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,200
renovation so with that Laura I think

596
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:27,158
we're done with the formal presentation

597
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,080
and U maybe we can go and look at some

598
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:33,000
of the responses to the poll or

599
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:35,199
answerers some questions and Jeff asks

600
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,960
What's the timing of sewing the O of

601
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,919
Sudan grass we uh plant or see that

602
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,240
right at renovation so that would be

603
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,960
probably early August after the you go

604
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,599
through with the Rota tiller and narrow

605
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,480
up the rows the Leer mode off you narrow

606
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:52,199
up the rose then you can seed your oats

607
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,720
and Sudan grass then if it's a really

608
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,840
hot

609
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,759
warm summer late at the end of the

610
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,158
season the Sudan grass can grow pretty

611
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,798
pretty tall so when we've done that

612
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,399
we've had pretty good results just to go

613
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:06,798
in with like a sickle bar or something

614
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:09,079
and mow that Sudan grass back down to

615
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,119
say a foot high if it exceeds the

616
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:13,119
strawberry plants by too much in other

617
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,519
words it'll shade the strawberry plants

618
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,839
out if it gets too tall so we don't let

619
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,639
it get too tall but if we just go in and

620
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:21,519
mow it that's a good way of setting it

621
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,399
back again and uh having it sort of

622
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,679
start over again and still provide that

623
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:28,959
biomass that we want later in this

624
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,880
season

625
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,880
all right does anybody else have any

626
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:41,079
questions now's your

627
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,000
chance okay maybe we can look at the

628
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:45,000
results of the poll

629
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:53,398
um try to find the one that uh but we'll

630
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,798
just start with this one and this is

631
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:58,439
uh just see gu the results there

632
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,679
hopefully you're seeing the

633
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,919
results and

634
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:05,640
uh that was the one chose oh yeah this

635
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,679
was the one that we couldn't yeah this

636
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,480
isn't very appropriate so let's get

637
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,480
let's get rid of this one let's look at

638
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,520
um what type of let me just broadcast

639
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:19,158
the results and what type of new

640
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,879
herbicide would be most useful to

641
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:26,440
Strawberry Growers and I don't know if

642
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:29,600
you want to comment at all on that

643
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,679
Marvin yeah would say that I would agree

644
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,759
that post emergent Broad Leaf is

645
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,038
probably most valuable it's not too

646
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:40,398
difficult to kill grass in strawberries

647
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:42,200
because grass is a monocot and it's a

648
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,798
grass and you can find selective

649
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,360
herbicides against grasses that leave

650
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:47,798
the strawberries alone but where you

651
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,119
have real difficulty are broadleaf weeds

652
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:52,398
within a broadleaf plant most of the

653
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:54,719
broadleaf herbicides that are out there

654
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:58,079
affect strawberries as well one of the

655
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,319
few that dozen is 24d surprisingly 24d

656
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,678
will impact most other broadleaf plants

657
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,879
and leave strawberries alone it's very

658
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,000
old herbicide Growers have used it for

659
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,880
years and it's still really quite a good

660
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,519
herbicide to use on strawberries

661
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:13,440
particularly uh at renovation time and

662
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,278
again in early November when it's still

663
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,558
a little warm and the Dand lines and

664
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:20,640
plants like that can take it up yeah

665
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,359
anything that works on broadleaf plants

666
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,360
that selectively leave strawberries

667
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:27,000
alone would be a good thing all right

668
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:29,959
when I as I switch these pole um things

669
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,398
there's a couple of other questions um

670
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,159
Marvin one from Jeff Miller about can

671
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:36,639
cover crops be a host of pest of

672
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,640
strawberries and then Jan beglinger has

673
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:45,080
a um question as

674
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:47,880
well yeah so cover crops can be host of

675
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:51,158
pests but if you select a cover crop

676
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:54,000
that's not closely related to the crop

677
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:55,600
then the odds of sharing pests diminish

678
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,240
considerably and that's why most of the

679
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:01,879
cover crops that we've talked about

680
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,519
are grass type crops in the grass family

681
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,519
so Sudan grass it doesn't really share

682
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:07,440
any pest strawberries in fact it helps

683
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:11,519
suppress

684
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,080
nitas Rye oats those things they do not

685
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,200
share pest with strawberries so they're

686
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:18,199
very safe to use whereas if we would be

687
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,720
using say like a legume cover crop like

688
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,240
Clover or peas they do Harbor lots of

689
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,319
diseases in common with strawberries

690
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,679
because they're much more closely

691
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:27,720
related verticillium Wilt tares plant

692
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,480
bug things like that so stick the

693
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,558
grasses and you'll be much safer and

694
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,839
then in terms

695
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:36,480
of fact sheets we have good information

696
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:38,480
in the production guides the strawberry

697
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,919
production guide the blueberry guide the

698
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,159
raspberry guide they all have a a

699
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:46,120
chapter in there a section on cover

700
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:49,000
crops that are appropriate to use in the

701
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:49,000
various Berry

702
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:59,840
crops what percent of non-h harvest

703
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,278
labor expenditures do you believe

704
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,278
Growers spend on weed management

705
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:12,720
and yeah I would we've done various

706
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,558
economic analyses and in fact last two

707
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,079
weeks I've taken my class on field trips

708
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,240
to strawberry farms and we've asked the

709
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,240
Growers that question specifically and

710
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,038
they all say about

711
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,000
80% and our numbers when we look at it

712
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:29,599
the economics it looks like it's about

713
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,960
70% so it's very very high a lot of

714
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:33,639
Labor spent pulling weeds and managing

715
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,519
weeds and strawberries in particular

716
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,080
that's why we're focusing so many of our

717
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,079
efforts on

718
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:52,399
strawberries okay um let's look at these

719
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:56,000
polls about uh how effective the current

720
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:58,599
Suite of f herbicide

721
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,839
strawberries yeah

722
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:04,558
raspberries and blueberries and let me

723
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,959
just make sure that they're all um

724
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,480
broadcast the results of all of these as

725
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,480
we look at

726
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:15,679
them and I would you know concur with

727
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,919
these results at least that's how I

728
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,720
would expect them to come out even if

729
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,519
you pull it a bunch of Growers that you

730
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,839
know strawberry herbicides are modly

731
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,240
effective they're more now than there

732
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:28,398
were just a few years ago uh same with

733
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,480
raspberries moderately effective none

734
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:33,239
are super effective but blueberries you

735
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,480
know we have a few that are you know

736
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,120
fairly effective on blueberries because

737
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:41,038
we have a a plant that's up harded has

738
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:43,079
Woody stems and shoots so it gives us a

739
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,879
lot more options for spraying a little

740
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,678
bit more harsher product down on the

741
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,760
ground and not affecting the

742
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,840
plant all right and for our final

743
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:56,558
question this was

744
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:59,240
actually the first question broadcast

745
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:59,240
those results

746
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,000
yeah and uh again I think people's

747
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:05,519
perception is right you know strawberry

748
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,519
Growers struggle the most with weeds

749
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,159
compared to the other

750
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,319
two and then I see a few questions down

751
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,880
here that we can maybe answer about

752
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,798
cover crops the Sarah managing cover

753
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,440
crops book is a good resource and it

754
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:22,038
sure is a lot of the information from

755
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,360
the Sarah guide we've picked out cover

756
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:25,960
crops that would be in at sbbook for the

757
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,839
production guide because certain ones

758
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,480
don't do well like it's in the sbook

759
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:33,798
like some of the legumes but in a

760
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,399
blueberry field where you have an acidic

761
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:40,119
soil the legumes don't grow well in

762
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:41,558
acidic soil so those would be excluded

763
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:44,000
even though they might be good cover

764
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:46,200
crops otherwise so if you look in a

765
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,558
blueberry production guide it won't talk

766
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,440
about leguminous cover crops because

767
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:53,879
it's just not compatible with acidic

768
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,399
soil and the question that Dean asks can

769
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,720
buckwheat be used as a late cover at

770
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:00,719
renovation or their pest

771
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,159
concerns the problem that we've seen

772
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:08,679
with buckweed is that it it throws a

773
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:12,559
good bit of shade and it also goes to

774
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:14,880
seed and the and you might have to kill

775
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:17,200
it or cultivate it before it goes to

776
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,559
seed whereas the oats and the sedan

777
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,319
grass we don't have to worry about that

778
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,278
we let that Frost take care of it for us

779
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,879
and we can just leave it in plays if you

780
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:25,960
use buckwheat in between the rows you'd

781
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,639
have to manage a little bit more

782
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,120
carefully because you wouldn't want to

783
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:32,240
it to turn into a weed for you the

784
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,518
following year I'm not sure about pest

785
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,558
concerns of buckweed I don't think there

786
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,038
would be pest concerns particularly you

787
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:39,839
know when it's flowering it's flowering

788
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:42,158
after strawberries flow so even if it

789
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,918
would attract Carnage plant bugs or

790
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,039
something like that it would be past the

791
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,038
point at which strawberries are

792
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:52,639
vulnerable and then I see Jeff has a is

793
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,639
asking about sap Beetle I'm not sure in

794
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:58,839
what context but sap beetles do over

795
00:32:55,638 --> 00:33:01,599
winter in strawberry can overwinter in

796
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:05,079
Strawberry Fields if there's a lot of

797
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:08,038
junk around so there could be an issue I

798
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:09,278
suppose if you had a lot of residue it

799
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:11,319
could make an environment a little bit

800
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:14,079
more favorable for the sap Beetle to

801
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:15,918
overwinter in so instead of leaving the

802
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:17,839
field into the woods and all it might

803
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,840
just hang around that's a good question

804
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:20,439
I don't know the answer to that I

805
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:23,199
haven't had

806
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,960
anybody say or observe any grower say

807
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,440
you know I've been multim more and I've

808
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,880
been using these interplanet cover and I

809
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,798
just noticed my saple uh increasing

810
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:36,360
dramatically I haven't heard that but I

811
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:36,359
think theoretically it's

812
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:44,759
possible all right does anybody else

813
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,759
have any questions for

814
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:51,558
Marvin do want to let you know that we

815
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:55,319
have another webcast training on October

816
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:58,158
8th at 1:00 again it'll be the same

817
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:00,599
format but a different topic I believe

818
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,840
that one is with Dr Courtney Weber about

819
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:07,319
new um small fruit

820
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:09,519
varieties and um I I am hopeful that I'm

821
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:12,159
going to be able to email you folks a

822
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:14,960
couple of questions just about the

823
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,919
format and whether or not the thing went

824
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,240
smoothly the whole webcast went smoothly

825
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:20,719
and if you wanted to make any

826
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,759
