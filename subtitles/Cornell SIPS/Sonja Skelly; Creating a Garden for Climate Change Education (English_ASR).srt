1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:04,560
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,719
University there we go um so I'm really

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:15,119
excited to share this project with you

4
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:16,480
all today um especially as um I'm here

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,239
with plant scientists and

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,600
horticulturists and experts in

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:26,278
greenhouse and high tunnels um as you'll

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,359
see why that's important um uh to use

9
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:31,559
those things to help us educate about

10
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:33,559
climate change and um ultimately we're

11
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,280
hoping our goal is to have a positive

12
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:38,640
impact but we want to do something a

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,640
little bit different um so I'm the lucky

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,799
one who gets to speak to you today but I

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,439
have two collaborators um actually I

16
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,078
have lots of collaborators on this

17
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:48,359
project and I'm going to highlight them

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,239
all at the end but here's a few of us

19
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:54,600
here at the site but key to this effort

20
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,479
um has been Chris wean who um has now

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,079
left the project unfortunately but we

22
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,718
keep drawing trying to draw him back in

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,039
as often as we can and then Josh Sarah

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,478
from landscape architecture who uh the

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,519
three of us um served as the principal

26
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:09,280
investigators when we started um putting

27
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,560
this project together and are Josh and I

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,799
are continuing to work on this with a

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,759
host of other

30
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,118
folks so um before I tell you about the

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,519
garden itself I wanted to give you a

32
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,118
little background at least from where we

33
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,280
were working from so you have some

34
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:23,680
context

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,320
for uh where we were coming from and

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,640
what we were trying to do and as I think

37
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,399
most of us are aware we um climate

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,599
change is one of the biggest challenges

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,000
that we're facing and this is a slide

40
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:38,640
that I pulled from NASA when I was

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,478
initially preparing this when they were

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,079
saying that January has broken all

43
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:46,399
records um that has quickly been uh

44
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:50,399
eclipsed by all the records set in

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:53,239
February for being the hottest uh let me

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,320
make sure I say this right

47
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,919
the most anomalous warm month ever

48
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,438
recorded So February broke all of

49
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,118
January's records so we know that this

50
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:04,038
is an issue and there's lots of

51
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:08,878
scientists on campus who are working on

52
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:11,520
this um but what we also know is that as

53
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,280
the public there's um a disconnect

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,319
between the knowledge that we have about

55
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,000
climate change and our willingness to do

56
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,000
something about

57
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:30,359
it so in talking about in looking at

58
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,799
what other Gardens were doing

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,680
so plantations as the public garden of

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,879
Cornell we wanted to know what was

61
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,719
happening out there and a lot of work uh

62
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,239
has been done on plant conservation

63
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:44,239
efforts specifically and looking at um

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,039
how we conserve plants either in insitu

65
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,239
or

66
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,959
exitu programs um two of the recent ones

67
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:52,959
that have just been released is the New

68
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,199
England wildf flower Society recently

69
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,840
put out this habitat based approach when

70
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:00,598
they profiled their five key habitats

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,920
for the Northeast region and and are

72
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,919
discuss the environmental issues that

73
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,679
are facing each habitat and um

74
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,158
discussing the impacts of stressor such

75
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,439
as climate change are likely to have on

76
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:12,878
those an international organization

77
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,919
called Botanic Gardens conservation

78
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,639
International is looking

79
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:20,000
at um climate change on Plants the

80
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:23,679
impacts on plants and their ecosystems

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,080
or at the cellular level and this report

82
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,319
uh lists how the impact of climate

83
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,879
change will affect animals AFF humans

84
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,199
who depend on them but also provid some

85
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:36,759
recommendations for how to Stave off

86
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:39,959
Extinction or to work towards these

87
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:42,598
um issues that are being

88
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,719
faced probably the most predominant way

89
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,438
that public gardens are educating about

90
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,080
climate change is through phology

91
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:51,280
studies and looking at things like

92
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,360
project Bud burst or project Bud break

93
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,360
and um they're doing it in a few ways

94
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,439
one is by using their own plant records

95
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,519
which Public Gardens are well known to

96
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,919
have very detailed and accurate records

97
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,319
and a lot of gardens are using these

98
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,199
records to record the times of first

99
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:12,039
Leaf out and the first bed Break um but

100
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,000
they're also now looking at installing

101
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:16,000
plants uh on a what called a

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
phenological monitoring garden and

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,199
looking specifically at specific kinds

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,319
of plants and how they're flowering at

105
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,199
different times and then they're also

106
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:29,240
involved in uh citizen science efforts

107
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:32,199
which train volunteers staff uh school

108
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:35,519
children to go out and record the date

109
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,720
of first Bud break or Leaf break within

110
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,719
their

111
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,000
communities and then the other way that

112
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,680
um we're familiar with were are um ways

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,519
in which Gardens are

114
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,918
interpreting P climate change and their

115
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,319
outreach program so in terms of

116
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,038
interpretation the American public

117
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,240
garden Association is working to develop

118
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:58,719
a set of templates that are based on the

119
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,680
most recent climate science about

120
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,840
climate change um providing information

121
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,840
that Gardens can develop their own

122
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,000
interpretive tools for or there are

123
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,239
Outreach programs such as the community

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
climate action program at the Chicago

125
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,680
Botanic Garden which takes slightly

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,279
different approach and goes out into

127
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,439
communities and works with groups that

128
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,439
are traditionally not represented in the

129
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,279
climate change programs and they go into

130
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:27,000
the community they work with these

131
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,038
Community groups on issues that they're

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,839
facing that are related or are the

133
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:34,560
result of Cl climate change and look to

134
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,079
find assets that this community can use

135
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,319
to solve problems and so are really

136
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,279
taking it at a community level approach

137
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,080
and then there are educational Outreach

138
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:45,519
efforts such as the fair child challenge

139
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,839
which is out of a fair child tropical

140
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,519
banic garden in Miami that is uh K

141
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,758
through 12 environmental science

142
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:56,000
competition and many of the topics that

143
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,520
are addressed in that um through art and

144
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,439
literature

145
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,519
through debates um are focused on

146
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,360
climate

147
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,719
change so um in looking and trying to

148
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,160
find out if anybody else is doing

149
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,440
something called a climate change Garden

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,560
we came across this effort at Syracuse

151
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,918
University and in 2014 they installed

152
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,439
what they're calling a climate change

153
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:20,359
Garden that will track how plants will

154
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,719
adapt to global warming and they planted

155
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,319
33 different species of trees and shrubs

156
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,000
some of which are adapted to Central New

157
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,960
York and some which are adapted to

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
warmer regions and they will be

159
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,638
monitoring the to see if there are any

160
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,839
changes in health and the Vitality of

161
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,840
these

162
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:41,758
species

163
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,120
so I'll also share that uh the executive

164
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,199
director of the American public garden

165
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,000
Association saw what

166
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,598
we see and feel and that is that public

167
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,120
gardens really are uniquely positioned

168
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:54,959
to be as he says the place to learn

169
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,399
about and experience climate change and

170
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,279
that public gardens are places where

171
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,839
visitors can make local connections to

172
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:04,598
the global issue and this was something

173
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:07,519
that um really is something that we were

174
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:09,959
very interested in that we didn't we

175
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,120
appreciated the phenological studies and

176
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,918
the phenological monitoring Gardens and

177
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,478
the Outreach efforts in fact we're

178
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,478
trying to partner with the Chicago

179
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:20,279
Botanic Garden on that community-based

180
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,959
asset approach that I described but what

181
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,598
we were looking for was something that

182
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,839
was demonstrative that was experiential

183
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:28,918
that was interactive it was compelling

184
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,159
to visitors that somehow gave them a

185
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:35,000
sense of what climate change um

186
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,400
is expected to do and what impacts it

187
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,120
would have locally and in looking at

188
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,079
this and in going through the project

189
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,800
for a couple of years um we recently

190
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,918
came across a paper from uh perspectives

191
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,280
on psychological science that was

192
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:53,279
written to address how public engage we

193
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,079
can improve public engagement in policy

194
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,559
efforts toward climate change and just

195
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,318
briefly I thought I would share some of

196
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,680
these because they are in line with some

197
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,759
of the things that we're trying to do

198
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,598
and some of the goals that we have which

199
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,240
is that um we value experience over

200
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,560
analysis so a lot of the climate science

201
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,800
that's put out there a lot of what's

202
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,280
seen in the media a lot of the articles

203
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,000
that are written or even interpretation

204
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,519
we're seeing at Public Gardens is very

205
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,079
analytical we're putting lots of

206
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:21,719
Statistics out but as individuals um we

207
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,318
do have an analytical side of our brain

208
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,639
but we also um we react to our gut and

209
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,240
so if there was an opportunity to really

210
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,918
highlight relevant experiences how

211
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,799
people may be experiencing current

212
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,838
effects of climate change or are seeing

213
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,639
patterns to build on that the other one

214
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,200
that really jumped out was this out of

215
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,278
sight out of mind and I think we may

216
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,080
have all experienced this in this that

217
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:46,159
climate change is some future phenomenon

218
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,639
it's not going to happen in our lifetime

219
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,000
and it's happening across the world to

220
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,879
somebody else other than ourselves and

221
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
so how do we make that how do we change

222
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,679
that perception and one of their

223
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,519
recommendations is to emphasize what's

224
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,958
happening now and what's happening at a

225
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,278
local and Regional level and the last

226
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,359
one which I didn't highlight here but I

227
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,879
think is really important is this um

228
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,320
idea of how we are motivated to act and

229
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:12,320
we are either motivated at an inst

230
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,920
extrinsic level you know there's some

231
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,000
carrot there waiting for us or from an

232
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:20,799
intrinsic level and what their study

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,559
found is that there is this deeply held

234
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,799
motivation that we have intrinsically to

235
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:27,359
want to make the world a better place so

236
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,399
they recommended tapping into that

237
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,639
somehow so we haven't quite figured out

238
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:35,720
now but we'll come back to

239
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:37,879
that so what we decided to do was come

240
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,680
up with what we are calling a cre

241
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,759
creative experiment and it's not a true

242
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,359
experiment in the way that we're all

243
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:45,600
used to thinking about control and

244
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,320
experimental but really we wanted to

245
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,879
figure out if we could create a garden

246
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,200
or some kind of experience within a

247
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,078
garden that would inform visitors about

248
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,000
climate change would physically

249
00:09:53,078 --> 00:10:00,078
demonstrate what we might expect um in

250
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,839
some future not too distant future um

251
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:04,639
that would use plants as a lens to

252
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,240
communicate what these impacts are

253
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:11,078
likely to um to look like and that gave

254
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,240
visitors some way to really experience

255
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:16,000
this and even to interact with um these

256
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,759
changes that we are

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,440
seeing so we've um came up with a way to

258
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:25,480
do this and our approach was to um look

259
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,399
at it with from an environmental control

260
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,920
standpoint a plant response standpoint a

261
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,919
visitor response standpoint so the

262
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,599
environment Al controls this is where

263
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,719
Chris ween came in and his love of high

264
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,800
tunnels he said you guys at plantations

265
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,720
need a high tunnel and so that's kind of

266
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,240
where we started um but really he was he

267
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
was advocating not just for us to have a

268
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,440
high tunnel but that he felt that it

269
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,278
could be a tool to approximate F some of

270
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,800
the predicted future climate conditions

271
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:51,720
and then as horticulturists and as

272
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:54,359
gardeners and at a public garden we

273
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,160
really wanted to have plants as the lens

274
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,200
and wanted to see if we could find

275
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,480
plants that would show effects of

276
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,320
temperature and pre ation and could be

277
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,519
good communicators of what we're

278
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,040
expecting to see and then ultimately

279
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,399
we're doing this so that we can have

280
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:13,519
some impact on the visitors that come

281
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:15,639
through and you know at on a spectrum of

282
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,120
what we want to do from goals it's one

283
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,600
increasing their knowledge of and

284
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,679
concern of but for me it's always about

285
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,440
some intent to act some making that

286
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,879
world a better place and I think my

287
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,680
colleagues would agree with that so

288
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,439
enter the high tunnel and and we

289
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:35,199
received uh an initial Grant from the

290
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,839
toward sustainability Foundation to buy

291
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,360
a high tunnel and install it and so this

292
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:45,959
is uh was installed it's a 24x 20 and

293
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:51,560
12T high high tunnel um col covered with

294
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:54,159
um a poly ethene e film and while there

295
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:56,799
are lots of other devices some far more

296
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,240
expensive that can approximate more

297
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,679
accurately the effects of climate change

298
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,440
we were drawn to the high tunnel because

299
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:08,278
it's relatively inexpensive and we can

300
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:11,160
regulate temperature uh because of the

301
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:14,000
radiation and the ventilation and that

302
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,879
uh we could also control

303
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,440
irrigation so in addition to

304
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:20,720
constructing the high tunnel we also

305
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,320
constructed 12 raised beds 4x6 beds both

306
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,399
outside the garden outside the high

307
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
tunnel and inside the high

308
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,958
tunnel

309
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:32,799
and we in installed a tempature sensors

310
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:35,559
both inside and outside the tunnel this

311
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:39,359
we are using an onset computer model u30

312
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:42,039
hobo to take both the air temperature as

313
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,199
well as soil temperature and measuring

314
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:46,198
the active radiation during the growing

315
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:52,958
season and then what we set out to do

316
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:55,958
was to create what we we called the

317
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,958
garden of today um in the outside bed so

318
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,638
they would experience the temperatures

319
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:02,599
and the precipitation and the

320
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:06,720
temperature the climate changes of today

321
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:09,879
and then we wanted to approximate some

322
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,879
future climate and we selected The

323
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,879
Garden of 2050 and we did this for

324
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:17,240
several reasons one is when we in um

325
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,879
invited Jonathan Schult who is a

326
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,278
professor of communication to um work

327
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:23,439
with us on this project he was saying

328
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:25,799
you know you really need to put a date

329
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,560
on it otherwise it's that future distant

330
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,559
future it's never going to happen date

331
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:34,399
and that date of 2050 really gives us

332
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:36,479
something not too distant that we can um

333
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,159
understand 34 years is not that far away

334
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,440
hopefully many of us will still be alive

335
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:43,679
then our CH we can imagine our children

336
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,000
in this climate so um that was one

337
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,198
reason the other reason is that we are

338
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,879
using the nerta climate report and

339
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:55,120
within this report which is um full of

340
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,879
lots of good information but um in

341
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,519
particular there are climate models and

342
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:03,039
they're based on the 2020s the 50s the

343
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:06,440
2080s and the 2100s so we the this time

344
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:09,000
frame gave us um a clear model to work

345
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,560
from and this is the report that I just

346
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,278
mentioned and this is an assessment that

347
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,518
provides information on climate change

348
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,480
impacts specific for New York State and

349
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,278
even more specifically for various

350
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:26,879
regions and we are here in turn that on

351
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:28,360
as you can see in Region 3 and there are

352
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,439
climate projections for temperature

353
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,360
precipitation sea level rise heat waves

354
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,680
cold events intense precipitation

355
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,399
extreme events and storms so we were

356
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:42,719
using this

357
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:45,198
um report to uh get at those projections

358
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,959
so what are they um starting with

359
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,958
temperature that for the 2050s we are

360
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:55,518
expected to see an average annual

361
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:55,518
increase of between 4.4 and 6.3

362
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,600
de um there are expected to be an

363
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:05,120
increase in days over 90° fah um up to

364
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,120
38

365
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:11,278
days and we're going to have a greater

366
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:13,638
frequency and duration of heat waves so

367
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,360
3 to six consecutive days over 90

368
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,079
degrees or

369
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,278
more and we're expected to have five or

370
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:23,758
um three to six of those heat wve

371
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:26,519
durations lasting five or more

372
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,600
days and then our annual precipitation

373
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:31,198
is expected to increase by 4 to 10% now

374
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,759
this increase right now is looking at

375
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,159
winter that increase will happen

376
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,318
primarily over the winter and that

377
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,240
actually in this late Summer and the

378
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:39,360
fall there'll be a decrease in that

379
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,240
precipitation um and we're also expected

380
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,879
to have some increase in frequency and

381
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,560
intensity and duration of extreme

382
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,559
precipitation

383
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:51,240
events so looking at all those

384
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:54,399
projections um we started we installed

385
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,759
the Garden in 2014 and this is the

386
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,198
garden itself just to give you a sense

387
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,639
of where it's at it's located in the

388
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,799
botanic garden bowl of Plantation

389
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,480
it's in what's known as the pounder

390
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,479
garden and it sits within the southeast

391
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,600
corner of that

392
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,360
garden and um we spent the first year

393
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,278
primarily installing the high tunnel as

394
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:17,000
I showed you and getting the beds in and

395
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:18,399
um figuring we did minimal

396
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,839
interpretation we were having lots of

397
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,559
discussions about how we would interpret

398
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,160
it and um but in talking about the

399
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:27,159
plants we were very ambitious in this

400
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:29,799
first year and we selected six different

401
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:32,519
categories of plants to display

402
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:35,000
and walk you through those uh this first

403
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,399
one that's pictured here is uh a

404
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,318
temperate species that would have an

405
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,198
earlier and abbreviated growth period in

406
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:41,838
the high

407
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,000
tunnel um second bed was landscape

408
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,600
plants that would grow well in the high

409
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,839
tunnel but not be Hardy outside so as a

410
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,560
Southern girl I was really excited to

411
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,519
see this lacroma in there didn't last

412
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,799
very

413
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,318
long um and then uh having more

414
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,599
temperate species that would have an

415
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:02,000
earlier and abbreviated growth period

416
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,038
period unusual species of tropical

417
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,480
origin that would grow well outside in

418
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:09,919
but not um in the high

419
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,798
tunnel um no it would grow well in the

420
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,360
high tunnel but not so well outside and

421
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:15,720
these were things like okra peanuts

422
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,519
cotton Malibar

423
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,720
spinach and then we did a varieties of

424
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:23,199
peppers several different

425
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,759
varieties and then tender perennials

426
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,558
things that would grow well um in the

427
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,640
tunnel but not so well outside the

428
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:33,079
tunnel and this was an interesting

429
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,720
watching how um people interacted with

430
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:38,079
these plants was very interesting and

431
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,798
this this Garden this particular bed um

432
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,279
a couple of anecdotes both for myself

433
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:43,240
and for the student who is working in

434
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,000
there is that when people saw this they

435
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,880
were like climate change Bring it on I

436
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,599
can grow this here now they were really

437
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,600
excited so this when we're talking about

438
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,759
plants as Messengers a little bit later

439
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:54,399
we always come back to this one about

440
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:59,599
being being clear about what kind of

441
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,600
message we're um trying to convey

442
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,000
and then this is the interpretation we

443
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,360
had for the first year which was very

444
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,440
simply um a welcome sign mentioned a

445
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,119
little bit about the garden and what we

446
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,400
were trying to do there we did have a

447
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:14,519
brochure with a detachable survey and

448
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,960
invited folks to walk around and Inter

449
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,960
our idea is that they would interact

450
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,240
with the garden and tell us a little bit

451
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,000
about what they felt about the quality

452
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,480
of the plants inside and outside so the

453
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,079
flip of this had um an inside the tunnel

454
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,038
and asked them to rank and then had

455
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,558
these directed questions and we put out

456
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,240
surveys they were all gone at the end of

457
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:35,599
the season but we only received nine of

458
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,200
these uh detachable surveys back um and

459
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,839
from that we saw that these open-ended

460
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,519
questions didn't work so well people did

461
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:46,439
tend to fill in the the quality but not

462
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:49,279
so much on the on the open-ended

463
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,679
questions and then we had staff or our

464
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,399
we've had several interns work in the

465
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,840
garden and they documented their

466
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,120
observations uh both about the garden

467
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,319
but also about the visitors that were

468
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,479
there and the kinds of questions and

469
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:03,439
interaction that they

470
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,720
had so there were a couple of lessons

471
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,240
that we learned from this first year uh

472
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,519
that we've take we took on to for this

473
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,759
last year in

474
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:15,639
2015 and so as I mentioned it was we

475
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,079
really were getting started planting the

476
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,960
garden seeing how well it would work um

477
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:23,038
what we did see is that in the high

478
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,679
tunnel we were able to get um even

479
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,158
though it was not severely restricted in

480
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,200
terms of the ventilation uh we were able

481
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,520
to get an increase in the the

482
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,558
temperature higher inside the tunnel

483
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,158
than outside the tunnel and we also

484
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,279
observed differences in plant growth

485
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,440
inside and outside and um I just

486
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,918
mentioned to you about the visitor

487
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,440
survey results or lack thereof that we

488
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,759
got

489
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,480
and um but also probably one of the most

490
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,400
striking things was how people used the

491
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,759
site or didn't use the site and I'll try

492
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,679
so this is where that sign was that uh

493
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,839
the interpretive sign and with the

494
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,440
brochure but in order to get into the

495
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,959
garden you either had to go up this step

496
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,440
walk around this planting of corn and

497
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,558
bypass the high tunnel which everybody

498
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,159
wants to walk into at first or you had

499
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:13,240
to enter from some other part of the

500
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:17,360
Garden or jump up off this probably two

501
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,359
feet um retaining wall so it we weren't

502
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,558
really able to direct the experience and

503
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,678
how people moved through it and there

504
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,240
wasn't a lot of signage that said this

505
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,960
was the Garden of today this was the

506
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,960
Garden of

507
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:33,798
2050 so enter what we did last year

508
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:37,679
which was to um improve the visitor

509
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:40,200
experience and go into that first so

510
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,000
this is a fairly accurate rendition of

511
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,038
that was done by Maru Jabar who is a

512
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,679
student in landscape architecture to

513
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:48,038
really help us redesign The Experience

514
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,200
so that visitors understood what they

515
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:53,400
were coming into and what they were

516
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,600
seeing and with the exception of this

517
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,200
Arch which isn't in the garden we did

518
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,158
install some new steps so people could

519
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,880
come directly into the garden and then

520
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:04,400
we displayed a sequence of interpretive

521
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,960
messages um along with what we call

522
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,320
focused information tags in the garden

523
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,480
and just to give you a sense of what

524
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,240
that looked like um here at this first

525
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,278
space and this is what it looked like as

526
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,440
you walked up to it uh we tell you a

527
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:17,400
little bit about the garden itself a

528
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,558
little bit more about some of the

529
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,600
science behind it what we're hoping to

530
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:24,480
do in the garden very clearly say this

531
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:26,959
is the garden of today and this is the

532
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,400
garden of 2050 and give you some of

533
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,480
those Graphics that um student landscape

534
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,120
architecture helped us develop to convey

535
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,960
some of this information which if you

536
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:40,000
read it in a paragraph it's pretty hefty

537
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,600
um but she worked really hard with us to

538
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,240
graphically depict that so it was more

539
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,558
visible especially when you look at some

540
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,839
of the interpretation which um studies

541
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:50,798
that say most people spend maybe two

542
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:53,639
minutes if we're lucky looking at a

543
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,158
sign so then um before they enter the

544
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,640
garden we wanted to stop them and tell

545
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,039
them a little bit about the plants they

546
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,159
would be seeing in these Gardens

547
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,879
and when I mentioned we were very

548
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,880
ambitious about the plants that we had

549
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,840
in the first Year's Garden um what we

550
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,360
one of the things that our students saw

551
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:13,558
in her observations is that it was very

552
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,199
um daunting there were lots of plants to

553
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:17,678
look at and the messages and doing a

554
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,480
comparison between six different

555
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,840
categories and what ended up being 36

556
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,120
different plants was um pretty

557
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,319
overwhelming so we narrowed it down to

558
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,158
two categories of plants nectar resource

559
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,678
plants and vegetables and Grains and

560
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,960
then we tell them a little bit about why

561
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,000
we're interested in looking at these

562
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,640
plants and then we tell them a little

563
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,679
bit about um that there are these what

564
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,080
we call we call them focused information

565
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:41,519
tags we're trying to call out something

566
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,000
or Draw their attention to something or

567
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,000
get them to

568
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,640
interact and then when they get to the

569
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,080
back of the garden before they enter

570
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,640
into the garden of the future we wanted

571
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:56,678
to give them a chance to record some of

572
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,679
their observations so this is one of

573
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:59,679
those

574
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,759
and then before they enter into the high

575
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:08,278
tunnel we tell them about what they're

576
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,599
about to enter into so again we're using

577
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:11,558
some of those Graphics that were

578
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:15,000
developed to say what Does The Garden of

579
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:18,960
2050 look like what are you expected to

580
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,240
encounter and then we have this um

581
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,440
chalkboard where we can call attention

582
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,440
to what is happening within the garden

583
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,000
and so at this particular time we were

584
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,759
initiating a heat wave um trying to

585
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,240
trying to initiate a heat wave we um are

586
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:36,119
we we tried to be S uh follow the

587
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:40,038
projections and had six heat waves uh

588
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,038
over the course of the 2015

589
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,480
season and then finally as they exit

590
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:48,038
exit the garden we wanted to give them

591
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,679
some uh another opportunity

592
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:53,960
to share their observations so things

593
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,960
like

594
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:59,558
this and then give them a little uh give

595
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,600
them some way to learn about more about

596
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:04,960
the garden and then we gave them a

597
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,959
takeaway brochure which um is based in

598
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,480
large part on the work that David wolf

599
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,919
did in his chapter about gardening

600
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,519
sustainably and a changing climate and

601
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,880
he was very generous with this work to

602
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,679
um give our visitors something that they

603
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,320
could leave with that gave them some

604
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:23,720
tools to do

605
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:25,798
more um so the other thing that we tried

606
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,278
to do in addition to improving the

607
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:31,240
visitor experience was really to tune

608
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:32,720
the tunnel and in this case we um didn't

609
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,720
get quite the increase that we were

610
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,519
looking for in 2014 that was consistent

611
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,839
with the projections for

612
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:40,918
2050 um so we really wanted to figure

613
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:42,439
out how we could tune that tunnel to get

614
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,759
the temperature increase the average

615
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:50,159
annual temperature increase of 4.4 to

616
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:52,119
6.3 uh we also installed in 2014 we were

617
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,760
manually rolling up the sides of that

618
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:55,918
high tunnel to restrict the ventilation

619
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,919
to get the temperatures up and last year

620
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,278
we installed um so you see there's the

621
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,200
manual

622
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,480
um and when you have to do that a couple

623
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,159
of times a day it's not hard but it gets

624
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,038
gets to be a lot of work so we um

625
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,000
installed some we automated them and

626
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,440
I'll talk a little bit about that

627
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,640
Automation in in a few

628
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:19,399
minutes and then we really wanted to

629
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:21,440
figure out and test and identify plants

630
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:23,678
that could be our Messengers and whether

631
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,080
they were susceptible to the impacts

632
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,880
that we were seeing with climate change

633
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:30,439
or if they were showing resilience um to

634
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,880
them and looking at um how they would be

635
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,159
affected by temperature and eventually

636
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,080
precipitation um whether they had

637
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:41,278
accelerated growth or syence Bloom time

638
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:44,798
differences stress or uh stress related

639
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,640
diseases and could we interpret those uh

640
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:47,759
in a way that our visitors would

641
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,799
understand and that we could attribute

642
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:53,558
to a temperature or precipitation uh

643
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:56,398
change in precipitation or

644
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:58,839
temperature so um as I mentioned we

645
00:25:56,398 --> 00:26:02,158
focused on grain crops and we want what

646
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:03,119
we wanted to do is tie the um this idea

647
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,559
of the

648
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,798
food food is going to our food plants

649
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:09,119
are going to be affected by climate

650
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,960
change um and in some cases we know how

651
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,359
but in some cases we don't know how so

652
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,960
we thought we would start with grains

653
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:15,158
since so much of our diet is based on

654
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,278
grains and then we would have other

655
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:20,720
plants that are common in home gardeners

656
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:24,319
home gardens so in these beds here we

657
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,079
have uh barley wheat and

658
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,200
oats

659
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:31,038
and what

660
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,038
we we know about at least with wheat is

661
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,558
a it's a short-lived annual and under

662
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,119
increased temperatures it could grow

663
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,759
faster and have reduced yields and so

664
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:42,639
that's something that we could interpret

665
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,558
um in this case last year we had uh some

666
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,720
disease that affected

667
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:49,240
the the wheat and we don't know again

668
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,720
why this was the case but this is

669
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,640
something this is something that we're

670
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,200
trying to tune in terms of um

671
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,520
understanding it we also tried beans uh

672
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,798
in the garden both inside and outside

673
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:05,079
side and as I mentioned that we went

674
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:07,720
through six heat waves and when these

675
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:09,199
beans were setting their flowers we had

676
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,519
one of those heat waves and so what we

677
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,240
ended up seeing was a split set of the

678
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:17,359
beans which we have beans of different

679
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,440
sizes because at higher temperatures the

680
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,918
beans will drop their flowers which for

681
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,278
a home Gardener may not be a big deal

682
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:26,320
but from a production standpoint could

683
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:29,359
have a real impact in having seed uh

684
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:31,599
fruit of different sizes

685
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,240
and both the grains and the beans were

686
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,558
done relatively early in the season so

687
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,960
it gave us an opportunity to try out um

688
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:41,240
another set of crops so we tried out

689
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,240
lettuce and um we had different

690
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,599
germination rates inside and outside of

691
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:49,720
the garden so we're recording those and

692
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:53,158
this is a different set of uh varieties

693
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:55,679
of lettuce that were planted in the bean

694
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,399
beds and then for the other final food

695
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,720
crop we had uh peppers and wanted to see

696
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,119
what kinds of differences we could

697
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,120
expect

698
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:05,839
there then the other set of plants were

699
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:09,158
our nectar resource plants and we did

700
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,798
this by early blooming flowers uh late

701
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:13,519
blooming summer flowers and then fall

702
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,558
blooming flowers so this is the early

703
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,038
summer flowering plants things like Iris

704
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:21,200
versicolor the manota the

705
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:23,440
pensum and wanted to see what kind of

706
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,679
impact that they would have and this was

707
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,440
another way that um instead of just

708
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,038
pointing out things we were asking for

709
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,759
visitors to to comment on their

710
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:34,038
observations and with the exception of

711
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,919
the first set of checks in both of these

712
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:38,200
which is US putting it on there so

713
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,799
people know what to do um you can see

714
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,278
that our visitors generally recognize

715
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:46,079
the difference between um what they were

716
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:48,200
seeing inside and

717
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,918
outside and then these are the late

718
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,080
summer flowering plants so two different

719
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:57,320
varieties of scus and a

720
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,720
panum and again trying to draw attention

721
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,439
to what we were seeing

722
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,720
um and help our visitors see that so

723
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,720
here we're asking them to count the

724
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,720
flowers um inside and outside see if

725
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,919
they can notice a

726
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,640
difference and then finally we had the

727
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:15,720
fall blooming plants so we had solidago

728
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:19,120
cleone and a common wood Aster and um in

729
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:23,278
this case excuse me we um had this poor

730
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,038
Clon that was being over um competed by

731
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,599
the

732
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:29,398
solidago and we simply say here uh this

733
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,678
Clon is having a hard time competing

734
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:32,239
plant communities in the future may

735
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:34,038
change as some plants better adapt to

736
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,960
new

737
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:39,278
conditions so the other thing that we

738
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,919
did last year was to uh in to work with

739
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,200
Jonathan Schult from communication to um

740
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,278
really get serious about a visitor

741
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,919
survey we saw limitations of our initial

742
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:49,359
one and we wanted his help and his work

743
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,880
is working with public perception of

744
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:56,000
climate change and he's a statistician

745
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:58,240
and so lots of good things to offer and

746
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,759
what we did with this uh visitor survey

747
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,440
is that we asked some general questions

748
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:05,200
about knowledge people's knowledge their

749
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,240
concern their opinion about climate

750
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,919
change and how it's caused when the

751
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,240
changes will occur and the likelihood

752
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,840
that they would take some action and all

753
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,480
of these questions are based on um

754
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:21,240
previous UNP polling data whether it's

755
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:23,360
Gallup poll or ABC News polling um New

756
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,359
York Times polling and this is so that

757
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,519
we can we can use our results and we can

758
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,918
compare them to what's being pulled on a

759
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,120
national

760
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:34,080
level we also then asked some very

761
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,639
specific questions to our project things

762
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,398
um about what impact we would have on

763
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,679
local plant communities uh those nectar

764
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:44,918
resource plants the local crops what um

765
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:46,240
people could expect in 20150 do are they

766
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:50,159
recognizing the changes that we're

767
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,278
likely to see uh what is it what is

768
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,840
going to happen specifically in central

769
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:56,240
New York wanted to understand if they

770
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:58,480
had they felt like they had access to

771
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,919
Reliable information and

772
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,480
then if they were seeing any differences

773
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,720
between the plants inside and outside

774
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,079
and whether the signs that we had up uh

775
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,600
were of

776
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:11,119
help and so our initial results um just

777
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,678
saying that this was a pilot test we um

778
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:16,319
didn't launch it till the very end of

779
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:18,200
the season we only had 43 precip

780
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,599
participants and most of those were

781
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,159
students from communication uh so they

782
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:27,599
were had incentive to participate we

783
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,240
also um had tour takers folks who came

784
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,839
on tour of plantations who are willing

785
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,638
to do it and with that with only having

786
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:38,000
43 participants we don't have as John

787
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:40,959
says not enough statistical power to um

788
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,798
say anything but he was and these are

789
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,960
his words initial indications are that

790
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:48,759
there's something detectable

791
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,000
happening so um he he was very

792
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:52,839
encouraged by what he was seeing but he

793
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,880
wouldn't say anything more than that for

794
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:58,678
this se but he's on board for for us to

795
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:03,240
do this next season so talking about

796
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:05,880
that and what we plan to do uh we

797
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,839
are again working on refining what we're

798
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,200
doing we're not really changing the

799
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,119
plant material uh very much we want to

800
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,080
refine that Garden experience and

801
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:18,038
looking at um the interpretation and how

802
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:20,558
people navigate through the garden and

803
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:23,119
um we want to see if we can uh find

804
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:26,200
Tunes to the tunnel and whether we can

805
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:28,518
eventually replicate this so in terms of

806
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,080
the garden um and the tunnel

807
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,000
one of the things that Josh was

808
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,960
successful in doing was um partnering

809
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,240
with um a professor from the Department

810
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,798
of biological and environmental

811
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,960
engineering Pete maretto who is working

812
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:44,879
with us to build as best I can call it a

813
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,360
widget um that will take the temperature

814
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,240
from that computer sensor the weather

815
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:52,678
station and monitor what's happening

816
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,960
outside um know what we want to have

817
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:57,399
happen inside in terms of average annual

818
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,840
increase but also these heat waves and

819
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:01,000
it will take take all that information

820
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:02,638
and it will do what we want and he's

821
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,440
told us that we can even have a heatwave

822
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:07,839
button on this so that those side the

823
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,919
sides of the tunnel and the vents and

824
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:15,000
the doors can be automated to ventilate

825
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:17,240
the the tunnel to have the kind of

826
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,880
controls that we're looking for to meet

827
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,399
the the projections that we're hoping to

828
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,440
replicate the other thing um we're

829
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:25,239
trying to do is once we get that

830
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,759
temperature dialed in is to figure out

831
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,440
how we can um start to include

832
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,359
precipitation so right now we've only

833
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,000
been working under one the one variable

834
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:34,959
of temperature and seeing if we can

835
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,759
raise the temperature in the high tunnel

836
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,240
enough to meet what's being projected

837
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:40,960
and to see what kind of impacts that

838
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,720
will have on Plants but we know that

839
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:47,399
precipitation is going to be a big um

840
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,960
issue for plants and so we're talking

841
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:52,239
about how we might do that with soil s

842
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,519
uh moisture sensors but also with hand

843
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,880
watering and um drip irrigation things

844
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:01,000
of that nature

845
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,120
we really want to get the plants right

846
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,038
um we are trying to as I said use plants

847
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:08,159
as Messengers and we want to make sure

848
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:10,918
that the plants that we're using will

849
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,838
have some effect and that that effect is

850
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:18,158
the result of either temperature

851
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:20,000
precipitation and that they are have the

852
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,440
ability to be observed and that we can

853
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,719
interpret that

854
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,599
observation so this is something that

855
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:28,279
we're continuing to work on and

856
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,838
certainly if you have suggestions or um

857
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,320
comments about how some which plants

858
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:35,119
might do well um our team's already been

859
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,919
talking with folks like Thomas bjorkman

860
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,280
and looking at broccoli perhaps because

861
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:41,519
of its um the effect the temperature can

862
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,040
have on

863
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:48,000
it and then um we're also really wanting

864
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:50,838
to look at how uh we can have that

865
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,679
impact on visitors and if we if we're

866
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:55,320
having an impact um what is it and why

867
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,039
to what extent and if we're not having

868
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,599
an impact why not and what can we do to

869
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,800
change that

870
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:03,039
um so we are as I mentioned really

871
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,039
aiming for a more robust sampling of our

872
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:07,920
visitor survey of the visitor surveys

873
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:09,679
but what we'd also like to do is to do

874
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,200
some visitor observations of how people

875
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:14,519
are in the garden what kinds of

876
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:16,719
questions they have are they making

877
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:18,800
observations um if we're able to do some

878
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,480
interviews with visitors we'd like to

879
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,000
get that qualitative data as well as the

880
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,559
visitor data survey data um and

881
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,920
ultimately what we'd like to do is to

882
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:29,679
figure out if this is a project that we

883
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,159
can replicate that other Gardens or

884
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:36,000
other organizations can um do their

885
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,440
Gardens relatively inexpensively and

886
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,719
have the same kind of impact for their

887
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,639
region and use this as a tool to help

888
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:46,000
visitors understand about climate

889
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,480
change um and so I just want to um share

890
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,800
some words of thanks I mentioned Josh

891
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,318
and Chris at the beginning but there's a

892
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,640
host of other folks who are working on

893
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:54,279
this project with us to folks like Donna

894
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,799
Levy who's going to be managing the

895
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,880
garden for us this season Sarah fella

896
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,039
who really has been instrumental in

897
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,039
helping us with the interpretation for

898
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:08,199
this program the gentleman there on the

899
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:10,719
bottom your left is Jonathan Schult from

900
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:13,279
communication and then Nina bassic and

901
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,719
David wolf have also been um agreed to

902
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,400
work with us and collaborate with us on

903
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:17,838
the project to really help us understand

904
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,880
some of these things that we're still

905
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,639
looking to figure out things about

906
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,559
plants what effect the we're having on

907
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,879
plants and and what's the reason for

908
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:29,000
that effect and some of these irrigation

909
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,200
issues so we had a great meeting last

910
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,358
week and are very excited to have them

911
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:34,919
working with us on this and then there

912
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:39,000
are a host of folks at Cornell

913
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,400
plantations um who you know without whom

914
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,318
we wouldn't have this program either

915
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,720
they are out there installing this

916
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:47,838
Garden helping us find plants sourcing

917
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:49,838
the material and then we've had a host

918
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,639
of really phenomenal graduate students

919
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:56,078
people like Emily rer and Julie Romeo

920
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:58,639
aldez I don't have a picture of who was

921
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,599
the the Young who did all those Graphics

922
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:03,159
that I was showing you and then uh Mike

923
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,400
Roberts who is also an employee at

924
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:09,239
plantations but he's now working on a

925
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,960
masters in looking at climate change so

926
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:15,159
this is not a one-woman show except for

927
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,199
today and then um I just want to uh

928
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:18,279
recognize the support that we've gotten

929
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:20,639
financially from the toward

930
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,800
sustainability Foundation the ainson

931
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,358
center for sustainable future for

932
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,119
Cornell plantations and the department

933
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:29,920
of landscape architecture who've um made

934
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,720
this possible possible so with that I

935
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,838
will end and be happy to take any

936
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,259
suggestions or questions or comments

937
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:39,559
that you might

938
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:44,240
[Applause]

939
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:46,799
have yes yeah I you know actually Cally

940
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:48,159
looking at the plants it looks like

941
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,079
plants did better in the tunnel than

942
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:51,559
they did outside the tunnel I think

943
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,039
there really the choice of plants is

944
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:55,519
really going to be critical really and

945
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,279
one of the things like you mentioned

946
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:00,599
that jumped out at me is Iris vers is a

947
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,720
oblate wetland plant you might want to

948
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:05,680
take that out it's a it's not going to

949
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:08,879
be it's it's a wetland plant and so

950
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:10,960
you're in a a situation where probably

951
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,079
won't do better in either either

952
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,039
situation so just a think I mean

953
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,079
thinking about those plants that really

954
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,599
are going to show what you want CU just

955
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:20,560
looking at it says hey they did better

956
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:22,680
in the tunnel right and this is this is

957
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,679
some of the the visitor observation that

958
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:28,199
we had and um I mean I I picked those

959
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:30,598
photos to show the plants um there are

960
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:32,039
other photos that show the opposite of

961
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,519
that but if you're going through the

962
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,559
Garden on that particular day that's

963
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,679
what it looks like and that's what it

964
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,960
says and we have that effect where with

965
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:41,440
the um all of those tropical plants

966
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,800
we're like oh this is cool bring it on

967
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:50,440
right I'll be Sonia how are you dealing

968
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:53,760
with rain inside the P tunnel so we um

969
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:56,800
have a water gauge um outside measures

970
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,680
rainfall and what we've been doing is me

971
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,720
is watering the same amount inside the

972
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:03,039
tunnel so we have a gauge on the hose

973
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:05,639
that Waters so that we're at this point

974
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,358
keeping the soil moisture equivalent in

975
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:09,559
both outside and inside so you're

976
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:13,598
watering the soil if not sounds like you

977
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:15,920
might not be watering the foliage well

978
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,200
be a big part it is a big part right and

979
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,280
this just recently came up that when

980
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:21,318
you're hand watering you're you you're

981
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,880
cooling the plants right by and if

982
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:24,880
you're got it on the foliage and how are

983
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,680
we doing that so what we were discussing

984
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,920
last week is if we can get D Irrigation

985
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:29,239
in there that would be

986
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,920
all the better and we might even be able

987
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:32,959
to control it and make sure that they're

988
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,838
they're equivalent if we want to keep

989
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,119
them equivalent we can do that but if we

990
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:41,119
want to say okay it's a heat wave and

991
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,119
it's a drought then we can withold

992
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:47,920
water grant uh Sonia similarly in terms

993
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:50,079
of the plant material selection you've

994
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,639
selected plants for inside the high

995
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,400
tunnel that have a warmer range in

996
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:56,039
general might you also have a set of

997
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,119
plants that are typically found in more

998
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:01,719
cooler ranges um um you know to to show

999
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,680
them being heat stress in that future

1000
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:07,959
scenario right so the the plants that um

1001
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:11,039
we had in the 2014 season had that we

1002
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,720
had some that would show stress under um

1003
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,838
cooler temperatures they wouldn't make

1004
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:17,159
it through the winter but then they

1005
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:19,400
would also had plants that were um more

1006
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:22,480
temperate here more uh adapted to this

1007
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,240
climate but in the second season we we

1008
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,440
didn't go to that extreme in terms of

1009
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,279
having all those different kinds of

1010
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,559
plants um but it's it's a constant

1011
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,960
conversation that we're having about how

1012
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:33,440
to evolve especially with the plant

1013
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,838
material and are we not only telling the

1014
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,800
story of how things are going to be

1015
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:38,318
adversely affected but are might we also

1016
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,119
be telling the story about resilience

1017
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:42,440
and how we're we're going to have to

1018
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:43,559
adapt to this at some level and so maybe

1019
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,880
we can bring in some of these plants

1020
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:46,880
that are being bred for bber

1021
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,800
temperatures and how might our Farmers

1022
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,119
or agriculturalist use them here or even

1023
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:55,359
home

1024
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:58,119
Gardener so I know that um a goal of the

1025
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:01,400
garden both in terms of the things and

1026
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:04,079
interpretive signage is to increase

1027
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:07,358
awareness among visiting public of the

1028
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,400
reality and seriousness of climate

1029
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:14,199
change typically an even higher goal is

1030
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,240
to move visitors to action so is any of

1031
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:20,838
the future interpretation going to

1032
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:23,799
address actual actions that people can

1033
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:24,838
take well yes that that's the ideal and

1034
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,920
the only thing that we have right now

1035
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,159
that's doing that is the brochure which

1036
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,079
provides

1037
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,920
um information as I mentioned from

1038
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,440
David's chapter that gives gardeners a

1039
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,920
tool either how to adapt their Garden or

1040
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,240
things that they can do to mitigate

1041
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:42,519
using their Garden for climate change um

1042
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,239
you know some of our future you know

1043
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:47,559
Blue Sky discussions have been um having

1044
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:49,078
another high tunnel and showing how you

1045
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:50,838
might adapt things you or things you

1046
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,640
might mitigate in your garden and what

1047
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:54,639
impact that has

1048
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:59,318
so You' mentioned that you know there's

1049
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:01,078
some hope that this serves as a model

1050
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:04,358
that can be used in other Gardens and

1051
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,760
I'm curious if you have heard of have

1052
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:08,639
other Gardens contacted you about this

1053
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,839
program um or have you had an

1054
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:13,559
opportunity to present this model or you

1055
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:17,440
waiting to fine-tune it before doing

1056
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:18,719
that um very good question and no we

1057
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,000
don't we don't really want to wait I

1058
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:21,558
mean part there's part of that is we

1059
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,280
want to make sure it's good but we also

1060
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:24,920
want that feedback in terms of what

1061
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,000
other Gardens are likely to do so

1062
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,280
something that that would res um work

1063
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,440
with well for them do they have the

1064
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,400
space do they have the funds even at

1065
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,519
relatively inexpensive a high tunnel is

1066
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,880
still $10,000 and plus all the other

1067
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:39,440
plant material and beds um but we were

1068
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,838
so at the American public garden

1069
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,280
Association they're aware that we're

1070
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:44,440
doing this and to they're serving as a

1071
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,200
clearing house for others who are

1072
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,440
interested and so through them I've been

1073
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:51,598
contacted quite a bit by other gardeners

1074
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,039
and in fact was invited to speak at um

1075
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,480
last Summer's Botanic Gardens

1076
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,079
conservation International about this

1077
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,559
project and was ask be a part of climate

1078
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,119
about how Gardens can um educate about

1079
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:05,760
climate change and then um I will be

1080
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:09,440
presenting at The Summer's um apga

1081
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,520
seminar the the there's and then we were

1082
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,639
invited to participate in two Grant

1083
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:14,920
programs about climate change education

1084
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:17,440
and that this would be a model that we

1085
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,400
would be sharing um and talking with

1086
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,559
other Gardens about so keep our fingers

1087
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:25,358
crossed on those and there also will be

1088
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,319
an article that Sonia has authored about

1089
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:30,318
the climate change Garden in the next

1090
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:32,519
issue of Public Garden Magazine along

1091
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:32,519
with

1092
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:41,000
Josh yes um I was just curious what the

1093
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,838
state was with uh the the widget that's

1094
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,639
monitoring and doing all that I was in

1095
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:47,318
Pete's class last semester which we it

1096
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:49,159
was sort of a loose Collective of

1097
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:51,400
students working on that project and I

1098
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:54,078
know Pete has uh left and taken a new

1099
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,800
job so I was just curious but right

1100
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,800
right well thank you because um the

1101
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,039
reports that we were getting even though

1102
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,039
I don't understand that's why I called

1103
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:01,679
it a widget cuz I heard about it I like

1104
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:03,599
really sure how it works but it sounds

1105
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,399
very exciting um and Pete and Josh

1106
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,359
really understand it um so Pete although

1107
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,800
he's left to go to another position he's

1108
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:13,239
still in town and we're actually meeting

1109
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,880
on site um later this month for us to

1110
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:17,919
figure out how to install it so along

1111
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,838
it's it's electrical powered but we'll

1112
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,720
have a solar panel that will power it so

1113
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:24,759
we can walk the walk with what we're

1114
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:26,598
trying to do as well um and so hopefully

1115
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,440
it'll be installed by the end of April

1116
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:31,680
and then we'll be using it for the

1117
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:35,000
season yeah come down and see it you can

1118
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:37,519
help us interpret it your name

1119
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,159
afterward well I want to thank Sonia for

1120
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:43,239
a fascinating seminar and I think we all

1121
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,920
need to make the track down the hill to

1122
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:48,519
see the climate change Garden this

1123
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,519
growing season

1124
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:55,000
will this has been a production of

1125
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:58,000
Cornell University on the web at

1126
