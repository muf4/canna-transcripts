1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,480
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,599
University welcome to the show uh we

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,960
have a really interesting conversation

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,960
today about something that's literally

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,480
taken you know no commercial people want

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,039
to admit it but commercial people make

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,079
up less than 15% of all the money spent

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,279
uh in the turf grass industry you're

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,678
talking about homeowners uh and maybe

10
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,160
they're spending it on Commercial

11
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:32,399
Services for a little bit more but the

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,159
Home Lawn Market drives the majority of

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,039
how we value the turf grass industry so

14
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,159
we're going to talk a little bit uh

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,439
about Home Lawn stuff today but we have

16
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:44,679
some guests like I usually like to talk

17
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:47,079
about Mike fed danza's dog uh a pre a

18
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:49,198
previous guest on the show is doing well

19
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,759
sitting on the chair and here's Ralphie

20
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:54,679
and Leo from the Chicago district office

21
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,679
associations Derek settle uh who goes

22
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,000
out on Field tours with these two

23
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:04,040
Knuckleheads and then another passing

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,239
Ryan Gordon at T at the the the the uh

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,479
corset Snow kwami Ridge up in Seattle he

26
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:12,399
posted about a dog his doggy lost this

27
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,560
is again uh just connecting I just love

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,759
this dog thing uh that we've got going

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,118
and also po pet population has gone up

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,000
about 20 to 25% which is a big part of

31
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,118
the long conversation so let me do the

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,319
weather Carl quick and then I'm going to

33
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,640
set you guys up and get out of the way

34
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:32,319
uh things are warming up quick uh we

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,200
have really seen a rapid push uh in

36
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:38,118
warm-up so if you're making sprays for

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,600
uh root pathogens like fairy ring or

38
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:42,478
drenches for summer patch uh you're

39
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,039
going to be making those applications

40
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,519
relatively quickly in the New York

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,320
metropolitan area uh and all the way up

42
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:52,078
to Hudson Valley and even stretching

43
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:54,798
into here into Central New York um it

44
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,438
was a dry week last week and in fact I

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,200
think we had the first period of time uh

46
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,718
our our climatologist told us that we

47
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,240
were drying more than we had rainfall

48
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,759
for maybe the first time this season and

49
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:11,439
you can see the rainfall percentages are

50
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,479
uh generally 100% or more of normal with

51
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:17,359
a few dry patches smattered throughout

52
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,439
the region Cape Cod uh you know right

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,239
around New York City uh where you're

54
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,878
just a little bit short of normal just

55
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,080
for the month of April which has just

56
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,840
gotten

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,239
started what generally this means is

58
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,680
growth is unabated you know what they

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,080
sometimes say is listen if your grass

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,640
doesn't look good this time of year

61
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,840
maybe you should find another line of

62
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,878
work uh because it's pretty good easy to

63
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,360
grow grass in fact it grows you know you

64
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:44,719
can't stop it I think Carl you mentioned

65
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,159
you know you could mow multiple times in

66
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:51,280
a week I mow a mow an area for my wife

67
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:54,079
out at the house I mowed it on Sunday

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,919
and it needed to be mowed uh yesterday

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,519
uh on Wednesday so we know growth is

70
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:02,158
crazy uh but at the same time our little

71
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,158
poll Ator risk tool Carl is really

72
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,479
starting to show up what we're seeing uh

73
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:09,719
across uh the state with regard to

74
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:12,000
dandelion flowering right this is Sarah

75
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,239
this is a tool that Carl's developed

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,759
that's looking at dandelion and clover

77
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,439
blooming in the lawn to try to help

78
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:21,479
those people who might be making

79
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:23,439
applications to their lawns uh to maybe

80
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,959
recognize that there's risk and

81
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,759
potential pollinators vising it so we

82
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,319
are with Dr Sarah stria Sarah will uh is

83
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:33,000
the Outreach coordinator

84
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,560
from the G turf grass Institute one of

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,680
the great turf grass programs in the

86
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,640
world for many years um and that's

87
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,120
widely respected throughout the world

88
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,639
and of course is the source of

89
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,519
information in Canada and Sarah has been

90
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,318
very outspoken I love this there you

91
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,840
know we talked about this on my other

92
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,839
podcast I think you you guys have done

93
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,680
just a great job in getting out out into

94
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,799
the media and being uh thoughtful about

95
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,319
this I think your most recent uh

96
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,438
communication efforts uh on on Twitter

97
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:07,878
uh with lawn science and just trying to

98
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:11,400
teach people about how Lawns work what's

99
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:13,518
going on there citing the science uh

100
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,478
about these things I just you know this

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,160
is exactly you know we don't want to be

102
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,959
defensive even though we're like yeah I

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,000
don't think this is a good idea but at

104
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,879
the same time you know you want to sort

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,918
of embrace the idea that we're thinking

106
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,319
about lawns differently Carl and as I

107
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,519
get you in here you sent around this in

108
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,959
naturalist conversation

109
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:36,560
about uh this whole no thing happening

110
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,758
among Eco people and I can tell you

111
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,399
they're much more polite than the

112
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,720
general public in social media so big

113
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:46,359
shout out to in naturalist Forum

114
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,960
contributors it's the first time I've

115
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,360
ever heard

116
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:56,239
bashing so so look at this oh yeah this

117
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:59,038
you can't fix Lawns it no m is a

118
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,400
Band-Aid when Lawns need a tourniquet

119
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:04,159
this is just be watching I just love

120
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:06,399
this Carl so there you go brother yeah

121
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,000
so I think uh before we get Sarah in

122
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,560
here just sort of setting up the Noom

123
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,079
conversation right Frank so it's May 2nd

124
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,759
and I'll show some data here in a bit on

125
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,198
Google searches and how people start

126
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,960
searching for no now instead of in April

127
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,680
which is a little bit weird uh but

128
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,279
basically the idea is relatively new I I

129
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,560
didn't realize it was so new uh I guess

130
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:26,959
2019 over over in Britain uh UK

131
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,240
organization plant life started

132
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,519
promoting it uh as a way to promote uh

133
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,199
pollin in the lawn so basically the idea

134
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,839
is you treat your lawn like a lawn every

135
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,079
single month of the year except for

136
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,399
Maine which you just let it grow and the

137
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,399
idea is that there will be flowering

138
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,399
plants that will grow up uh as you don't

139
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:46,198
mow and that can be a pollinator sort of

140
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:47,439
foraging resource uh for them early in

141
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,680
the season especially when there's not a

142
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,879
whole lot around um if you look through

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,319
some literature this is the thing that

144
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,079
sort of pops up when you search it uh a

145
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,840
paper at of Appleton Wisconsin and they

146
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,639
said that hey we found no M Lawns

147
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,399
relative to traditional Lawns have high

148
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,680
higher pollinator richness and abundance

149
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,159
so the idea was uh they sort of survey

150
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
pollinators and oh wow we got more in

151
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,479
the no may maon this sort of supports

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,520
the idea that it it's good for

153
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,800
pollinators and then you started to see

154
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,478
certain municipalities uh Appleton

155
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,759
Wisconsin some places in Minnesota

156
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,918
around here Frank we're starting to hear

157
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,080
chatter especially when it comes to code

158
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:23,120
of of cities and towns where normally

159
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,000
you're supposed to keep vegetation lawn

160
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,598
type vegetation under 8 in and they're

161
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,120
saying ah we'll make an exemption for no

162
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:31,120
M because it's good for pollinators uh

163
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,639
the problem with that is that uh that

164
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,879
paper was retracted a couple years ago

165
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,840
uh and an entomologist entomologist

166
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:40,800
detailed sort of a lot of reasons why

167
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:43,119
the paper had some inconsistencies first

168
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,240
of all how they were identifying bees uh

169
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,319
by sight and not with a microscope which

170
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,720
you would need to identify the certain

171
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,199
uh species of bees and also that they

172
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,440
were reporting bees that just didn't

173
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,919
exist in Wisconsin during May and then

174
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,918
there's some other landscape context

175
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,038
things uh reasons why that the paper

176
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,038
probably wasn't so good uh and it turns

177
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:00,639
out when you look at some different

178
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,598
papers that haven't been

179
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,680
retracted you actually see these these

180
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:06,878
sort of bee abundances how many bees are

181
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,720
going on the lawn uh when you can cut

182
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,120
the lawn every two weeks even in may you

183
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,800
have more bees than a 3-week mowing

184
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,639
interval um and some there's some

185
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,639
evidence there that hey you know you

186
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,240
sort of got to cut the grass uh so that

187
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,439
it doesn't sort of shade out the the

188
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,960
dandelion uh flowers or the Clover

189
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,959
flowers so the bees can actually see

190
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,279
them and actually s ask he's got a

191
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,719
graduate student Frank who's looking at

192
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,679
UV light sort of how pollinators see and

193
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,560
if you have a Malon which has really

194
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,319
long grass that basically obscures the

195
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,680
the ability for the bees to see those

196
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,080
those foraging resources so hey maybe

197
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,360
that's actually preventing them from

198
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:43,318
getting uh to the flowers right and this

199
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,960
is just some some evidence from some

200
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,840
some pictures from my community where I

201
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,719
see a couple Nomo maons and it really

202
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,478
just doesn't go well at the end of it

203
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,759
right so the end you got to cut that

204
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,000
grass down right that's the idea of in

205
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,199
June and July you're going to treat it

206
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,519
like a a lawn and that seems to have

207
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,400
some bad consequences that I've seen

208
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,198
handling that vegetative material right

209
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,878
where do you put all th those clippings

210
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,319
which have nitrogen and phosphorus in

211
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,120
them how do you dispose of those off the

212
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,759
lawn um some damage to to long-term Turf

213
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,720
quality we'll ask Sarah actually you've

214
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,520
got some research there from a no M plot

215
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,120
last year you can maybe share with us uh

216
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,038
and then this idea of the other animals

217
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,439
that sort of inhabit that long

218
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,759
vegetation throughout May if you've got

219
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,319
some some small mammals some snakes and

220
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,720
then you sort of cut all that down they

221
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,199
were setting up shop all spring and then

222
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,120
you just shock in one shock uh event

223
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,320
disrupted that entire habitat so maybe

224
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,679
that's not such a good thing we're

225
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,519
focused on pollinators that might not be

226
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,120
good so this is a perfect time to talk

227
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,038
about no uh when I look at Google Trends

228
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,879
The Last Five Years in New York uh no

229
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:49,360
you see that first spike in

230
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:51,278
20121 uh more interest in 2022 and even

231
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,600
more interest last year we'll see what

232
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:56,200
we do this year uh but interesting to me

233
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Frank that that the the surges peak in

234
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,680
the second week of May which if I were

235
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,639
going to imp imp no M I'd probably want

236
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,599
to know before May 1 that I was going to

237
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:07,679
do it not sort of like yeah well we're

238
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,120
two weeks into May should i m my lawn oh

239
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,159
maybe I don't need to M La so this

240
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,200
starts to to bring in some questions you

241
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:16,078
know who are we dealing with who is who

242
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,640
are I guess the audience of of n m uh

243
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:20,039
and this is what what Sarah's work and

244
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,639
everybody at at G turf turf craft

245
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:24,399
Institute has some really good resources

246
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,278
now note to moay this is a website uh

247
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,200
you guys have set up a lot of cool yeah

248
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:29,958
good visuals so good sort of snippet

249
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,240
posters you can send people to to get

250
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,958
some just really basic information on

251
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,600
what's good for pollinators is the stuff

252
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,679
in lawns good for pollinators how should

253
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,839
I treat my lawn if I want that and then

254
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,838
really good communication of the

255
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,600
literature too so you have these papers

256
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,079
and you sort of bring out the notes that

257
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,600
are key for people to know a really good

258
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:49,319
way to communicate sort of the primary

259
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,759
source literature to uh average people

260
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,879
who are going to start uh maybe

261
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,679
implementing this so that starts to get

262
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,600
us to our questions right Frank and I

263
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:59,399
think the first question Sarah is uh who

264
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,839
is the audience right we always as

265
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,278
extension people start with like you

266
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,680
know who are we trying to communicate

267
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:07,159
with I guess in in um your sort of

268
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,159
experience with people who are looking

269
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:12,199
at noo is there a general profile of of

270
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,879
people who want to do this or groups who

271
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,160
who want to adopt this

272
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,039
practice yeah um you've got a lot of

273
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,879
background on this and I totally totally

274
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:25,319
support this before I get in this I did

275
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:28,120
when you pulled up the paper um about

276
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,720
the Del Toro paper with the the Beast

277
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,879
they are going to republish it they did

278
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,920
do some restudies so there there is a

279
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:35,958
paper that has been pre-published and

280
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,679
it's uh available online now and so they

281
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:40,838
basically redid it but not only was the

282
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,239
issue that they were identifying bees

283
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:46,639
incorrectly they were comparing no mo

284
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,959
Lawns to moded Parks which are totally

285
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,959
different environments mode Lawns well

286
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:54,239
even mode Lawns are going to have more

287
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:58,399
pollinators than a park because there's

288
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,200
generally flowers around alwn right so

289
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,958
anyways that's that's one little caveat

290
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,600
but um what I'm finding with no is it's

291
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,759
it's mostly homeowners and it's people

292
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,560
who want to do good things and probably

293
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:11,078
the spike in that two we part is because

294
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:13,119
that they're seeing other people who

295
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:14,679
have put the Nomo signs out and so

296
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,078
they're on their smartphones on the

297
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:18,479
walking their dog be like what does this

298
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,879
mean actually um and some people get

299
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,000
really really upset about it there's

300
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:25,320
actually a paper in the Wall Street

301
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,240
Journal that people were citing each

302
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,120
other's neighbors and calling in and and

303
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,600
people get really really upset because

304
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,200
you said that you're making your

305
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,399
neighborhood look messy or bringing out

306
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:40,800
of property value or or or whatever so

307
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:43,000
it's generally homeowners but uh because

308
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,359
there has been this big

309
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,759
um virality of it on social media and

310
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,959
such um and then last year I think also

311
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,600
we were talking to a lot of news media

312
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:56,838
Outlets that also could have contributed

313
00:11:52,600 --> 00:12:00,040
a bit to the spike um so that has

314
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:02,399
developed policies in certain

315
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:04,679
municipalities they've had to set a rule

316
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,120
on it and once the municipality sets a

317
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,239
rule then people are going to start to

318
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,159
Google it but it it's homeowners really

319
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,120
and really it's people who want to do a

320
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:17,639
good thing right they're not they're

321
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:20,519
just misinformed wait wait Sarah wait

322
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,399
Sarah we talk about people arguing in

323
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:28,078
virality that's normal business in New

324
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:30,720
York state so um um I asked a question

325
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,399
this morning of somebody ask it of you

326
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,079
can you separate out people trying to do

327
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,078
good from people who just hate

328
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:45,919
Lawns yeah no I I people who hate Lawns

329
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:49,319
hate them because they want to see more

330
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:51,319
biodiversity I think anyone you stop on

331
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,600
the street and ask them is biodiversity

332
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,959
a good thing they'll agree with you

333
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,480
right because that's that's what we've

334
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:00,319
all been taught right but the people who

335
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,360
hate Lawns they're

336
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,519
um not really understanding the

337
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,039
functional space that it is and that's

338
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,919
part of the website that I have that's

339
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:15,399
lawn science that also talks about what

340
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:17,159
are the functions of Lawns and the it's

341
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,919
it would be lovely in a world that we

342
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,559
could just say yeah everybody's lawn can

343
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:26,360
convert to a wildf flower

344
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:27,958
Meadow but then don't call me when your

345
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,120
cat goes missing because now you have

346
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,119
coyotes yeah

347
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:37,120
right like there are there are Pest

348
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,120
Control elements like yes there are

349
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,519
studies that uh fleas are not fleas and

350
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,440
ticks are not really that much more in

351
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:48,000
Long Grass unless you live next to

352
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,560
forests okay so if you live next to

353
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,240
forests you're going to have more fleas

354
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:56,319
and ticks and also if we're building

355
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,680
multiple neighborhood corridors of

356
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,399
everyone doing long grass then that's

357
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:03,519
going to create more larger animals like

358
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,440
deer and deer carry ticks and then

359
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,320
you're going to have ticks right so like

360
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,040
the studies that exist that say oh no

361
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,278
long grass doesn't actually carry ticks

362
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,399
they're small studies right they're

363
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:17,000
small plot studies and they cannot be

364
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:18,519
applied to how like it's common sense to

365
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,639
say you're going to find more ticks and

366
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:25,039
Long Grass the G turf grass Institute

367
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:27,000
actually just we moved um only about 500

368
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:30,159
met half a kilometer and our old

369
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,360
location we stopped mowing it for uh 4

370
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,759
months and if you walked in there with

371
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,519
white pants you'd come out with black

372
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,360
pants cuz how much tick you ticks you

373
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,959
had and there's no Forest there right

374
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,360
so anyways um there's also a home uh a

375
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:45,799
town in Ontario that they had a really

376
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,320
great initiative and it's a good

377
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:49,879
feel-good movement where they said that

378
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,759
they were going to completely naturalize

379
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:53,159
I think it was like 20% of the land mass

380
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,199
of their public parks they just said

381
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:58,600
they're going to naturalize them 12

382
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,599
months no cut well now this year they

383
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,639
had to add $3,000 back into their budget

384
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:08,199
to mow those all down because they have

385
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:11,039
rats yeah right um so it's it's tough

386
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:13,599
well we can agree a good idea yeah we we

387
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,599
can agree rats and snakes and coyotes

388
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,519
don't belong in lawn's Carl but what

389
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,560
about

390
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:20,120
pollinators right and and and so that's

391
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,799
the next question I think Sarah you're

392
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,000
bringing up a lot of good uh sort of

393
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:27,399
risks of no M and it's it's often build

394
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,318
as this is great for pollinators and

395
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,159
that's one potential function or

396
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:33,759
ecosystem service of Lawns uh but

397
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,879
there's other things that Lawns are good

398
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,839
for and it's not just Recreation it's

399
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:40,919
not just Aesthetics but things like uh

400
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,720
storm water controls soil erosion right

401
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:44,278
uh air temperature reduction and if

402
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,839
you're going to do maybe there's some

403
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,399
health and safety risks and just talking

404
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,920
to some extension folks this morning uh

405
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,600
uh downstate in New York they were

406
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,479
saying that can be something that moves

407
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,480
people off of n when you talk about

408
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,360
ticks when you talk about snakes or uh

409
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,680
mice that can get near foundations then

410
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,919
it all of a sudden is O you know is it

411
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:04,758
worth me having pollinators in the lawn

412
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:07,639
for that and I guess the next question

413
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:10,159
is does this really you know should we

414
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:12,360
be promoting pollinators in The Lawns

415
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,198
are there things like dandelion or

416
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,159
Clover or self-heal I guess how good are

417
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,399
those for pollinators and is it worth

418
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:21,278
sort of sacrificing some of our other

419
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,440
functions or ecosystem Services of the

420
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:27,240
lawn to get those uh

421
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,720
foraging um sort of Edibles for for

422
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,839
pollinators in the lawn

423
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,720
yeah well and you know we talk about the

424
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,440
obvious pests of the the rats and the

425
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,278
Snak and stuff what about bees bee

426
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,120
stings there are people who are

427
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:43,399
literally deathly allergic to bees so I

428
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,560
don't know if you were to go back 30

429
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,480
years and say oh how much I love bees

430
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:49,559
people would look at you like what

431
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,839
because it was the you know before the

432
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:55,399
popularization of the EpiPen um right so

433
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,959
I personally don't want bees in my

434
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,519
backyard because I like to play with my

435
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,479
dog and walk barefoot in my grass so no

436
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,919
thank you I don't want bees there but

437
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,038
pollinators are not just bees either

438
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,959
there are in bees alone there's over

439
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:12,879
there's hundreds of species of bees then

440
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,839
there's also moths and birds and uh

441
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,520
flies right so if you're going to say

442
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,480
you're going to support all of these

443
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,439
hundreds possibly thousands of

444
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:26,160
pollinator species that exist with one

445
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:29,640
flower a dandelion which is a not native

446
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,120
and B not a very good nutrition source

447
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,720
that doesn't seem right to me right it's

448
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:36,159
it's the Band-Aid when you need a

449
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,880
tourniquet you don't need Dan Alliance

450
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,519
you need uh Apple species you need the

451
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,919
uh flowering dogwoods you need the

452
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,000
Magnolia you need the willow species you

453
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,840
need all of these things like if I were

454
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,880
to have a a let's say a wedding and I'm

455
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:54,519
having aund 100 people over I'm not just

456
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,200
going to put out one bowl of

457
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:59,480
chips right I'm going to put out a

458
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,558
buffet because I know that not everybody

459
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,360
is going to like my favorite flavor of

460
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,599
dill pickle chips some people won't eat

461
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,879
it some people will be allergic right

462
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,199
now we're now we're somewhere else

463
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,240
listen listen here's something that I

464
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,960
hear often um and it was reiterated in

465
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,558
the ey naturalist thing Sarah I know you

466
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,279
guys have been playing around with this

467
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,079
and and I think maybe even measuring

468
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:23,480
pollinators correct me if I'm wrong

469
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:26,000
there but one of the things I hear is

470
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,038
when people want to help pollinators

471
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,720
they buy plants in the spring and then

472
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:31,440
they help the poll ators in the summer

473
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,360
and the fall or they buy plants in the

474
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,120
summer and they help them in the fall or

475
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,959
they buy them in the fall and maybe

476
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:41,678
maybe they'll come up in the spring but

477
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,960
T come up in the fall is the lawn from

478
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:48,360
your perspective actually potentially

479
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:52,240
useful for early spring visitors early

480
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:55,240
spring natives Specialists and would you

481
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:59,279
say that it's probably best to delay

482
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:02,400
mowing rather than to to necessar if you

483
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:05,399
mow as as the study showed relax it a

484
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,440
little bit but these spring ephemerals

485
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:12,280
I'm wondering it it can serve a real

486
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:15,200
purpose but it's sort of misaligned in

487
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:17,319
timing at least in my mind and it seems

488
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,759
like it's become something mostly

489
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:23,359
because of the alliteration you know

490
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:25,240
like you know mo No Shave November or

491
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,959
you know I think it took off on men not

492
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,640
shaving in November and men are lawn

493
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,079
people and so now it's no more may

494
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,320
because they don't shave in November and

495
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,279
they don't want to cut their grass in

496
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:38,079
May it could be a rebellion of the

497
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,839
entire male species who know Sarah but

498
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,158
can you talk a little bit about early

499
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,038
spring

500
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,720
stuff yeah absolutely so in my

501
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:49,158
neighborhood at least the crocuses have

502
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,159
already come and gone so I I strongly

503
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:53,039
believe at least in my ecosystem and I

504
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,240
cannot say a bled statement through

505
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,279
across all of North America plant

506
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,120
crocuses in your lawn to provide early

507
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,798
spring pollen because I I don't know

508
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,759
when the crocuses will pop in your

509
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,158
neighborhood versus my neighborhood but

510
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,319
for Ontario Southern Ontario

511
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:10,120
specifically you can incorporate

512
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:13,759
crocuses um or

513
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:15,319
um snow drops into a lawn and they will

514
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,919
flower and complete their entire life

515
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:20,279
cycle before you even need to mow and

516
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:23,480
that's usually in April um there you can

517
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:25,639
also incorporate uh white clover uh and

518
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,839
seed that intercede that white clover

519
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,840
actually works pretty well with lawn

520
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:33,519
grasses and can be mowed and the more

521
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,918
you mow it the smaller the plants can

522
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,798
get but they're not actually really

523
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,159
spring flowers they're actually late

524
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,279
summer flowers um so you could have

525
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,360
crocuses for the spring and clover for

526
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,359
later um and the other things that uh

527
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:48,279
you mentioned self heal and you can also

528
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:51,038
incorporate wild strawberry a lot of

529
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:53,599
these different species they can uh be

530
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:56,279
incorporated into a lawn you might have

531
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,279
to raise the height of cut and maybe cut

532
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,119
less frequently and also note that

533
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:02,480
you'll have to change your use habits of

534
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,199
that space as well because they're not

535
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,319
going to be as traffic tolerant right

536
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:10,759
you're not going to see crocuses and

537
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:13,918
self-heal and um Clover surviving very

538
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:16,519
well in let's say a commonly used soccer

539
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,360
field right we just don't see those we

540
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:22,720
see dandelions because they are able to

541
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:25,639
handle high traffic and compacted soils

542
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,919
right so yes you can incorporate and

543
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,320
then call that like your belon so I

544
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,360
would say I could do that to my front

545
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:34,480
lawn and then I'll leave my back lawn as

546
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:37,959
grass so that I can still enjoy that

547
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,519
with my dog and and my kids right yeah

548
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,558
so so what do you think Sarah of those

549
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,359
be mixes I know Minnesota a couple years

550
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:46,000
ago I I think uh had a mix there and it

551
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:48,798
has the things like white white clover

552
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,319
or self heel have you tried those out

553
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:53,038
and and that seems to me like you know

554
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:54,678
at least in myON a lot of people's lawn

555
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,960
they have high traffic areas or high

556
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,559
visibility areas and then peripheral

557
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,480
areas and if and if I can just take area

558
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:03,960
maybe plant some of those mixes maybe I

559
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,919
mow it once a month or something yeah

560
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,000
that's that's a a great idea right and

561
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,960
and so I guess have you seen the

562
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,038
efficacy of those mixes do they perform

563
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,240
well um and is that the alternative that

564
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:14,480
that people should be looking at as

565
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,038
opposed to just letting their lawn grow

566
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,319
in May and choing it back down yeah we

567
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,839
haven't seen any studies I haven't done

568
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,319
any studies on it but I've seen just

569
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,480
colloquially in my own neighborhood I've

570
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,678
seen a bunch of people have uh High

571
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,720
success with these things but in general

572
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,360
it I I would think that some of these

573
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,640
Lawns you just need to pay a little bit

574
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,519
more attention to them it's not as sort

575
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,159
of automatic like I'll cut my grass when

576
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:43,839
I want to you know whatever it's it's

577
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:49,480
you know lawn maintenance is in my

578
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:52,879
opinion the easiest least work for a

579
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,240
homeowner right whereas a beix you're

580
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,200
probably going to have to reced that

581
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,919
multiple times because Flowers and

582
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,720
flowering plants just generally don't

583
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,520
really like to be cut even if they're

584
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,839
mowing tolerant like you're going to

585
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,359
have to come back uh every 3 years or

586
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,278
something and and add some more seed

587
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,798
back into that uh you're going to have

588
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:13,278
to be cognizant of like you said hight

589
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:15,639
trffic areas the the it's not going to

590
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,240
be completely flower Meadow in the

591
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,120
backyard if you have a pathway that

592
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,720
you're going back and forth to your shed

593
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:25,599
that's not going to have flowers in it

594
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,798
right so just understanding um and

595
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,079
modifying your expectations of your

596
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:30,319
belong

597
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,879
it's not going to perform the same way

598
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,759
as a grass lawn and you're probably

599
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:38,240
going to have to be a little bit

600
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:40,558
more aware of the growth rates because

601
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,679
if you do let the the like even

602
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,278
microclover we have a plot back here and

603
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,120
we didn't mow it the microc Clover

604
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:49,960
turned into macroc Clover if you don't

605
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:52,319
mow it and then if you mow that down uh

606
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,840
it still applies to the oneir rule right

607
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,278
it's going to be really shocking to that

608
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:59,558
plant and even more so than a grass so

609
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:00,720
you you have to can just put it on a

610
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,000
calendar and say oh I'm just going to

611
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,278
mow every three weeks or something well

612
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,919
if you have like you saw showed in the

613
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,960
the beginning of this that extreme flush

614
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:10,759
of growth you're going to have to be

615
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,278
mowing it every week for that month

616
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:16,158
right just in general the whole no M May

617
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,960
and the hashtag and the cuteness we as

618
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,600
Turf managers and you talk to any farmer

619
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,600
also you can't do anything on a calendar

620
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,398
because this the weather changes year to

621
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:28,639
year climate is changing and also

622
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,639
ecosystems are totally different I could

623
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,720
do no mo may in Northern Ontario where

624
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,399
the polar bears live

625
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,200
yeah right I could do no mo all summer

626
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:39,158
or maybe in Britain maybe that's why it

627
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,038
worked in the UK right you know maybe

628
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:43,919
they have a cooler May and for us maybe

629
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:46,558
shifting like you said the Shifting the

630
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,399
timing Frank hey no mo April like I my

631
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,720
first Mo this year in in itha New York

632
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:52,839
was April 28th right so I could probably

633
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,240
I can get away and just by the nature of

634
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:56,678
how the Grass Grows with without mowing

635
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,679
in April so Sarah you you mentioned a

636
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,200
couple Alternatives here we're talking

637
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,798
about the beon okay maybe that's an

638
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,798
alternative but it's not quite as

639
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:07,079
minimal no mo M no maintenance as as we

640
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,079
might think um but you mentioned earlier

641
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,879
just planting other trees and shrubs in

642
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:13,798
the landscape is that the best way are

643
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,480
those the uh I guess the most nutritious

644
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:16,798
sources for pollinators early in the

645
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,440
year is that sort of the best way to

646
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:22,079
give them resources uh maybe Beyond you

647
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,960
know looking in the lawn for those

648
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:27,599
resources yeah I well it's essentially

649
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,480
don't do a popup shop for four weeks

650
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,480
plan for the entire growing season uh if

651
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,558
you can think of uh or visit your local

652
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,919
nursery and say what flowers in May what

653
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,798
flowers in June July August and plan for

654
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:42,399
that if you only have a small space just

655
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:44,278
even a hanging basket A Flower Basket

656
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:46,479
hanging off of your porch That's

657
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:48,159
providing pollen resources that would

658
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,360
otherwise not be there you can start

659
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,399
small even in my backyard I actually

660
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:54,199
started a little naturalized area where

661
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:57,439
I built a little fence and it's about 2

662
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,720
m squared that my dog won't go into and

663
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,038
I'm not going to mow it I'm not going to

664
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,000
cut it I throw a random packet of wild

665
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,519
flower seeds at it once in a while and I

666
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,278
don't manage that at all because

667
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,599
actually removing Garden resid residues

668
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:12,440
like those Hollow stems that come out of

669
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:15,439
like sunflowers and stuff those are

670
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,880
valuable nesting materials for bees and

671
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,159
sometimes the our best intentions are

672
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,360
saying yeah let's provide pollinator

673
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,679
support we don't also provide pollinator

674
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:27,359
habitat I like to say that the number

675
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:29,399
one hit to the carpenter bee was the

676
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:32,000
invention of the gas furnace because we

677
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:34,000
no longer have wood piles right so the

678
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,278
carpenter bee likes to live in Wood

679
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,440
piles so even just having three or four

680
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:41,519
logs in your backyard that you just

681
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,960
leave alone that's an amazing habitat

682
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,599
for snakes and pollinators and you could

683
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,038
just leave that in that space make sure

684
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,158
that it's an area that is safe from your

685
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,079
kids and your pets and everything else

686
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,520
yeah and you're supporting biodiversity

687
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:55,079
right start small yeah and Carl you got

688
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,839
love this show one week we're talking

689
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:59,398
about killing grass with with salts uh

690
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,398
you know and now we're talking about

691
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:04,398
snakes and rats and carpenter bees

692
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:06,918
because the the Landscapes that we

693
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:08,839
manage are are enormously complex and

694
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,440
one of the things Sarah that they

695
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:13,158
involve and you've touched on it a few

696
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,440
times and made the comment and I just

697
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,440
want to reiterate it and get more

698
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,759
thoughts on it when when you decide to

699
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,159
have something that's going to look at

700
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:25,079
your lawn as a different function than

701
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,200
traditional which is mostly you're

702
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,038
looking at it and you run around your

703
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,720
pets and your kids and you have lawn

704
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:34,278
parties and you walk on it and you know

705
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,798
it's all those things so once you make

706
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,599
the decision to help you know and use

707
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:40,558
this ecosystem service enhanced

708
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:43,000
pollinators you lose some of the

709
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,879
cultural stuff because you can't use

710
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,079
that space for the things you used to

711
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,880
use it for and I'm not even talking

712
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:51,240
about health reasons no one wants to

713
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,320
walk through 8 inch uh grass you're not

714
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,640
having a garden party with everybody

715
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:58,319
standing around in knee high grass so

716
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,278
when we're talking about importing these

717
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,119
trying to create some native or some

718
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,359
habitat or viewing these things

719
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,518
differently in the urban environment

720
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:10,240
ultimately it's going to change the way

721
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,798
you're going to be able to use that area

722
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,440
now when you've played around with this

723
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:17,519
a little bit you've mentioned a bunch of

724
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:20,200
plants there are plenty of plants that

725
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:23,679
will be low growing that you could mow

726
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,600
at three inches or four and 4 in have a

727
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,399
lawn that you can walk on and do

728
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:30,839
everything else on but also has these

729
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,839
you know incidental flowering plants as

730
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,879
we like to call them so talk a little

731
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,759
bit more about when when people talk to

732
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,640
you about this you actually say I'm sure

733
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,879
you say to them listen you can't have a

734
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,919
garden party in this thing uh when you

735
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:49,120
stop mowing it and make it a belon yeah

736
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:51,720
I the whole backyard wedding industry

737
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:55,759
will shut down if everybody has a beon

738
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,798
right I it Lawns have functions right

739
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,558
you said backyard barbecues social

740
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:00,119
events

741
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:01,759
even just me being able to hang my

742
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:03,599
laundry in the backyard I need to be

743
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,558
able to walk on the grass to be able to

744
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:08,798
pin my laundry to my line right so

745
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,879
understanding that maybe when you drive

746
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,200
past my lawn and I'm not physically out

747
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,679
there that on that moment it looks like

748
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,679
my lawn is a useless space but actually

749
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,559
it is doing a lot of functions even when

750
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,640
no one's physically walking on it right

751
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:24,639
it's holding that soil down it's uh

752
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,080
allowing water to percolate back down in

753
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,840
to refill our ground uh aquafers which

754
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:31,000
our our drinking system they act as a

755
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:32,480
natural filtration system and you know

756
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,720
what people don't think about this often

757
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,519
but it's also temporary parking

758
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,200
sometimes I know most people in the

759
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:40,679
winter will park on their lawns we have

760
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,679
it all the time here when we have field

761
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,600
days we park on the grass right there's

762
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:47,278
so many functions that you don't think

763
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:49,319
of and if I had a garden this entire

764
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,640
backyard I wouldn't be able to do those

765
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,558
things when I want to use them even if

766
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,960
I'm not using them all the time grass is

767
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:59,759
sort of the holding holding space for

768
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,759
future events right and the simplest and

769
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:05,119
easiest your point about being simple

770
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:07,398
and easy uh is well taken and Carl do we

771
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,599
have a question because we're at the uh

772
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:11,759
fastest 30 minute hour here we're we're

773
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,158
right at the end um just just a couple I

774
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,278
think Concepts uh Rich was talking about

775
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,000
uh bees and and pesticide use and how

776
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:20,558
that interacts with flowers and and I

777
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,798
think Frank what we're sort of starting

778
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,200
starting to think about and and maybe

779
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:25,720
promote is the idea that if you're going

780
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,000
to have pollinators in your lawn if

781
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,640
you're going to have some incidental

782
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,038
flowering plants that Clover the cell

783
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,159
fuels you probably shouldn't apply

784
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,679
insecticide applications we we would say

785
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:37,278
in one of the bmps is to mow flowers off

786
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,200
uh before you make those applications

787
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:40,720
and we're finding with Clover you can

788
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,240
run that mower over at two and a half

789
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,319
inches Hayden box data up in Geneva

790
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,679
there's still 50% of clover flowers that

791
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:50,278
didn't get cut right so oh and dandelion

792
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,038
flowers duck too y I've seen them go

793
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:54,519
they they duck back up yeah like they're

794
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,278
an inch and a half off the ground right

795
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:59,638
so so sort of uh you know aligning your

796
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:01,398
your pesticide use your IPM strategies

797
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:03,319
with the functions of the lawn I think

798
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:05,959
is one of the the big keys we're taking

799
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:08,918
away from today so Sarah thanks for

800
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,639
joining us Carl great job on this and

801
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:13,519
everybody appreciate you joining us for

802
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:16,879
the fastest 30 minutes in Turf um we'll

803
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,759
see you here oh one programming note we

804
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,720
will not be here next Thursday at 10: am

805
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:25,599
eastern time because my last kid is

806
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,000
graduating college so I will beat

807
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:31,359
standing there in tears as I'm enjoying

808
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,798
of happiness with the last tuition bill

809
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:36,278
I paid so for all of you Sarah thanks

810
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:38,158
