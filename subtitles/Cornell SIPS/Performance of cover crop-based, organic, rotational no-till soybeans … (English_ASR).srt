1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,400
University so today as Tony mentioned

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,799
I'm going to talk a little bit about U

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,278
my work on organic noil soybean

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,640
systems um so I don't have enough time

6
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:19,359
to share all the work that I've been

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,960
involved in over the last two years but

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,039
I wanted to at least introduce you to

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,839
some of the projects um that I have been

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,800
working on at Cornell um and really I've

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,719
been involved in five main projects that

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,839
we can organize under three main topics

13
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:33,839
or themes so the first one is winter

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,200
cereal thermal models um so we're

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,600
working with uh cereal Rye barley and TR

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,160
12 cultivars across those species so

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,600
this work is in New York as well as in

18
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,919
Maryland where we're working with Steven

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,198
mky at the USDA so this is really going

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,079
to help us predict phenology and uh

21
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:51,839
cover crop biomass I'm sorry but can you

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,198
speak a little louder speak a little

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,039
louder yes I can I will try to um thank

24
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,960
you so we're also working on the

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,640
trade-offs um looking at the trade-offs

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,280
between Forge quality and yield um for

27
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,118
winter cereals that are grown as forage

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,478
double crops so double cropping systems

29
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,478
that Dairy Producers might be employing

30
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,879
on their farm and so this work is with

31
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,400
Karine ketterings and a really big group

32
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,839
of extension Educators and Farmers um we

33
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,920
have a lot of sites throughout New York

34
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,159
as well as Maryland um so it's been a

35
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,159
lot of fun to work with such a big

36
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,759
team and then finally um my last three

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,478
projects really fall under the umbrella

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,920
of these cover crop based organic

39
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,759
rotational notil soybean systems and so

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,840
so that uses a roller crimper which you

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,879
can kind of see uh this Implement on the

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,040
front of the tractor here it's used to

43
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,599
terminate the cover crops so roll them

44
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,560
down flat and I'm going to talk about

45
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,559
this at length um and so these projects

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,719
range from system economics uh all the

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,320
way to a focus more on weed ecology and

48
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:49,718
so today I'm going to talk about one of

49
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,478
these projects where we're looking at

50
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:54,599
mixtures of barley and cereal Rye um to

51
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:58,478
enhance wheed suppression in these

52
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,199
systems um and these aren't just uh you

53
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,438
know dispert projects there is is a

54
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,799
Common Thread here and that's that they

55
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,679
all involve winter cereals um so either

56
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,560
as a cover crop for wheat suppression or

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,800
as Forge for Dairy

58
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,959
Producers um so other than a really long

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,080
name um what is cover crop based organic

60
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,319
rotational noal soybean some of you

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,040
might not be familiar with this system

62
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,679
um this photograph is from the Musgrave

63
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,519
research Farm in Aurora New York and so

64
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,120
what I've highlighted here this is how

65
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,519
you would typically prepare the soil so

66
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,200
you have your primary tillage your

67
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,800
secondary tillage and then you can come

68
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,119
in and plant um for instance your

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,519
soybean cro so in contrast to that with

70
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,878
these cover crop based systems you need

71
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,599
to start with a cover crop in the fall

72
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:42,079
so what you're looking at here is serial

73
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,598
Ryan barley this would been planted in

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,040
mid-september um and then when it

75
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:51,079
reaches anthesis so mid um to early June

76
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:52,400
um so I should say miday to early June

77
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,120
um they're ready to be terminated with

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,680
the roller

79
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,280
crimper and that's what it looks like

80
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,599
after that roller crimper has passed

81
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,598
over those cover crops form a nice thick

82
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,079
cover crop mulch that provides your weed

83
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,759
suppression and then you can no till

84
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,719
plant through that cover crop mulch for

85
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,199
these no till based

86
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,959
systems so we've established you have

87
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,119
your tillage based management and then

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,799
your cover crop based no till and so why

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,039
would farmers be interested in this

90
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,400
different type of soybean production um

91
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,598
if you think back to 2013 um we had a

92
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,879
really wet June and August in the

93
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,919
Northeast and if we look at a photo from

94
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:30,438
Aurora you can see a lot of surface

95
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,399
erosion washing out of soy beans here in

96
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:34,120
these tillage based systems and then a

97
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,959
plots adjacent to it you can see that

98
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,920
the soybeans are growing up undisturbed

99
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,878
through this thick cover crop

100
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,318
mulch later on Surface sealing of those

101
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,199
clay soils you see standing water and

102
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,359
then again um this cover crop base

103
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,560
system is just fine and so this is one

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,680
of the main reasons farmers are

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,079
interested in this system and that's

106
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,680
from a soul Health perspective um so in

107
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,920
addition to reducing erosion um a lot of

108
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,920
research has looked at uh increasing

109
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,639
biodiversity so both below ground and

110
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,919
above ground

111
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,559
um obviously associated with reduced

112
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,518
tillage or disturbance in these

113
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,039
rotational no till systems um when we

114
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,039
think of system advantages it's really

115
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,479
for conventional and organic Growers so

116
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,000
for a conventional grower that might be

117
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,839
struggling with herbicide resistant

118
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,959
weeds we can think of this as an

119
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,478
integrated weed management approach um

120
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,000
so in a really simplified way you can

121
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,758
think of these cover crops as replacing

122
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,439
your synthetic herb besides and for

123
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,759
organic Growers that would be replacing

124
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:30,560
your cultivation um but of course these

125
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:34,240
cover crops provide many other

126
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,839
benefits um I forgot to mention here um

127
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,000
when you're comparing it to tillage

128
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,000
based organic production we see about a

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,319
30% reduction in diesel fuel and labor

130
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,959
and what's interesting when you talk to

131
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,560
Farmers at grower meetings they're

132
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:47,239
really drawn to this from a soil Health

133
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,560
perspective we can talk about Energy

134
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,360
savings but it's really um about

135
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,839
reducing tillage in their crop rotation

136
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,840
um and that's what's really driving them

137
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:59,399
towards adopting this type of management

138
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:01,000
system so this all sounds pretty good

139
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,959
you know is this the new perspective of

140
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,720
farmers be sitting on their tractor you

141
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,918
got the roller crimper out front looking

142
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,280
at a field a winter cereal is ready to

143
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:11,839
roll that down I mean we hope so that's

144
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,918
what we're working on um we're working

145
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,198
right now on a farmer manual to help

146
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,639
address some of these issues that

147
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,680
farmers are coming up against um so

148
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,720
issues related to weed suppression in

149
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,319
particular um and one of the most common

150
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,720
questions that we get at grower meetings

151
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,840
is how does this fit into my rotation

152
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,520
farmers are typically planting if you

153
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:34,159
think of a corn soybean wheat rotation

154
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,599
soybean would be following corn grain

155
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,280
and so for this system to work they

156
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,479
would be establishing a winter cereal

157
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,239
like seral Rye after they've harvested

158
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:42,959
corn grain and that's going to be really

159
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,918
late in the fall and is not going to

160
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,879
provide enough biomass or a uniform

161
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:49,758
stand for weed suppression so right off

162
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,120
the bat that's going to be a real TR a

163
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,560
real problem for Farmers if they're

164
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,120
stuck in this corn soybean wheat

165
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,879
rotation um so from my perspective I'm

166
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,399
interested in kind of a food grain based

167
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,839
system it might have more small grains

168
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,560
so so something like wheat would be a

169
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,239
really good crop to precede this um so

170
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,598
wheat's going to be harvested in August

171
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,240
and it gives you lots of time to

172
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:11,598
establish something like Cal Rye in

173
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,680
early September if you're working on a

174
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:16,079
feed grade based system um a short

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,160
season corn silage would work um and

176
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,680
that's going to push you maybe into

177
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,240
mid-september for establishing that

178
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,598
cover crop and what I want to draw your

179
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,360
attention to um if you look at these

180
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:27,399
later planting dates so these are six

181
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,919
different serial rise seeding dates

182
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,159
these photographs were taken on April

183
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:32,879
1st and if you notice at these later

184
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,960
planting dates along the bottom you see

185
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,839
a lot more soil between those rows of

186
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,279
cover crops and where you see exposed

187
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,560
soil that's where weed seeds are going

188
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,918
to germinate um and that's a real

189
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,639
problem because in this system it's

190
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,000
those early emerging weeds that really

191
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,879
dominate so you've got wild buckweed

192
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,319
common rag weed they're going to emerge

193
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,598
before you actually roll that cover crop

194
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,759
um in late May so as you can see here

195
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:58,038
they've come up in that stand in this

196
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,280
case it's seral Rye um in the background

197
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:02,038
here so if you look at some of these

198
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,559
data from Pennsylvania you can see

199
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:07,120
common Ragweed here um in these violin

200
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,839
plots emerge a lot earlier than other

201
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,680
common Sumer annual weeds so that bulge

202
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,959
in this plot here indicates that the

203
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,319
majority of that species is emerging in

204
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,638
this case in early April in New York we

205
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,080
would expect this to be a few weeks

206
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,960
later but that's still going to be the

207
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,399
majority of them emerging before we roll

208
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,918
down these cover crops and so that's a

209
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,799
real problem because common Ragweed

210
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:28,878
emerges early and it also can survive

211
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,879
rolling and crimping and this has really

212
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,560
informed a lot of of our research um

213
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,120
this is not just a phenomenon on the you

214
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,759
know musk grave research farm this is

215
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,199
throughout the Northeast this common rag

216
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,720
we just dominates in these cover crop

217
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,680
based notil soybean

218
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,759
systems so in terms of previous research

219
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,639
the focus is really been on maximizing

220
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,158
serial Ry biomass so manipulating

221
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,560
seating date and seating rate and a

222
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:54,918
couple other factors like that emerging

223
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,959
from that has being this threshold of

224
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:58,719
8,000 kgrs per hectare and it's been

225
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,120
suggested that if you can achieve that

226
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,759
you're going to get consistent or

227
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,840
adequate weed suppression throughout the

228
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,759
season but there's some problems with

229
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,679
that um with this excessive cover crop

230
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,199
production and that's lodging which you

231
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,879
see here in really fertile soils and

232
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,960
it's also really difficult to get good

233
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,680
seed to soil contact it's really hard to

234
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,079
get good soiling seed placement through

235
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,519
a thick

236
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,279
mulge so in this photo here you can see

237
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,799
that they've added sandbags on top of

238
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,559
these planter units um to try to get

239
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,520
more down pressure so you can actually

240
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,319
penetrate that thick cover crop Mulch

241
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:32,958
and get good SE to soil contact UM and

242
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,080
this is particularly challenging if it's

243
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,518
dry in the

244
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,879
spring and later on obviously if you

245
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,320
don't get that good soybean seed

246
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,120
placement germination is going to be

247
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,719
poor and some of these soybeans that do

248
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,918
emerge as you can see are pretty

249
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,120
chlorotic and you're going to see a

250
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,399
yield

251
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,720
loss so for our research um and the way

252
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,159
it differs from all this previous

253
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,278
research is that we're moving away from

254
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:55,278
a focus on this maximum biomass and

255
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,958
instead we're focusing on optimizing

256
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:01,200
early season shading um for optimal or

257
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,838
for better weed suppression and so to do

258
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,480
that we're looking at mixtures of barley

259
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,720
and cereal Rye so cereal Rye is tall and

260
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,079
slender Bary is going to be shorter

261
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,480
wider leaves and I'm not suggesting that

262
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:13,039
this is really a true Niche

263
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,519
differentiation as you would expect with

264
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,559
a legume and a cereal but the slight

265
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,078
differences in phology um stature and

266
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,399
leaf architecture might be enough to

267
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:24,239
give us that edge to provide better um

268
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,039
early season

269
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,480
shading so we've got a couple objectives

270
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,879
we're interested in the impact of these

271
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,278
cover crop mixtures on weed suppression

272
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,480
as well as ultimately on soybean yield

273
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,519
and then we're looking at two main

274
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,959
management treatments so high residue

275
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,759
cultivation and then just standard noil

276
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,838
and again we're looking at those those

277
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:46,799
effects on wheat suppression and soybean

278
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,880
yield um in terms of experiment design

279
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,719
we used a split block design um so

280
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,519
replicated four times over two years

281
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,040
this was 2012 to 2014 at the musk grave

282
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,799
research Farm we seated our cover crops

283
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,799
in a replacement Series so you've got a

284
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,679
barley mon culture a 50/50 mixture and

285
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,000
then a Serial Ry monoculture and these

286
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:09,919
were seated as I mentioned mid-september

287
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,278
at 19 CM row spacing um I will note that

288
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,240
I have some photographs in here from

289
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,919
2013 but all the data I'm going to share

290
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,600
is just from 2014 I'm really just have

291
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,479
time to share a subset of all the

292
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,879
different treatments that were involved

293
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,240
in this experiment so we're just going

294
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,240
to simplify this uh in the interest of

295
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,838
time all right as I mentioned you've got

296
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,360
your two management treatments standard

297
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,079
no till which is going to involve

298
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,720
rolling crimping that cover crop when

299
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:37,919
they're at anthesis um and then no till

300
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,200
planting soybean on that same day and

301
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,599
that's it you don't have to do anything

302
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,040
else until you come in and harvest that

303
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,600
soybean in

304
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:47,159
October with high resid cultivation on

305
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,920
this about um two to four weeks after

306
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,199
you've planted that soybean you're going

307
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:53,360
to have a single pass with a high

308
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,639
residue cultivator um to control some

309
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,320
inter weeds and this is one of the

310
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,720
reasons why we use these wider soybean

311
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,839
spacing so 76 CM rows so that

312
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,879
facilitates the operation of this High

313
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,560
residue

314
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,278
cultivator and we did include adjacent

315
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,000
to those plots an interro cultivated

316
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,720
treatment and so this allows us to

317
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,759
compare these cover crop based

318
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,800
management practices to what would be

319
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:17,480
kind of your traditional tillage based

320
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:20,240
um soybean

321
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,879
management so to look at this um roller

322
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,839
crimper a little more closely it

323
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,958
basically involves a cylinder with these

324
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,360
blunt metal blades welded in a chevron

325
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:31,000
pattern and it's going to bend or crimp

326
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,519
these plants at their base um as opposed

327
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,519
to shearing or cutting them off as a

328
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,078
mower would and this is an important

329
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,799
distinction um because we want that

330
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,078
cover crop mulch to persist throughout

331
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,679
the season and when you mow these cover

332
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,120
crops down which has been looked at in

333
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,559
other research it's of course going to

334
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,679
increase the surface area which is going

335
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,638
to speed up decomposition which is going

336
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,479
to result in poor weed

337
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,600
suppression with the high residue

338
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,240
cultivator um after those cover crops

339
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,120
being rolled this Implement has really

340
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,639
wide sweeps on it that are intended to

341
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,759
slice through the soil just just below

342
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,919
the sole surface um it's going to sever

343
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,838
weed choots from weed roots and it has

344
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,399
really thin Shanks um with the intention

345
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,399
of limiting the amount of residue that's

346
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:12,480
dragged all over the field so this photo

347
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,600
um kind of shows that we had some

348
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,199
trouble actually um calibrating this

349
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,920
equipment we didn't get enough cover

350
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:19,278
crop biomass and you can see some soil

351
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,360
that's actually turned up between the

352
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,480
rows ideally you wouldn't see anything

353
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,879
you'd barely notice that this piece of

354
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:29,320
equipment has been run through the

355
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:31,320
field in terms of uh seating rates um we

356
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,480
based our replacement series on a rustic

357
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,920
Rye um and then we adjusted for

358
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,600
differences in size and mass for the

359
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,120
barley seed which is why we refer to

360
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,440
this as density based seatings as

361
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,959
opposed to volume based seatings so this

362
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
low density is equivalent to about one

363
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,479
bushel per acre and then this high

364
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,319
density is two bushels per acre you'll

365
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,159
notice with the soybean this is a really

366
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,760
high seating rate this about 300,000

367
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:55,319
seeds per acre which is about double

368
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,639
conventional soybean seating rates and

369
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,680
if you think about herbicide based

370
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,759
conventional soybean production um these

371
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,838
are weed-free systems um with the

372
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,319
exception of uh issues with herbicide

373
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,880
tolerant weeds so you're going to have

374
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,120
really high germination rates for the

375
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:13,000
soybean really good seedling survival um

376
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,519
obviously very little to no weed

377
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,480
competition and so you can use those

378
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,278
lower soybean seaing rates and still get

379
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,240
maximum yield but for us this is really

380
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,838
part of our cultural weed management so

381
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,039
we use these high rates to achieve

382
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,079
canopy closure earlier in the season

383
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,799
which is going to provide greater

384
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,439
shading which is going to reduce the

385
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:32,120
facundity of weeds so some of these

386
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,199
later emerging summer annuals um so in

387
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,278
other words less seed production from

388
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:39,000
some of those later species um so this

389
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,759
in concert with that rolled mulch really

390
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,919
forms the basis of our weed suppression

391
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,679
and this photo is a little bit dark here

392
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,120
um but what you're seeing is a shot from

393
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,599
underneath that soybean canopy here um

394
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,320
that's completely closed you just see a

395
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,800
little bit of sunlight filtering through

396
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,879
and then you see that nice rolled cover

397
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:58,359
crop mulch there along the soil

398
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:00,480
surface in terms of sampling before

399
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,959
those cover crops rolled uh we measured

400
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,278
cover crop biomass and population uh

401
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,799
photosynthetically active radiation um

402
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,039
or light transmittance through that

403
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:12,240
cover crop canopy and then after they

404
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,799
were rolled um weed identification uh we

405
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,600
looked at weed biomass and then also

406
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:18,159
soybean um density and yield we

407
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,000
certainly measured a lot of other things

408
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,120
but again this is just a subset of this

409
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,440
experiment so this is what we're going

410
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,799
to focus

411
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,639
on um so if we look at the interspecific

412
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,958
cover crop competition um we've got

413
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,519
cover crop biomass on the y- axis and

414
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,638
those replacement Series so that seating

415
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,078
ratio along the x-axis and you've got

416
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,159
your low density and high density

417
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,359
seating rates and what you'll notice

418
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:43,240
here in the low density is that oh I

419
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,639
should first mention this these Dash

420
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,759
lines are your barley monoculture and

421
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,440
these uh dotted lines are your serial Ry

422
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,079
monoculture and then the solid lines

423
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,639
here are your 50/50 mixtures and so what

424
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,399
you're seeing here is what we term

425
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,360
overyielding um at that low density so

426
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,120
in other words this is a higher absolute

427
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,680
yield in that 5050 mixture of barley and

428
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,320
cereal Rye compared to a Serial Rye

429
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,078
monoculture or The Barley monoculture

430
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,519
here and with these studies um typically

431
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:12,120
that's what you're looking for maybe if

432
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,519
it's a legum and it's a seral you want

433
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,600
over yielding especially if these are

434
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,399
being grown for grain but for our

435
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,000
purposes um we're really more interested

436
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,839
in shading so does this higher biomass

437
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,480
here actually translate into enhanced

438
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,800
shading and thus better weed control um

439
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,000
and I'll also just note we actually

440
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,919
didn't see that in the high density um

441
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,600
and there's a number of different

442
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,719
reasons here perhaps the serial Rye has

443
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,120
greater uh competitive ability

444
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,440
especially in what would be considered

445
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,639
more resource limited

446
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,000
environment um so when we look at par

447
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,240
transmittance so that light that

448
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,159
actually is making it through that

449
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,278
canopy we have the same seating ratios

450
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:49,838
along the bottom we actually don't see

451
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,958
enhanced um shading in that 50/50

452
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,600
mixture so instead um you see that part

453
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,239
transmittance increases as the

454
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,399
proportion of Serial Rye decreases so in

455
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,639
other words at that serial r monol

456
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,078
that's where you see the least amount of

457
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,560
light reaching the soil surface and in

458
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:06,120
that barley monoculture that's where the

459
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,518
greatest amount of light is actually

460
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,560
making it

461
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,919
through and when you look at weed

462
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:13,799
biomass across those C seaing ratios you

463
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,799
see a really similar Trend as you might

464
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,198
expect of course if there's more light

465
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:19,639
coming through the canopy you're going

466
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,198
to have great greater weed germination

467
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,839
higher weed biomass and of course less

468
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,639
weed biomass When there's less light

469
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,560
making it through the canopy um we saw

470
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,519
this really clearly in the field you

471
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,719
have your barley monoculture here and

472
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,278
that is a lot of common Ragweed that's

473
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,120
that's emerged so we really did not have

474
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,159
um nearly enough biomass production

475
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,240
there or of course shading to suppress

476
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:43,679
those weeds with the serial Ry

477
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,600
monoculture we had actually pretty good

478
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:49,159
um pretty adequate uh weed suppression

479
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,278
throughout most of our

480
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:53,799
treatments when we look at total weed

481
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:56,639
biomass you can see that common Ragweed

482
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,599
comprised over 80% of that biomass so it

483
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,839
was really dominant um in this system we

484
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,240
had fox tail species so yellow and giant

485
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,798
fox tail made up about 8% and then a

486
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,919
variety of other weeds made up the

487
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:11,519
remaining 10% um for this experiment so

488
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,319
if we're going to then focus on common

489
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,639
Ragweed um let's look at those

490
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:18,798
management treatments so we've got

491
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,000
common raged biomass here you've got uh

492
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,679
let's look at the difference of high

493
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,558
resue cultivation and standard noil and

494
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,319
what we saw was about a 20 to 30%

495
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,318
reduction when you integrate that high

496
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:29,639
residue

497
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:31,079
cultivation um and of course you can see

498
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,679
by the air bars this wasn't a

499
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:34,759
significant reduction but if you think

500
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,240
of this from a farmer's perspective or a

501
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:39,200
more applied perspective reducing common

502
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,000
Ragweed biomass by a few hundred

503
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,919
kilograms um is going to be really

504
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,720
important for long-term weed seed bang

505
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,919
management um so there's going to be a

506
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,240
lot um lower contribution of weed seeds

507
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,160
um that are going to be a problem later

508
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,919
on in their

509
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,919
rotation and this photo from 2013 um and

510
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,280
I just wanted to to use this to

511
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,038
illustrate how effective that high

512
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:03,200
residue cultiv cation can be so these

513
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,679
lighter rows here are soybeans that are

514
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,519
ready to be harvested and what you'll

515
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,360
notice in the standard not to all this

516
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,480
dark these dark patches here all of that

517
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,599
is common Ragweed and so when you look

518
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,279
at the high Rd of cultivation um you can

519
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,319
see no common Ragweed at all in between

520
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:20,158
those rows so under certain conditions

521
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:23,678
this can be really really effective at

522
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:23,679
taking care of that inter row common

523
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,798
Ragweed all right and here what we're

524
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,480
really interested in is um is shading

525
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,400
being a really good predictor of common

526
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,880
Ragweed biomass so you've got common

527
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,240
Ragweed biomass on the y axis again we

528
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,919
have common or cover crop biomass so

529
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,319
combined both barley and serial Ry

530
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:43,840
biomass here and then par transmittance

531
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:45,240
on this right right side chart and so

532
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,798
really you can think of this as a lot of

533
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,159
the previous research has focused on

534
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,918
this relationship just maximizing cover

535
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:53,520
crop biomass whereas we've shifted the

536
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,240
focus over here to par transmittance or

537
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,038
shading and what we found um both in the

538
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,400
low and high density treatments as well

539
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:01,679
as all the other treat ments I couldn't

540
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,960
discuss was that in fact shading was a

541
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,759
much better predictor of common Ragweed

542
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,960
so you can see here we definitely had

543
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,200
higher R squar values when we look at

544
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,679
this relationship um and what's

545
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,600
interesting to note is as we saw with

546
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:16,038
the low density and that high or that

547
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,918
overyielding in that lower density

548
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:19,798
treatment High biomass production

549
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,640
doesn't necessarily result in Greater

550
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,038
shading so it definitely um suggests us

551
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,880
that we really need to focus in on

552
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:28,720
shading um to really tackle this issue

553
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,559
of early emerging weeds like common red

554
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,400
B

555
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:34,599
weed in terms of soyan yield um we

556
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,400
actually saw no differences um between

557
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:37,759
seating ratio or management treatments

558
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,559
which was surprising given the

559
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:43,480
differences in cover crop biomass um as

560
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,480
well as weed biomass um and on average

561
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,200
we got about 40 belsh per acre which is

562
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,880
actually the lowest yields we had across

563
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,440
all of our different treatments and our

564
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,760
on Farm sites we typically get 45 to 50

565
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,240
bushels which is really competitive with

566
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,279
other organically uh produced soybeans

567
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,440
So tillage based systems um when we

568
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,960
compare this to the intro cultivation um

569
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,519
we see about 80% of that yield and so

570
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,720
that's definitely a substantial yield

571
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,038
loss there again this is a little bit

572
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,880
related to these were not very

573
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:14,200
productive um treatments for us and of

574
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,039
course you need to factor in the fact

575
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,200
that there's going to be a 30% reduction

576
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:20,200
in diesel fuel and labor um with this

577
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,000
type of

578
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,720
management so in summary we found that

579
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,679
early season shading definitely was an

580
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,600
important predictor um or common driver

581
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,200
of common Ragweed B M but these mixtures

582
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,879
of barley and serial Rye might not be

583
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,038
the best way to actually achieve that

584
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,799
enhanced shading um we're definitely

585
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:39,440
encouraged to continue pursuing this

586
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:42,158
because preempting that common Ragweed

587
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,798
biomass is just so critical um for

588
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,440
addressing these issues for farmers in

589
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:46,558
the

590
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,080
Northeast we also found that hru

591
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,038
cultivation was really useful um for

592
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:52,480
controlling that inter common Ragweed

593
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,679
and you can think of it as a rescue

594
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,400
cultivation and for long-term weed seed

595
00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:01,038
bank management this might be a really

596
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,038
useful tool um and then this is actually

597
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,679
different than what we'd expected um so

598
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,798
was not higher when you integrated that

599
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,880
high residue cultivation actually in

600
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,519
some ways this might be a a desirable

601
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,000
result for us because what it suggests

602
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:15,200
is um if we focus on cover crop

603
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,119
management and so we can really suppress

604
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,960
those weeds um with just standard no

605
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,798
till U you're not going to see a yield

606
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,159
loss if you don't integrate High residue

607
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,440
cultivation and really for Farmers

608
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:25,840
they're not that interested when we've

609
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,080
gone to grower meds and talked about

610
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,720
this in using High residue cultivator

611
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,678
because the whole purpose um or their

612
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,679
whole interest in this is a reduced

613
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,840
tillage system so this idea of

614
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,600
hybridizer cultivation is is is not very

615
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:41,158
popular um and we definitely see high

616
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,759
potential profitability for this system

617
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,080
like I said if you get these competitive

618
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,119
yields uh in combination with this

619
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,038
reduction in energy use this is going to

620
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,599
translate into higher profits for

621
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:54,000
Farmers um and so with that I just like

622
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,319
to thank uh in particular Chris peler

623
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,919
Brian Caldwell and the rest of our lab

624
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,200
um and all the folks at the musra

625
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,600
research Farm certainly couldn't have

626
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,240
done this research without everyone's

627
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,558
assistance and support so if there's

628
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,759
time I'd love to take some questions

629
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:06,759
thank

630
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,360
